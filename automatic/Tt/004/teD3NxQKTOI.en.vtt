00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello youtube friends I did mine and 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.210
 I'm here in the game as you can see 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.700
 the league of legends a year ago so 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.879
 costume to a top of favorite games 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.520
 and he 's playing much better I'm doing 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.650
 of everything 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.840
 and first of all in this game is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.890
 wanted to bring a guide that I think 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.680
 very important 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.170
 about the runes 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.980
 some do not know that the runes 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.560
 runes are 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.600
 as objects that are bought in the store 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.600
 they are like masters only that you 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.300
 provides a lot more of life what 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.420
 be and how am I beginning to still play 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.010
 we wanted to bring the main ones 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:55.239
 of ap already of those of life then more 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:00.019
 forward extract what I know of his by 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.360
 adhikari jungle already more specific voucher 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.559
 first let's start with the idea 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.559
 what I think is more important 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.870
 ok I'm exactly the same only 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.760
 in the store they buy what more expensive 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.940
 As I have already bought them, they do not 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.000
 I appear in the store 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.520
 first of all you have to put 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.980
 to buy extras always grade 3 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 forever 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.920
 I already know that you have to be at level 20 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.500
 at least but it 's worth the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.360
 true 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.700
 because I typical you start with 65 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.620
 or so I started and I had to start 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.350
 a game with 95 bird 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.340
 and good to see first all the degree 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.369
 three quintas essential essence 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.130
 this has always been 225 years 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.360
 until all three are a total of three 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.150
 thousand 75 points of influence I think 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.720
 then the marks also from a of the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.720
 nine brands 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:12.120
 I think it was 1875 I think 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.950
 it's more or less about it asérix 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.640
 a lot of money but if it's me 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.290
 sorry then stamps here there are two options 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.840
 or buy you armor 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.909
 Attack damage or half damage attack and 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.489
 half of armor as you want I have 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.519
 preferred attack damage because if 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.460
 because I want more attack damage and 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.970
 then the taps 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.970
 are these blue 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.710
 buyers armor the armor that 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.620
 be to 0 with 7 vale 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.480
 It is very good to contain 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.480
 Losada of carts will provide much 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.569
 well now we continue with those of ap la 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.609
 idea of ​​how you can see they are already 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:01.799
 Completed the whole and we are missing 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:05.230
 still a little bit worth seeing either for 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:09.159
 4.95 the skill of powers 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:13.680
 this amount insecure this always then 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:16.659
 here marks or skill power all or 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.849
 magic penetration all or halves do not 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:24.250
 created so I have put 123456 of power 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.520
 of skill and three depends on 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.830
 penetration more here is worth 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.280
 and here I know I have put the ones of the 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.420
 attack because I have no more I have to 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.840
 buy still 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:44.019
 and they or depends here depends 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.060
 It depends what I'm going to do in the store 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.959
 because how are these new I have bought 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.250
 follow me will appear worth first depends 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.430
 if you use ap to own everything 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.430
 be 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.180
 and use mana you have to buy 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.130
 are you really 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.830
 if you see here you have the foundations 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.920
 different different options we 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.380
 you have to buy the mana one every five 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.010
 seconds the truth is quite broken 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.560
 to have a lot of mana for example and 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.110
 white a character that we use that 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.170
 spend a lot of human is essential 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.990
 then buy this and if you do not use for 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:32.980
 example catarina or cali 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.080
 you have to buy the 0.59 from 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.800
 ability power 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.310
 The answer is pretty much what 403 has 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.460
 but that has to start with 95 of 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.460
 bird 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.240
 and then the very important children 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.050
 and there are also two options I 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.050
 I recommend 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.139
 magical resistance because generally 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.139
 if you go a thousand 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.679
 if you go if you go to peu be because 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.919
 you usually go to the ap almost 

00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:14.009
 there are always 1000 and magic resistance 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.109
 because the other me will also be p so 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.029
 that will hurt you unless it's better then I 

00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:20.969
 I know in some case that you want to go 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:23.009
 with some trouble because you get armor 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.529
 it's up to everyone but I 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:26.849
 I recommend these which are the standard ones 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.319
 OK 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.629
 then simply when you have it 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.339
 bought the vais stuffing the 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.249
 selection is one of the two you put 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:38.309
 Once you get the marks the drags and 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:40.710
 depends if they are trademarks stamps or what 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:44.670
 it's worth 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:48.770
 and well these are the masters of 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.710
 yahvé standard the most common 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.240
 and also tell you that from now on 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.479
 I will go up a lot and I read fleider and can 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.289
 be gameplays trole champion guides 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:59.289
 fairies to people 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.150
 classifying anything you have 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.690
 of legends because I really love 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:09.460
 I recommend you play if it's the 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.010
 first time this game visit it 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.380

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.620
 a video game that you will love you 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.620
 I assure 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:25.389
 was that the standard runes I know that 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:29.040
 they cost a lot but that's what you have and 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:33.570
 super important always in the store 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:36.430
 buy to see if it's worth comparing 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:39.010
 always the grade 3 is worth 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:42.760
 It is very important that you can start 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.980
 of level 20 it is not much climbs 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.220
 Quick 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.010
 and well this is already all I had to 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.750
 tell you how to always like
