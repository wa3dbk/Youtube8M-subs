00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:03.900 

and<00:00:01.560> and<00:00:02.560> yet<00:00:02.800> I<00:00:02.830> think<00:00:02.950> that<00:00:03.220> we<00:00:03.460> can<00:00:03.640> go<00:00:03.790> ahead

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:03.910 
and and yet I think that we can go ahead

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.900 
and and yet I think that we can go ahead
and<00:00:04.540> clean<00:00:05.230> up<00:00:05.259> a<00:00:05.410> few<00:00:05.560> highlights<00:00:05.830> and<00:00:06.400> then

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:06.910 
and clean up a few highlights and then

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.449 
and clean up a few highlights and then
I'm<00:00:07.060> going<00:00:07.210> to<00:00:07.270> use<00:00:07.450> my<00:00:07.630> 4b<00:00:08.139> and<00:00:08.349> push<00:00:09.099> some

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:09.459 
I'm going to use my 4b and push some

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:11.909 
I'm going to use my 4b and push some
things<00:00:09.789> a<00:00:09.940> little<00:00:10.059> farther<00:00:10.360> back<00:00:10.690> and<00:00:11.200> this<00:00:11.860> is

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:11.919 
things a little farther back and this is

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.159 
things a little farther back and this is
the<00:00:12.249> only<00:00:12.429> time<00:00:12.820> that<00:00:12.849> I<00:00:13.119> would<00:00:13.269> really<00:00:13.629> use<00:00:13.959> it

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:14.169 
the only time that I would really use it

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.289 
the only time that I would really use it
it's<00:00:14.469> just<00:00:14.619> rare<00:00:14.919> that<00:00:15.129> I<00:00:15.219> ever<00:00:15.400> used<00:00:15.699> the<00:00:15.849> 4b

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
it's just rare that I ever used the 4b

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.590 
it's just rare that I ever used the 4b
but<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.080> think<00:00:17.530> that<00:00:17.830> probably<00:00:18.670> in<00:00:19.030> most<00:00:19.270> of<00:00:19.510> the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:19.600 
but I think that probably in most of the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.080 
but I think that probably in most of the
time<00:00:19.840> I<00:00:19.870> find<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:20.440> place<00:00:20.680> where<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.340> can<00:00:21.640> go<00:00:21.820> in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
time I find a place where I can go in

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.380 
time I find a place where I can go in
into<00:00:23.020> the<00:00:23.350> darkest<00:00:23.890> place<00:00:24.280> and<00:00:24.700> show

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
into the darkest place and show

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.440 
into the darkest place and show
something<00:00:25.810> even<00:00:26.380> deeper<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.580> deepest<00:00:28.090> part

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
something even deeper the deepest part

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.380 
something even deeper the deepest part
of<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:28.960> value<00:00:29.410> so<00:00:30.280> that's<00:00:30.760> what<00:00:31.030> I'm<00:00:31.150> going

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
of that value so that's what I'm going

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.399 
of that value so that's what I'm going
to<00:00:31.480> do<00:00:31.750> right<00:00:32.349> now<00:00:32.379> and<00:00:33.989> because<00:00:34.989> we<00:00:35.109> only<00:00:35.140> have

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:35.409 
to do right now and because we only have

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.229 
to do right now and because we only have
one<00:00:35.440> overhead<00:00:35.829> camera<00:00:36.429> I'm<00:00:36.640> gonna<00:00:36.850> have<00:00:37.120> to

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
one overhead camera I'm gonna have to

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.919 
one overhead camera I'm gonna have to
really<00:00:37.420> pay<00:00:37.629> attention<00:00:38.079> here<00:00:39.510> let's<00:00:40.510> go<00:00:40.719> ahead

00:00:40.919 --> 00:00:40.929 
really pay attention here let's go ahead

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.130 
really pay attention here let's go ahead
and<00:00:41.289> go<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.469> little<00:00:41.949> closer<00:00:42.309> here<00:00:42.519> so<00:00:43.019> that<00:00:44.019> we

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
and go a little closer here so that we

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.979 
and go a little closer here so that we
can<00:00:44.379> pick<00:00:44.920> out<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.159> few<00:00:45.429> things<00:00:45.640> let's<00:00:46.629> look<00:00:46.870> at

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
can pick out a few things let's look at

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:54.779 
can pick out a few things let's look at
our<00:00:47.109> source<00:00:47.469> here<00:00:51.929> now<00:00:53.219> it'd<00:00:54.219> probably<00:00:54.579> be

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
our source here now it'd probably be

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.819 
our source here now it'd probably be
good<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.389> be<00:00:55.510> able<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.780> use<00:00:56.079> my<00:00:56.289> lighter<00:00:56.559> one

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
good to be able to use my lighter one

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:58.619 
good to be able to use my lighter one
now<00:00:57.010> I'm<00:00:57.249> thinking<00:00:57.579> about<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.879> so<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.269> I<00:00:58.389> can

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
now I'm thinking about it so that I can

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.860 
now I'm thinking about it so that I can
tell<00:00:58.899> where<00:00:59.710> is<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.339> deepest<00:01:00.760> part<00:01:01.089> of<00:01:01.210> some

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
tell where is the deepest part of some

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.750 
tell where is the deepest part of some
of<00:01:01.899> these<00:01:02.019> dark<00:01:02.289> lines<00:01:02.379> it's<00:01:03.159> real<00:01:03.399> easy<00:01:03.609> to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
of these dark lines it's real easy to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.690 
of these dark lines it's real easy to
come<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.600> do<00:01:05.170> oh<00:01:05.470> I'm<00:01:06.100> sorry<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.460> had<00:01:06.610> the

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
come in and do oh I'm sorry I had the

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.630 
come in and do oh I'm sorry I had the
wrong<00:01:06.880> one<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.650> real<00:01:08.890> easy<00:01:08.920> to<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:14.640> think

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
wrong one it's real easy to just think

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.910 
wrong one it's real easy to just think
about<00:01:15.760> this<00:01:16.150> all<00:01:16.360> as<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.810> almost<00:01:17.350> an<00:01:17.530> eyeliner

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
about this all as a almost an eyeliner

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.010 
about this all as a almost an eyeliner
and<00:01:18.160> make<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.460> all<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.610> same<00:01:18.940> but<00:01:19.720> as<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:19.900> can

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
and make it all the same but as you can

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.810 
and make it all the same but as you can
see<00:01:20.080> what<00:01:20.380> I've<00:01:20.500> already<00:01:20.710> tried<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.340> do<00:01:21.490> is

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
see what I've already tried to do is

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.660 
see what I've already tried to do is
show<00:01:22.120> a<00:01:22.390> little<00:01:22.810> bit<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.170> difference<00:01:23.620> in<00:01:23.860> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
show a little bit of a difference in the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.790 
show a little bit of a difference in the
darkest<00:01:25.300> place<00:01:25.540> versus<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.230> lightest<00:01:26.560> place

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
darkest place versus the lightest place

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.730 
darkest place versus the lightest place
and<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.360> that's<00:01:28.600> what<00:01:28.840> I'm<00:01:28.960> going<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.380> do<00:01:29.590> I'm

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
and so that's what I'm going to do I'm

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.050 
and so that's what I'm going to do I'm
just<00:01:29.770> going<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.160> touch<00:01:30.400> in<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:31.030> couple<00:01:31.900> places

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
just going to touch in a couple places

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.840 
just going to touch in a couple places
still<00:01:34.060> trying<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.540> use<00:01:35.280> maintain<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.520> clean

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
still trying to use maintain the clean

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:45.560 
still trying to use maintain the clean
edges<00:01:37.120> and<00:01:37.950> also<00:01:38.950> keep<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.180> in<00:01:40.870> a<00:01:41.110> in<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:42.400> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.260 

know<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.660> soft<00:01:46.930> transition<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.670> you<00:01:48.850> can<00:01:49.060> see

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
know a soft transition but you can see

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.960 
know a soft transition but you can see
now<00:01:49.510> I've<00:01:49.900> I<00:01:50.380> might<00:01:50.920> back<00:01:51.100> this<00:01:51.310> off<00:01:51.520> but<00:01:51.760> it's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
now I've I might back this off but it's

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.910 
now I've I might back this off but it's
darker<00:01:52.360> here<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:53.080> comes<00:01:53.320> over<00:01:53.470> here<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.710> gets

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
darker here it comes over here and gets

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.710 
darker here it comes over here and gets
a<00:01:53.980> little<00:01:54.100> lighter<00:01:54.370> and<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.150> gets<00:01:55.300> darker<00:01:55.630> over

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
a little lighter and it gets darker over

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.870 
a little lighter and it gets darker over
here<00:01:56.020> this<00:01:56.620> is<00:01:56.680> another<00:01:56.950> opportunity<00:01:57.640> for<00:01:57.700> me

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
here this is another opportunity for me

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.000 
here this is another opportunity for me
not<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.090> press<00:01:58.390> too<00:01:58.600> hard<00:01:58.630> I'm<00:01:59.500> coming<00:01:59.860> down<00:01:59.950> to

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
not to press too hard I'm coming down to

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.500 
not to press too hard I'm coming down to
the<00:02:00.220> place<00:02:00.430> now<00:02:00.670> where<00:02:00.940> I<00:02:01.030> just<00:02:01.060> want<00:02:01.450> to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
the place now where I just want to

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.350 
the place now where I just want to
emphasize<00:02:01.870> a<00:02:01.900> few<00:02:02.200> things<00:02:02.470> I'm<00:02:02.920> going<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.700> show

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
emphasize a few things I'm going to show

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.140 
emphasize a few things I'm going to show
where<00:02:04.630> it<00:02:04.659> goes<00:02:04.930> underneath<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.850> eyelid<00:02:06.850> I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
where it goes underneath the eyelid I

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.320 
where it goes underneath the eyelid I
love<00:02:08.019> that<00:02:08.200> separation<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:09.100> want<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.149> make<00:02:10.300> sure

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
love that separation I want to make sure

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.130 
love that separation I want to make sure
that<00:02:10.690> that's<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.800> know<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.280> show

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that that's you know I can show

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.870 
that that's you know I can show
to<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> best<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.710> my<00:02:13.770> ability<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.890> is

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
to the best of my ability and that is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.690 
to the best of my ability and that is
all<00:02:18.209> quite<00:02:18.630> dark<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:19.709> maybe<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.459> can

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
all quite dark in here but maybe I can

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.240 
all quite dark in here but maybe I can
emphasize<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.569> edge<00:02:21.900> just<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.560> little<00:02:22.590> bit<00:02:23.040> we

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
emphasize that edge just a little bit we

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.240 
emphasize that edge just a little bit we
want<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.520> know<00:02:23.610> where<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.910> disappears<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.250> now

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
want to know where it disappears and now

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.120 
want to know where it disappears and now
maybe<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.569> come<00:02:27.780> back<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.470> want<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.010> be

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
maybe I can come back in I want to be

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.490 
maybe I can come back in I want to be
careful<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.600> my<00:02:30.750> 4b<00:02:31.230> I

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
careful just because I have my 4b I

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.130 
careful just because I have my 4b I
don't<00:02:32.280> want<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.550> go<00:02:32.670> ahead<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.090> say<00:02:33.270> oh<00:02:33.750> this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
don't want to go ahead and say oh this

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.900 
don't want to go ahead and say oh this
is<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> great<00:02:34.860> opportunity<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.430> think<00:02:35.520> I'll<00:02:35.760> make

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
is a great opportunity I think I'll make

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.460 
is a great opportunity I think I'll make
everything<00:02:36.470> dark<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.480> effort<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.110> I'm

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
everything dark the the effort that I'm

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.620 
everything dark the the effort that I'm
making<00:02:40.830> now<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:42.060> maintain<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:44.630> gradations

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
making now is to maintain the gradations

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.490 
making now is to maintain the gradations
maintain<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.160> range<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.610> value<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:49.170> same

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
maintain the the range of value the same

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.470 
maintain the the range of value the same
quality<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.130> have<00:02:50.489> built<00:02:50.730> up<00:02:50.940> with<00:02:51.120> all<00:02:51.300> my

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
quality I have built up with all my

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.530 
quality I have built up with all my
other<00:02:51.950> pencils<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.459> now<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.700> have<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.090> chance<00:02:54.390> to

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
other pencils but now I have a chance to

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.350 
other pencils but now I have a chance to
push<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.590> bit<00:02:55.920> further<00:02:56.250> just<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.269> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
push it a little bit further just in the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.150 
push it a little bit further just in the
darkest<00:02:57.690> places<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.260> if<00:02:58.350> I<00:02:58.470> go<00:02:58.650> away<00:02:58.800> just

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
darkest places and if I go away just

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.050 
darkest places and if I go away just
using<00:02:59.870> almost<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.110> line<00:03:01.550> then<00:03:02.550> I'm<00:03:02.700> really

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
using almost a line then I'm really

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.780 
using almost a line then I'm really
defeating<00:03:03.480> my<00:03:03.600> purpose<00:03:04.019> -<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.580> want<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.730> a

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
defeating my purpose - I want to have a

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.280 
defeating my purpose - I want to have a
clean<00:03:06.060> edge<00:03:06.090> but<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.600> don't<00:03:06.840> want<00:03:06.959> to<00:03:07.050> have<00:03:07.170> it

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
clean edge but I don't want to have it

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.759 
clean edge but I don't want to have it
just<00:03:07.470> become<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.130> dark<00:03:08.970> line<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.300> there<00:03:09.769> so

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
just become a dark line on there so

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:20.070 
just become a dark line on there so
let's<00:03:11.040> see<00:03:11.280> what<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.519> can<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.850> here

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.210 

let's<00:03:21.080> go<00:03:21.319> ahead<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.620> end<00:03:22.069> this<00:03:22.280> up<00:03:22.550> there

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
let's go ahead and end this up there

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.399 
let's go ahead and end this up there
let's<00:03:25.220> make<00:03:25.459> a<00:03:25.519> little<00:03:25.760> more<00:03:26.200> value<00:03:27.200> in<00:03:27.379> the

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
let's make a little more value in the

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.500 
let's make a little more value in the
pupil<00:03:27.890> here

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
pupil here

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.360 
pupil here
taking<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.599> few<00:03:29.780> liberties<00:03:30.019> because<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:31.159> looks

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
taking a few liberties because it looks

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.770 
taking a few liberties because it looks
like<00:03:31.549> they're<00:03:31.730> quite<00:03:31.909> a<00:03:31.940> bit<00:03:32.090> lighter<00:03:32.299> in<00:03:32.569> this

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
like they're quite a bit lighter in this

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.440 
like they're quite a bit lighter in this
lighter<00:03:34.450> valued<00:03:35.450> print<00:03:35.870> I<00:03:36.849> want<00:03:37.849> to<00:03:38.000> see<00:03:38.180> some

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
lighter valued print I want to see some

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.210 
lighter valued print I want to see some
difference<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:38.989> notice<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:40.010> almost

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
difference you notice that it it almost

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.920 
difference you notice that it it almost
appears<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.819> this<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.150> darker<00:03:41.569> than<00:03:41.599> this

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
appears that this is darker than this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.589 
appears that this is darker than this
well<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:42.709> know<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.549> this<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:43.849> recessed<00:03:44.360> in

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
well I know that this is recessed in

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.509 
well I know that this is recessed in
there<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.080> so<00:03:45.739> I'm<00:03:45.920> going<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.129> take<00:03:46.310> that

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
there and so I'm going to take that

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.220 
there and so I'm going to take that
opportunity<00:03:46.790> maybe<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.690> push<00:03:47.870> it<00:03:47.900> back<00:03:48.049> a

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
opportunity maybe I can push it back a

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.119 
opportunity maybe I can push it back a
little<00:03:48.379> bit<00:03:48.530> further<00:03:50.110> and<00:03:51.110> if<00:03:51.260> I<00:03:51.409> can<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.980> can

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
little bit further and if I can you can

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.819 
little bit further and if I can you can
see<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.549> value<00:03:53.269> in<00:03:53.540> not<00:03:53.930> going<00:03:54.440> to<00:03:54.709> the

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
see the value in not going to the

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.559 
see the value in not going to the
extreme<00:03:55.480> until<00:03:56.480> you're<00:03:56.660> ready<00:03:58.150> maybe<00:03:59.150> just<00:03:59.480> a

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
extreme until you're ready maybe just a

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.830 
extreme until you're ready maybe just a
little<00:03:59.780> bit<00:03:59.900> of<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.049> separation<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.739> there<00:04:00.980> I

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.630 

hope<00:04:05.840> it'll<00:04:06.049> pick<00:04:06.290> up<00:04:06.410> on<00:04:06.620> camera<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.069> think<00:04:07.400> I

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
hope it'll pick up on camera I think I

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.660 
hope it'll pick up on camera I think I
can<00:04:08.390> see<00:04:08.660> it<00:04:08.690> here<00:04:09.109> and<00:04:09.349> I<00:04:10.010> hope<00:04:10.370> that<00:04:10.579> I'm

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
can see it here and I hope that I'm

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.569 
can see it here and I hope that I'm
pushing<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.150> back<00:04:11.980> but<00:04:12.980> I<00:04:13.010> don't<00:04:13.250> want<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.430> just

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
pushing it back but I don't want to just

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.420 
pushing it back but I don't want to just
make<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.790> big<00:04:14.030> flat<00:04:14.329> spot<00:04:14.780> I<00:04:15.140> want<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.160> really

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
make a big flat spot I want to really

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.599 
make a big flat spot I want to really
show<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:17.630> there<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.079> even<00:04:18.440> a<00:04:18.530> deeper<00:04:19.070> part<00:04:19.370> to

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
show that there is even a deeper part to

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.879 
show that there is even a deeper part to
this<00:04:19.820> area<00:04:20.180> it<00:04:20.870> would<00:04:21.049> probably<00:04:21.320> be<00:04:21.620> back

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
this area it would probably be back

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.730 
this area it would probably be back
closer<00:04:22.789> to<00:04:23.000> this<00:04:23.180> or<00:04:23.660> maybe<00:04:24.139> up<00:04:24.440> underneath

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
closer to this or maybe up underneath

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.370 
closer to this or maybe up underneath
the<00:04:24.979> hair<00:04:25.220> you<00:04:28.539> know<00:04:29.539> let's<00:04:29.780> see<00:04:29.990> what<00:04:30.110> we<00:04:30.200> can

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
the hair you know let's see what we can

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.200 
the hair you know let's see what we can
do<00:04:30.560> about<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:31.039> top<00:04:31.280> maybe<00:04:31.580> there's<00:04:31.910> a<00:04:32.000> little

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
do about the top maybe there's a little

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.980 
do about the top maybe there's a little
bit<00:04:32.479> more<00:04:32.720> value<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.710> can<00:04:33.950> do<00:04:34.400> with<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.849> one<00:04:34.990> if

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
bit more value I can do with this one if

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.500 
bit more value I can do with this one if
this<00:04:36.260> starts<00:04:36.620> just<00:04:37.039> becoming<00:04:37.669> something

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
this starts just becoming something

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.350 
this starts just becoming something
that's<00:04:38.840> going<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.080> be<00:04:39.970> gaining<00:04:40.970> all<00:04:41.180> the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
that's going to be gaining all the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.760 
that's going to be gaining all the
attention<00:04:43.030> then<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.090> want<00:04:44.539> to<00:04:44.599> be<00:04:44.750> very<00:04:45.289> careful

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
attention then I want to be very careful

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.680 
attention then I want to be very careful
that<00:04:45.800> I'm<00:04:46.160> not<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:46.460> making<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.900> too<00:04:48.110> dark<00:04:48.349> I

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
that I'm not just making it too dark I

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.339 
that I'm not just making it too dark I
guess<00:04:50.690> I<00:04:50.810> can<00:04:51.020> keep<00:04:51.740> emphasizing<00:04:51.950> that<00:04:52.580> but<00:04:53.349> I

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
guess I can keep emphasizing that but I

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.140 
guess I can keep emphasizing that but I
I<00:04:54.979> don't<00:04:55.280> want<00:04:55.700> to<00:04:57.190> just<00:04:58.190> have<00:04:58.370> it<00:04:58.520> catch<00:04:58.940> the

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
I don't want to just have it catch the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.400 
I don't want to just have it catch the
eye<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.710> want<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.860> enhance<00:05:01.010> the<00:05:01.460> drawing<00:05:02.410> so

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
eye I want it to enhance the drawing so

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.050 
eye I want it to enhance the drawing so
I'm<00:05:03.560> going<00:05:03.830> in<00:05:03.979> between<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> little<00:05:04.610> bit<00:05:04.820> where

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
I'm going in between a little bit where

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.700 
I'm going in between a little bit where
there<00:05:05.300> could<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:06.050> suggestion<00:05:06.470> of

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
there could be the suggestion of

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.100 
there could be the suggestion of
eyelashes<00:05:07.340> here<00:05:07.639> there's<00:05:08.389> just<00:05:08.539> a<00:05:08.900> little

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
eyelashes here there's just a little

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.250 
eyelashes here there's just a little
variance<00:05:09.680> in<00:05:09.830> value<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:11.360> I<00:05:11.389> want<00:05:11.810> to<00:05:11.930> take

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
variance in value and so I want to take

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.850 
variance in value and so I want to take
my<00:05:12.470> 4b<00:05:13.220> opportunity<00:05:13.910> to<00:05:14.660> show<00:05:14.870> the<00:05:15.110> spaces<00:05:15.710> in

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
my 4b opportunity to show the spaces in

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.370 
my 4b opportunity to show the spaces in
between<00:05:15.889> that<00:05:16.340> are<00:05:16.460> a<00:05:16.490> little<00:05:16.610> darker<00:05:17.199> just<00:05:18.199> in

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
between that are a little darker just in

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.010 
between that are a little darker just in
a<00:05:18.470> few<00:05:18.740> little<00:05:19.099> touches<00:05:19.479> it<00:05:20.479> doesn't<00:05:20.840> take

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
a few little touches it doesn't take

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.050 
a few little touches it doesn't take
much

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.120
