00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
it easier and of course the sound system
and<00:01:55.380> gadgetry<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:56.009> top-notch<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:57.210> from<00:01:57.359> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and gadgetry is top-notch but from a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.120 
and gadgetry is top-notch but from a
performance<00:01:57.749> standpoint<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.920> Navigator

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
performance standpoint the Navigator

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.540 
performance standpoint the Navigator
takes<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.850> backseat<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.420> its<00:02:00.659> competitors

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
takes a backseat to its competitors

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.850 
takes a backseat to its competitors
again<00:02:01.850> it's<00:02:02.150> about<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.660> image<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.260> not<00:02:03.650> about

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
again it's about the image and not about

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.560 
again it's about the image and not about
the<00:02:04.040> horsepower<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.820> wouldn't<00:02:05.240> call<00:02:05.420> the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
the horsepower I wouldn't call the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
the horsepower I wouldn't call the
navigators<00:02:06.200> ride<00:02:06.470> sporty<00:02:07.070> but<00:02:07.340> it's

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
navigators ride sporty but it's

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.550 
navigators ride sporty but it's
comfortable<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.150> luxurious<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.930> perhaps<00:02:09.170> a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
comfortable and luxurious and perhaps a

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.620 
comfortable and luxurious and perhaps a
bit<00:02:09.710> soft<00:02:10.040> around<00:02:10.400> corners<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.360> big

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
bit soft around corners this is a big

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.920 
bit soft around corners this is a big
vehicle<00:02:11.900> so<00:02:12.560> it's<00:02:12.740> expected<00:02:13.450> bottom<00:02:14.450> line<00:02:14.630> is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
vehicle so it's expected bottom line is

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.600 
vehicle so it's expected bottom line is
whether<00:02:15.320> or<00:02:15.410> not<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.950> see<00:02:16.160> yourself

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
whether or not you can see yourself

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.580 
whether or not you can see yourself
driving<00:02:16.820> a<00:02:17.180> navigator<00:02:17.690> my<00:02:18.110> thought<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.560> that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
driving a navigator my thought is that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.950 
driving a navigator my thought is that
for<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.040> money<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.940> do<00:02:20.060> better<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.810> the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
for the money you can do better like the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.920 
for the money you can do better like the
cadillac<00:02:21.410> escalade<00:02:21.980> GMC<00:02:22.730> denali<00:02:23.120> even<00:02:23.840> the

mercedes gl550 and for that matter you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.660 
mercedes gl550 and for that matter you
may<00:02:27.050> want<00:02:27.200> to<00:02:27.320> consider<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.800> navigators<00:02:28.430> less

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
may want to consider the navigators less

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.030 
may want to consider the navigators less

flashy cousin the ford expedition which

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.130 
flashy cousin the ford expedition which
