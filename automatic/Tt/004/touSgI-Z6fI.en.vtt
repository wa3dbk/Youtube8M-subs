some<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.920> Godzilla<00:01:53.220> movies<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> he's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
some of the Godzilla movies and he's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.999 
some of the Godzilla movies and he's
trudging<00:01:54.240> through<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> city<00:01:54.689> yeah<00:01:55.560> you'll<00:01:55.799> see

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
trudging through a city yeah you'll see

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.100 
trudging through a city yeah you'll see
maybe<00:01:56.310> debris<00:01:56.759> fall<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.180> some<00:01:57.390> people<00:01:57.869> off

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
maybe debris fall on some people off

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
maybe debris fall on some people off
camera<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:58.979> you'll<00:01:59.790> see<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.210> looks<00:02:00.420> like

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
camera or you'll see what looks like

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.440 
camera or you'll see what looks like
he's<00:02:00.719> about<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.990> step<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> people<00:02:01.890> off<00:02:02.070> camera

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
he's about to step on people off camera

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450 
he's about to step on people off camera
but<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.540> never<00:02:03.689> get<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.950> how<00:02:05.130> violent

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
but we never get to see just how violent

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.160 
but we never get to see just how violent
something<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.240> could<00:02:06.450> actually<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.869> if

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
something like this could actually be if

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.080 
something like this could actually be if
it<00:02:07.320> were<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.500> happen<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:08.099> mean<00:02:08.789> we're<00:02:08.940> talking

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it were to happen I mean we're talking

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.809 
it were to happen I mean we're talking
about<00:02:09.500> tons<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.709> tons<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.250> squashed<00:02:11.580> bodies

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
about tons and tons of squashed bodies

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.880 
about tons and tons of squashed bodies
and<00:02:12.939> people<00:02:13.480> falling<00:02:13.749> from<00:02:14.079> building<00:02:14.530> stuff

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and people falling from building stuff

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.839 
and people falling from building stuff
like<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:16.180> i<00:02:16.239> think<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.819> know

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
like that but i think you know

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.970 
like that but i think you know
definitely<00:02:19.359> there's<00:02:20.049> there's<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.680> lot<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
definitely there's there's a lot of

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.629 
definitely there's there's a lot of
potential<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.639> make<00:02:21.879> this<00:02:22.090> very<00:02:22.540> scary

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.639 
potential to make this very scary

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:26.699 
potential to make this very scary
definitely<00:02:24.639> from<00:02:24.939> a<00:02:25.180> scenery<00:02:25.629> standpoint<00:02:26.230> you

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
definitely from a scenery standpoint you

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.770 
definitely from a scenery standpoint you
know<00:02:27.060> depending<00:02:28.060> what<00:02:28.209> kind<00:02:28.389> of<00:02:28.450> lighting

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
know depending what kind of lighting

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.530 
know depending what kind of lighting
they<00:02:28.870> choose<00:02:29.139> and<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.560> kind<00:02:29.829> of<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.510> know

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
they choose and what kind of you know

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.080 
they choose and what kind of you know
sky<00:02:31.959> what<00:02:32.739> the<00:02:32.829> sky<00:02:33.010> looks<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.849> things

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
sky what the sky looks like and things

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.330 
sky what the sky looks like and things
like<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.469> could<00:02:35.469> definitely<00:02:35.739> add<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
like that could definitely add the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.289 
like that could definitely add the
effects<00:02:36.849> how<00:02:37.060> scary<00:02:37.359> movie<00:02:37.659> can<00:02:37.810> be<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.139> think

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
effects how scary movie can be I think

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.949 
effects how scary movie can be I think
seeing<00:02:40.299> Godzilla<00:02:42.209> directly<00:02:43.209> aiming<00:02:43.749> at

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
seeing Godzilla directly aiming at

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.140 
seeing Godzilla directly aiming at
hurting<00:02:44.680> people<00:02:45.189> would<00:02:45.609> be<00:02:45.760> kind<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.030> scary

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
hurting people would be kind of scary

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.629 
hurting people would be kind of scary
like<00:02:47.049> there's<00:02:47.560> been<00:02:47.709> plenty<00:02:47.889> of<00:02:48.099> movies<00:02:48.400> where

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
like there's been plenty of movies where

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.780 
like there's been plenty of movies where
you<00:02:48.760> see<00:02:49.060> Godzilla<00:02:49.680> behind<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:51.129> group<00:02:51.639> of

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
you see Godzilla behind a group of

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.640 
you see Godzilla behind a group of
people<00:02:52.060> running<00:02:52.180> away<00:02:52.480> from<00:02:52.659> him<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:53.049> need<00:02:53.500> this

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
people running away from him I need this

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.280 
people running away from him I need this
continues<00:02:54.519> to<00:02:54.760> lollygag<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.689> go<00:02:55.840> about<00:02:56.109> his

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
continues to lollygag and go about his

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.199 
continues to lollygag and go about his
business<00:02:56.319> but<00:02:57.280> could<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.549> imagine<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:58.090> there

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
business but could you imagine if there

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.759 
business but could you imagine if there
was<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.359> whole<00:02:58.659> group<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.139> people<00:02:59.199> running<00:02:59.560> away

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
was a whole group of people running away

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.099 
was a whole group of people running away
from<00:02:59.949> Godzilla<00:03:00.099> and<00:03:00.879> he<00:03:01.030> decides<00:03:01.389> to<00:03:01.599> stop<00:03:01.900> for

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
from Godzilla and he decides to stop for

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.990 
from Godzilla and he decides to stop for
a<00:03:02.139> second<00:03:02.469> look<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.680> him<00:03:02.769> on<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.159> breathe<00:03:03.549> his

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
a second look at him on and breathe his

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.420 
a second look at him on and breathe his
breath<00:03:04.329> and<00:03:04.599> just<00:03:05.069> incinerate<00:03:06.069> all<00:03:06.099> these

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
breath and just incinerate all these

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.339 
breath and just incinerate all these
people<00:03:06.699> and<00:03:07.389> we<00:03:07.480> saw<00:03:07.629> something<00:03:07.840> similar<00:03:08.139> to

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
people and we saw something similar to

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.129 
people and we saw something similar to
that<00:03:08.469> in<00:03:08.590> Godzilla<00:03:08.980> 84<00:03:09.609> where<00:03:10.299> he<00:03:10.480> got<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:11.019> the

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
that in Godzilla 84 where he got to the

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.349 
that in Godzilla 84 where he got to the
Tokyo<00:03:11.590> Bay<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.400> there's<00:03:12.549> a<00:03:12.639> military<00:03:13.060> waiting

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
Tokyo Bay and there's a military waiting

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.800 
Tokyo Bay and there's a military waiting
for<00:03:13.510> him<00:03:13.659> and<00:03:14.549> he<00:03:15.549> blew<00:03:15.909> his<00:03:16.120> breath<00:03:16.599> right

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
for him and he blew his breath right

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.499 
for him and he blew his breath right
across<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.290> bay<00:03:17.759> but<00:03:18.759> even<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.150> even<00:03:19.269> then

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:19.509 
across the bay but even and even then

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:21.479 
across the bay but even and even then
gmk<00:03:19.959> something<00:03:20.379> very<00:03:20.560> similar<00:03:20.829> he<00:03:21.069> did<00:03:21.280> I

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
gmk something very similar he did I

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.899 
gmk something very similar he did I
think<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.419> GM<00:03:22.810> k<00:03:23.340> Godzilla<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.579> whole<00:03:24.759> nother

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
think a GM k Godzilla to a whole nother

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.030 
think a GM k Godzilla to a whole nother
level<00:03:25.180> would<00:03:25.659> definitely<00:03:26.349> be<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> little<00:03:26.739> scary

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
level would definitely be a little scary

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.129 
level would definitely be a little scary
but<00:03:27.849> I<00:03:27.909> think<00:03:28.209> things<00:03:28.389> like<00:03:28.569> that<00:03:28.840> would<00:03:29.019> be

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
but I think things like that would be

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.589 
but I think things like that would be
pretty<00:03:29.439> my<00:03:29.680> marriage<00:03:30.009> because<00:03:30.220> it's<00:03:31.150> always

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
pretty my marriage because it's always

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.240 
pretty my marriage because it's always
the<00:03:31.750> city's<00:03:32.079> it's<00:03:32.349> always<00:03:32.560> the<00:03:32.680> military<00:03:33.129> it's

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
the city's it's always the military it's

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.399 
the city's it's always the military it's
never<00:03:33.430> really<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:34.569> know<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:34.989> innocent

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
never really you know that innocent

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.689 
never really you know that innocent
people<00:03:35.650> are<00:03:35.739> affected<00:03:36.009> but<00:03:36.310> you<00:03:36.430> never<00:03:36.609> really

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:36.699 
people are affected but you never really

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:39.270 
people are affected but you never really
see<00:03:37.030> how<00:03:37.180> badly<00:03:37.479> and<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.439> think<00:03:38.799> something<00:03:39.159> like

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
see how badly and I think something like

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.939 
see how badly and I think something like
that<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.849> little<00:03:40.150> bit<00:03:40.329> more<00:03:40.629> and<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.650> know<00:03:41.709> it

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:41.949 
that a little bit more and I know it

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:44.969 
that a little bit more and I know it
sounds<00:03:42.099> more<00:03:42.669> big<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.810> really<00:03:44.259> that<00:03:44.530> would<00:03:44.799> be
