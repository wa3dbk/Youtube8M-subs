00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
and lower teeth look very different in

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.890

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:17.659 
over 2 inches long which is the magic

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:19.869 
over 2 inches long which is the magic
mark<00:02:17.930> meaning<00:02:18.920> they<00:02:19.099> go<00:02:19.250> up<00:02:19.370> in<00:02:19.489> the<00:02:19.580> value

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
mark meaning they go up in the value

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.880 
mark meaning they go up in the value
exponentially<00:02:20.659> once<00:02:20.930> they<00:02:21.080> hit<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.470> 2<00:02:21.650> inch
