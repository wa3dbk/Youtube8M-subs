00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.580 
name or the IP address of your print
server<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> let's<00:01:41.490> make<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> fake<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:42.150> here<00:01:43.970> and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
server so let's make a fake one here and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.200 
server so let's make a fake one here and
then<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> backslash<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.970> name<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
then your do a backslash and the name of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.349 
then your do a backslash and the name of
your<00:01:48.360> printer

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.380 

so<00:01:54.359> what<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> usually<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.380> change<00:01:56.390> change

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
so what I usually do is change change

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.289 
so what I usually do is change change
the<00:01:57.570> name<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:59.250> actual<00:01:59.610> name<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.060 
the name to the actual name of the

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
printer because they don't like a bunch

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.529

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
of numbers as the name of the printer

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.020 
of numbers as the name of the printer
location<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.630> can<00:02:06.780> put<00:02:06.929> what<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.200> want<00:02:08.030> for
