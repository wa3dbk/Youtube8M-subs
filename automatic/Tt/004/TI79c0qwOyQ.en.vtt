00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
and I'm more concerned with what is it

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.930 
and I'm more concerned with what is it
happening<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:10.979> interrelationship<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.850> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
happening with interrelationship of the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.600

is<00:02:14.730> really<00:02:15.090> taken<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.570> backseat<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:17.400> never<00:02:18.290> do<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
is really taken a backseat I never do a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.860 
is really taken a backseat I never do a
painting<00:02:19.739> because<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.580> subject<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.690> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
painting because of subject I do a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.320 
painting because of subject I do a
painting<00:02:22.170> because<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:23.040> value<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.060> shape

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
painting because of value and shape

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.580 
painting because of value and shape
relationship<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.110> color<00:02:25.320> relationships

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
relationship and color relationships

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.370 
relationship and color relationships
that<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.720> that's<00:02:27.720> really<00:02:28.050> what<00:02:28.260> I'm

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
that I see and that's really what I'm

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.530 
that I see and that's really what I'm
interested<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.670> subject<00:02:29.940> becomes

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
interested in if the subject becomes

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.180 
interested in if the subject becomes
something<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.110> people<00:02:31.410> are<00:02:31.560> interested<00:02:32.040> in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
something that people are interested in

00:02:32.190 --> 00:03:19.050 
something that people are interested in
or<00:02:32.670> respond<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.330> that's<00:02:33.930> great

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.190 

when<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.599> start<00:03:20.170> painting<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:22.330> was<00:03:22.780> really

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
when I start painting I I was really

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.600 
when I start painting I I was really
into<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:24.760> figurative<00:03:25.569> at<00:03:26.050> portrait<00:03:26.980> painting

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
into a figurative at portrait painting

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.360 
into a figurative at portrait painting
so<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.209> find<00:03:28.480> out<00:03:28.660> still<00:03:29.230> life<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:30.220> very

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
so I find out still life is a very

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.880 
so I find out still life is a very
practical<00:03:30.880> for<00:03:31.270> me<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.810> also<00:03:32.020> is<00:03:32.319> relatively

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
practical for me and also is relatively

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.670 
practical for me and also is relatively
short<00:03:33.400> cut<00:03:33.640> for<00:03:33.670> me<00:03:34.030> because<00:03:34.989> compared<00:03:35.440> to

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
short cut for me because compared to

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.809 
short cut for me because compared to
figures<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:38.230> can<00:03:38.500> control<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.160> lighting<00:03:39.430> I

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
figures and I can control the lighting I

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.600 
figures and I can control the lighting I
can<00:03:40.239> control<00:03:40.660> the<00:03:40.750> setup<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.980> i<00:03:42.250> will

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
can control the setup so i will

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.650 
can control the setup so i will
naturally<00:03:43.599> I<00:03:44.050> will<00:03:44.290> concentrate<00:03:44.739> more<00:03:45.370> on<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
naturally I will concentrate more on the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:04:08.160 
naturally I will concentrate more on the
compositions<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.950> how<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:49.390> the<00:03:49.720> ideas

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:35.170 

you
