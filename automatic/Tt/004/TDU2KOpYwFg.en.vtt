side<00:00:51.979> of<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.190> carburetor<00:00:52.519> and<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.030> is<00:00:53.180> the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
side of the carburetor and this is the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.390 
side of the carburetor and this is the
airbox<00:00:53.839> side<00:00:54.170> of<00:00:54.229> the<00:00:54.290> carburetor<00:00:54.530> and<00:00:54.949> what<00:00:55.369> I

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
airbox side of the carburetor and what I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.329 
airbox side of the carburetor and what I
mean<00:00:55.580> by<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:56.089> is<00:00:56.449> this<00:00:56.960> round<00:00:57.379> cylinder<00:00:58.159> here

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
mean by that is this round cylinder here

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.299 
mean by that is this round cylinder here
is<00:00:58.489> your<00:00:58.670> throttle<00:00:58.909> valve<00:00:59.119> and<00:01:00.309> anything

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
is your throttle valve and anything

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.670 
is your throttle valve and anything
behind<00:01:01.909> here<00:01:02.360> is<00:01:02.540> consider<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.049> airbox<00:01:03.320> side

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
behind here is consider the airbox side

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.810 
behind here is consider the airbox side
and<00:01:04.059> this<00:01:05.059> side<00:01:05.299> is<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.630> airbox<00:01:06.200> side<00:01:06.470> if<00:01:07.159> the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
and this side is the airbox side if the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.410 
and this side is the airbox side if the
screw<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.899> then<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:09.320> video<00:01:10.359> majority<00:01:11.359> of

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
screw and then in that video majority of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.599 
screw and then in that video majority of
the<00:01:11.479> case<00:01:11.689> is<00:01:11.899> when<00:01:12.109> this<00:01:12.320> screw<00:01:12.649> is<00:01:12.950> located

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
the case is when this screw is located

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.840 
the case is when this screw is located
on<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.630> engine<00:01:14.929> side<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.439> meters<00:01:15.710> fuel<00:01:16.009> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
on the engine side and meters fuel and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.849 
on the engine side and meters fuel and
if<00:01:16.939> it<00:01:17.090> if<00:01:17.359> it's<00:01:17.659> located<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.289> airbox<00:01:18.560> side

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
if it if it's located on the airbox side

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:23.709 
if it if it's located on the airbox side
it<00:01:19.729> meters<00:01:20.329> air<00:01:20.810> however<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:22.039> this<00:01:22.159> case<00:01:22.719> this

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
it meters air however in this case this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:27.760 
it meters air however in this case this
screw<00:01:24.109> still<00:01:24.380> meters<00:01:24.799> air<00:01:25.659> so<00:01:26.659> another<00:01:27.590> way<00:01:27.740> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
screw still meters air so another way to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.830 
screw still meters air so another way to
tell<00:01:28.130> not<00:01:28.789> only<00:01:28.939> on<00:01:29.299> what<00:01:29.479> side<00:01:29.689> of<00:01:29.749> the

turn<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:16.310> okay<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.970> that's<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.240> pilot<00:02:18.420> screw

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
turn out okay so that's the pilot screw

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.130 
turn out okay so that's the pilot screw
it<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:20.180> meters<00:02:21.180> how<00:02:21.360> much<00:02:21.540> air<00:02:21.720> goes<00:02:21.960> into

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it just meters how much air goes into

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.490 
it just meters how much air goes into
the<00:02:22.260> engine<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.770> can<00:02:22.920> fine<00:02:23.100> tune<00:02:24.500> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the engine and you can fine tune the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.980 
the engine and you can fine tune the
idle<00:02:25.740> mixture<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.850> here<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.570> idle<00:02:27.870> screw

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
idle mixture this here is the idle screw

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.199 
idle mixture this here is the idle screw
the<00:02:28.230> idle<00:02:28.470> screw<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.770> usually<00:02:29.100> found<00:02:29.250> right<00:02:29.670> on

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
the idle screw is usually found right on

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.260 
the idle screw is usually found right on
the<00:02:30.360> centerline<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.670> throttle<00:02:32.670> slide<00:02:33.030> and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the centerline of the throttle slide and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.650 
the centerline of the throttle slide and
it<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:33.540> basically<00:02:34.580> lifts<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.760> lowers<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
it just basically lifts and lowers the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.470 
it just basically lifts and lowers the
slide<00:02:37.130> okay<00:02:38.130> turning<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.760> in<00:02:38.880> will<00:02:39.120> raise<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
slide okay turning it in will raise the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.380 
slide okay turning it in will raise the
idle<00:02:40.070> turning<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.160> out<00:02:41.310> will<00:02:44.060> okay<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.240> more

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
idle turning it out will okay one more

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.130 
idle turning it out will okay one more
thing<00:02:45.450> before<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.900> fire<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> up<00:02:47.990> turning<00:02:48.990> this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
thing before I fire it up turning this

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.490 
thing before I fire it up turning this
screw<00:02:49.770> in<00:02:50.480> will<00:02:51.480> reduce<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.080> amount<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.350> hair

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
screw in will reduce the amount of hair

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.590 
screw in will reduce the amount of hair
so<00:02:52.680> it'll<00:02:52.860> rich<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> idle<00:02:53.550> screwing<00:02:54.480> it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
so it'll rich in the idle screwing it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.479 
so it'll rich in the idle screwing it
out<00:02:54.800> will<00:02:55.910> lean<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.090> out<00:02:57.590> okay<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.250> what<00:02:59.400> you

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
out will lean it out okay so what you

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.220 
out will lean it out okay so what you
want<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.730> do<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.510> have<00:03:00.690> your<00:03:00.780> baseline

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
want to do is you have your baseline

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.960 
want to do is you have your baseline
here<00:03:01.500> of<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.980> one<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> half<00:03:02.370> turn<00:03:02.610> out<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
here of one to one and a half turn out I

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.570 
here of one to one and a half turn out I
took<00:03:03.269> put<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.570> one<00:03:03.750> turn<00:03:03.959> out<00:03:04.459> what<00:03:05.459> you're

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
took put it one turn out what you're

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.259 
took put it one turn out what you're
gonna<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.120> set<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.900> idle<00:03:07.050> as<00:03:08.090> low<00:03:09.090> as

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
gonna do is set the idle as low as

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.660 
gonna do is set the idle as low as
possible<00:03:09.330> kind<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.080> low<00:03:10.230> because<00:03:10.519> when<00:03:11.519> it's

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
possible kind of low because when it's

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.400 
possible kind of low because when it's
low<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:11.970> notice<00:03:12.660> changes<00:03:14.810> easier<00:03:15.810> when<00:03:16.140> when

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
low you notice changes easier when when

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.590 
low you notice changes easier when when
you<00:03:16.500> mess<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.250> pilot<00:03:17.550> air<00:03:17.640> screw<00:03:17.880> so

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
you mess with the pilot air screw so

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.120 
you mess with the pilot air screw so
we're<00:03:18.780> gonna<00:03:18.930> want<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.200> do<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.470> turn<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.920> in

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
we're gonna want to do is turn it in

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.509 
we're gonna want to do is turn it in
until<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> engine<00:03:20.910> stumbles<00:03:22.190> turn<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.340> out

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
until the engine stumbles turn it out

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.080 
until the engine stumbles turn it out
until<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.480> engine<00:03:24.750> stumbles<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.880> you<00:03:26.880> want

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
until the engine stumbles and you want

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.570 
until the engine stumbles and you want
to<00:03:27.209> find<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.720> highest<00:03:27.930> rpm<00:03:28.380> somewhere<00:03:29.340> in

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
to find the highest rpm somewhere in

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.500 
to find the highest rpm somewhere in
between<00:03:30.019> those<00:03:31.019> two<00:03:31.350> points<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.060> example

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
between those two points so for example

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.840 
between those two points so for example
let's<00:03:33.690> say<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:33.870> turn<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.769> at<00:03:35.489> half<00:03:35.700> a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
let's say I turn it in and at half a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.440 
let's say I turn it in and at half a
turn<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.840> stumbles<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.530> then<00:03:38.400> at<00:03:38.880> one<00:03:39.299> and

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
turn out it stumbles and then at one and

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.320 
turn out it stumbles and then at one and
a<00:03:39.510> half<00:03:39.720> it<00:03:39.930> stumbles<00:03:40.410> I'm<00:03:41.150> probably<00:03:42.150> gonna

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
a half it stumbles I'm probably gonna

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.560 
a half it stumbles I'm probably gonna
finding<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.720> best<00:03:42.840> setting<00:03:43.230> at<00:03:43.350> one<00:03:43.530> turn<00:03:43.739> out

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
finding the best setting at one turn out

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.539 
finding the best setting at one turn out
okay<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:45.750> let's<00:03:46.260> fire<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.500> up<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.950> you'll<00:03:47.519> see

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
okay so let's fire it up and you'll see

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.960 
okay so let's fire it up and you'll see
what<00:03:47.760> I'm<00:03:47.820> talking<00:03:47.880> about

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.600 

[Music]

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.770 

all<00:03:57.610> right<00:03:57.790> so<00:03:57.910> let's<00:03:58.090> go<00:03:58.240> ahead<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.480> lower

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
all right so let's go ahead and lower

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.470 
all right so let's go ahead and lower
the<00:03:58.930> aisle<00:03:59.230> which<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.830> through<00:04:00.100> here

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.290 

see<00:04:06.020> it's<00:04:06.170> barely<00:04:06.410> running<00:04:07.000> go<00:04:08.000> ahead<00:04:08.180> and

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
see it's barely running go ahead and

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.160 
see it's barely running go ahead and
turn<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.690> in

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
turn this in

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.350 
turn this in
so<00:04:09.620> we're<00:04:09.800> at<00:04:09.890> one<00:04:10.069> turn<00:04:10.340> out<00:04:10.550> okay<00:04:10.940> so<00:04:10.970> let's

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
so we're at one turn out okay so let's

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.199 
so we're at one turn out okay so let's
go<00:04:11.480> ahead<00:04:11.720> turn<00:04:15.250> you<00:04:16.250> can<00:04:16.400> see<00:04:16.609> it's<00:04:16.730> it<00:04:16.970> barely

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
go ahead turn you can see it's it barely

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.680 
go ahead turn you can see it's it barely
wants<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.660> run<00:04:17.870> right<00:04:18.169> that's<00:04:18.859> tumbling<00:04:19.690> come

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
wants to run right that's tumbling come

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.450 
wants to run right that's tumbling come
back<00:04:20.900> get<00:04:21.079> one<00:04:21.290> turnout<00:04:21.709> let's<00:04:21.979> split<00:04:22.130> one<00:04:22.310> and

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
back get one turnout let's split one and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.510 
back get one turnout let's split one and
a<00:04:22.490> half<00:04:26.470> don't<00:04:27.470> real<00:04:27.650> change<00:04:27.979> at<00:04:28.190> one<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.460> a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
a half don't real change at one and a

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.090 
a half don't real change at one and a
half<00:04:29.050> that's<00:04:30.050> starting<00:04:30.410> to<00:04:30.440> gurgle<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.889> little

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
half that's starting to gurgle a little

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.840 
half that's starting to gurgle a little
bit<00:04:31.389> but<00:04:32.389> to<00:04:33.550> that<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.820> turn<00:04:35.090> see<00:04:35.710> go<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:37.760> you

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
bit but to that to turn see go so you

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.810 
bit but to that to turn see go so you
can<00:04:37.910> see<00:04:38.180> one<00:04:38.419> turnout<00:04:38.840> was<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:40.310> sweet<00:04:40.580> spot

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
can see one turnout was the sweet spot

with some videos called how to tune your
main<00:05:49.130> jet<00:05:49.370> and<00:05:49.550> how<00:05:49.730> to<00:05:49.790> tune<00:05:50.090> your<00:05:50.510> needle

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
clip position I think we can bump the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.180 
clip position I think we can bump the
main<00:05:53.000> jet<00:05:53.270> up<00:05:53.420> one<00:05:53.990> to<00:05:54.200> two<00:05:54.380> to<00:05:54.590> three<00:05:54.620> sizes

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
main jet up one to two to three sizes

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.120 
main jet up one to two to three sizes
and<00:05:55.730> also<00:05:56.270> go<00:05:56.420> one<00:05:57.320> richer<00:05:57.650> on<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.860> needle

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
and also go one richer on the needle

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.250 
and also go one richer on the needle
clip<00:05:58.340> and<00:05:58.760> we'll<00:05:58.940> just<00:05:59.180> see<00:05:59.360> what<00:05:59.660> happens<00:06:00.080> I
