00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.620
 and so in general, hello to all I want once more 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.870
 not exactly 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.799
 one more time about praise I want to tell 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:20.310
 about shoals let's start with a shoal what is now 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:21.460
 from the trip from the garage I have something behind 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.929
 crunched 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:30.369
 I understand that the chain tensioner 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:34.030
 before that, I understand that I'm not 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.730
 so did not crunch the bearing 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.260
 usually the sound in this rolls over there 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:43.239
 something clicks so i think i 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.530
 somehow crooked rat tightened because 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.930
 If you look at the star tooth right 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.300
 already attached to this side 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.530
 they move away and here they are already equal 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.090
 so okay still from the doorpost and here it is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.489
 this bolt so they were not so they 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.229
 there were some others I don't remember and there 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.920
 mount inside the broken off here on this 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:12.130
 my brother and I also put a side 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.250
 plate in general they rattled it 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:20.650
 now it does not rattle so hard 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.040
 pulling the knitting needles not so much as there 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.240
 drawing they need to be pulled no just 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.460
 pulled those that dangled not 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:35.229
 drew them just pulling up and found out 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:38.710
 what two wires were they 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:43.740
 I review showed I had here 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.110
 a fall after reviews in the garage here and 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.549
 I'm right in the garage fell but due to the fact that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.280
 the wheels were all mud 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.130
 slightly injured leg so therefore 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.250
 for a long time did not ride and do not take off now like 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.860
 more or less everything goes away you can go 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:05.440
 and broke that pen at that moment 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:07.720
 of how remember she was flip out here it is 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.250
 broken now i put 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.440
 the quad bike lagged behind 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.160
 since I really wanted to ride and the first 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:23.890
 I got a stealth store 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:27.310
 this pen is a plus from the fact that I do not know 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:31.360
 plus it or not plus there is here and this 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.350
 Stop he type of parking brake on an ATV 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.180
 working is clamped so the brake well not 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.010
 I know he doesnâ€™t use her spring well 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.610
 works like this and so here these two wires 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.370
 before when they were taken from me 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.950
 standard handle and set flip without 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.120
 I don't know how to do it right 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.000
 call here he gloh me somewhere in 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:03.910
 slides and I had to always include 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.250
 neutral to start here and now here 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.040
 These wires are set I can include 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.530
 already directly at speed surviving 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:18.340
 Only clutch there if he can be seen 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.730
 from here now focus here it is there white 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.370
 such a rod is he himself of the type on the steering wheel 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.480
 brake button that is clamped 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.390
 if the clamp is not started if 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.380
 and jetta it can be started well and 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.590
 accordingly everything works fine 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:42.130
 I understood it of course so very necessary 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.680
 thing i just remember there is a slide 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.590
 here yes by the way on such in it difficult 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.989
 drive in from the bottom that is and where is 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.489
 face there rests and there is not that 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.079
 straight land here on this hill here and here 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.390
 there is such a soft nakida well that is 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.370
 apparently well , somewhere the grass with the roots removed 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.200
 she is straight soft from the motorcycle 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.470
 fails in it and here in it 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.730
 you drive in and he stalls 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.890
 well now everything 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.900
 and now he stalls on it can start 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.709
 I certainly got there forever 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.180
 speeds to remove put on 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:22.930
 subway ice to go 7 will be short 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.330
 such a short video but I just want to 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.780
 ride must take what to come and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.880
 son wanted to ride here he is very person 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.220
 I will not ride because this one 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.919
 crunch makes me worried 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.120
 Of course, I will correct it all the same 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.010
 castor because here by the way yes all 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.460
 I probably noticed the wheel 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:49.949
 just crooked standing here right now 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.960
 so here and from the other side that's how 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:56.590
 almost 5 millimeters left the wheel of the court 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.660
 In this direction, I think that rather 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.570
 altogether she 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.880
 bearing on came back for this melting 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.120
 right now i will put it all back in place 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:12.160
 maybe still live well anyway 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:15.479
 I will change to more often from the jambs 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:19.330
 and from the stocks after washing 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:23.260
 these are the stickers they started 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:26.050
 fall off this is my last mare 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:30.090
 after the fall already his in my week 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:35.400
 through one and a half and started stickers fly off 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.400
 quietly here 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:42.770
 so basically everything is bye 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.000
 Today I hope I ride either brother or 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.260
 we 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.290
 small son 6 year old schoolboy 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.940
 by taking me off well and generally i took 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.340
 take something else 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.070
 tramplinchik here this sells from 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.190
 for some reason, they somehow killed me here 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.900
 probably in bottles though 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.110
 the video will seem like it is small 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.240
 cockroach but still on it is good so 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.950
 jump important here I scratched him a little 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.070
 so it will be possible 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:20.370
 but he is not alone here here still here 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:24.660
 here is a springboard then here 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:28.410
 springboard on and there are so small 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.300
 but they are in turns so there in 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.260
 Basically, I posted a video on this track. 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.690
 there you can see though she is bad with 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.380
 quality with bad shot on soapboxes 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:47.000
 fasten and tape to the helmet of how 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:49.400
 gopro yet well all plans and moreover 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.190
 more more 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:58.350
 shock absorber also began to beat chipper 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:07:02.700
 I do not know what the reason is there 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:05.810
 valve which pump it up on 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:11.090
 tougher to do well to someone purely physically 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.090
 here we have a trick 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:17.260
 physically and well, do not crawl 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:23.560
 Do not screw anything only if you shoot 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:25.720
 filter with a battery that's so then 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:30.150
 This pen of course pleased me 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:33.480
 I hope she'll be ok 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:39.250
 the fall is not supposed to be anymore 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:42.670
 it became scary so well that's all 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.850
 Thank you all, I will shoot 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.850
 throw out
