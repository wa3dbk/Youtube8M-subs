00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.969 
it's the thought that counts we also
have<00:01:35.820> our<00:01:36.000> box<00:01:36.210> for<00:01:36.479> bodies<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.710> three

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
have our box for bodies and the three

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.440 
have our box for bodies and the three
other<00:01:38.159> things<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.610> can't<00:01:38.909> name<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.210> an<00:01:39.299> anvil

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
other things I can't name in an anvil

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.510 
other things I can't name in an anvil
which<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.960> ender<00:01:40.320> chests<00:01:40.619> we've<00:01:41.189> got<00:01:41.430> our

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
which is ender chests we've got our

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.880 
which is ender chests we've got our
anvil<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.180> also<00:01:42.810> our<00:01:42.960> crafting<00:01:43.380> table<00:01:43.560> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
anvil and also our crafting table so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.219 
anvil and also our crafting table so
like<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.220> said<00:01:44.280> all<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.119> essentials<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
like I said all of the essentials now to

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.770 
like I said all of the essentials now to
build<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:46.950> isn't<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:48.060> difficult

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
build one of these isn't that difficult

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
build one of these isn't that difficult
I<00:01:48.810> mean<00:01:49.079> sure<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> quite<00:01:50.009> low<00:01:50.159> resources

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
I mean sure there is quite low resources

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.100 
I mean sure there is quite low resources
involved<00:01:51.030> you're<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.079> a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
involved you're going to have to do a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.200 
involved you're going to have to do a
bit<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> groundwork<00:01:52.860> before<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> begin<00:01:53.700> but

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
bit of groundwork before you begin but

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.550 
bit of groundwork before you begin but
once<00:01:54.420> you're<00:01:54.630> done<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.079> will<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.439> yourself

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
once you're done you will have yourself

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.399 
once you're done you will have yourself
a<00:01:56.040> very<00:01:56.310> nice-looking<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.180> fully<00:01:57.780> functional

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
a very nice-looking and fully functional

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.530 
a very nice-looking and fully functional
secret<00:01:59.100> armory<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.670> reason<00:02:00.030> it's<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.299> little

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
secret armory the reason it's a little

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.060 
secret armory the reason it's a little
bit<00:02:00.689> bigger<00:02:00.869> than<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> would<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.680> liked<00:02:01.920> is

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
bit bigger than I would have liked is

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.980 
bit bigger than I would have liked is
because<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.430> wanted<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.850> keep<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.630> clean

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
because I wanted to keep that clean

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
because I wanted to keep that clean
opening<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.979> closing<00:02:05.430> sequence<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.969> you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
opening and closing sequence that you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
opening and closing sequence that you
can<00:02:06.090> see<00:02:06.450> there<00:02:06.750> my<00:02:07.170> only<00:02:07.380> regret<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:08.099> this

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
can see there my only regret with this

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.010 
can see there my only regret with this
design<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.629> particularly

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
design is that it's not particularly

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.690 
design is that it's not particularly
fast<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.129> due<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.580> way

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
fast and that is just due to the way

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.150 
fast and that is just due to the way
that<00:02:11.730> I've<00:02:12.000> wired<00:02:12.270> up<00:02:12.540> but<00:02:13.140> anyway<00:02:13.200> that's<00:02:13.830> an

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that I've wired up but anyway that's an

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.650 
that I've wired up but anyway that's an
of<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.550> now<00:02:15.030> we're<00:02:15.180> going<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.330> get<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
of that now we're going to get to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.120 
of that now we're going to get to
business<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.260> crack<00:02:16.500> on<00:02:16.530> with<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.920> tutorial

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
business and crack on with this tutorial

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.820 
business and crack on with this tutorial
so<00:02:17.700> let's<00:02:18.030> go<00:02:18.260> so<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.320> want<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.530> get<00:02:19.650> things

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
so let's go so you want to get things

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.130 
so let's go so you want to get things
started<00:02:20.130> with<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.490> six<00:02:20.790> by<00:02:21.030> six<00:02:21.360> area<00:02:21.840> your

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
started with a six by six area your

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.050 
started with a six by six area your
floor<00:02:22.440> level<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.920> going<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.220> be<00:02:23.280> five<00:02:23.610> blocks

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
floor level is going to be five blocks

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.450 
floor level is going to be five blocks
above<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.960> bottom<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:25.530> anyway<00:02:25.860> we're<00:02:26.340> going

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
above the bottom but anyway we're going

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.130 
above the bottom but anyway we're going
to<00:02:26.520> start<00:02:26.760> off<00:02:26.910> by<00:02:26.940> placing<00:02:27.480> down<00:02:27.600> our<00:02:27.780> sticky

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
to start off by placing down our sticky

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.050 
to start off by placing down our sticky
piston<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.830> want<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> place<00:02:29.220> your<00:02:29.460> double

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
piston so you want to place your double

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.970 
piston so you want to place your double
piston<00:02:30.240> extenders<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.440> then<00:02:31.680> take

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
piston extenders in like that then take

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.680 
piston extenders in like that then take
out<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.340> blocks<00:02:32.550> on<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.820> bottom<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.240> you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
out the blocks on the bottom and you

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.240 
out the blocks on the bottom and you
want<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> place<00:02:34.080> your<00:02:34.230> floor<00:02:34.590> blocks<00:02:34.860> on<00:02:35.070> top

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
want to place your floor blocks on top

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.040 
want to place your floor blocks on top
of<00:02:35.370> those<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.880> then<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.570> want<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> place

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
of those and then you just want to place

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.080 
of those and then you just want to place
a<00:02:37.290> set<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.590> sticky<00:02:38.040> pistons<00:02:38.460> there<00:02:38.670> with

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
a set of sticky pistons there with

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.290 
a set of sticky pistons there with
blocks<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.600> top<00:02:39.810> once<00:02:40.050> again<00:02:40.820> then<00:02:41.820> go<00:02:42.030> right

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
blocks on top once again then go right

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.270 
blocks on top once again then go right
to<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.540> front<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.020> place<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.560> line<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.070> blocks

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
to the front and place a line of blocks

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.030 
to the front and place a line of blocks
going<00:02:44.700> all<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.150> way<00:02:45.300> across<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.320> place

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
going all the way across here and place

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040 
going all the way across here and place
redstone<00:02:47.430> dust<00:02:47.910> right<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.450> way<00:02:48.540> across<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
redstone dust right the way across the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560 
redstone dust right the way across the
top<00:02:49.230> once<00:02:49.470> again<00:02:49.620> with<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> lever<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> side

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
top once again with a lever on the side

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.120 
top once again with a lever on the side
then<00:02:51.930> now<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.320> want<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.560> go<00:02:52.710> over<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.010> this

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
then now you want to go over to this

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.120 
then now you want to go over to this
side<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.580> place<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.570> repeater<00:02:54.840> facing<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:55.890> this

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
side and place a repeater facing in this

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.790 
side and place a repeater facing in this
direction<00:02:56.420> running<00:02:57.420> into<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> block<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.470> then

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
direction running into a block and then

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.410 
direction running into a block and then
you<00:02:58.860> want<00:02:59.010> another<00:02:59.370> half<00:02:59.670> slab<00:03:00.000> there

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
you want another half slab there

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.540 
you want another half slab there
we've<00:03:00.720> redstone<00:03:01.260> dust<00:03:01.470> running<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:02.010> like<00:03:02.280> that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
we've redstone dust running up like that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.390 
we've redstone dust running up like that
two<00:03:03.090> blocks<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.480> with<00:03:04.260> repeaters<00:03:04.770> set<00:03:05.190> both

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
two blocks here with repeaters set both

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.400 
two blocks here with repeaters set both
of<00:03:05.580> them<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.970> two<00:03:06.180> ticks<00:03:06.510> then<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.110> want<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.350> do

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
of them to two ticks then you want to do

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.140 
of them to two ticks then you want to do
the<00:03:07.560> same<00:03:07.770> thing<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.190> other<00:03:08.220> hand<00:03:08.550> side<00:03:08.820> so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the same thing on the other hand side so

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.800 
the same thing on the other hand side so
like<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.510> said<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.990> repeater<00:03:10.970> running<00:03:11.970> into<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
like I said a repeater running into a

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.130 
like I said a repeater running into a
block<00:03:13.710> up<00:03:14.070> like<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.790> then<00:03:15.510> another<00:03:15.990> half

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
block up like this and then another half

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.830 
block up like this and then another half
slab<00:03:16.650> right<00:03:16.890> there<00:03:17.490> weave<00:03:18.090> redstone<00:03:18.630> dust

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
slab right there weave redstone dust

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.840 
slab right there weave redstone dust
running<00:03:19.230> down<00:03:19.380> like<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.950> two<00:03:20.370> blocks<00:03:20.640> like

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
running down like that two blocks like

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.210 
running down like that two blocks like
this<00:03:21.060> and<00:03:21.300> repeaters<00:03:21.900> set<00:03:22.560> both<00:03:22.740> of<00:03:22.920> them<00:03:23.070> to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
this and repeaters set both of them to

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.730 
this and repeaters set both of them to
two<00:03:23.400> ticks<00:03:23.810> then<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.900> want<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.110> go<00:03:25.260> down<00:03:25.500> below

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
two ticks then you want to go down below

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.460 
two ticks then you want to go down below
and<00:03:26.250> place<00:03:26.520> a<00:03:26.760> block<00:03:27.090> down<00:03:27.450> here<00:03:27.959> with

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.810 
blocks here and on this side as well
then<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.800> want<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:49.980> repeat<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.370> same<00:03:50.580> thing

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
then you want to repeat the same thing

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.610 
then you want to repeat the same thing
on<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.030> other<00:03:51.060> side<00:03:51.420> so<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.810> is<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.200> block

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
on the other side so that is a block

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.370 
on the other side so that is a block
like<00:03:52.800> this<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.070> then<00:03:53.640> fill<00:03:53.970> out<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.300> area<00:03:54.600> so

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
like this and then fill out this area so

like that and the same thing on the
other<00:03:58.080> side<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.800> then<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.280> want<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.459> place

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
other side and then you want to place

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.490 
other side and then you want to place
your<00:03:59.790> redstone<00:04:00.209> dust<00:04:00.390> going<00:04:00.750> up<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.020> over<00:04:01.110> a

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
ticks on this one and then a repeater on

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.350 
ticks on this one and then a repeater on
this<00:04:07.230> side<00:04:07.440> with<00:04:08.010> your<00:04:08.250> blocks<00:04:08.520> on<00:04:08.790> either<00:04:09.030> end

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
this side with your blocks on either end

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.720 
this side with your blocks on either end
as<00:04:09.630> well<00:04:09.890> now<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.950> do<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.190> last<00:04:11.550> little

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
as well now to do that last little

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.610 
as well now to do that last little
element<00:04:12.209> is<00:04:12.330> very<00:04:12.420> simple<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.200> just<00:04:13.380> want<00:04:13.530> to

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
element is very simple you just want to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.420 
element is very simple you just want to
go<00:04:13.709> around<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:14.040> back

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
go around the back

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.460 
go around the back
place<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:14.970> redstone<00:04:15.209> torch<00:04:15.450> a<00:04:15.900> block<00:04:16.230> like<00:04:16.440> that

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
place a redstone torch a block like that

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.099 
place a redstone torch a block like that
and<00:04:16.890> a<00:04:16.950> block<00:04:17.280> up<00:04:17.489> like<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:17.970> run<00:04:18.540> redstone

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
and a block up like this run redstone

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.020 
and a block up like this run redstone
dust<00:04:19.290> into<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:20.040> block<00:04:20.280> there<00:04:20.580> with<00:04:21.000> a

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
dust into that block there with a

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.480 
dust into that block there with a
dropper<00:04:21.630> on<00:04:21.780> top<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.260> then<00:04:22.620> a<00:04:22.770> hopper<00:04:23.190> running

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
dropper on top and then a hopper running

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.250 
dropper on top and then a hopper running
into<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.880> top<00:04:24.090> of<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:24.479> then<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.020> need<00:04:25.169> to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
into the top of it and then you need to

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.510 
into the top of it and then you need to
place<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.620> non<00:04:25.890> stackable<00:04:26.490> item<00:04:26.880> in

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
place a non stackable item in

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.980 
place a non stackable item in
that<00:04:27.669> dropper<00:04:28.060> I'm<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.539> to<00:04:28.629> be<00:04:28.690> using<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
that dropper I'm going to be using a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.629 
that dropper I'm going to be using a
boat<00:04:29.169> because<00:04:29.349> I<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.919> them<00:04:30.160> then<00:04:30.370> you<00:04:30.460> want

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
boat because I like them then you want

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.089 
boat because I like them then you want
to<00:04:30.729> just<00:04:31.150> take<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.360> comparator<00:04:31.960> output<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.560> run

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:33.099 
to just take a comparator output and run

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:34.860 
to just take a comparator output and run
it<00:04:33.220> into<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:33.610> redstone<00:04:34.000> dust<00:04:34.300> here<00:04:34.449> then<00:04:34.810> you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
it into this redstone dust here then you

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.909 
it into this redstone dust here then you
want<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.050> repeat<00:04:35.319> the<00:04:35.410> same<00:04:35.440> thing<00:04:35.770> on<00:04:35.830> the

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
want to repeat the same thing on the

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:36.480 
want to repeat the same thing on the
other<00:04:35.979> side

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
other side

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.909 
other side
so<00:04:36.759> that's<00:04:36.909> redstone<00:04:37.330> dust<00:04:37.539> and<00:04:37.840> then<00:04:38.379> a<00:04:38.409> block

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
so that's redstone dust and then a block

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.020 
so that's redstone dust and then a block
up<00:04:39.129> like<00:04:39.460> this

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
up like this

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.450 
up like this
there's<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.840> dust<00:04:41.080> a<00:04:41.409> dropper<00:04:42.099> facing

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
there's the dust a dropper facing

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.610 
there's the dust a dropper facing
upwards<00:04:42.819> with<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.030> hopper<00:04:43.389> like<00:04:43.539> that<00:04:43.840> place

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
upwards with a hopper like that place

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.770 
upwards with a hopper like that place
any<00:04:44.919> old<00:04:45.129> item<00:04:45.460> into<00:04:45.669> your<00:04:45.789> dropper<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.270> then

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
any old item into your dropper and then
