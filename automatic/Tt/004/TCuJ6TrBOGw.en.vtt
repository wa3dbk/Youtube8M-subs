00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.150
 good 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.050
 now back for good companions 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.920
 after 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.860
 of many days of rain and bad weather 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.080
 I got it from got 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.510
 have that ratillo this morning 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.060
 what are you doing in this fabulous 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.090
 circuit that we have here in reus and 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.460
 good what I 'm going to do 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.720
 and more than anything the interest that faces 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.910
 a career that we have this end of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.130
 week 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 well one of the reasons and the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.210
 interest of d 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.550
 to try and finish is a bit of the subject 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.340
 to finish tuning the rossi nova 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.070
 the calf 2 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.760
 and then what I also had wanted 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.380
 do what 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.600
 repeat that with the time that we have 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.300
 taken for there has been no way is it 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.780
 finish rolling 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.539
 r 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.370
 another ninja that I have here and good in a 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.940
 principle as I told you in some video 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.059
 in fact bearings I 've put the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.909
 new player 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.220
 inside says a whole polish to the mirror 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.030
 which is called 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.760
 what is in the shirt the tears of 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.980
 the escape window is the pool and it 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.690
 I made them a little more marked and in the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.180
 crankshaft two tears also that has 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.190
 the side that channel's what the 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.900
 Well, well, I also finished them 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.100
 polish a little bit the lengthen the remark 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.310
 a little more equal there are four 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.110
 nonsense I'm curious then for 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.920
 see how you are going to see how food works 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.320
 after all, it's an engine that's good 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.240
 it does not need that you will arrive it is a 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.740
 magnificent engine ivÃ¡n well with what the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.080
 done well then I get good 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.510
 of motor work go well 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.360
 the idea itself is that agreement then 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.450
 first well good out from 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.530
 to steal the child leave it ready for 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 career 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.150
 from a more or less tuned point 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.220
 and to the fact the shooting then 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.770
 we want to ride the other ninja and 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.590
 we'll look good then to see how it goes 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.300
 I always have the box and put the new 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.370
 rossi as the second engine or simply 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.950
 I'm still half civility 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.170
 Clean the subway then good to leave it like 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.300
 second motor agree and good give you 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.819
 a little bit if it's that for companies 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.100
 but I'm going to do different stretches of 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.380
 video and see a bit the process to see 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.380
 how he behaves according to this hour
