this is a really nice case and in his
dual<00:00:14.969> layer<00:00:15.240> meaning<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.809> has<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> inner

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
dual layer meaning it has the inner

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.310 
dual layer meaning it has the inner
silicon<00:00:16.859> layer<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.730> outer<00:00:18.029> hard<00:00:18.720> plastic

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.870 
look and feel on the backs of the hard
plastic<00:00:24.840> that's<00:00:25.320> pretty<00:00:25.590> smooth<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.130> inside

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
plastic that's pretty smooth and inside

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.099 
plastic that's pretty smooth and inside
you<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> rubber<00:00:27.420> which<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.869> still

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
you have the rubber which is still

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.750 
you have the rubber which is still
grippy<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:28.949> gives<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.250> lot<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.369> corner

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
grippy but gives you a lot of corner

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.609 
grippy but gives you a lot of corner
protection<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.660> lot<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.900> shock<00:00:31.170> absorption

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
protection and a lot of shock absorption

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.830 
protection and a lot of shock absorption
if<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.040> were<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.340> drop<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.120> any<00:00:33.540> type<00:00:33.809> of

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
if you were to drop this on any type of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.410 
if you were to drop this on any type of
material<00:00:34.340> but<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.489> course<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.910> case<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.210> more

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
material but of course this case is more

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.880 
material but of course this case is more
than<00:00:36.570> just<00:00:36.809> protection<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.559> also<00:00:37.710> has

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
than just protection it also has

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
than just protection it also has
complete<00:00:38.190> access<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.969> camera<00:00:39.360> cutout<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
complete access to the camera cutout and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
complete access to the camera cutout and
the<00:00:39.960> flash<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.950> also<00:00:41.070> says<00:00:41.370> autofocus

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the flash it also says autofocus

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.700

underneath<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.750> I'm<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.230> sure<00:00:43.469> why

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
underneath that I'm not really sure why

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.229 
underneath that I'm not really sure why
I<00:00:43.739> wish<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> wasn't<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:44.850> not<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
I wish it wasn't but it's not really a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
I wish it wasn't but it's not really a
big<00:00:45.420> deal<00:00:45.570> at<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.870> underneath<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.190> have

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
big deal at all underneath that we have

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.670 
big deal at all underneath that we have
a<00:00:47.399> nice<00:00:47.640> cutout<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.239> our<00:00:48.360> speaker<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:48.930> well<00:00:49.469> as

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
a nice cutout for our speaker as well as

a nice cutout for our speaker as well as
a<00:00:49.739> small<00:00:50.309> speaking<00:00:50.579> logo<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.390> still

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
a small speaking logo that I think still

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.779 
a small speaking logo that I think still
adds<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> good<00:00:52.469> books<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.160> case<00:00:53.460> now

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.859 
texture on the front we have a nice lay
on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> table<00:01:29.280> design<00:01:29.490> which<00:01:30.360> means<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
on the table design which means that you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.359 
on the table design which means that you
set<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> facedown<00:01:31.380> or<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> were<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.159> drop

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
set it facedown or if you were to drop

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.490 
set it facedown or if you were to drop
it<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> front<00:01:32.880> you're<00:01:33.420> likely<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.780> avoid

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
it on the front you're likely to avoid

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.499 
it on the front you're likely to avoid
any<00:01:34.770> scratches<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.610> any<00:01:35.850> dents<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.360> your

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
any scratches or any dents on your

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.719 
any scratches or any dents on your
screen<00:01:36.840> including<00:01:37.259> cracks<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.520> looks

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
screen including cracks so this looks

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.740 
screen including cracks so this looks
like<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> will<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> nice<00:01:39.390> job<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.659> absorbing

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
like it will do a nice job of absorbing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
like it will do a nice job of absorbing
those<00:01:40.259> shocks<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.790> conclusion<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.509> is

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
those shocks so in conclusion this is

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.870 
those shocks so in conclusion this is
basically<00:01:43.049> an<00:01:43.229> otterbox<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.189> more<00:01:44.369> stylish
