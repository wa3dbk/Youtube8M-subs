00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 and that to him to all these mysteries of 1993 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.740
 and this time in this video are only 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.990
 not see for a genilem test all that 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.190
 but mostly for a slight problem that 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.679
 I noticed on some games 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.109
 particular steam on counter strike on 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.590
 precisely on the primal carnage game or 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.970
 still chivalry a game that is who and 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.170
 on steam or getting dressed eating eu 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.760
 still this problem on steam games 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.750
 as we can see here it's a game 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.789
 I bought not so long ago 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 that they in less 66% that costs 5 euros 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 on steam which is primal carnage that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.430
 I bought there was eight minutes ago 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.130
 we can see here 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.630
 finally I had ten minutes of play because I 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.520
 will show you right away 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.510
 go see it's going 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.520
 some people have seen the way in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 it is certainly a small live cd mini 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.289
 curling to say I have a configuration 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 pretty powerful of my pc in pc can that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.320
 rotate all the ultra games so 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.750
 did not think it was my 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.059
 configuration that shit is not no 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 more and updates on live x is at 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.750
 day my graphics cards but drivers 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.180
 graphics are up to date everything is up to date 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.280
 its paying a bug of the game that is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.660
 very easy to correct so I showed 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.369
 still a little example we go I 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.780
 am going to launch primal carnage and you're going 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.460
 see when I started to move my 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.830
 mouse is going to see very very very big 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 lag I show you right now that in 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 fraps right now and do not see again in 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.530
 premium at 15h to reject months 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 for the lotto of fps on the left I hurt 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.030
 managed my shot if the bear not too serious 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.650
 and so here I do not move we smile 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.470
 so the game is fluid 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.800
 it turns in maximum 30 fps we can see 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.990
 that the game turns as if 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.920
 as if I played very well from the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.240
 moment when you go to see that I'm going 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.510
 turn mac os the concert blues me 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.160
 smiled it'll go down to 15 fps that 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.320
 already goes down from ten places will say that's 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.840
 normal but in the eyes of the dinosaurs he 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.910
 there are moons there that do not type here 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.130
 when you played a fps example or 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.660
 a game where you need to do some 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.550
 abrupt movements to avoid 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.170
 or whatever else that 's all 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.910
 simply unplayable you have a little 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.140
 little restless lodge for nothing I will you 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.460
 show how to solve this little problem 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.750
 we'll find ourselves on strike it's still 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.650
 once to show you that the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.720
 problem well settled right away 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.790
 here is re on the keyboard so what are we going 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.170
 to actually do it works for games 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.030
 official and unofficial 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.270
 so after just know little 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.520
 near how to do so you have the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.170
 how to say we 're not going we'll take a 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.480
 official game is a young official we are going 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.750
 take it from the age of so tacc 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.340
 empires afp the empire leaders like you 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.910
 want to be there to test this game on the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.740
 chain so this one and not finally and no 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.360
 officials as you can see the 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.970
 root is not at all the same c 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.800
 program files then hf empire added 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.000
 we can make a king guide open 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.650
 the location of the file from the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.650
 moment it is necessary to find the point ex of the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.640
 game of which to say the launcher the file 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.130
 which allows to launch the game 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.480
 that's the most important thing 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.090
 usually for young officials 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.459
 it is found directly in the in 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.989
 the program file or for games 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.330
 Officials it is found directly 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.630
 in the steam folder who is who and who 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.250
 love primal carnage after if you 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.620
 do not know how to be in cbd luis I believe 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.180
 win32 after that depends on your game but 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.880
 I know to primer for primal carnage 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.500
 it's here here are two are from the 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.670
 moment you have the game shortcut 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.070
 whose office is all you 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.209
 have more important now this 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.580
 we're going to do is right click on 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.920
 the game on the shortcut the game flying 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.410
 property valley and to settle in 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.160
 do this little little cilag we'll be in 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 compatibility 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.209
 we will run the program in 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.870
 compatibility and we will put it in mode 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:36.290
 xp pac-3 service pack 3 did 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.239
 apply is ok here to share this 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.470
 moment there do not ask me how that 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.810
 works I have not been in the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.280
 colleges to see where the bug was coming from 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.819
 I will try to find that then put you 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.260
 in commentary in the video is 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.370
 now from that moment on 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.959
 when you're starting my game he goes 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.270
 many already much less the war 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.000
 I send back fraps and I show you to 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.080
 what a point it is this technique is 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.080
 great at 38 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.940
 this is re and so here I am going to move 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.980
 my mouse I can select in the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.239
 menu all I want the game did it 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.459
 that pouic 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.690
 so in fact I have not really yet I 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.209
 thought it was already an hour since I 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.430
 look why that 's what I did 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.079
 still not found for you all come 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.310
 where did the soft butter come from and there I 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.380
 move my mouse well as it should 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.630
 the circ ex mouth still as much but we 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.770
 can choose our we can choose the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.910
 part we want to see that there is 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.160
 no lag 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.950
 the game is fluid and yet I have 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.880
 put the graphics really thoroughly I 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.950
 can show you 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.180
 So here are the tickets of in fullscreen 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.830
 appeal makes it strikes 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.919
 six films or no question of 2.2 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.620
 how to say of the hospital known for the 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.050
 youtuber everyone does as he wants but 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.280
 I'm doing it I'm doing it in 2560x 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.390
 1600 all the qualities so high at 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.310
 maximum from the moment you have 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.289
 a good configuration it should be very 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.780
 worked well from the moment that 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.669
 the game still relates mellac all the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.930
 time it means that if the game where 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.310
 all the time that means you actually 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.750
 when you move to move and 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.150
 your salad mouse when you 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.260
 to stay like that that lag we want is 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.729
 to play that lag 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.139
 there it will not come from those of this problem 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.190
 there it is simply that your pc 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.229
 is not powerful enough to make 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.910
 turn the game so at that moment there 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.979
 either you buy a powerful pc with 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.490
 a graphics card and all that or either 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.479
 it can come from your 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.690
 antivirus your other two of your 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.539
 of your vegetable rap song from your 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.599
 go on fire go in the fire and 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.680
 uncheck the block all this was going to get 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.090
 should play because it's too much 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.160
 easy to do in you have fire anpara 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.930
 you uncheck the box that unlocked 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.759
 unlock everything he says is blocked 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.900
 any name announcement should set the 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.990
 problem but if the problem should not be 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.780
 settle that just comes from a put 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.389
 up to date or while your game is running 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.669
 with a direct x that is not the right one 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.740
 it takes me personally my game 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:59.080
 runs with direct x 9 because my 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.289
 graphics cards are made for 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.639
 operate media x 920 the computer 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.090
 notebook we have a French law has 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.340
 complicated to understand but if 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.479
 you have a fixed pc and you have 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.800
 voted the possibility of putting your 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.500
 graphics card my graphics driver and 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.509
 the same all your pilots to date this 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.490
 can also come this the fact that your 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:20.560
 Driver is outdated ve the game 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.569
 can very sincerely war after 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.099
 again if you have a game no 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:28.509
 official sometimes it is possible that 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.539
 some lines of coding in the in 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:33.159
 a crash makes the game lag and there this 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.199
 moment we can not do anything at all 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:37.630
 bought up but apart from that we can not 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.520
 absolutely nothing or before 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.259
 an update of the game and I know myself 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.099
 went to see m days and one last thing 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.940
 I forgot what I wanted to boil 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.639
 any more 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.380
 ah yes so in steam is a 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.639
 possibility that steam 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.340
 once they do an update 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:56.620
 or download files or 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.110
 installs me your game the install badly or 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.449
 forget some files what can 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.249
 as well 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.219
 how to say do it squarely crash is 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:07.020
 judged after a certain time or August 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:08.729
 that kind of stuff at that moment so 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.830
 it should be considered that right click on 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:13.349
 your on your game for example there there is 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.509
 housed primal carnage primetime game 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:17.490
 I'm doing a bigger one so I'm going 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:19.169
 browse and local files and I him 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.460
 request to check all caches and to 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.050
 that moment he will check all my 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.249
 games everywhere but I he has just effect 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.110
 all the game folders that I'm going 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:26.879
 go away and he'll see if the 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.919
 download and properly installed all 

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:30.509
 files a parent so that also allows 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.749
 sometimes that some files anyway 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:35.490
 go to install or who are who are 

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:38.639
 as it looks like they're clogged or 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.930
 other and who also ford the game if 

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:41.249
 again not here you still have 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.689
 lakes down there I think it comes 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:43.919
 squarely your graphics card a couac 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:47.189
 albert it's not powerful enough for 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.719
 rotate your game and you go 

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:50.789
 say buy a powerful pc 

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:52.710
 so here I hope this toyal country has you 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:53.849
 rained and you have been the case if we 

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.409
 can leave a little green thumb and where 

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:57.599
 a comment and share the video 

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:58.680
 it is at your convenience of course and 

00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:00.330
 that you can subscribe to the chain 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.259
 of the dmn so as not to miss anything on this 

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.089
 month I tell you very soon a 

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:05.460
 new video we will surely find 

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:08.520
 on a test of the primal carnage game or 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.629
 primal carnage content besides and on 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.629
