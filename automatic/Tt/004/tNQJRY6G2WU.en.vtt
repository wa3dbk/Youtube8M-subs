00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
directly bumpers be moved down so it's

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.830 
directly bumpers be moved down so it's
more<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.840> line<00:01:49.049> with<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.479> straight

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
more in line with so this is straight

more in line with so this is straight
drop<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> down<00:01:52.710> just<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.040> little<00:01:53.189> bit<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
drop it down just a little bit not that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.010 
drop it down just a little bit not that
you<00:01:54.509> Tamia<00:01:54.810> drop<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> down<00:01:55.770> towards<00:01:56.189> more

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
you Tamia drop it down towards more

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.480 
you Tamia drop it down towards more
perfectly<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.200> line<00:01:58.229> impact<00:01:58.920> lie<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
perfectly in line impact lie to the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.770 
perfectly in line impact lie to the
frame

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
frame

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
frame
so<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.500> well<00:02:01.650> did<00:02:01.860> install<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.580> frame

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so we well did install it to the frame

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.390 
so we well did install it to the frame
and<00:02:03.420> then<00:02:03.479> would<00:02:03.630> take<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.229> figure<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.310> out

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
and then would take I figure it out

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.540 
and then would take I figure it out
already<00:02:05.580> i'll<00:02:05.820> cut<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.210> cross<00:02:06.570> here<00:02:07.369> do<00:02:08.369> away

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
already i'll cut this cross here do away

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520 
already i'll cut this cross here do away
with<00:02:08.580> all<00:02:08.850> that<00:02:09.090> i'll<00:02:09.750> leave<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.110> bumper
