when you're not using them that's the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.570 
when you're not using them that's the
best<00:01:22.200> thing<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:25.580> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
best thing that you can do now the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.179 
best thing that you can do now the
battery<00:01:27.000> because<00:01:27.840> visual<00:01:28.409> land<00:01:28.650> wanted<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
battery because visual land wanted a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.020 
battery because visual land wanted a
light<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.229> small<00:01:31.229> tablet<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:32.310> had<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.670> put<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
light and small tablet they had to put a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.719 
light and small tablet they had to put a
light<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> small<00:01:34.140> battery<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
light and small battery in there and I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.490 
light and small battery in there and I
understand<00:01:36.150> why<00:01:36.299> they<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.600> why<00:01:36.930> they<00:01:37.110> had<00:01:37.259> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
understand why they had why they had to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.140 
understand why they had why they had to
make<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.070> compromise<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.820> that's<00:01:38.970> what

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
make that compromise but that's what

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.819 
make that compromise but that's what
this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> all<00:01:39.509> about<00:01:39.540> trade-offs<00:01:40.130> so<00:01:42.799> one<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
this is all about trade-offs so one of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.200 
this is all about trade-offs so one of
the<00:01:44.009> things<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.490> will<00:01:44.640> notice<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
the things that you will notice is that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.270 
the things that you will notice is that
even<00:01:45.600> though<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.200> battery<00:01:46.560> life<00:01:46.740> goes<00:01:47.100> down

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
even though the battery life goes down

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.510 
even though the battery life goes down
quickly<00:01:47.899> for<00:01:48.899> example<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.409> standby<00:01:49.950> it'll<00:01:50.369> go

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
quickly for example on standby it'll go

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.660 
quickly for example on standby it'll go
down<00:01:50.549> about<00:01:50.899> 1.5<00:01:51.899> percent<00:01:52.350> every<00:01:52.470> hour<00:01:53.159> if

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
down about 1.5 percent every hour if

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.130 
down about 1.5 percent every hour if
you're<00:01:53.850> watching<00:01:54.000> Netflix<00:01:54.540> it'll<00:01:54.780> go<00:01:54.869> around

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you're watching Netflix it'll go around

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.690 
you're watching Netflix it'll go around
down<00:01:55.680> somewhere<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> neighborhood<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
down somewhere in the neighborhood of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.660 
down somewhere in the neighborhood of
forty<00:01:57.329> forty<00:01:57.689> five<00:01:57.869> percent<00:01:57.899> per<00:01:58.500> hour
