want<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.380> handle<00:02:29.890> just<00:02:30.700> shy<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
want that handle just shy of the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.449 
want that handle just shy of the
shoulder<00:02:31.930> but<00:02:32.350> for<00:02:32.590> double<00:02:32.740> unders<00:02:33.190> you

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
shoulder but for double unders you

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.540 
shoulder but for double unders you
actually<00:02:33.820> want<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.240> about<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.080> nipple<00:02:35.410> line

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
actually want it about the nipple line

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.760 
actually want it about the nipple line
shorter<00:02:36.550> rope<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> faster<00:02:37.480> rope<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.650> if

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
shorter rope is a faster rope so if

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.080 
shorter rope is a faster rope so if
you've<00:02:38.890> never<00:02:39.070> jumped<00:02:39.459> with<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.640> shorter<00:02:39.970> rope

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
you've never jumped with a shorter rope

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.080 
you've never jumped with a shorter rope
that's<00:02:40.360> something<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.810> consider<00:02:41.250> okay<00:02:42.250> but

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that's something to consider okay but

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.760 
that's something to consider okay but
for<00:02:43.390> now<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:43.570> want<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.080> work<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.380> swinging

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
for now we want to just work on swinging

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.890 
for now we want to just work on swinging
to<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.820> side<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:48.300> that's<00:02:49.300> going<00:02:49.480> to<00:02:49.630> involve

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
to the side and that's going to involve

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.860 
to the side and that's going to involve
two<00:02:50.380> quick<00:02:50.770> rotations<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.700> succession

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
two quick rotations in succession

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.670 
two quick rotations in succession
you<00:02:53.650> might<00:02:53.860> hear<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.190> snap<00:02:54.730> snap

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
you might hear a snap snap

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.110 
you might hear a snap snap
one<00:02:57.310> two<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.470> all<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.739> force<00:03:00.099> is<00:03:00.730> coming<00:03:00.879> from

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
one two so all the force is coming from

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.520 
one two so all the force is coming from
the<00:03:01.269> wrists<00:03:01.480> she's<00:03:01.720> stabilizing<00:03:02.200> at<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
the wrists she's stabilizing at the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.930 
the wrists she's stabilizing at the
shoulder<00:03:02.980> snap<00:03:03.310> snap<00:03:03.459> snap<00:03:03.610> snap<00:03:04.180> snap<00:03:05.170> snap

that's<00:03:06.940> our<00:03:07.209> second<00:03:08.019> drill<00:03:08.170> we<00:03:08.290> need<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.530> get

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
that's our second drill we need to get

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.699 
that's our second drill we need to get
that<00:03:08.830> wrist<00:03:09.430> circumduction<00:03:09.879> down<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.810> we

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
that wrist circumduction down and we

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.890 
that wrist circumduction down and we
need<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.129> it<00:03:12.280> with<00:03:12.459> the<00:03:12.760> non-dominant<00:03:13.629> hand

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
need to do it with the non-dominant hand

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.530 
need to do it with the non-dominant hand
one<00:03:14.500> two<00:03:14.709> one<00:03:15.549> two<00:03:15.690> one<00:03:16.690> two<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:17.260> one<00:03:17.920> two<00:03:18.540> okay

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
one two one two one two and one two okay

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.140 
one two one two one two and one two okay
so<00:03:19.599> if<00:03:20.110> we<00:03:20.470> find<00:03:20.739> that<00:03:20.980> both<00:03:21.220> arms<00:03:21.849> are<00:03:21.970> not

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
so if we find that both arms are not

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.780 
so if we find that both arms are not
contributing<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.349> same<00:03:23.560> degree<00:03:23.739> we<00:03:24.579> grab

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
contributing to the same degree we grab

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.030 
contributing to the same degree we grab
the<00:03:25.000> wrist<00:03:25.150> trainer<00:03:25.590> we'll<00:03:26.590> just<00:03:26.769> do<00:03:26.860> this

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
the wrist trainer we'll just do this

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.119 
the wrist trainer we'll just do this
very<00:03:27.159> quickly<00:03:27.489> so<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.819> can<00:03:27.970> see<00:03:28.209> it<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.530> we

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
very quickly so you can see it and we

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.119 
very quickly so you can see it and we
grab<00:03:30.370> one<00:03:30.609> in<00:03:30.760> each<00:03:30.879> hand<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:32.010> Shawna<00:03:33.010> is

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
grab one in each hand and Shawna is

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.479 
grab one in each hand and Shawna is
right<00:03:33.489> dominant<00:03:34.769> and<00:03:35.769> she<00:03:36.010> might<00:03:36.190> just

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
right dominant and she might just

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.729 
right dominant and she might just
exaggerate<00:03:37.329> the<00:03:37.989> degree<00:03:38.349> to<00:03:38.560> which<00:03:39.390> her<00:03:40.390> right

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
exaggerate the degree to which her right

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.910 
exaggerate the degree to which her right
is<00:03:41.739> more<00:03:42.040> proficient<00:03:42.400> than<00:03:42.760> her<00:03:42.940> left<00:03:43.920> she's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
is more proficient than her left she's

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.610 
is more proficient than her left she's
actually<00:03:45.099> proficient<00:03:45.730> on<00:03:45.790> both<00:03:46.000> sides<00:03:46.299> but

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
actually proficient on both sides but

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.640 
actually proficient on both sides but
this<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.799> for<00:03:47.980> illustration<00:03:48.640> purposes<00:03:49.120> only

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
this is for illustration purposes only

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.199 
this is for illustration purposes only
so<00:03:50.650> you'd<00:03:50.829> grab<00:03:51.040> those<00:03:51.190> wrist<00:03:51.430> trainers<00:03:51.879> and

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
so you'd grab those wrist trainers and

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.710 
so you'd grab those wrist trainers and
do<00:03:52.420> some<00:03:52.659> drills<00:03:53.519> either<00:03:54.519> with<00:03:54.790> both<00:03:55.000> or<00:03:55.329> just

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
do some drills either with both or just

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.960 
do some drills either with both or just
with<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.049> non-dominant<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:57.250> get<00:03:57.430> yourself<00:03:57.790> up

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
with the non-dominant to get yourself up

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.860 
with the non-dominant to get yourself up
to<00:03:58.120> speed

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
to speed

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.199 
to speed
awesome<00:04:01.000> okay<00:04:02.000> then<00:04:02.180> we<00:04:02.299> go<00:04:02.330> back<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:03.260> rope

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
awesome okay then we go back to the rope

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.930 
awesome okay then we go back to the rope
and<00:04:05.209> now<00:04:05.450> we're<00:04:05.659> going<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:05.870> swing<00:04:06.140> to<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.290> side

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
and now we're going to swing to the side

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.910 
and now we're going to swing to the side
and<00:04:08.019> jump<00:04:09.019> and<00:04:09.950> see<00:04:10.940> if<00:04:11.060> we<00:04:11.180> can<00:04:11.360> get<00:04:11.920> two

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
and jump and see if we can get two

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.850 
and jump and see if we can get two
rotations<00:04:13.730> before<00:04:14.450> our<00:04:14.659> feet<00:04:14.930> land<00:04:15.230> that's

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
rotations before our feet land that's

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.949 
rotations before our feet land that's
what<00:04:16.070> we're<00:04:16.190> working<00:04:16.370> towards<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:17.810> you'll

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959

notice<00:04:18.139> she's<00:04:18.440> going<00:04:18.709> straight<00:04:18.739> up<00:04:19.459> it's<00:04:19.729> like

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880

neither<00:04:32.510> is<00:04:32.810> efficient<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:35.169> now<00:04:36.169> we're<00:04:36.530> going

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
neither is efficient and now we're going

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.460 
neither is efficient and now we're going
to<00:04:36.770> go<00:04:36.889> ahead<00:04:37.039> and<00:04:37.490> put<00:04:38.300> all<00:04:38.570> those<00:04:39.260> elements
