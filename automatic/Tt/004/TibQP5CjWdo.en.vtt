00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.080
 victory of the elche by 1 to 0 against 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.000
 real valladolid a victory that added 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.889
 the 0 to 0 of the first leg makes the 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.959
 team franjiverde pass rounds 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.110
 in the round of 16 where he will face 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.970
 FC Barcelona started strong stronger 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.679
 local team with that shot from the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.410
 front of adrián that is just dani 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.210
 hernandez 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.070
 it was just a warning of what was going to 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.670
 happen shortly after 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.789
 in this play they combine jonatás and 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.950
 christian herrera cristian hides her 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.200
 associated with corocoro returns it to 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.240
 cristian and the canary leaves her behind to 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.130
 the shot of adrián 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.470
 Dani Hernández gets to play but the 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.260
 ball sneaks minute 7 marked the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.110
 elche 1 to 0 was going to be the only goal in 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.330
 180 minutes of playoff a goal with 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.470
 much controversy since in the 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.870
 moment when I run it is delivered to 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.320
 cristian herrera the canary player is 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.320
 in offside 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.580
 after dialing the first one he followed 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.430
 looking for the rival goal the elche that 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.699
 could score in this header from 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.699
 pellegrini 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.280
 they were good times for the team 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 local who was looking for a way to get back on track 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.540
 the eliminator another approximation to 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.490
 charge of xc of herrera with that shot 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.500
 that finally did not catch thread and it 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.080
 diverted little by little however 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.590
 the real valladolid was going to give samples of 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.900
 recovery after fitting 1 to 0 yet 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.720
 in the first part and in the second 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.920
 to be far superior to the local team here 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.080
 We have the first approximation of 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.530
 match for good rugby guys 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.030
 connection between timor and oscar day whose 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.270
 shot goes over the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.270
 crossbar 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.670
 in this way finished the first part already 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.680
 in the second 45 minutes he entered 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.570
 blond value and the real valladolid gave a 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.730
 step to the front was far superior to elche 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.520
 and accumulated merits more than enough 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.680
 to at least have marked this is the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.600
 first approximation of the second part 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.720
 the center of zaccaría berdych and the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.610
 header that drew Titón 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.860
 the goalkeeper with the conceded by the weight 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.490
 vendo ven was the great figure of the party 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.260
 for the elche soccer club he was very 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.090
 sure in the second part when more 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.830
 squeezed the valladolid here we have a 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.080
 jeffren list 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.800
 that blocks without problems the international 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.800
 polish tito na 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.970
 and another of the pucelano team one against 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.430
 book one against cathedral in a 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.439
 excellent pass from jeffrén pisa omar area 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.599
 and the hard shot of the canary what 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.739
 palm tree corder titón with another 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.739
 fine intervention 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.160
 little by little ruby was making changes 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.319
 to give it even more mordant 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.790
 offensive to his team coming from the 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.069
 bench added to the shock in the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.780
 second part the Colombian Mojica and 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.700
 oscar gonzález 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.830
 in the same way and seeing that he lost the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.530
 control of the situation escrivá made 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.330
 changes in the second 45 minutes it 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.270
 they entered faisal sash 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.730
 víctor rodríguez and already in the final stretch 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.690
 pass beats in replacement of the injured 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.690
 pedro mosquera 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.350
 there we have precisely mosqueda 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.230
 hurting himself in a very strange move 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.960
 appears in the lower area of the image 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.490
 we see as mosquera very far from the 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.290
 action very far from the play very 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.190
 away from the ball ends up on the ground 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.020
 taking the hand to the knee 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.520
 bad feelings for pedro mosquera 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.830
 that he left the field precipitously 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.940
 leaving his place to pasalic in the 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.400
 last minutes of the shock and the 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.200
 Valladolid was overturned looking for the 1 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.410
 to 1 result that also would have given 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.000
 the pass because the goal away from home the 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.410
 double value of the visiting goals 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 would have made any tie with 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.640
 goals put the rugby in the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.080
 next round and now I had timor with 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.080
 that shot to pieces 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.490
 and here even he got to mark the 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.470
 Real Valladolid did would lift 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.090
 berdych but the referee invalidated the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.440
 action out of play and with good 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.380
 criterion since the footballer 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.400
 Moroccan is ahead when he gets 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.400
 the pass or more bouquets 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.919
 and already the desperate practically the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.169
 last of the party this center of omar 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.620
 topped by oscar 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.510
 gonzález 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.370
 the valladolid felt damaged not 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.660
 only by the action of the goal by the outside 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.400
 of game in action of the goal but with a 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.440
 possible expulsion of christian herrera 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.139
 who did not understand in that way the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.370
 referee and that ended up putting of the 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.570
 nerves to timor that insists the 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.810
 protests in the final stretch of the match 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.760
 and was sent off at the end with this 1-0 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.350
 with the lonely goal of adrián in 180 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.370
 minutes the elche is in eighth 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.370
 end of the king's cup
