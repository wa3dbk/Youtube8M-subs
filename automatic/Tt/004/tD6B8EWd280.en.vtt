00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
now you need to do like I did tape it on

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:27.010 
now you need to do like I did tape it on
all<00:01:17.990> four<00:01:18.990> sides<00:01:22.880> okay<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.740> need<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.070> like

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
all four sides okay and you need to like

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
all four sides okay and you need to like
make<00:01:28.020> tape<00:01:28.470> into<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.369> circle<00:01:30.299> thing<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.939> put<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
make tape into a circle thing and put it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.630 
make tape into a circle thing and put it
on<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> middle<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.770> has<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> be<00:01:35.220> duct<00:01:35.460> tape

on the middle and it has to be duct tape

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.819 
on the middle and it has to be duct tape
because<00:01:35.939> regular<00:01:36.420> tape<00:01:36.659> obviously<00:01:37.439> won't<00:01:37.590> let

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
because regular tape obviously won't let
