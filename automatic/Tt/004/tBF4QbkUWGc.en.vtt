we've<00:02:47.590> outlined<00:02:47.890> in<00:02:48.040> previous<00:02:48.310> episodes<00:02:48.430> how

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
we've outlined in previous episodes how

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.400 
we've outlined in previous episodes how
simple<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.450> get<00:02:49.570> rid<00:02:49.690> of<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:49.990> how

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
simple that is to get rid of and how

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.980 
simple that is to get rid of and how
pointless<00:02:50.890> it<00:02:51.010> is<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:52.270> I<00:02:52.330> say<00:02:52.510> dead<00:02:52.690> simple<00:02:52.900> to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
pointless it is as I say dead simple to

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.020 
pointless it is as I say dead simple to
get<00:02:53.080> off<00:02:53.200> just<00:02:53.380> implies<00:02:53.650> snip<00:02:53.950> there<00:02:54.130> spin<00:02:54.910> off

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
get off just implies snip there spin off
