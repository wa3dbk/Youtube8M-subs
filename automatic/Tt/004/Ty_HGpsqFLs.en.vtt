00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
could go and wind some sticky tape

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.770 
could go and wind some sticky tape
around<00:00:49.920> there<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.960> want<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> be

terminal the problem is the back part is
so<00:01:14.130> incredibly<00:01:14.939> thick<00:01:15.470> well<00:01:17.930> canon<00:01:18.930> ma<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.799> mean

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
so incredibly thick well canon ma I mean

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.380 
so incredibly thick well canon ma I mean
kenton<00:01:21.320> must<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.530> done<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
kenton must have done that with a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.270 
kenton must have done that with a
purpose<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> don't<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
purpose so I don't want to put in one of

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.319 
purpose so I don't want to put in one of
those<00:01:26.520> speaker<00:01:27.420> terminals<00:01:28.610> because<00:01:29.610> well

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
those speaker terminals because well

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.630 
those speaker terminals because well
this<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.689> even<00:01:30.840> has<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.110> hole<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:32.369> as

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
this one even has a hole in it but as

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
this one even has a hole in it but as
you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.450> all<00:01:33.630> made<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> really

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you can see this is all made of really

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.060 
you can see this is all made of really
thin<00:01:34.680> plastic<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.290> basically<00:01:37.560> make<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
thin plastic and so you basically make a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.810 
thin plastic and so you basically make a
big<00:01:38.369> hole<00:01:38.400> into<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.270> back<00:01:39.869> part<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.619> just

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
big hole into the back part and just

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.700 
big hole into the back part and just
cover<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.150> with<00:01:42.180> some<00:01:42.600> thin<00:01:42.960> plastic<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
cover it up with some thin plastic and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.429 
cover it up with some thin plastic and
that's<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.070> course<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.369> stupid<00:01:44.820> solution<00:01:45.439> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that's of course a stupid solution so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.499 
that's of course a stupid solution so
what<00:01:46.890> I'm<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.980 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
drill<00:01:48.780> two<00:01:49.140> holes<00:01:49.170> into<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> back<00:01:50.340> part<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
drill two holes into the back part and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.420 
drill two holes into the back part and
into<00:01:51.990> those<00:01:52.170> holes<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> stick

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
into those holes I'm going to stick

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.300 
into those holes I'm going to stick
these<00:01:54.409> these<00:01:55.409> are<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.890> usual<00:01:56.750> plugs<00:01:57.920> for<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
these these are just usual plugs for a

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.920 
these these are just usual plugs for a
single<00:01:59.909> lead<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:00.960> into<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.689> going<00:02:03.689> to

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
single lead go into there and going to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.920 
single lead go into there and going to
put<00:02:04.200> those<00:02:04.409> into<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.950> holes<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.719> that<00:02:06.719> will

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
put those into the holes and that will

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.540 
put those into the holes and that will
be<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.320> new<00:02:08.030> speaker<00:02:09.030> connection<00:02:09.690> terminal

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
be the new speaker connection terminal

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.410 
be the new speaker connection terminal
and<00:02:11.569> here<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.660> have<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.050> two

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
and here we have the two

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.830 
and here we have the two

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
hold that we are going to need this hole

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.920 
hold that we are going to need this hole
is<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.620> hole<00:02:18.099> where<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.610> cable<00:02:19.360> originally

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
is the hole where the cable originally

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.320 
is the hole where the cable originally
went<00:02:20.319> through<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.870> could<00:02:23.050> you<00:02:23.200> reuse<00:02:23.950> that

grilled now unfortunately I should have

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.140 
grilled now unfortunately I should have
made<00:02:31.420> a<00:02:31.450> test<00:02:31.810> before<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.340> diameter<00:02:33.850> of<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
made a test before the diameter of the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.650 
made a test before the diameter of the
hole<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.569> slightly<00:02:34.870> too<00:02:35.200> big<00:02:35.230> cuz<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:36.660> jacks

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
hole to slightly too big cuz the jacks

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.559 
hole to slightly too big cuz the jacks
are<00:02:37.840> just<00:02:38.050> sitting<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.440> their<00:02:38.650> loose<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.569> I

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
are just sitting in their loose and I

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.040 
are just sitting in their loose and I
originally<00:02:41.080> intended<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.599> diameter

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
originally intended to have the diameter

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.490 
originally intended to have the diameter
so<00:02:44.410> small<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:45.660> either<00:02:46.660> have<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.140> use<00:02:47.470> a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
so small that you either have to use a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.940 
so small that you either have to use a
hammer<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.030> get<00:02:49.030> them<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.390> there<00:02:49.630> or<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.560> have

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
hammer to get them in there or you have

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.490 
hammer to get them in there or you have
to<00:02:51.130> screw<00:02:51.459> them<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.959> now<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:54.269> got<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.500> get

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
to screw them in so now I got to get

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.259 
to screw them in so now I got to get
something<00:02:57.190> else<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:58.000> fix<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.810> and<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:01.150> is

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
something else to fix that and here is

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.130 
something else to fix that and here is
the<00:03:01.420> solution<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.200> problem<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.760> is<00:03:04.140> some

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
the solution to the problem this is some

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.210 
the solution to the problem this is some
really<00:03:05.769> really<00:03:06.220> really<00:03:07.000> hard<00:03:07.450> glue<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.890> a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
really really really hard glue it's a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.080 
really really really hard glue it's a
two-component<00:03:10.120> affair<00:03:11.049> you<00:03:11.769> have<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.280> sort

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
two-component affair you have this sort

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.229 
two-component affair you have this sort
of<00:03:13.239> dust<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:16.980> stuff<00:03:17.980> here<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.549> mix<00:03:19.090> that

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
of dust and this stuff here you mix that

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.039 
of dust and this stuff here you mix that
and<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:21.280> glue<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:22.000> getting<00:03:22.359> really<00:03:22.720> really

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
and that glue is getting really really

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.860 
and that glue is getting really really
hard<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:23.829> really<00:03:24.220> really<00:03:24.459> powerful<00:03:24.870> so

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
hard and it's really really powerful so

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.410 
hard and it's really really powerful so
what<00:03:26.230> I'm<00:03:26.350> going<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.620> do<00:03:26.829> is<00:03:27.430> I'm<00:03:27.820> going<00:03:28.299> to

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
glue<00:03:28.720> those<00:03:29.350> checks<00:03:29.799> into<00:03:30.100> those<00:03:30.640> holes<00:03:34.440> I've

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
glue those checks into those holes I've

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.270 
glue those checks into those holes I've
already<00:03:35.799> used<00:03:36.040> that<00:03:37.170> glue<00:03:38.170> to<00:03:38.530> glue<00:03:38.829> together

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
already used that glue to glue together

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.610 
already used that glue to glue together
that<00:03:39.910> broken<00:03:40.450> gear<00:03:40.900> in<00:03:41.109> my<00:03:41.799> sharp<00:03:42.959> both<00:03:43.959> sides

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
that broken gear in my sharp both sides

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.710 
that broken gear in my sharp both sides
playing<00:03:45.070> record<00:03:45.549> player<00:03:46.230> and<00:03:47.760> well<00:03:48.760> until<00:03:49.510> now

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.069 
playing record player and well until now
has<00:03:50.109> done<00:03:50.500> a<00:03:50.530> perfect<00:03:51.010> job<00:03:51.370> holding<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.209> gear

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
has done a perfect job holding that gear

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.620 
has done a perfect job holding that gear
together<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:55.510> first<00:03:55.780> track<00:03:56.200> is<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.829> its<00:03:56.980> place

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
together the first track is in its place

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.000 
together the first track is in its place
and<00:03:59.340> here<00:04:00.340> is<00:04:00.459> the<00:04:00.640> second<00:04:01.120> one

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.399 

just<00:04:05.310> want<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.670> put<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.000> carefully<00:04:06.510> into<00:04:07.170> their

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
just want to put it carefully into their

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.509 
just want to put it carefully into their
to<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.760> too<00:04:08.970> fast<00:04:09.299> of<00:04:09.599> course<00:04:09.980> all<00:04:10.980> the

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
to do that too fast of course all the

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.460 
to do that too fast of course all the
school<00:04:11.790> all<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.120> glue<00:04:12.480> is<00:04:12.629> going<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.049> come<00:04:13.290> out

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
school all the glue is going to come out

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.140 
school all the glue is going to come out
again<00:04:14.569> it<00:04:15.569> should<00:04:15.810> be<00:04:15.989> good<00:04:16.669> it's<00:04:17.669> some<00:04:17.910> time

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
again it should be good it's some time

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.110 
again it should be good it's some time
later<00:04:18.419> now<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.139> as<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.739> can<00:04:19.889> see<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.579> glue<00:04:20.850> is

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
later now and as you can see the glue is

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.379 
later now and as you can see the glue is
now<00:04:21.180> hard<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.770> see<00:04:23.010> it<00:04:23.389> slightly

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
now hard so you can see it slightly

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.909 
now hard so you can see it slightly
change<00:04:25.139> its<00:04:25.470> color<00:04:27.260> this<00:04:28.260> is<00:04:28.320> what<00:04:28.620> it<00:04:28.740> looks

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
change its color this is what it looks

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.100 
change its color this is what it looks
like<00:04:29.100> from<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.490> other<00:04:29.520> side<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.330> as<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.960> can

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
like from the other side and as you can

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.379 
like from the other side and as you can
see<00:04:31.139> there<00:04:32.070> is<00:04:32.190> still<00:04:32.639> a<00:04:32.669> little<00:04:32.970> bit<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
see there is still a little bit of a

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.990 
see there is still a little bit of a
problem<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.130> can<00:04:35.310> see<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.720> ends<00:04:37.229> of<00:04:37.470> those

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
problem so you can see the ends of those

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.810 
problem so you can see the ends of those
Jags<00:04:39.000> are<00:04:39.300> down<00:04:40.139> in<00:04:40.350> there<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.919> it's<00:04:41.340> quite

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
Jags are down in there and it's quite

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.330 
Jags are down in there and it's quite
complicated<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.600> reach<00:04:42.780> them<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.889> soldering

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
complicated to reach them the soldering

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.610 
complicated to reach them the soldering
iron<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.360> one<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.690> also<00:04:46.020> covered<00:04:46.229> with

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
iron and this one is also covered with

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.330 
iron and this one is also covered with
that<00:04:47.010> glue<00:04:47.340> so<00:04:48.330> what<00:04:48.570> I'm<00:04:48.690> going<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.960> do<00:04:49.169> is<00:04:49.500> I'm

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
that glue so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.210 
that glue so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:04:50.580> to<00:04:50.699> drill<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.720> bigger<00:04:52.080> hole<00:04:52.440> around

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
going to drill a bigger hole around

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.400 
going to drill a bigger hole around
those<00:04:54.289> until<00:04:55.289> I<00:04:55.320> can<00:04:55.650> reach<00:04:56.130> those<00:04:56.880> two<00:04:57.780> jacks

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
those until I can reach those two jacks

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.629 
those until I can reach those two jacks
in<00:04:58.710> there<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:01.110> there<00:05:01.440> you<00:05:01.560> have<00:05:01.590> it<00:05:01.800> now<00:05:02.430> it

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
in there and there you have it now it

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.180 
in there and there you have it now it
should<00:05:02.850> be<00:05:03.000> pretty<00:05:03.449> easy<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:04.199> reach<00:05:04.800> down<00:05:05.160> with

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
should be pretty easy to reach down with

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.120 
should be pretty easy to reach down with
in<00:05:05.760> there<00:05:06.030> with<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.389> soldering<00:05:06.810> iron<00:05:07.130> to

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
in there with the soldering iron to

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.210 
in there with the soldering iron to
solder<00:05:08.850> on<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.599> wire<00:05:09.919> and<00:05:11.479> there<00:05:12.479> you<00:05:12.630> have<00:05:12.660> it

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
solder on the wire and there you have it

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.730 
solder on the wire and there you have it
wire<00:05:14.220> has<00:05:14.550> been<00:05:14.580> soldered<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.810> jags<00:05:16.380> on

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740
