 an optical mouse should but 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.540
 from joystick 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.090
 Per cent power connection only way would be over 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.520
 Winter sale 5 mm 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.060
 and for myself 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.800
 here would be loud speaker 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
 and the mic we read maps 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 we have the back 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.090
 2 main running speakers of ours are called Kilos so Kobi Pyros and then 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.110
 the different 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.910
 around version numbers 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.940
 here there is no AR main camera there is a version with each with 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.960
 and without and the height of the version with camera we have a 2-megapixel camera 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.680
 built-in 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.020
 Grandma nothing to me 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.280
 and percent - say 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.390
 the volume rocker 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.610
 that probably 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.610
 so open the door for the flap but I do not know 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.720
 Romans are all rarely on 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.889
 probably never Corp 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:11.379
 Year the most important thing is the software 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.779
 for workmanship there is actually quite neat for me are fat 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.400
 but otherwise everything around to make the devices are now very cheap that 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.549
 most expensive device 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.549
 Percent the 10-inch tablet and sitcom 1-inch tablet 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.669
 with full equipment 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.669
 309 70 euros cost so q4 b 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.509
 Probably percent on the market now come for less 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.969
 and the cheapest 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.629
 until then a 7 inch tablet 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.709
 for primates 39 EUR 4 b 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.859
 but then with me is also every now and then in the squad 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.649
 through always once 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.909
 most important is the software and here we unfortunately only Android two out of three points 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:57.959
 suffice 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.729
 and then I let that percent Rovi in ​​negotiations 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.239
 is located at percent Google 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.309
 and even Waltz 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.779
 new equipment will go 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:11.479
 with Android 3 2 0 Hanekamp or wait two already directly 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:16.529
 on these devices which if you followed this is now buy would be 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.119
 it is not delivered so 

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:22.279
 If I want to have a cheap tablet in the world then rather wait and be 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.589
 then came to the hall version of the station wagon 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.099
 Devices are waiting 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.239
 the display is not as great as other manufacturers as well 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.759
 understandable that in Salo Borgia blew up 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:37.699
 who here today a gigahertz processor inside and 5 times 12 meters wide 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:41.649
 otherwise percent 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.389
 A completely naked Android is 2 points off and 3 and percent 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.709
 often difficult 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.709
 or complex preinstalled 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.499
 There really not quite as liquid 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.499
 as you are used to from other tablets though 

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:05.929
 yes, for example, to OTZ 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.049
 as you can see 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.399
 Engelbertz runs quite fluently on the tablets 

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:13.929
 he already has 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.270
 quite okay for this 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.270
 Price class 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.920
 these were the tablets found to Beat Beat Tablets 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.370
 Cyrus and 10 we go on through the halls and chance other manufacturers 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.240
 Pröll until then the much to look for and more information can be found on 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.430
 the Alb the administration should act
