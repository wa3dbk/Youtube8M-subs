00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.920
 hello youtubers how are all I hope 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.380
 well this time I'll talk about a legend 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.309
 very popular and known here on youtube 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.650
 if so is the legend of hero green ok 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.380
 for this occasion we have a member 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.480
 new channel and we'll see you at the headquarters 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.020
 from the eye corporation so let's go 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.020
 there 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.010
 hello to what waves the light and that welcome 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.470
 to the channel thanks dark link now 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.890
 we'll talk about a creepy pasta is not it 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.379
 if it's about this creepy pasta so 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.270
 famous of minecraft the legend of hero 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.790
 I toasted and I do not know what you think 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.680
 Regarding the truth, it does not make sense 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.140
 because the hero hero green character is 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.629
 just a bogey nothing else that put us in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.120
 a version and that suddenly appeared and 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.220
 killed the characters besides me 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.650
 it has not appeared to me and I have played many 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.470
 times mini craft like that and I'd say it's a 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.690
 farce and there is certain said clear legend 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.549
 but there are many people who do say that 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.280
 has appeared and videos where they have 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.530
 recorded while the players played is 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.140
 a true mystery in itself but the same 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.930
 we will relate it as it is known 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.409
 that they agree to take their favorite drink 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.080
 put the video in hd put on a diaper 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:29.320
 for adult xd and enjoy the video 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.650
 let's start the myth of that player who 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.750
 tells the legend and says recently 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.440
 born in a new world in the mode of 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.050
 a mini player 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.210
 everything seemed normal at first when 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.880
 I started cutting trees and doing my 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.190
 work table I began to notice something 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.590
 strange moving inside the dense 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.930
 fog as I had a very computer 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.990
 slow I was forced to play in the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.970
 minimum distance of vision at the beginning 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.520
 I thought it was a cow so 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.790
 I started to chase her hoping to get 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.730
 something leather to make me an armor 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.920
 more was not a cow looking at me in front of 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.020
 I was a character with the skin 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.140
 original from minecraft but his eyes 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.240
 they were blank I did not see any names 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.060
 above your head as if you were 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.920
 playing multiplayer so check 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.950
 twice to make sure I do not 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.230
 was playing in that mode the mysterious 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.870
 character did not stay there long 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.300
 he stared at me for a moment 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.450
 and quickly ran inside the dense 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.060
 fog was eating my curiosity but he 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.520
 I had marched I continued playing 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.670
 normally without being sure of what 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.709
 to think as I expand my world I started 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.130
 to see some things that seemed to be 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.410
 outside 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.990
 place to be generated by the engine of 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.540
 game map was something quite strange 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.760
 2 x 2 tunnels inside some 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.100
 mountains small pyramids of 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.320
 perfect proportions made of sand 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.560
 'sea inside' trunks of trees without 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.510
 no blade constantly tortured me 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.820
 the curiosity of being able to see that 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.490
 mysterious player who had appeared 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.020
 that day in that dense fog 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.720
 unfortunately I could never see it again 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.820
 sometimes I tried to change the 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.890
 vision distance in an attempt to 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.800
 to be able to find that strange character 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.590
 all those times without any luck 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.630
 I clicked save and went to the forums 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.940
 from minecraft to look for some topic 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.160
 about if someone else had this 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.280
 strange experience of having seen that 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.020
 strange character as I did not see any subject 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.790
 I decided to create mine in which 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.130
 I asked if anyone else had 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.500
 witnessed such an appearance there was no 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.650
 had some similar experience in the 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.740
 game my theme was deleted five minutes 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.570
 then I tried again and again my 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.069
 theme was deleted this time more 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.379
 quickly 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.239
 I received a personal message from a user 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.389
 called hero toasted and the message 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.340
 contained a single word stop 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.769
 after seeing this I immediately wanted 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.069
 check this user's profile but 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.829
 I got the typical error 404 or page not 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:10.040
 found time later I received a 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:12.349
 email from another lyon user he said 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.359
 that the moderators could read all 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.820
 the messages of forum users 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:19.070
 so we were safer using 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.709
 in ellis this user swore that also 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.780
 had seen this strange character and that 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.750
 I had a small directory of others 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.180
 users with similar experiences he 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.130
 described the strange character who had 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.680
 seen in the dense fog like a 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.710
 normal mintra ftc character but with 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.099
 the blank eyes spent a whole month for 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.780
 to hear from this user again 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.970
 mentioned that some other players that 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.580
 he had in his directory had passed 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.740
 for experiences similar to mine but 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.960
 they had started an investigation 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 about the eurocine name and they found 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.090
 that was a used username 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.160
 often by a player 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.410
 after putting together more than 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.419
 information we come to the conclusion that 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.880
 he was the brother of not being a creator of 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.520
 minecraft personally I sent you an email 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.190
 last night asking him if he had a brother 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.520
 it took some time but he responded 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.040
 with a short message hello look if I had 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.530
 a younger brother but unfortunately already 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.510
 is not with us, not only have I returned to 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.340
 see that mysterious character that 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.650
 came out in the shit in that 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.690
 first contact I have not noticed the 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.690
 munication disclosed apart from my 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.970
 constructions I could take an extensive 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.270
 from the first time I saw it and this is 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.639
 my evidence that he is real with the 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.100
 things that are said about the character but 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.169
 rime creates random constructions like 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.169
 the pyramids and swing in the tunnels 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:46.750
 of two blocks of height also top or 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:49.419
 cuts off the leaves of the trees and creates 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.880
 adoptive underground complexes 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:54.490
 just like the dungeons lit with 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.129
 torches of red stone often 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.849
 appear on the edge 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:01.379
 in a distance it looks small 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.749
 variations there are many variations of the 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:06.839
 ero brin behavior but usually 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:08.550
 they divide the version of 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:11.519
 eros bringué is the younger brother of 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.749
 night that about the player disappears 

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:15.269
 if you approach him 

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:17.459
 the mining version of hero bring is a 

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:19.889
 vengeful miner who tries to catch the 

00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:22.919
 player in the traps supposedly 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.169
 to steal his objects he hopes that 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.539
 people enter their dungeon and well 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.319
 inside the stamps or teleports 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.089
 behind them presumably killing 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:35.279
 some variations of this particular 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:37.589
 version says it breaks and creations 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:40.619
 of the player and steals your items from 

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:43.229
 chest and also the controversy but greene 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:45.899
 although many players have said that 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:48.360
 they have actually enlisted the character 

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:50.519
 it does not let me exercise more good game a 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.129
 history launched by young people 

00:06:50.519 --> 00:06:55.559
 nationals supposedly of nationality 

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:57.749
 greece and hollow barbarian to keep the 

00:06:55.559 --> 00:07:00.179
 players because of the rumors about 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:03.239
 this writing of forums and other places 

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:05.129
 officers this joke made many 

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:08.849
 players will start to investigate 

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:10.860
 thus expanding the game even more despite everything 

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:13.529
 it is possible that in some update 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.479
 include this character due to the 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.059
 popularity that has emerged in this 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:20.399
 besides the curiosities like 

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:22.259
 example when you start is administered with 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:25.769
 the hero account brina the skin is 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:28.769
 change among other things more ok this has 

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:30.919
 been everything comment subscribe denle
