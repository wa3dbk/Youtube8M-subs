00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.270
 so now let's talk about the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.550
 notion of absolute value senans langnau 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.960
 his case was meeting in high school so 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.509
 we could define the value here 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.929
 absolute as here no absolute value of 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.380
 xcom being equal to x so the number and to 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.060
 him even if he is positive 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.519
 or are opposed in the event that he 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.840
 elective sema 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.910
 but I could also define the value 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.279
 absolute through the maximum 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.480
 as we saw just before and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.730
 precisely I'm going to use this 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.829
 definition through the 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 maximum so that's going to be our 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.910
 definition bump so that is to say that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.480
 I will not make me laugh this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:51.449
 definition definition have used a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:01:01.890
 other notation then will say that for the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:06.019
 turn and mx1 we 'll say that the maximum the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.019
 maximum of all 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:15.280
 about are quite particular c 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.120
 x16 the maximum of this set the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.950
 match the absolute value of x on 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.700
 can notice that the definitions 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:31.980
 so coincides the maximum of the set x 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:41.290
 - x and the absolute value and the value 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:46.060
 absolute of x so that's how we go 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.740
 note absolute value of x equal max so 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.270
 the maximum of this set the x or 1.6 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.620
 and as he would separate we do not know 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.280
 his sign we do not know for now 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.970
 which is precisely the maximum 6 x is 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.310
 positive 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.340
 the maximum of x and -6 and dotting x 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.140
 and then if it's negative the maximum of x 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.020
 and music is less 6 that 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.679
 fits well that's it for the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.970
 definition 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.489
 so there is something about the neck that 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:22.090
 will flow already by this definition 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:23.860
 we can say that for touré l x ma 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.709
 absolute value of -6 equal value 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.320
 absolute of x since current value of 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.320
 -6 by definition it's the maximum of 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.260
 minus x is less and less x so 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.690
 maximum of mold of these 2 x so maximum 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.239
 2 x 2 1 x but it fits well low 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.850
 grade am saying what are we going to have 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.180
 others as property we will see it 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.180
 as well 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.819
 that absolute value of will be of x is 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.519
 biggest grins I ax hits its 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:59.010
 x the little rigor to bale on the lookout for x 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.480
 and we'll also have -6 and smaller or 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.519
 equal to that formerly we arras to who go 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.590
 to follow 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:17.280
 we will also see its absolute value ch 2 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.599
 x com is bigger than me x and no 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.459
 I do not need a stupidity, it's not 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:27.209
 it's more like 10 x that will be understood 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.639
 -20 unbeknownst to evaluate x Félix 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.609
 what are we going to have other 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:38.069
 as property that's all I think 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.200
 off game anyway remember here that 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.419
 for tour alix I still count 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.389
 we have square root the xo gadret 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.280
 that gives me the intruder 2x so in 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.900
 particular what is this woman 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.239
 interested in this demonstration 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.629
 if I take the value of luxury squared 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:57.530
 it gives me this quinté so that's ok 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.530
 to be essence and thereafter
