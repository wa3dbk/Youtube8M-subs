00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.920 
feedback on that I'm looking to to use a
little<00:03:47.700> more<00:03:47.850> I<00:03:47.910> had<00:03:48.240> success<00:03:48.660> on<00:03:48.810> that

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
little more I had success on that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.720 
little more I had success on that
channel<00:03:49.170> but<00:03:49.470> it's<00:03:49.740> hard<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.100> have<00:03:50.400> time

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
channel but it's hard to have time

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.449 
channel but it's hard to have time
because<00:03:51.030> you<00:03:51.240> know<00:03:51.480> games<00:03:51.840> are<00:03:52.080> long<00:03:52.260> so<00:03:53.100> maybe

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
because you know games are long so maybe

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.220 
because you know games are long so maybe
shorter<00:03:54.030> games<00:03:54.240> is<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.510> way<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.690> go<00:03:54.870> indie

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
shorter games is the way to go indie

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.690 
shorter games is the way to go indie
games<00:03:55.470> or<00:03:55.770> just<00:03:55.800> games<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.459> short
