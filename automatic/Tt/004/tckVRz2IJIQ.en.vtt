00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.940
 I'll call this novel the continuation 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.870
 from the diary of a madman 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.990
 with 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.260
 probably pouting a novel 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
 published several years ago and it is the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.800
 story of a man disturbed by a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 woman 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.720
 For jealousy 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.720
 because of the impossibility of owning it 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.579
 by madness which gets you a 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.610
 disturbed imagination 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.940
 and to go 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.519
 and one 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.010
 consequence of this imagination 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:59.120
 overwhelmed is the presence of several 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:03.020
 philosophers who converse with the character 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.479
 throughout the plot but it's not a 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.820
 pedante novel I did not bring the I did not bring the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.479
 ideas of the systems nor the concepts 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.060
 of the philosophers I brought the characters 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.729
 that literarily 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.590
 they are mundane and nice or 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.030
 unpleasant for the reader 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.030
 then I can chat 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.780
 schopenhauer that is just man 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.990
 born in dance 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.450
 about the most ordinary topics and 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.090
 mundanes that exist I bring them to the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.479
 table as a friend 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.000
 also with a lot of curiosity because 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.210
 they were all strange names and 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.159
 disturbed distrustful in the case of 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.009
 schopenhauer a very arrogant man 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.990
 he believed that his ideas were the most 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.990
 important that had happened to the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.709
 humanity I do not think the truth has 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.709
 what to do with the woman 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.490
 I believe that 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.310
 we give the woman we have from here so 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.789
 Silver is the sum of all women 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.569
 that we knew 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.740
 and each one of them surprises me 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.420
 they are always exceptional individuals 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.260
 sometimes terrible sometimes beautiful sometimes 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.440
 comprehensive 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.430
 sometimes tyrannical no no I do not think that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.049
 there is something like the woman 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.910
 or maybe I could talk about the world 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.870
 female 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.470
 how would you define the feminine world as the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.000
 world where the other stranger lives 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.890
 be that you can never own 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.080
 in the house of desire 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.080
 the desire always unfulfilled 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.090
 no matter the sex 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.120
 no matter 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.930
 the tyrannical that one can be the desire 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.930
 of appropriation 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.420
 that a woman provokes you never never the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.420
 you'll have because it's a free being 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.100
 and above all a strange being at least 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.910
 in the mouth of the character 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.910
 it does not happen like that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.220
 that would be for me the feminine world is 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.840
 a world populated by ghosts 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.840
 love is an invention 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.430
 the error the error is little said that the 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.930
 people would not talk about love people would not 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.430
 he would fall in love if he had not listened 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.040
 talk about love 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.060
 watching and said that love was a 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.060
 saliva exchange 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.800
 basketball gives you certainty because if 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.900
 you are no longer 30 points along a 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.510
 match are 30 points 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.560
 instead love is more of a 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.810
 consequence of language 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.030
 it is a metaphorical construction 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.620
 one not only when he says he is 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.209
 in love does not know what he is saying 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.600
 maybe he has been seduced or wishes to a 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.880
 woman or a man 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:20.560
 but being in love is a policy 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.560
 more than an erotic 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.509
 to a literature more than a reality in 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.370
 change in basketball not the bones 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.970
 that broke me playing basketball during 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.870
 8 for 8 years there are the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:40.380
 X-rays that I took when I 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.750
 they broke the ciliary arch and several fingers 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.350
 and the radio thank you are tests 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:49.470
 reliable that basketball existed 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.590
 but on the radiography about love 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.200
 I have stories stories always 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:59.140
 they are fictitious yes of course 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.480
 and good just Garcia Marquez said that 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.560
 he liked to do carpentry for 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.560
 lose the fear of life 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.000
 I try to be and to be strong I'm going 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.430
 to run two or three times a week 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.360
 because I lead a very dissipated life 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.790
 I am let's say nocturnal bird 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.910
 in my youth I was very quarrelsome 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.090
 it's still not a fight the rain is 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.750
 two years ago and I was almost on the verge of 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.860
 lose it 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.780
 an impartial referee would say that we draw 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.120
 in a canteen of the narvarte if badly 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.380
 I remember then you have to be 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.270
 strong there is that you have to 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.380
 Do not miss out on the world of 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.730
 abstraction 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.730
 of course magic johnson 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:52.610
 with whom I would take a deal with 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:55.520
 magic of I imagine that I will not take the 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.330
 same rhythm as me but it was a man 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:02.000
 likeable enjoyed what he did instead 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.390
 schopenhauer no no no no no 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.639
 wanted to talk to me I would have said 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:10.759
 this writing 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.280
 supposed reader of philosophy does not have the 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:16.789
 less idea of ​​what he says and also not 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.879
 knows German or reads in German and does not 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:23.350
 would despise with great ease 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.150
 instead the magic and I could talk 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.540
 of my times in the selection of 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.820
 pumas 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.889
 and his steps from his great step in the 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.499
 true basketball of the nba 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.659
 by the lakers of the angels magic 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:40.199
 johnson about schopenhauer I do not have the 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.199
 minor doubt
