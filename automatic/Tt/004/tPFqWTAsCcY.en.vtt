00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.580 
but then after making it and doing video
I<00:01:49.619> decided<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.340> couldn't<00:01:50.670> sing<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:52.320> was

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
I decided I couldn't sing and it was

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.649 
I decided I couldn't sing and it was
stupid<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.850> when<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> thought<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.360> can't

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
stupid and then when I thought I can't

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.510 
stupid and then when I thought I can't
sing<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.380> want<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> make<00:01:55.740> some<00:01:55.979> sort<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> song

that's<00:01:57.210> when<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.450> decided<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.990> I'd<00:01:58.290> create

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that's when I decided that I'd create

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.580 
that's when I decided that I'd create
some<00:01:58.860> raps<00:01:59.219> now<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.810> people<00:02:00.930> who<00:02:01.079> can't<00:02:01.320> sing

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
they wrap which is what I do and so once

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.130 
they wrap which is what I do and so once
that<00:02:05.340> was<00:02:05.700> quite<00:02:05.909> successful<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:06.990> get

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
that was quite successful I don't get
