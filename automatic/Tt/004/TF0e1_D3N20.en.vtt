I<00:00:26.070> don't<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.400> midair<00:00:27.439> we're<00:00:28.439> doing<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.740> on

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
I don't know midair we're doing this on

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.700 
I don't know midair we're doing this on
our<00:00:28.949> own<00:00:29.160> private<00:00:29.609> servers<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.410> install

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
our own private servers with we install

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.290 
our own private servers with we install
the<00:00:31.830> plugin<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.399> would<00:00:32.579> recommend<00:00:32.700> doing<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the plugin so I would recommend doing it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.250 
the plugin so I would recommend doing it
on<00:00:34.370> actual<00:00:35.370> servers<00:00:35.820> because<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.480> might<00:00:36.660> get

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
on actual servers because you might get

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.549 
on actual servers because you might get
banner<00:00:38.629> not<00:00:39.629> good<00:00:39.870> thing<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.230> get<00:00:40.379> back

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
banner not good thing when you get back

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.410 
banner not good thing when you get back
because<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:42.030> might<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.270> playing

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because you know you might be playing

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420 
because you know you might be playing
the<00:00:42.540> servers<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.230> love<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.219> what

second line you put how much of the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.310 
second line you put how much of the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
blocks you want so you can put two

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.200 
blocks you want so you can put two
thousand<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> want<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.820> this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
example we're gonna do 64 and then this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
example we're gonna do 64 and then this
is<00:00:57.120> a<00:00:57.180> code<00:00:57.360> what<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> type<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.109> gonna

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
is a code what you want to type in gonna

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.139 
is a code what you want to type in gonna
press<00:00:58.920> one<00:00:59.280> capital<00:01:00.239> e<00:01:00.390> 1<00:01:01.050> capital<00:01:01.859> B<00:01:02.100> 1<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
press one capital e 1 capital B 1 and

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.359 
press one capital e 1 capital B 1 and
then<00:01:03.359> 10<00:01:03.570> zeros<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> next<00:01:08.220> line

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
then 10 zeros and then the next line

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.130 
then 10 zeros and then the next line
you're<00:01:08.520> gonna<00:01:08.610> put<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.270> block<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
you're gonna put the block you want to

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.700 
you're gonna put the block you want to
spawn<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.490> could<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.760> diamond<00:01:12.600> block

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.410 

versus<00:01:16.710> any<00:01:17.009> block<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.700> doesn't<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.299> be

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
versus any block it doesn't have to be

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
versus any block it doesn't have to be
done<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:18.960> for<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.470> video<00:01:19.680> we're<00:01:20.070> showing

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

done but for this video we're showing
you<00:01:20.460> down<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.880> block<00:01:21.119> yeah<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.009> can't

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you down in block yeah and so you can't

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
you down in block yeah and so you can't
get<00:01:24.030> anything<00:01:24.240> from<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.900> need<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
friend to right-click at once you get 64

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.330 
friend to right-click at once you get 64
done<00:01:31.770> blocks

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
done blocks

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.300 
done blocks
twice<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.030> 128<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:35.040> ban

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
twice you get 128 and you can just ban

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.539 
twice you get 128 and you can just ban
that<00:01:35.520> however<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.400> just

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
that however much you want and you just

that however much you want and you just
get<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:39.030> much<00:01:39.329> done<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.079> blocks<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.619> want

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
get as much done in blocks as you want

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.350 
get as much done in blocks as you want
so<00:01:42.500> that's<00:01:43.500> basically<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.549> remember

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so that's basically it just remember

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
so that's basically it just remember
that<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.720> only<00:01:45.960> works<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.040> cheshire

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
that this only works if the cheshire

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.370 
that this only works if the cheshire
plug<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.299> server<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.630> using<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.049> under

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
plug in the server is using is under

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
plug in the server is using is under
three<00:01:49.680> point<00:01:49.950> seven<00:01:50.159> point<00:01:50.490> seven<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.210> doesn't

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
three point seven point seven it doesn't

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.020 
three point seven point seven it doesn't
work<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.720> 370<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:53.310> some<00:01:53.460> reason<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.820> don't<00:01:53.880> know

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
work on 370 for some reason I don't know

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.399
