00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that'd be a good one for that next one

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.760 
that'd be a good one for that next one
we<00:02:13.790> got<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.209> redstone<00:02:14.660> chest<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.319> need<00:02:15.620> to

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
we got a redstone chest so you need to

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.100

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
like just quickly build redstone for

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.620 
like just quickly build redstone for
maybe<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.410> challenge<00:02:18.890> or<00:02:19.040> something<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.880> note

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
maybe a challenge or something and note

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.390 
maybe a challenge or something and note
that<00:02:20.660> there's<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.110> gap<00:02:21.319> right<00:02:21.620> here<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.100> I've

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
that there's a gap right here and I've

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.830 
that there's a gap right here and I've
done<00:02:22.819> this<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.090> purpose

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
done this on purpose

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.809 
done this on purpose
it<00:02:24.050> doesn't<00:02:24.890> actually<00:02:25.959> physically<00:02:26.959> fully

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
it doesn't actually physically fully

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.390 
it doesn't actually physically fully
copy<00:02:28.819> what<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.270> do<00:02:29.780> exactly<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:31.220> see

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
copy what you do exactly so you see

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.449 
copy what you do exactly so you see
there's<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.640> gap<00:02:31.820> here<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.269> will<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.459> it'll

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
there's a gap here that will then it'll

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.550 
there's a gap here that will then it'll
just<00:02:34.489> move<00:02:34.790> up<00:02:34.940> once<00:02:35.209> so<00:02:35.450> you'll<00:02:35.630> see<00:02:35.870> it

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
just move up once so you'll see it

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.030 
just move up once so you'll see it
doesn't<00:02:36.830> fully<00:02:37.900> build<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.019> gap<00:02:39.200> properly<00:02:39.680> so

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
doesn't fully build the gap properly so

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.660 
doesn't fully build the gap properly so
you<00:02:40.940> have<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.300> like<00:02:41.800> fill<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:42.920> up<00:02:43.010> fully<00:02:43.370> you

you have to like fill it up fully you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.830 
you have to like fill it up fully you
won't<00:02:43.820> have<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.060> put<00:02:44.209> gaps<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.600> if<00:02:44.750> you

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
won't have to put gaps in if you

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.170 
won't have to put gaps in if you
understand<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.440> then<00:02:46.010> finally<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.700> PvP

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180
