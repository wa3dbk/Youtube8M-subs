it's be easier senior I drew a hole here
and<00:00:12.420> put<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> nut<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.259> bolt<00:00:14.009> through<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.280> put<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and put a nut and bolt through and put a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.180 
and put a nut and bolt through and put a
washer<00:00:15.000> on<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.500> I<00:00:16.500> clamped<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
washer on this up and I clamped the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.590 
washer on this up and I clamped the
brake<00:00:18.150> cable<00:00:19.970> I'm<00:00:20.970> trying<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.660> good<00:00:21.840> view<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.140> it

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 
brake cable I'm trying a good view of it

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.390 
brake cable I'm trying a good view of it
you<00:00:24.600> can't<00:00:24.840> see<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.140> very<00:00:25.289> good<00:00:25.769> but<00:00:26.010> basically

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you can't see it very good but basically

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.570 
you can't see it very good but basically
I've<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> wash<00:00:27.000> off<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:28.220> I've<00:00:29.220> just

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
I've got a wash off and I've just

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.299 
I've got a wash off and I've just
clamped<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.599> tightened<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.289> cable<00:00:32.189> between

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
clamped just tightened the cable between

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.020 
clamped just tightened the cable between
the<00:00:32.610> washer<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:34.160> metal<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.850> there's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
the washer and the metal here so there's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
the washer and the metal here so there's
a<00:00:36.090> washer<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> cable<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.110> cables<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
a washer on the cable and cables in the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.810 
a washer on the cable and cables in the
middle<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> washer<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> middle<00:00:38.700> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
middle of the washer in the middle and

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.700 
middle of the washer in the middle and
just<00:00:38.850> squished<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.379> seems<00:00:40.590> to

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just squished in there and it seems to

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.369 
just squished in there and it seems to
work<00:00:40.829> okay<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:42.090> I've<00:00:42.239> got<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.390> spring<00:00:42.899> there<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
work okay so I've got a spring there to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
work okay so I've got a spring there to
return<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:50.780> it's<00:00:51.780> run<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.649> some<00:00:53.239> copper

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
return it and it's run in some copper

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.840 
return it and it's run in some copper
tubing<00:00:54.719> for<00:00:55.079> shielding<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> copper

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
tubing for shielding so the copper

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
tubing for shielding so the copper
tubing<00:00:57.149> runs<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.570> way<00:00:57.719> around<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.370> then

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
tubing runs all the way around here then

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.119 
tubing runs all the way around here then
little<00:00:59.910> hole<00:01:00.090> there<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.629> then<00:01:01.620> run<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
little hole there and then run to the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.979 
little hole there and then run to the
break<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.609> there's<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.910> return<00:01:03.210> spring<00:01:03.780> there

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
break and there's a return spring there

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:18.730 
break and there's a return spring there
so<00:01:04.640> when<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> pull<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.740 

it<00:01:19.040> only<00:01:19.190> has<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.550> pull<00:01:19.730> it<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:19.910> tiny<00:01:20.240> little<00:01:20.510> bit

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
it only has to pull it a tiny little bit

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.830 
it only has to pull it a tiny little bit
and<00:01:21.760> it<00:01:22.760> works<00:01:23.230> so<00:01:24.490> yeah<00:01:25.490> I've<00:01:26.300> also<00:01:26.540> heard<00:01:26.780> a

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
and it works so yeah I've also heard a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.630 
and it works so yeah I've also heard a
lot<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.200> people<00:01:27.470> asking<00:01:28.100> how<00:01:28.250> got<00:01:28.520> my

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
lot of people asking how got my

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.990 
lot of people asking how got my
throttles<00:01:29.410> I'll<00:01:30.410> go<00:01:30.710> in<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.070> detail<00:01:31.250> I've

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
throttles I'll go in that detail I've

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.280 
throttles I'll go in that detail I've
got<00:01:32.270> some<00:01:32.740> shielding<00:01:33.740> for<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:34.610> bike<00:01:35.140> I've<00:01:36.140> got

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
got some shielding for a bike I've got

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.900 
got some shielding for a bike I've got
some<00:01:36.500> bike<00:01:37.600> what<00:01:38.600> I<00:01:38.630> used<00:01:38.870> for<00:01:38.990> here<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.910> what

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
some bike what I used for here is what

some bike what I used for here is what
they<00:01:41.060> use<00:01:41.270> on<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:42.560> road<00:01:42.590> bikes<00:01:43.130> not<00:01:43.790> the

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
they use on the road bikes not the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.480 
they use on the road bikes not the
mountain<00:01:44.240> bikes<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.750> actual<00:01:45.170> proper<00:01:46.040> road

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
bikes it's the brake cable it's just

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.380 
bikes it's the brake cable it's just
very<00:01:51.080> thick<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.860> what<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.759> has<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.030> like<00:01:53.180> has<00:01:53.360> a

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
very thick and what it has is like has a

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.780 
very thick and what it has is like has a
little<00:01:53.660> knob<00:01:53.990> Li<00:01:54.140> bit<00:01:54.290> on<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:54.530> end<00:01:54.650> I<00:01:55.340> have

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
little knob Li bit on the end I have

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.180 
little knob Li bit on the end I have
this<00:01:55.880> governor<00:01:56.360> still<00:01:56.630> connected<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.350> on<00:01:58.009> the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
this governor still connected so on the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.609 
this governor still connected so on the
governor<00:01:58.550> arm<00:01:58.790> here<00:01:59.150> this<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:00.020> arm<00:02:00.229> three

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
governor arm here this is arm three

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.800 
governor arm here this is arm three
holes<00:02:00.860> in<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.160> I<00:02:01.280> just<00:02:01.399> put<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:02.000> cable

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
holes in it I just put that cable

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.790 
holes in it I just put that cable
through<00:02:02.990> there<00:02:03.140> and<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:03.500> got<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.710> little

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
through there and it's got that little

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.859 
through there and it's got that little
bulb<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.310> end<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.759> stays<00:02:05.060> in<00:02:05.300> there<00:02:05.479> and

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
bulb in the end so it stays in there and

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.540 
bulb in the end so it stays in there and
then<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.530> cable<00:02:06.830> runs<00:02:06.979> here<00:02:07.160> and<00:02:07.399> then

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
then the cable runs here and then

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.359 
then the cable runs here and then
there's<00:02:08.360> little<00:02:08.690> washer<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.679> screw<00:02:09.979> there

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
there's little washer and screw there

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.190 
there's little washer and screw there
usually<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.450> hold<00:02:11.600> your<00:02:11.780> other<00:02:11.810> throttle

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
usually it hold your other throttle

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.660 
usually it hold your other throttle
cable<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.800> just<00:02:13.040> hold<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> shielding

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
cable so you can just hold the shielding

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.760 
cable so you can just hold the shielding
in<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.270> then<00:02:14.900> zip<00:02:15.170> tie<00:02:15.350> your<00:02:15.530> shooting

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
in that and then zip tie your shooting

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.970 
in that and then zip tie your shooting
to<00:02:16.010> your<00:02:16.130> frame<00:02:17.050> I've<00:02:18.050> got<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.440> drill<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.890> little

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
to your frame I've got a drill a little
