00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
I guess you can say what you do is if

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.510 
I guess you can say what you do is if
you<00:01:13.080> guys<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.320> noticed<00:01:13.560> these<00:01:13.890> big<00:01:14.189> pools

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you guys have noticed these big pools

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.910 
you guys have noticed these big pools
that<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.150> around<00:01:15.380> in<00:01:16.380> each<00:01:16.409> world<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that kind of go around in each world I

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.890 
that kind of go around in each world I
believe<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> spawns<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:17.970> 15<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.630> 20

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
believe it spawns in like 15 or 20

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
believe it spawns in like 15 or 20
minutes<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.229> every<00:01:19.380> single<00:01:19.560> world<00:01:19.890> they're

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
minutes in every single world they're

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.520 
minutes in every single world they're
not<00:01:20.909> actually<00:01:21.299> all<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.450> sync<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.320> if<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
not actually all in sync so like if you

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
not actually all in sync so like if you
hop<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.250> world<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.180> hop<00:01:24.360> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
hop to one world and then you hop to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.820 
hop to one world and then you hop to
another<00:01:24.689> one<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.229> could<00:01:25.380> actually<00:01:25.560> have

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
another one that you could actually have

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.289 
another one that you could actually have
them<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.189> back-to-back<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.030> not<00:01:27.150> in

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
them like back-to-back so it's not in

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sync or anything I'm like warbands is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.950 
sync or anything I'm like warbands is
every<00:01:29.490> 7<00:01:29.850> hours<00:01:29.970> those<00:01:30.360> are<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.570> kind<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:30.840> in

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
consider morph tokens and it'll give you

consider morph tokens and it'll give you
the<00:02:16.270> ones<00:02:16.510> where<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.960> gives<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.260> more

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
the ones where it gives you more

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
experience if you use the other energies

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.410 
experience if you use the other energies
with<00:02:20.770> it<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.100> kinda<00:02:21.310> confusing<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:22.030> explain

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
with it it's kinda confusing to explain

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.240 
with it it's kinda confusing to explain
but<00:02:22.660> obviously<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:23.650> will<00:02:23.770> see<00:02:23.920> on<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.220> screen

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
but obviously you will see on the screen

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.100 
but obviously you will see on the screen
that<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.790> those<00:02:25.210> little<00:02:25.420> special<00:02:25.690> looking

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
that that those little special looking

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.810 
that that those little special looking
ones<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.380> my<00:02:26.440> inventory<00:02:26.620> those<00:02:27.190> ones<00:02:27.460> give<00:02:27.700> you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
ones in my inventory those ones give you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.280 
ones in my inventory those ones give you
more<00:02:28.030> experience<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:28.750> right<00:02:28.930> now<00:02:29.080> at<00:02:29.200> all

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
more experience like right now at all

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.590 
more experience like right now at all
fifty<00:02:29.770> instead<00:02:30.370> of<00:02:30.460> getting<00:02:30.670> 26<00:02:31.180> experience

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
fifty instead of getting 26 experience

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.360 
fifty instead of getting 26 experience
I'm<00:02:31.690> getting<00:02:31.900> like<00:02:31.990> 53<00:02:32.560> with<00:02:32.800> them<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.190> they're

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
I'm getting like 53 with them so they're

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.580 
I'm getting like 53 with them so they're
literally<00:02:33.580> double<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> experience<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:35.470> you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
literally double the experience but you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.750 
literally double the experience but you
don't<00:02:35.770> get<00:02:35.890> them<00:02:36.070> all<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.250> time<00:02:36.460> they're<00:02:36.640> not

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
don't get them all the time they're not

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.490 
don't get them all the time they're not
as<00:02:36.880> often<00:02:37.090> obviously<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.810> whenever<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.410> get

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
as often obviously but whenever you get

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.710 
as often obviously but whenever you get
those<00:02:38.680> big<00:02:38.860> cool<00:02:39.100> things<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.850> do<00:02:40.030> get<00:02:40.270> double

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
those big cool things you do get double

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.900 
those big cool things you do get double
you<00:02:41.260> always<00:02:41.830> get<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.190> it'll<00:02:42.490> always<00:02:42.640> be<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
you always get that it'll always be the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.550 
you always get that it'll always be the
double<00:02:43.120> experience<00:02:43.390> from<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.720> so<00:02:43.900> that's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
double experience from it so that's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.100 
double experience from it so that's
obviously<00:02:44.830> nice<00:02:45.250> now<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:46.540> keep<00:02:46.690> up<00:02:46.870> with<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
obviously nice now to keep up with the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.230 
obviously nice now to keep up with the
energies<00:02:47.560> if<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.920> guys<00:02:48.070> do<00:02:48.430> use<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:49.090> mean

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
energies if you guys do use I mean

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.760 
energies if you guys do use I mean
obviously<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:50.050> option<00:02:50.410> on<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> very

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
I don't think there's any benefit of

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.160 
I don't think there's any benefit of
getting<00:03:37.000> 99th<00:03:37.450> first<00:03:37.720> I<00:03:37.810> don't<00:03:37.870> think<00:03:38.080> it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
getting 99th first I don't think it

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.420 
getting 99th first I don't think it
really<00:03:38.230> does<00:03:38.440> anything<00:03:38.650> special<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> don't

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
really does anything special you don't

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.490 
really does anything special you don't
like<00:03:39.670> make<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> huge<00:03:40.209> money<00:03:40.450> from<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:41.380> you

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
like make a huge money from it but you

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.570 
like make a huge money from it but you
definitely<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:41.950> make<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.130> lot<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.280> money<00:03:42.370> right

now<00:03:42.640> from<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.060> skill<00:03:43.450> if<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.959> just<00:03:44.110> collect

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
now from this skill if you just collect

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.930 
now from this skill if you just collect
those<00:03:44.530> energies<00:03:44.980> I<00:03:45.130> would<00:03:45.280> say<00:03:45.459> get<00:03:45.700> like<00:03:45.820> well

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
those energies I would say get like well

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.460 
those energies I would say get like well
at<00:03:46.060> fifty<00:03:46.300> or<00:03:46.390> sixty<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:47.290> start

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
at fifty or sixty and just start

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.630 
at fifty or sixty and just start
collecting<00:03:47.920> them<00:03:48.100> because<00:03:48.340> there's<00:03:48.490> always

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
collecting them because there's always

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.520 
collecting them because there's always
some<00:03:48.880> people<00:03:49.090> wanted<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.360> buy<00:03:49.540> them<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.020> I

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
some people wanted to buy them and I

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.990 
some people wanted to buy them and I
mean<00:03:50.650> obviously<00:03:50.950> like<00:03:51.040> five<00:03:51.370> or<00:03:51.520> six<00:03:51.550> mil<00:03:51.880> to

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
mean obviously like five or six mil to

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.610 
mean obviously like five or six mil to
save<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.360> a<00:03:52.570> little<00:03:52.660> bit<00:03:52.810> more<00:03:53.020> time<00:03:53.290> isn't

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
save you a little bit more time isn't

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.050 
save you a little bit more time isn't
too<00:03:53.830> big<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.100> a<00:03:54.190> deal<00:03:54.340> for<00:03:54.370> most<00:03:54.610> people<00:03:54.910> but

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
too big of a deal for most people but

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.030 
too big of a deal for most people but
that<00:03:55.510> five<00:03:55.780> or<00:03:55.990> six<00:03:56.170> mil<00:03:56.380> is<00:03:56.560> pretty<00:03:56.860> big

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
that five or six mil is pretty big

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.380 
that five or six mil is pretty big
profit<00:03:57.340> because<00:03:57.490> you<00:03:57.580> can<00:03:57.730> make<00:03:57.880> it<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.209> like

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
profit because you can make it and like

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.949 
profit because you can make it and like
I'm<00:03:58.840> gonna<00:03:59.020> guess<00:03:59.260> like<00:03:59.440> an<00:03:59.530> hour<00:03:59.680> so<00:04:00.810> once<00:04:01.810> you

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
I'm gonna guess like an hour so once you

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.740 
I'm gonna guess like an hour so once you
get<00:04:02.080> a<00:04:02.140> little<00:04:02.170> 55<00:04:02.680> definition<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:04.570> will

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
get a little 55 definition you will

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.420 
get a little 55 definition you will
actually<00:04:05.080> be<00:04:05.170> getting<00:04:05.350> double<00:04:05.770> of<00:04:05.980> the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
actually be getting double of the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.820 
actually be getting double of the
energies<00:04:06.850> whenever<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.450> your<00:04:08.140> what<00:04:08.709> do<00:04:08.770> you

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
energies whenever you your what do you

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.110 
energies whenever you your what do you
want<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.010> call<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.190> siphoning<00:04:09.610> these<00:04:09.790> things<00:04:10.030> I

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
want to call it siphoning these things I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.160 
want to call it siphoning these things I
don't<00:04:10.180> really<00:04:10.360> know<00:04:10.480> it's<00:04:10.720> like<00:04:10.870> it's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
don't really know it's like it's

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.229 
don't really know it's like it's
freaking<00:04:11.470> weird<00:04:11.680> ass<00:04:11.830> things<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:13.120> yeah<00:04:13.180> you

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
freaking weird ass things but yeah you

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.540 
freaking weird ass things but yeah you
do<00:04:13.450> start<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.720> get<00:04:13.870> doubles<00:04:14.350> ever<00:04:15.130> since<00:04:15.370> then

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
do start to get doubles ever since then

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.979 
do start to get doubles ever since then
you<00:04:15.700> would<00:04:15.850> just<00:04:15.970> get<00:04:16.120> one<00:04:16.390> for<00:04:16.660> every<00:04:16.810> single

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
you would just get one for every single

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.840 
you would just get one for every single
time<00:04:17.140> you<00:04:17.290> get<00:04:17.410> one<00:04:17.470> memory<00:04:17.919> Nerva<00:04:18.130> Tori<00:04:18.370> but

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
time you get one memory Nerva Tori but

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.400 
time you get one memory Nerva Tori but
now<00:04:18.970> you<00:04:19.030> get<00:04:19.270> double<00:04:19.660> every<00:04:19.840> time<00:04:20.020> to<00:04:20.140> get<00:04:20.260> one

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
now you get double every time to get one

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.020 
now you get double every time to get one
memory<00:04:20.709> all<00:04:20.919> these<00:04:21.100> weird<00:04:21.400> ads<00:04:21.549> name<00:04:21.760> is<00:04:21.850> Isis

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
memory all these weird ads name is Isis

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.400 
memory all these weird ads name is Isis
right<00:04:22.150> it<00:04:22.240> sounds<00:04:22.570> so<00:04:22.780> confusing<00:04:23.260> it's<00:04:23.350> you

last thing explained in this video you
guys<00:04:26.110> see<00:04:26.440> happening

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
guys see happening

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.950 
guys see happening
as<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.370> am<00:04:27.490> teleporting<00:04:28.030> with<00:04:28.120> my<00:04:28.270> circuit<00:04:28.780> ring

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
as I am teleporting with my circuit ring

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.600 
as I am teleporting with my circuit ring
the<00:04:29.230> sixth<00:04:29.830> age<00:04:29.980> I<00:04:30.160> think<00:04:30.220> it's<00:04:30.430> called

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
the sixth age I think it's called

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.240 
the sixth age I think it's called
right-clicking<00:04:31.450> right<00:04:31.630> now<00:04:31.780> I<00:04:31.810> have<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:32.230> on<00:04:32.290> me

right-clicking right now I have it on me

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.420 
right-clicking right now I have it on me
yes<00:04:34.120> fixed<00:04:34.510> age<00:04:34.660> circuit<00:04:35.140> ring<00:04:35.290> that<00:04:36.070> is<00:04:36.220> from

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
yes fixed age circuit ring that is from

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.690 
yes fixed age circuit ring that is from
the<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.910> quest<00:04:38.010> no<00:04:39.010> it's<00:04:39.160> not<00:04:39.220> well<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.370> got<00:04:39.550> six

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
the the quest no it's not well I got six

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.610 
the the quest no it's not well I got six
sleeps<00:04:39.940> it's<00:04:40.180> uh<00:04:40.330> the<00:04:40.690> last<00:04:40.960> master<00:04:41.290> quest

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
sleeps it's uh the last master quest

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.400 
sleeps it's uh the last master quest
we've<00:04:41.770> had<00:04:42.450> it's<00:04:43.450> not<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.750> long<00:04:43.900> quest<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.320> be

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
we've had it's not that long quest to be

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.410 
we've had it's not that long quest to be
honest<00:04:44.650> but<00:04:44.770> anyways<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.280> yeah<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.210> ring

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
honest but anyways so yeah that ring

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.610 
honest but anyways so yeah that ring
right<00:04:46.510> there<00:04:46.570> teleports<00:04:47.140> you<00:04:47.230> to<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.470> altar

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
right there teleports you to the altar

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.650 
right there teleports you to the altar
use<00:04:48.490> those<00:04:48.700> little<00:04:48.940> orange<00:04:49.090> things<00:04:49.420> on<00:04:49.540> the

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
use those little orange things on the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.030 
use those little orange things on the
altar<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:49.990> can<00:04:50.170> only<00:04:50.290> collect<00:04:50.470> up<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:50.710> ten

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
altar you can only collect up the ten

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.440 
altar you can only collect up the ten
and<00:04:51.220> then<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.490> get<00:04:51.580> the<00:04:51.700> order<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:51.940> altar<00:04:52.240> use

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
and then you get the order the altar use

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.050 
and then you get the order the altar use
them<00:04:52.600> on<00:04:52.720> them<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.890> believe<00:04:53.950> it<00:04:54.460> gives<00:04:54.760> you

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
them on them and I believe it gives you

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.270 
them on them and I believe it gives you
not<00:04:55.720> exactly<00:04:56.050> sure<00:04:56.290> what<00:04:56.500> it<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:56.770> I<00:04:56.980> know<00:04:57.040> right

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
not exactly sure what it is I know right

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.460 
not exactly sure what it is I know right
now<00:04:57.430> I'm<00:04:57.580> not<00:04:58.000> like<00:04:58.120> level<00:04:58.360> 59<00:04:58.750> whatever<00:04:59.080> and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
now I'm not like level 59 whatever and

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.230 
now I'm not like level 59 whatever and
I'm<00:04:59.620> getting<00:04:59.860> like<00:05:00.010> almost<00:05:00.280> 900<00:05:00.850> experience

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
I'm getting like almost 900 experience

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.690 
I'm getting like almost 900 experience
we're<00:05:01.360> using<00:05:01.480> 10<00:05:01.750> of<00:05:01.840> them<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:02.410> it's<00:05:02.830> weird

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
we're using 10 of them so it's weird

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.540 
we're using 10 of them so it's weird
like<00:05:04.500> exactly<00:05:05.500> what<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.830> but<00:05:06.070> um<00:05:06.250> it's

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
like exactly what that is but um it's

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.490 
like exactly what that is but um it's
it's<00:05:06.820> definitely<00:05:07.000> not<00:05:07.360> just<00:05:07.630> like<00:05:07.960> take<00:05:08.260> your

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
it's definitely not just like take your

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.260 
it's definitely not just like take your
level<00:05:09.130> and<00:05:09.250> add<00:05:09.340> a<00:05:09.370> zero<00:05:09.700> at<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.910> ending<00:05:10.150> it's

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
level and add a zero at the ending it's

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.750 
level and add a zero at the ending it's
a<00:05:10.600> little<00:05:10.750> bit<00:05:10.840> more<00:05:11.020> than<00:05:11.140> that<00:05:11.230> so<00:05:11.760> yeah

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
a little bit more than that so yeah

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.830 
a little bit more than that so yeah
whatever<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.090> math<00:05:13.240> is<00:05:13.420> ready<00:05:13.630> you<00:05:13.720> guys

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
whatever the math is ready you guys

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.690 
whatever the math is ready you guys
figure<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.470> out<00:05:14.560> but<00:05:14.770> yeah<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.520> would

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
figure it out but yeah I would

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.800 
figure it out but yeah I would
definitely<00:05:16.000> recommend<00:05:16.060> collecting<00:05:16.720> these

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
definitely recommend collecting these

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.540 
definitely recommend collecting these
things<00:05:17.140> if<00:05:17.830> you<00:05:17.890> guys<00:05:18.100> want<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.370> know<00:05:18.400> my

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
things if you guys want to know my

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.280 
things if you guys want to know my
hunter<00:05:18.910> experience<00:05:19.300> daily<00:05:19.630> right<00:05:19.780> now<00:05:19.900> it's

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
hunter experience daily right now it's

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.410 
hunter experience daily right now it's
actually<00:05:20.620> 500<00:05:21.070> thousand<00:05:21.520> which<00:05:22.150> is<00:05:22.180> very

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
actually 500 thousand which is very

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.970 
actually 500 thousand which is very
surprising<00:05:22.960> but<00:05:23.050> each<00:05:23.260> time<00:05:23.500> you<00:05:23.620> collect<00:05:23.800> one

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
surprising but each time you collect one

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.280 
surprising but each time you collect one
of<00:05:24.100> these<00:05:24.190> little<00:05:24.520> orange<00:05:24.670> things<00:05:24.970> it<00:05:25.630> is<00:05:25.840> it's

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
of these little orange things it is it's

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.050 
of these little orange things it is it's
one<00:05:26.530> thousand<00:05:27.130> red<00:05:27.250> experience<00:05:27.550> for<00:05:27.700> me<00:05:27.820> I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
one thousand red experience for me I

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.840 
one thousand red experience for me I
believe<00:05:28.540> that<00:05:28.780> one<00:05:29.020> goes<00:05:29.890> by<00:05:30.190> it<00:05:30.250> takes<00:05:30.700> your

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
believe that one goes by it takes your

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.250 
believe that one goes by it takes your
level<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:31.150> add<00:05:31.300> to<00:05:31.450> zero<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:31.870> if<00:05:31.960> your<00:05:32.050> result

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
level and add to zero so if your result

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.630 
level and add to zero so if your result
will<00:05:32.290> 70<00:05:32.680> hundred<00:05:33.010> I'm<00:05:33.070> guessing<00:05:33.430> together

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
will 70 hundred I'm guessing together

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.340 
will 70 hundred I'm guessing together
you<00:05:34.030> can<00:05:34.120> get<00:05:34.210> seven<00:05:34.600> or<00:05:34.630> Hunter<00:05:34.930> experience

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
you can get seven or Hunter experience

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.080

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
one of the fairy rings which I believe

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.250 
one of the fairy rings which I believe
it's<00:05:44.800> a<00:05:45.060> kr<00:05:46.060> or<00:05:46.090> something<00:05:46.480> like<00:05:46.540> that<00:05:46.630> I'm<00:05:47.050> you

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
it's a kr or something like that I'm you

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.630 
it's a kr or something like that I'm you
can<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.560> look<00:05:47.740> it<00:05:47.890> up<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.100> you'll<00:05:48.220> see<00:05:48.250> but

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
can just look it up and you'll see but

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.280 
can just look it up and you'll see but
yeah<00:05:48.790> I<00:05:48.820> just<00:05:49.060> use<00:05:49.210> a<00:05:49.240> crack<00:05:49.570> with<00:05:49.840> my<00:05:49.870> like

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
yeah I just use a crack with my like

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.660 
yeah I just use a crack with my like
whatever<00:05:50.620> 50<00:05:50.860> something<00:05:51.130> summoning<00:05:51.550> its

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
whatever 50 something summoning its

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.000 
whatever 50 something summoning its
requirement<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:53.020> you<00:05:53.050> get<00:05:53.260> there<00:05:53.440> just<00:05:53.830> a

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
requirement and you get there just a

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.050 
requirement and you get there just a
little<00:05:54.070> bit<00:05:54.340> quicker<00:05:54.550> I<00:05:54.730> guess<00:05:54.970> because

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
little bit quicker I guess because

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.970 
little bit quicker I guess because
you're<00:05:55.240> not<00:05:55.330> the<00:05:55.420> wait<00:05:55.570> for<00:05:55.690> the<00:05:55.780> fairings

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
you're not the wait for the fairings

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.560 
you're not the wait for the fairings
but<00:05:57.430> yeah<00:05:57.610> that's<00:05:57.730> basically<00:05:57.880> the<00:05:58.240> method<00:05:58.510> I

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
but yeah that's basically the method I

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.960 
but yeah that's basically the method I
used<00:05:58.750> for<00:05:59.140> level<00:05:59.500> 50<00:05:59.800> hopefully<00:06:00.610> tomorrow<00:06:00.790> I

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 
used for level 50 hopefully tomorrow I

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.810 
used for level 50 hopefully tomorrow I
can<00:06:01.120> get<00:06:01.240> like<00:06:01.330> level<00:06:01.630> 60<00:06:01.960> -<00:06:02.230> maybe<00:06:02.530> like<00:06:02.680> 65<00:06:03.460> or

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
can get like level 60 - maybe like 65 or

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.490 
can get like level 60 - maybe like 65 or
maybe<00:06:03.970> even<00:06:04.000> close<00:06:04.360> level<00:06:04.600> 70<00:06:04.990> depending<00:06:05.380> on

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
maybe even close level 70 depending on

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.130 
maybe even close level 70 depending on
if<00:06:06.250> they<00:06:06.850> update<00:06:07.210> this<00:06:07.420> in<00:06:07.630> any<00:06:07.780> way<00:06:07.870> or

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140 
if they update this in any way or

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.470 
if they update this in any way or
something<00:06:08.380> like<00:06:08.440> that<00:06:08.650> I<00:06:09.520> guess<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.210> can<00:06:10.360> do<00:06:10.450> a

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
something like that I guess I can do a

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.700 
something like that I guess I can do a
little<00:06:10.630> warmer<00:06:10.900> talk<00:06:11.110> over<00:06:11.350> about<00:06:11.530> other

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
little warmer talk over about other

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.740 
little warmer talk over about other
things<00:06:12.040> like<00:06:12.310> if<00:06:12.910> I<00:06:13.060> want<00:06:13.270> them<00:06:13.420> to<00:06:13.510> get<00:06:13.600> this

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
things like if I want them to get this

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.300 
things like if I want them to get this
experience<00:06:14.140> if<00:06:14.440> I<00:06:14.530> want<00:06:14.680> this<00:06:14.830> to<00:06:15.010> get<00:06:15.130> more

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
experience if I want this to get more

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.310 
experience if I want this to get more
