00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.730

 the knmi i've been there 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.130
 stand 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.110
 from this 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.640
 the new one can soak in detail 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 you that you go this well 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.310
 continue and then the lead 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.940
 through my officials 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
 I can't sit in both parties 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.290
 for sam cooper 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.290
 yahoo 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.639
 in the hands 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.639
 and no one who is a Moroccan with a controller 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.069
 the whole line 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.989
 would be for me 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.989
 for years for a year 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.389
 the entire month of January 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.909
 Quran 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.639
 pauline 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.639
 why not entirely true 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:47.700
 can you find out what you think for years 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.700
 smaller than a year earlier a day earlier 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.199
 the device but why 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.589
 m who is running 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.589
 i have my childhood 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.759
 a month earlier 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.799
 very unfortunate that the disaster 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 been there for a few years 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.789
 then you finish me off 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:14.489
 can just make that 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.489
 there seems to be some parallel to each other 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.609
 get in there 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:40.179
 why 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.269
 countries participating in 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.359
 4 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.399
 the new center 

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:08.399
 worry about it 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.659
 I don't think so 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.390
 but we have together 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.549
 only then can he be 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.689
 and I arrive 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:22.879
 if not when the bank 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:24.430
 quite a bit then 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.300
 but yes there is also a baby 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.699
 very unfortunate dude I leave 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.430
 this year then another 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.430
 next year only one such england 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.580
 horn anp 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.240
 b and w 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.240
 so there would be a summer 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:50.939
 the 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:53.449
 before and
