00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Today, July 3, finally after 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.030
 a three-week cold snap has come 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.320
 truly warm weather and immediately became 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.540
 noticeable growth 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 tomatoes in the greenhouse especially it became 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.240
 seen on tall bushes including 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.080
 new tomatoes started appearing 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.869
 flower brushes and ovaries 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.600
 in this video i will tell you how 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.469
 increase the number of ovaries at the tomatoes and 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.230
 also how to standardize the fruits in the hand 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.239
 tomatoes are a pollinated plant itself 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.539
 there are stamens and pistils they are 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.570
 in one flower but with additional 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.579
 pollinating crop of tomatoes several 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.520
 tomatoes are very rarely pollinated 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:01.250
 insects because bees and bumblebees 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.250
 do not visit tomato greenhouses 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.110
 also still have such insects dust 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.700
 or like ants 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:16.060
 but more often they do not crawl on the stalks 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.850
 in tomatoes because their tomato smell 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.180
 scares therefore it is advisable to hold 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.670
 hand pollinating tomatoes ie 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:29.640
 self- pollination is carried out 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:34.690
 only in the morning when pollen is still 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 viable and sunny to 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:41.080
 the pollen was dry 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.920
 an hour before pollination open at the greenhouse 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.950
 all doors and air vents to air 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.899
 dried accordingly to dry 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.000
 after night pollen 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.790
 so that pollen moves from stamens to 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.910
 pistils 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.000
 I need to shake the plant is convenient for me 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.180
 do for the wire which i have 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.869
 stretched over the top and from shaking off 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.150
 several bushes and to pollination 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.730
 passed completely 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:19.820
 you need to sprinkle floral brushes from the jackal 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:24.020
 add 2-3 drops per liter of water 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:28.040
 alcoholic boric acid solution 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.800
 such a trace element as boron contributes 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.750
 fruit set 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.290
 let's break the rationing of the ovaries 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.650
 on the example of one floral brush here 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.440
 look at this flower brush here 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.820
 already the first four fruits began to emerge 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.489
 there are still two flowers and a brush 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.150
 ends with buds that are not yet 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.000
 had time 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.690
 bloom these same buds 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.180
 remove if you grow 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.150
 large tomatoes and want to get 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.450
 really great fruits in such 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:16.799
 case, leave no more than 2 4 in the brush 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.250
 fruits then all fruits will be big 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.310
 I tried to fit in this video 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:27.120
 talk about how to pollinate tomatoes and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.549
 how to ration fruit in the brush if you 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.659
