you<00:01:13.619> know<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.860> protect<00:01:14.220> their<00:01:14.340> faces<00:01:14.729> they

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
you know they protect their faces they

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.580 
you know they protect their faces they
protect<00:01:15.150> their<00:01:15.270> body<00:01:15.450> when<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.320> flown

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
up in the air by explosions they try and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.969 
up in the air by explosions they try and
grab<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.049> certain<00:01:19.350> things<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.770> in

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
grab on to certain things you know in

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.100 
grab on to certain things you know in
order<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.790> preserve<00:01:21.180> their<00:01:21.390> lives<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.990> mean

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
order to to preserve their lives I mean

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230 
order to to preserve their lives I mean
these<00:01:22.200> are<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.590> bipedal<00:01:23.549> digital

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
these are little bipedal digital

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.760 
these are little bipedal digital
characters<00:01:24.689> running<00:01:24.930> around<00:01:25.110> for<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> first

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
characters running around for the first

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.249 
characters running around for the first
time<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.369> kind<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.670> cool<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.180> mean<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
time it's kind of cool I mean so that is

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.420 
time it's kind of cool I mean so that is
a<00:01:28.290> technology<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.040> feel<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.369> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a technology that we feel is going to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.980 
a technology that we feel is going to
revolutionize<00:01:29.579> gameplay<00:01:30.329> specifically

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
revolutionize gameplay specifically

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
revolutionize gameplay specifically
because<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.500> payoff<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:32.040> never<00:01:32.490> ever<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
because the payoff is never ever the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.399 
because the payoff is never ever the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
that's what we have going on it's

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.940 
that's what we have going on it's
critical<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.519> the<00:03:33.640> sign<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.880> this<00:03:33.940> game<00:03:34.150> oh<00:03:34.950> I'm

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950

their doom you see this guy hanging on
for<00:03:49.959> dear<00:03:50.019> life<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.680> is<00:03:50.830> not<00:03:51.100> an<00:03:51.250> animation

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
for dear life that is not an animation

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.930 
for dear life that is not an animation
that<00:03:51.730> is<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.090> behavioral<00:03:52.870> AI<00:03:53.820> simulation<00:03:54.820> this

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
that is a behavioral AI simulation this

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.729 
that is a behavioral AI simulation this
is<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.090> truly<00:03:55.420> simulated<00:03:56.019> game<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.380> that's<00:03:56.470> why

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
is a truly simulated game and that's why

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:57.540 
is a truly simulated game and that's why
we<00:03:56.769> feel<00:03:57.010> like<00:03:57.100> this<00:03:57.250> is<00:03:57.340> going<00:03:57.489> to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
we feel like this is going to

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.610 
we feel like this is going to
revolutionize<00:03:57.670> gameplay<00:03:58.540> we're<00:03:59.050> not<00:03:59.230> talking
