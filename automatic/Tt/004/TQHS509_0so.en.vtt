the<00:01:51.930> voltage<00:01:52.260> from<00:01:52.380> each<00:01:52.590> cell<00:01:52.890> each<00:01:53.310> lemon<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
the voltage from each cell each lemon is

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.510 
the voltage from each cell each lemon is
one<00:01:54.300> cell<00:01:54.690> this<00:01:55.200> works<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:55.920> chemical

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
one cell this works because of chemical

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.640 
one cell this works because of chemical
reactions<00:01:57.060> inside<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.960> lemon<00:01:58.260> so<00:01:58.500> what's

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
reactions inside of the lemon so what's

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.710 
reactions inside of the lemon so what's
happening<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.610> when<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.150> zinc<00:02:00.390> comes

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
happening in here is when the zinc comes

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.570 
happening in here is when the zinc comes
in<00:02:00.870> contact<00:02:01.080> with<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.560> asset<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.190> lemon

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
in contact with the asset of the lemon

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.550 
in contact with the asset of the lemon
it<00:02:02.729> begins<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.570> chemical<00:02:03.900> reaction<00:02:04.170> oxidation

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it begins a chemical reaction oxidation

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.770 
it begins a chemical reaction oxidation
which<00:02:05.190> is<00:02:05.340> kind<00:02:05.760> of<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.940> rust<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> hits

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
which is kind of like rust when it hits

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900 
which is kind of like rust when it hits
oxygen<00:02:07.260> once<00:02:07.650> wired<00:02:07.890> together<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.460> electrons

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
oxygen once wired together the electrons

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.490 
oxygen once wired together the electrons
are<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.179> to<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.360> pulled<00:02:09.630> from<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.259> zinc

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
are going to be pulled from the zinc

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
are going to be pulled from the zinc
through<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.160> wire<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.610> into<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.510> copper

it<00:02:44.310> works<00:02:44.550> we're<00:02:45.239> doing<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.630> with<00:02:45.840> lemon<00:02:46.489> did

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
it works we're doing this with lemon did

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.640 
it works we're doing this with lemon did
a<00:02:47.520> few<00:02:47.670> other<00:02:47.850> things<00:02:48.019> okay<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.080> we<00:02:49.290> can<00:02:49.440> light

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
a few other things okay so we can light

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.039 
a few other things okay so we can light
an<00:02:49.860> LED<00:02:49.980> but<00:02:50.730> what<00:02:51.330> else<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.660> we<00:02:51.780> power<00:02:51.930> with

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
an LED but what else can we power with

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.009 
an LED but what else can we power with
lemon<00:02:52.530> let's<00:02:52.799> try<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.850> clock<00:02:54.180> in<00:02:54.510> turn<00:02:54.750> Tory

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
lemon let's try a clock in turn Tory

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.140 
lemon let's try a clock in turn Tory
thank<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.920> clock

thank you clock
so<00:02:57.959> obviously<00:02:58.350> take<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.650> battery<00:02:59.010> out<00:02:59.070> figure

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
so obviously take the battery out figure

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.740 
so obviously take the battery out figure
out<00:02:59.580> which<00:02:59.730> one's<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> positive<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.690> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
out which one's the positive and the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.750 
out which one's the positive and the
negative<00:03:00.780> cuz<00:03:01.320> grab<00:03:01.620> those<00:03:01.830> here<00:03:02.100> right<00:03:02.519> this

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
negative cuz grab those here right this

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.330 
negative cuz grab those here right this
one<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.209> our<00:03:03.480> negative<00:03:04.110> great<00:03:04.739> let's<00:03:05.070> touch

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
one is our negative great let's touch

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.280 
one is our negative great let's touch
the<00:03:05.519> positive<00:03:05.970> one<00:03:06.120> there<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.180> that's<00:03:09.930> not

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
the positive one there and that's not

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.740 
the positive one there and that's not
the<00:03:10.560> right<00:03:10.739> time<00:03:11.040> not<00:03:11.519> even<00:03:11.820> cold<00:03:11.970> sadly<00:03:12.480> but

the right time not even cold sadly but
it's<00:03:12.930> powered<00:03:13.530> lemons<00:03:14.160> are<00:03:14.280> cool<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.670> didn't

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
it's powered lemons are cool I didn't

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.070 
it's powered lemons are cool I didn't
know<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.090> could<00:03:15.180> power<00:03:15.390> all<00:03:15.540> this<00:03:15.690> stuff<00:03:15.900> with

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
know you could power all this stuff with

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.330 
know you could power all this stuff with
lemons<00:03:16.350> how<00:03:16.470> many<00:03:16.620> lemons<00:03:16.830> do<00:03:17.070> you<00:03:17.130> think<00:03:17.250> it

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
lemons how many lemons do you think it

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.490 
lemons how many lemons do you think it
would<00:03:17.400> take<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:17.850> power<00:03:18.209> my<00:03:18.600> laptop<00:03:19.170> well
