00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.160
 we choose Spanish but it will not work but 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.050
 Spain 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.050
 but no matter what it is like this it will be mistakes 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.350
 but active 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.350
 go back and put it back 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:07.949
 convert it with seats 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.949

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.250
 let's ask him 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.250
 Hello 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.960
 Hello 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.490
 to wait 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.330
 and well let's go where there's more 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:42.379
 coverage and well let's ask her 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.379
 here to see if I know 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.690
 Hello 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.379
 and good as it works best is that the 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.610
 I was going to ask him 

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.610
 how are you 

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:06.839

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.440
 and good for you to answer us we are going to 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:24.300
 ask him 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.300
 I do not know what your name is 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.940
 and good as you can see now this 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:33.790
 it works perfectly and well this is 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.980
 just a matter of where services where 

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.710
 they have good internet culture and good 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.690
 I do not achieve this tutorial as they do 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:44.290
 some photos fourth generation our 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.850
 tutorial is incorrect only that in your 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.550
 account thanks can go pretty slow 

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.860
 I the xiria rolo I will erase since there is 

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.500
 m you can create the application the waters 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.420
 and that's why I restored it to do the 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.740
 video since it has a lot of tweets and 

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.590
 I would be sure he would not let me do 

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.540
 the tutorial good and good, because it has 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.160
 liked the video let's light the scare 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.500
 as these comments any doubt 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.210
 that they have and subscribe to the channel to be 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.370
 these videos about apple on tweets 

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.370
 etcetera and well let's go to the next bye
