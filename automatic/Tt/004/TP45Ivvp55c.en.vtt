 basic for the rural population and 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.849

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.259
 for educational promotion among those who 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.570

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.790
 social participation for parents 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.770

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.570
 organized way in maintaining 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.750
 school campuses that is very 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.420
 important this talk about how of the 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.340
 values ​​that you see sescam to children is 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.439
 Therefore, the council seeks to promote 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.810
 Parental involvement through 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.610
 of two aspects the intervention of the 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.250
 family in the educational process and the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.400
 school management for which he has designed 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.840
 materials focused on strengthening 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.550
 some companies with the same when 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.380
 practices with the father with the mother of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.140
 family you begin to realize that the 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.030
 student begins the approach to 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.560
 approach and especially in these 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.040
 workshops starts the day some because I 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.080
 because my son acts in this way this 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.670
 program involves participation 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.280
 active parents and 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.560

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.490
 also to monitor monitoring and 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.350
 surveillance 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.810

 a culture of participation and 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.060
 transparency I liked when we were 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.860
 talking about values ​​towards children 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.320
 in the future that to make them more 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 people 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.950
 would be done and the most important thing helps 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.170
 parents and children are more united even 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.720
 in the adolescence stage where he 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.820
 has achieved better coexistence with them and 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.729
 more openness in his talks of topics 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.119
 that foster a healthy development of 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.640
 common to tell you to know that this is lived 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.610
 sexuality before and now as 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.700
 it was lived that before then you see that the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.460
 two old boyfriends I touched because 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.039
 I was also in this also good 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.070
 it was not good but it did touch me is that I 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.289
 the boyfriend was coming to see me 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.300
 inside the fence and he outside never 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.500
 pita cop the tip of the fingers yes 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.660
 that he did not and he and he and he now 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.050
 supports once should that now seized 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.019
 hand and this and now they embrace 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.970
 they kiss us in these times 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.000
 there is also the family manual 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 and school to generate a better future than 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.380
 supports communities to ensure that their 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.299
 participation is extended to the aspects 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.140
 qualitative aspects of school achievement 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.720
 of their children 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.170
 and awaken their expectations around 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.170
 the education 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.370
 we work with parents in 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.280
 special to give guidance that 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.140
 support us in the aspect of not 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.910
 you just have to be asking 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.950
 example, go to school, but 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.580
 have a little more interest 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.310
 so that knowledge the child then 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.530
 the objective of the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.269
 Parent involvement strategy is 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.790
 contribute to the improvement of 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.709
 learnings creating close links 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.019
 between the family and the school that 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.269
 drive educational processes and 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.160
 school management actions in order 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.040
 to train people to participate 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.150
 Integrated productive and committed 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.700
 with your community differences you can 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.620
 have between them not so much in the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.830
 school but what is outside the 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.830
 school 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.570
 In the 2010-2011 cycle, the materials 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.050
 are implementing in 10 states without 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.970
 However, for the 2011-2012 school year 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.200
 the strategy will be implemented in the 31st 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.200
 States of the republic 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.500
 because what you are seeing has already 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.110
 explained to the children for the levels 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.450
 Initial preschool and primary 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.130
 they made transition materials that 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.440
 strengthen the participation of 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.030
 parents to help their children 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.920
 children to have the skills 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.920
 basic graduates of each level 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.160
 inside the drawing here although it 's very 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.160
 different than in fewer flights 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.229
 finally the material encounters with 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.630
 teenage families on the 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.460
 identity construction has as 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.979
 aim to create spaces where 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.110
 people meet with others not only 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.789
 to reflect but also to 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.979
 exchange and meet other 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.470
 experiences and ways of approaching 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.560
 situation that does not necessarily have to 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.419
 seen or understood as a problem has 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.759
 been basically through the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.009
 responsible community instructors 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:50.370
 of the group who are carrying out 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:52.550
 these talks with parents these 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.820
 workshops which have allowed 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.639
 know learn about some topics 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.800
 that previously they were not seen or 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.320
 they saw as a taboo as is the case with the 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.669
 sexuality, because I think that 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.810
 Parents will benefit 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.400
 have as a guide to 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.500
 for how to ask your children 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.660
 approaching them the values ​​are 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.410
 fundamental for the reputation of a 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.900
 child I think a child that grows up with 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.060
 firm values that has foundations 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.280
 firm since it can be a person of 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.520
 much profit for society 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.770
 If they support me as though 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.860
 half of them they put with me 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.080
 and then when you see that they get 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.449
 the posters no one that we read declines 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.150
 with your children, my mom starts reading with 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.150
 we choose a story 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.250
 as part of the most important achievements 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.129
 This program for parents 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.860
 we have found that children are 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.539
 they feel more supported the parents improve 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.669
 family coexistence and between 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.099
 people from your community 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.380
 Community instructors have better 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.419
 communication with parents and 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.370
 take advantage of their participation to raise 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:11.180
 the school performance of its students 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:13.639
 and most importantly helps parents and 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.740
 children are more united even in the 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.259
 stage of adolescence where it has 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.330
 achieved better coexistence with them and 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:24.580
 more openness in his talks of topics 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.580
 that encourage them to a healthy development
