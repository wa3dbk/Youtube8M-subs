 olive oil and cardiovascular health 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:12.849
 traditionally cardiovascular disease rates were 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.390
 significantly lower in the Mediterranean countries than in North America today 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.039
 the rest of europe 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.800
 the reason according to the scientists was the diet rich in fruits and vegetables 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.560
 blue fish and specially obtained 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.529
 for many years it has been believed that the fatty acids of olive oil 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.290
 allowed a drop in bad cholesterol and increase good cholesterol but 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.840
 Cordoban scientists inaugural now a new hypothesis that they hold that 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.040
 The real benefit of olive oil lies in its polyphenols 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.100
 Researchers from the University of CÃ³rdoba proved that the health of the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.080
 volunteers who took police filiation did not improve as much as the 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.150
 those who took originals 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.280
 penalties are very important biochemical compounds with properties 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.440
 Inti thrombotic antiinflammatory 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.390
 prevents the proliferation of pests in the corridors and generates circulation 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.390
 forcing the heart to pump more of cristina 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.360
 in Athens scientific scientists have done some research with more 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.610
 of 21 thousand volunteers and concluded that olive oil decreases the pressure 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.430
 arterial 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.140
 a third study that the university has in mind that in addition 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.730
 helps decrease body mass index 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.530
 insulin levels 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.609
 I have total cholesterol 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:33.140
 and triglycerides 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.470
 all this attention paid to scientists to the benefits of oil 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.350
 for the heart is not casual the world organization of health 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.140
 calculates that hypertension is the underlying cause in seven thousand deaths
