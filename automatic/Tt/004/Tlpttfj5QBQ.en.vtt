00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 international class sport between 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.230
 Others already Elena Radionov and this in 14 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.440
 years old 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.150
 silver medalist of the championship of Russia 2013 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 of the year and managed to wedge between 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.810
 Elizabeth Tuktamysheva and Adeline 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.570
 Sotnikova general while we talk about 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.689
 Rodionic all well wish her and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.529
 further progress but judging by 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:29.420
 Elena's relationship to the case 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.160
 if she is able to overcome normally 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 the process of adolescence growing up with 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.760
 so much of her character will be very much 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.760
 on the shoulder of the suntek movie she is correct 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.129
 but another completely triple conversation 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.320
 lutz-triple sheepskin coat hardest cascade 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.240
 even in previous warm-ups we have not seen 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.820
 both girls and triple toe double 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.820
 sheepskin jump and not always successful 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.650
 honey please in the second part of the program 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.970
 for the sake of these ten percent surcharge 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.819
 2 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.349
 jump elements audio triple 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.349
 rittberger and sends 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.010
 and chic absolutely final 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.620
 rotation fiction 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 brilliant just brilliant performance 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.390
 Elena Radionova and adults 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.700
 still a very young man nonetheless 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.770
 taking an incredibly complicated piece for 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.200
 their short program will feel 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.110
 Silva Fatty Particular Anna Karenina 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.090
 at 14 years old of course is incredibly difficult 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.280
 task but in my opinion with music with 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.860
 program Elena handled almost 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.690
 100 percent maybe some 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.900
 flaws and one could notice 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.430
 but here and so from the side practically 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.620
 perfect performance 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.370
 excellent glide with red 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.200
 track steps about rotation even talk 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.170
 doesn't make sense because well absolutely 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.330
 phenomenal maybe but don't know not 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.130
 should judges find fault maybe 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.790
 not a tiny circle was at 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.750
 performance 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:12.000
 triple lutz but in cascade and but not plus 3 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.060
 put and maybe plus 2 for 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.500
 landing from triple luca but it 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.919
 the hardest cascade is triple lutz-triple 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.840
 sheepskin jumps a very small number 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.660
 skaters in the world but in Russian 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.660
 level, well, do not say that every first and 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.820
 every second in the championship of Russia 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.610
 performs great with us perfectly 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.789
 young generation of girls or very sad 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.250
 that at the Olympics few can 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.500
 perform by age and not all 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.120
 will be able to break into the Olympic team 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:47.190
 because if you look after those 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.100
 athletes who can qualify 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.979
 on hit on olympiad that offhand 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.510
 56 min can be called, and besides that 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.880
 there will definitely be shadow 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.200
 applicants but Rodionova I am 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.660
 the challenger will not under any 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:05.130
 it is not yet by age 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.150
 suitable for the Olympics and passes but 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.060
 maybe korean himchan 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.180
 will become a city or on the radio but we will not 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.750
 yet hurry wait for our estimates 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.610
 sportswomen but also with incredible sadness 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.430
 I will inform you began to talk about Korea and 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.280
 remembered literally today it came 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.330
 the message that 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.400
 olympic champion and acting 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.640
 world champion and anakin and rather 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.260
 got seriously injured and miss 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.200
 about six weeks and well and 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.750
 accordingly will not take part in everything 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.240
 Grand Prix season first part of the season 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:44.460
 will pass without gorgeous 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.810
 shrimp elena radionova first place 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.300
 6460 nine hundredths point she 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.630
 setting a new personal record but 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.910
 good such a stock goes to the first 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.910
 line of today's competition
