00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.590
 so the corsin ability prevents the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.240
 pokemon stages of lowering it has ten 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.959
 dates because of defense following of 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.599
 special attacks 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.330

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.640

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.799
 directly after receiving your 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.569

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.909
 always once you take back your 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.299
