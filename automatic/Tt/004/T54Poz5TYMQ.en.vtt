not a whole lot that's really important

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.839 
not a whole lot that's really important
in<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.410> grand<00:02:19.620> scheme<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.310> things<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.700> know

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849

you know some of them they show up the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.550 
you know some of them they show up the
top<00:02:23.610> once<00:02:23.879> it's<00:02:24.360> done<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.840> know<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.170> you

top once it's done you know it's you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.390 
top once it's done you know it's you
know<00:02:25.620> it's<00:02:26.190> just<00:02:26.310> done<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.090> know<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.860> guess

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
let's let's move on to the animation so

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.910 
let's let's move on to the animation so
I<00:03:29.519> know<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:30.209> thing<00:03:30.480> was<00:03:30.660> made<00:03:30.959> like<00:03:31.319> a<00:03:31.590> long

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
I know this thing was made like a long

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.180 
I know this thing was made like a long
time<00:03:32.549> ago<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.359> I<00:03:33.389> like<00:03:33.750> yet<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.440> can't<00:03:34.739> judge

time ago so I like yet you can't judge

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.879 
time ago so I like yet you can't judge
it<00:03:35.400> too<00:03:35.639> hard<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.209> know<00:03:36.290> cuz<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.650> they

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
it too hard you know cuz you know they

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.949 
it too hard you know cuz you know they
don't<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.160> they<00:03:39.120> didn't<00:03:39.359> even<00:03:39.419> have<00:03:39.599> feet

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959

don't have they didn't even have feet
zero<00:03:40.230> back<00:03:40.470> then<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.919> know<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.099> they<00:03:41.220> didn't

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
zero back then you know what they didn't

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.030 
zero back then you know what they didn't
even<00:03:41.519> know<00:03:41.819> what<00:03:42.000> good<00:03:42.180> animation<00:03:42.720> was

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
even know what good animation was

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.770 
even know what good animation was
they're<00:03:44.040> like<00:03:44.220> what<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.669> alien<00:03:45.180> concept

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
they're like what is this alien concept

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.140 
they're like what is this alien concept
so<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.380> can't<00:03:46.650> be<00:03:46.799> too<00:03:46.829> hard<00:03:47.430> but<00:03:47.669> it's<00:03:47.880> still

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
so you can't be too hard but it's still

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.680 
so you can't be too hard but it's still
you<00:03:49.109> know<00:03:49.139> it's<00:03:49.530> still<00:03:49.680> not<00:03:50.459> very<00:03:50.970> good<00:03:51.150> you

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
you know it's still not very good you

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.479 
you know it's still not very good you
know<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.139> these<00:03:52.319> lasers<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.280> they

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
know they have these lasers and they

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.640 
know they have these lasers and they
just<00:03:53.669> the<00:03:54.450> layers<00:03:54.690> they<00:03:54.959> just<00:03:55.139> like<00:03:55.290> they<00:03:55.410> pop

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
just the layers they just like they pop

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.500 
just the layers they just like they pop
up<00:03:55.859> and<00:03:56.040> they<00:03:56.250> go<00:03:56.400> away<00:03:56.489> it's<00:03:57.180> like<00:03:57.269> like

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
up and they go away it's like like

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.629 
up and they go away it's like like
where's<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.109> bloom<00:03:58.349> or<00:03:58.980> is<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.250> papow

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
know that's not how lasers work so I

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.490 
know that's not how lasers work so I
can't<00:04:06.060> I<00:04:06.299> can't<00:04:06.630> score<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.079> variate<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
can't I can't score the variate the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.099 
can't I can't score the variate the
animation<00:04:08.160> very<00:04:08.400> highly<00:04:08.790> here<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.510> let's<00:04:09.930> just

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
animation very highly here so let's just

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:15.770 
animation very highly here so let's just
let's<00:04:10.560> move<00:04:10.919> on<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.310> sound

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.800 

so<00:04:16.780> for<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.410> sound<00:04:18.120> used<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.269> bunch<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:19.630> like

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
so for the sound used a bunch of like

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.920 
so for the sound used a bunch of like
classical<00:04:20.799> like<00:04:21.070> opera<00:04:21.790> stuff<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.420> know<00:04:22.540> it's

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
classical like opera stuff you know it's

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.570 
classical like opera stuff you know it's
like<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.260> stuff<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.770> find<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.280> like<00:04:24.430> my

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
like the stuff that I find it like my

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.970 
like the stuff that I find it like my
grandparents<00:04:25.330> house<00:04:25.530> yeah<00:04:26.530> it's<00:04:26.740> probably

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
grandparents house yeah it's probably

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.920 
grandparents house yeah it's probably
public<00:04:27.730> domain<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.480> they<00:04:28.600> didn't<00:04:28.750> even<00:04:28.780> have

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
public domain so they didn't even have

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.560 
public domain so they didn't even have
to<00:04:29.110> pay<00:04:29.320> for<00:04:29.380> it<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.100> it's<00:04:30.370> pretty<00:04:30.550> lazy<00:04:30.910> he

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
to pay for it so it's pretty lazy he

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.830 
to pay for it so it's pretty lazy he
