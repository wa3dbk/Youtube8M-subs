00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
water and you can do a large number at a

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.789 
water and you can do a large number at a
time<00:03:37.459> but<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.330> rigid<00:03:39.780> crates<00:03:40.440> and

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
time but I like the rigid crates and

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.470 
time but I like the rigid crates and
there<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.310> could<00:03:41.430> probably<00:03:41.579> do<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.850> milk<00:03:42.239> crate

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
there you could probably do a milk crate

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.539 
there you could probably do a milk crate
you<00:03:42.959> could<00:03:43.110> do<00:03:43.200> with<00:03:43.320> other<00:03:43.500> things<00:03:43.890> I<00:03:44.130> was

even<00:03:44.820> that<00:03:44.910> looking<00:03:45.239> that's<00:03:45.360> like<00:03:45.600> some

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
even that looking that's like some

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.660 
even that looking that's like some
laundry<00:03:46.079> baskets<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.130> have<00:03:47.310> quite<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.579> few

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
laundry baskets that have quite a few

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.120 
laundry baskets that have quite a few
thought<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.660> line<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.530> and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
thought and you can line that and and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.490 
thought and you can line that and and
