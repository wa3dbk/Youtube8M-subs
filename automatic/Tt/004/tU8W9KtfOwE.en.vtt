00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
year I'm going to click the gear and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.130 
year I'm going to click the gear and
fast<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.210> direction<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:07.110> guaranteed<00:01:07.770> to

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
fast in the direction I'm guaranteed to

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.260 
fast in the direction I'm guaranteed to
get<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.200> however<00:01:10.890> if<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.580> wasn't<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.030> collect

one of the balls with books early a
won't<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.010> anything<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:15.540> timer<00:01:16.020> will

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
won't do anything and a timer will

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.040 
won't do anything and a timer will
appear<00:01:16.500> as<00:01:16.770> soon<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.520> goes<00:01:18.510> into<00:01:18.780> there

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
appear as soon as that goes into there

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.270 
appear as soon as that goes into there
and<00:01:19.229> once<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> timer<00:01:20.460> runs<00:01:20.550> out<00:01:20.820> i<00:01:20.880> am<00:01:22.280> it'll

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and once the timer runs out i am it'll

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
and once the timer runs out i am it'll
wouldn't<00:01:23.940> do<00:01:24.030> while<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:27.710> what

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
wouldn't do while just on that so I what

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.210 
wouldn't do while just on that so I what
I<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.400> fast<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.850> possible<00:01:31.220> but

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
I want to do it as fast as possible but

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.590 
I want to do it as fast as possible but
it<00:01:32.340> gives<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.610> plenty<00:01:32.940> of<00:01:33.090> time<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.510> don't

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
it gives you plenty of time you don't

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.330 
it gives you plenty of time you don't
you<00:01:33.780> worry<00:01:33.960> about<00:01:34.079> time<00:01:34.409> especially<00:01:34.920> since

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
you worry about time especially since

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.609 
you worry about time especially since
there's<00:01:35.520> no<00:01:35.640> annoying<00:01:35.880> enemies<00:01:36.240> around<00:01:36.719> to

hit you during the process which will

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.560

thing and when you get here while
holding<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.659> thing<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.140> drop<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.759> switch

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
holding the thing you drop it I switch

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.780 
holding the thing you drop it I switch
the<00:01:50.850> towers<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.479> open<00:01:52.170> these

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.440 

and<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.479> switch<00:01:57.810> jump<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.310> it<00:02:00.060> opens

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
and the switch jump on it and it opens

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.270 
and the switch jump on it and it opens
up<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.870> last<00:02:01.140> area<00:02:01.409> i<00:02:01.620> was<00:02:01.800> talking<00:02:02.040> about

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
up that last area i was talking about

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.910 
up that last area i was talking about
but<00:02:02.940> only<00:02:03.240> got<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.540> now<00:02:03.750> i<00:02:04.050> want<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> come

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
but only got that now i want to come

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:16.790 
but only got that now i want to come
across<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.540> let's<00:02:13.110> like<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.590> DS<00:02:15.800> and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
across it and let's like all the DS and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.180 
across it and let's like all the DS and
alive

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.190 

I<00:02:21.280> think<00:02:22.210> it's<00:02:22.330> weird<00:02:22.510> how<00:02:22.810> we're<00:02:23.020> just

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
I think it's weird how we're just

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.150 
I think it's weird how we're just
hanging<00:02:23.440> off<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> edge<00:02:23.800> there<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.660> anyway

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
hanging off the edge there but anyway

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.570 
hanging off the edge there but anyway
let's<00:02:27.300> go<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.620> new<00:02:29.800> area<00:02:30.100> because<00:02:30.460> we

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
let's go to that new area because we

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.120 
let's go to that new area because we
completed<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.260> pretty<00:02:32.260> much<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.830> whole<00:02:32.860> level

because<00:05:10.169> there's<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.620> current<00:05:10.860> pushed<00:05:11.220> me<00:05:11.400> off

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
because there's a current pushed me off

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.150 
because there's a current pushed me off
the<00:05:11.550> edge<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.210> that's<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.690> while<00:05:12.960> fall<00:05:13.199> so<00:05:13.650> if<00:05:14.040> I

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
the edge and that's a while fall so if I

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.469 
the edge and that's a while fall so if I
go<00:05:14.190> off<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.460> edge<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.760> im<00:05:14.820> gonna<00:05:14.940> fall<00:05:15.240> far

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
go off the edge and im gonna fall far

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.360 
go off the edge and im gonna fall far
but<00:05:16.440> I'm<00:05:16.560> going<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.770> go<00:05:16.860> against<00:05:17.070> a<00:05:17.190> current

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
but I'm going to go against a current

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.340 
but I'm going to go against a current
which<00:05:17.610> will<00:05:17.669> be<00:05:17.880> slow<00:05:18.120> but<00:05:18.419> it'll<00:05:18.870> get<00:05:19.169> me

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
which will be slow but it'll get me

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.969 
which will be slow but it'll get me
these<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:23.720> this<00:05:24.720> is<00:05:24.870> circular<00:05:25.290> island<00:05:25.710> so

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
these and this is circular island so

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:28.250 
these and this is circular island so
once<00:05:26.190> i<00:05:26.340> get<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.970> that<00:05:27.360> one<00:05:27.570> that<00:05:27.780> should<00:05:28.229> be

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
once i get to that one that should be

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.520 
once i get to that one that should be
pushing<00:05:28.740> me<00:05:28.919> around<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:30.320> fast<00:05:32.780> yeah<00:05:33.780> see<00:05:34.320> is

pushing me around it fast yeah see is
pushing<00:05:34.860> me<00:05:34.950> around<00:05:35.040> that<00:05:35.550> direction<00:05:35.940> fairly

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
there's someone the wrong world but

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.370 
there's someone the wrong world but
let's<00:06:01.320> get<00:06:01.470> out<00:06:01.560> of<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:02.810> if<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:04.020> are<00:06:04.140> on<00:06:04.290> the

let's get out of it if you are on the

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.960 
let's get out of it if you are on the
top<00:06:04.530> of<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:04.740> water<00:06:04.920> the<00:06:05.280> current<00:06:05.640> is<00:06:05.760> more

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
top of the water the current is more

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.880 
top of the water the current is more
effective<00:06:06.450> so<00:06:06.840> you<00:06:06.930> want<00:06:07.170> to<00:06:07.290> say<00:06:07.440> underwater

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
effective so you want to say underwater

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.970 
effective so you want to say underwater
