00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.240
 we are already seeing the images of 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.879
 summary of the final of the argos league 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.130
 futsal real bucaramanga received in the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.630
 Bicentennial Coliseum to Condors x Lite 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.000
 the series was winning the team 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.710
 Bogotano and here also the day up 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.529
 on the scoreboard through 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.439
 sebastián inns thus placed the 0 by 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.250
 1 the auction was julian days and josé 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:35.350
 bravo that bounced the Bogotanos already 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.660
 they were taking out the revenues from their 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.430
 ephemeral but effective attacks here 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.980
 we have left for one 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.560
 angelo claro was the one that finished and is 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.360
 way the real shares were matched 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.670
 Bucaramanga attacked more condors 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.470
 light retreated and was against hitting 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 as in this opportunity in which 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.280
 julián díaz at minute 18 and 1 at two 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.650
 mentions of counterattack to jose bravo and 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.770
 they were already taking profits 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.690
 for two works by robert manzanares with 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.940
 his powerful shots of right very 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.610
 similar to her match he scored a goal 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.310
 we see again julian days and the 2 by 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.909
 3 at minute 19 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.300
 his peculiar celebration of topo gigio and 2 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.300
 for 30 count and one more 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.150
 d angelo that take advantage of that value and the 3 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.630
 by 3 in the commitment seconds before 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.290
 finish the first half we have one 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.930
 more of the expensive the 4 by 3 and already the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.750
 Bogotanos were going losers to the 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.700
 changing rooms playing real best 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.400
 bucaramanga or at least attacking more 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.010
 second half and there are both road war 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.840
 Apple that reached the far post and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.510
 after the auction of the match figure 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.310
 Angel or expensive that we see as in palm with 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.780
 left leg and gualdrón to the second 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.880
 stick one more 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.410
 Jon Monroy was that he finished it 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.690
 raising esteban sanchez and jesus 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.690
 gualdrón arrived to put it 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.930
 there would be one more joined the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.090
 Venezuelans and Jesus Gualdrón the 7 by 3 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.580
 he presented debt to his body 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.980
 technical and the pass has been the road war 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.200
 apple trees the two Venezuelans placing 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.570
 the 7 by 3 with which it was thought that already 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.780
 the commitment was settled but 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.630
 Julian Sanchez had this and the 7 for 4 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.470
 he relived condor in his aspirations for 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.150
 equalize the powerful right hand 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.580
 defeating the keeper of the real 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.580
 bucaramanga 7 x 4 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.430
 the actions followed seven by five 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.310
 they joined the kikin with camilo 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.400
 dominguez and dominguez that with leg 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.410
 left seven times five are left 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.090
 two many and a few seconds so that 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.070
 the commitment will be finalized and the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.020
 marker and seven seconds from the end 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.350
 the player placed and sealed the victory 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.060
 for real bucaramanga eight by five and 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.710
 that's why we're going to go to a third 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.110
 commitment the one who wins it will be the new 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.700
 champion of the league argos futsal and 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.430
 remember that the best information 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.680
 revolutionized football is at www dot 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.250
 league arc dotcom hospital 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.250
 reactions 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.950
 it was a very tough match 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:33.079
 we had two bases and this I think the 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.230
 at the height neither the court nor the 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.329
 dimensions of the canes make it difficult for us 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.950
 to them but superior to us and 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.209
 so that strangers were the 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.530
 better and won sealed the three 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.180
 points tomorrow when you arrive at the park 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.379
 decisive and then we will shoot to win 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.930
 we did not know it was not going to be easy 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.640
 bucaramanga did not come to give us the advantage 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.920
 to be champions we had had 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.019
 more units the last three is easy 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.579
 sometimes forward the marker and not again 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.530
 the sides the same mistakes that we 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.209
 they pay two laps that could not happen 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.519
 minus three very fast goals are leaving us 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.069
 the score above but good I take 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.870
 a decision at minute 10 of the second 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.139
 time and you can spend more to the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.700
 players that are going to do tomorrow 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.260
 headlines and end with the farewells 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.510
 because for them a little air 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.700
 that we reached two goals that was something 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.830
 important 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.800
 if the teacher told us that they will raise the 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:27.220
 pace they are not playing herd in 4 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.390
 or a little change with this heat that 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.730
 I think it's one time he hit a 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.000
 little, that's not what professor told us 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.090
 and good luck turned out god we take a 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.770
 advantage that we could not handle the game 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.660
 but we knew that he will put a team with 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.190
 a lot of ball handling we went out to squeeze 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.770
 first line to pressure from 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.180
 early we started a little passive but 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.160
 we adjusted and adjusted and we achieved 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.419
 hurting steal balls that we made concrete 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.280
 in goal and we got a victory 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.900
 report an important difference already 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.130
 mediated the second time and power 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.660
 reflect with players that we had 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.400
 apperceived because they were more tired 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.229
 that they had played less minutes and give the 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.490
 opportunity to have a team 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.490
 already thinking about tomorrow's game
