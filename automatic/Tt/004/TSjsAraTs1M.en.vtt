00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.140
 besides his activity as 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.620
 training director at the seminary seminary 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.870
 lucerne has rolf asal in germany 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.240
 train as fasting ladder 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.360
 For him, fasting is a form of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.790
 liberation 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.050
 in today's society 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.350
 are increasingly interested in this 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.030
 fasting for health reasons 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.030
 Religiously motivated are less and less 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.010
 How does he see this development? I think 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.810
 it shows something that I am very 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.340
 often shows that things 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.450
 they really diverge 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.520
 belong together 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.480
 On the one hand, that is natural 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.480
 ever something great 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.430
 health considerations too 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.350
 ask how do I handle my body 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.260
 How do I feel in my body 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.660
 what would be good for my body but me 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.310
 just do not believe that one 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.590
 health the physical 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.810
 health of the mental of the 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.910
 can release mental health and 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.079
 That's why this is certainly a first 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.600
 good access 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.760
 These things are with us if we want 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.100
 or not 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.229
 interwoven we are one 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.210
 unity we are a trinity when we are 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.030
 this is what a human trinity wants 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.399
 not to be mixed and to be separated 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.290
 what should you pay attention to if you are not 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.149
 opportunity has to be in a group too 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.000
 if you can not grasp the possibility 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:26.020
 has to take in a group then would 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.030
 I for a first almost completely massive 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.130
 to dissuade from it because that is so 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680
 like retreats you can do exercises 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.600
 not the first time for yourself 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.180
 but it is important that then 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.460
 that someone celebrates as a companion 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.040
 you are prepared and i would be someone 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.560
 For the first time, it is an urgent matter 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.040
 advise against doing that on your own 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.500
 but really with people 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.350
 get together and see where there are times 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.540
 a possibility at least knowledgeable 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.970
 to do everything that goes with it 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.580
 if you want to fast but 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.560
 It has to work at the same time 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.390
 no problem so in the responsibility 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.259
 for the next month but if you are 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.929
 now himself a 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.080
 in an office or as an architect and 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.020
 I do not know where that works 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.240
 no experience at all with my experience 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.190
 problem one has on the contrary if one 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.040
 times have the bad time behind it 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.810
 The bad time is three days 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.920
 first three days are comprehensive 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.630
 usually a bit harsh and then 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.120
 is there something like a fasting 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.010
 euphoria do not ask me what the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.110
 but it is chemically exactly behind it 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.480
 So are some Happiness hormones that 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.310
 free yourself on the third day and the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.800
 a cheer and the one the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.120
 fast a very wonderful 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.860
 experience 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.560
 but there is something else I can do 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.570
 I have exactly these at the age of 18 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.670
 experience made 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.040
 but relatively early a single time and 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.930
 I'm so scared that I do not have one 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.930
 hunger had more like you addicted to it 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.959
 so my everyone is different so i 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.740
 I did not become addicted and me 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.000
 do not believe that either 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:16.180
 examined potential in there but puts it 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.760
 has a craving to do that regularly 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.000
 a new form of fasting is that 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.100
 so-called facebook fast social media 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.800
 will only be for a certain time 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.500
 has restricted use of this kind of 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.800
 fast also a spiritual dimension 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.709
 or is that nonsense that's wonderful 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.940
 to reduce that once and I would 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.870
 even not only suggest 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.090
 to reduce 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.480
 we reduce that is quite whole 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:47.520
 difficult but it is wonderful once 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.250
 to say basta conclusion 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.320
 so fast or facebook 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.390
 internet is is wonderful and 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:00.390
 may also be an access to the fast 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:03.590
 in the broad sense if only there 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.590
 it stays good
