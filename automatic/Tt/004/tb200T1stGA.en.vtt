then player three pics she'll die and
there's<00:02:30.150> eight<00:02:31.040> shield<00:02:32.040> guys<00:02:32.430> eight<00:02:33.030> tribe

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
pyramid but there's 28 swordsman so if

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.660 
pyramid but there's 28 swordsman so if
you're<00:02:40.290> playing<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.650> five<00:02:40.860> people<00:02:41.310> there's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
you're playing with five people there's

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.470 
you're playing with five people there's
definitely<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.570> be<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:44.060> constraint<00:02:45.060> and

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
definitely going to be a constraint and

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.780 
definitely going to be a constraint and
bottleneck<00:02:45.960> on<00:02:46.110> some<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.440> these<00:02:46.590> units<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
bottleneck on some of these units and

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.970 
bottleneck on some of these units and
that's<00:02:48.000> kind<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.270> where<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> fun<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.290> in

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
that's kind of where the fun is is in

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.500 
that's kind of where the fun is is in
trying<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.310> assemble<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.910> different<00:02:51.300> teams

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
trying to assemble the different teams

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.900 
trying to assemble the different teams
and<00:02:51.720> you're<00:02:52.020> limited<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.500> how<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.370> can<00:02:53.610> set<00:02:53.820> it

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and you're limited in how you can set it

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.090 
and you're limited in how you can set it
up<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.660> isn't<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.260> much<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.590> case<00:02:55.770> if<00:02:55.980> it's

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
up this isn't so much of a case if it's

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.880 
up this isn't so much of a case if it's
a<00:02:56.160> three-player<00:02:56.580> game<00:02:56.690> though<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.680> could

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
a three-player game though you can could

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.860 
a three-player game though you can could
have<00:02:59.010> create<00:02:59.640> your<00:02:59.730> own<00:02:59.790> rules<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.300> cut<00:03:00.780> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
have create your own rules and cut it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.510 
have create your own rules and cut it
down<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.050> say<00:03:01.320> there's<00:03:01.680> only<00:03:01.830> six<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.370> pick

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
down to say there's only six to pick

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.680 
down to say there's only six to pick
from<00:03:02.730> instead<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.210> eighth<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.600> a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
from instead of the eighth in a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.490 
from instead of the eighth in a
five-player<00:03:04.170> game<00:03:04.410> if<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.770> want<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.520> then

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
five-player game if you want and then

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.770 
five-player game if you want and then
the<00:03:07.500> gliders<00:03:08.220> take<00:03:08.850> turns<00:03:09.120> battling<00:03:09.690> each

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the gliders take turns battling each

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.430 
the gliders take turns battling each
other<00:03:09.990> so<00:03:10.980> let's<00:03:11.820> say<00:03:12.210> normally<00:03:12.780> if<00:03:13.230> there's

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
other so let's say normally if there's

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.230 
other so let's say normally if there's
no<00:03:13.590> spearmen<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.430> choose<00:03:14.640> initiative<00:03:15.120> it's

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
no spearmen to choose initiative it's

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.210 
no spearmen to choose initiative it's
whoever<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.870> attacking<00:03:16.470> gets<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.740> roll<00:03:16.890> first

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
whoever is attacking gets the roll first

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.100 
whoever is attacking gets the roll first
and<00:03:17.780> hits<00:03:18.780> are<00:03:18.990> taken<00:03:19.370> instantly<00:03:20.370> there's<00:03:20.880> no

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
and hits are taken instantly there's no

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.230 
and hits are taken instantly there's no
there's<00:03:22.110> a<00:03:22.200> chance<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.740> retaliate<00:03:23.490> but<00:03:24.090> it's

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
there's a chance to retaliate but it's

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.030 
there's a chance to retaliate but it's
after<00:03:24.750> your<00:03:24.900> hit<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.260> there's<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.470> big<00:03:25.740> key

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
after your hit so there's a big key

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.780 
after your hit so there's a big key
initiative<00:03:27.020> let's<00:03:28.020> assume<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.770> guy<00:03:29.100> attacks

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
initiative let's assume this guy attacks

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.510 
initiative let's assume this guy attacks
this<00:03:30.510> guy<00:03:30.810> because<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.590> guy<00:03:31.710> has<00:03:32.010> a<00:03:32.040> spear

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
this guy because this guy has a spear

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.650 
this guy because this guy has a spear
even<00:03:32.790> though<00:03:32.880> he's<00:03:33.000> through<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.240> defender

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
even though he's through the defender

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.580 
even though he's through the defender
he'd<00:03:33.930> roll<00:03:34.110> first<00:03:34.470> how<00:03:35.430> do<00:03:35.490> we<00:03:35.640> calculated<00:03:36.590> how

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
he'd roll first how do we calculated how

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.020 
he'd roll first how do we calculated how
many<00:03:37.650> dice<00:03:38.010> rolls<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.460> gets<00:03:38.580> one<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.910> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
many dice rolls it gets one of the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.000 
many dice rolls it gets one of the
entire<00:03:39.330> team<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.840> then<00:03:39.930> an<00:03:40.050> additional<00:03:40.200> 14<00:03:40.830> to

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
entire team and then an additional 14 to

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.480 
entire team and then an additional 14 to
spearmint<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.120> we<00:03:42.209> roll<00:03:42.450> at<00:03:42.600> us<00:03:43.070> this<00:03:44.070> was<00:03:44.280> one

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
spearmint so we roll at us this was one

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.699 
spearmint so we roll at us this was one
yellow<00:03:44.790> hit<00:03:45.120> because<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.020> player<00:03:46.260> already

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
yellow hit because this player already

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.400 
yellow hit because this player already
is<00:03:46.830> has<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> yellow<00:03:47.580> hit<00:03:47.880> he<00:03:48.570> takes<00:03:48.840> a<00:03:48.990> second

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
is has a yellow hit he takes a second

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.810 
is has a yellow hit he takes a second
one<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.770> he's<00:03:50.340> killed<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:51.320> dice<00:03:52.550> come<00:03:53.550> in

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
one and he's killed the dice come in

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.680 
one and he's killed the dice come in
three<00:03:54.510> blanks<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.740> yellow<00:03:56.130> hits<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.730> an

three blanks to yellow hits and an

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.920 
three blanks to yellow hits and an
instant<00:03:58.080> kill<00:03:58.560> which<00:03:59.340> can't<00:03:59.700> be<00:03:59.790> blocked<00:04:00.090> the

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
instant kill which can't be blocked the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.790 
instant kill which can't be blocked the
shield<00:04:01.650> guys<00:04:01.830> can<00:04:02.100> block<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.370> single<00:04:02.940> yellow

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
shield guys can block a single yellow

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.830 
shield guys can block a single yellow
now<00:04:04.800> this<00:04:05.010> guy<00:04:05.220> gets<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.520> retaliate<00:04:06.060> he<00:04:06.660> gets

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
now this guy gets to retaliate he gets

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.949 
now this guy gets to retaliate he gets
to<00:04:06.930> roll<00:04:07.170> two<00:04:07.410> dice<00:04:08.450> he's<00:04:09.450> probably<00:04:09.630> going<00:04:09.870> to

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
to roll two dice he's probably going to

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.199 
to roll two dice he's probably going to
keep<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.350> because<00:04:10.650> he's<00:04:10.800> got<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> double<00:04:12.000> hip

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
keep that because he's got a double hip

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.060 
keep that because he's got a double hip
and<00:04:12.770> you<00:04:13.770> know<00:04:13.860> this<00:04:14.160> guy<00:04:14.220> could<00:04:14.580> get<00:04:14.700> killed

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
and you know this guy could get killed

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.170 
and you know this guy could get killed
though<00:04:17.070> because<00:04:17.340> he<00:04:17.430> does<00:04:17.700> have<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.940> tribe
