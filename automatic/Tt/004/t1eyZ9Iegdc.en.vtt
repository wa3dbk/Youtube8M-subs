00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 Speak there, my personal beauty. 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.030
 Welcome to yet another good video. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.699
 Today's video will be a video of tips 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.230
 just as my channel fits right 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.029
 basically is also one of the themes in the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.070
 channel is the tip for you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.789
 So let's start good, come back to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.140
 you here today how to create a class of 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.760
 assaults on these assault routes will 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 to start with is for them here because they 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.460
 are the first on the list 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 so I'll teach you how to create 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.399
 a class that is good to be really 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.510
 efficient as the enemies of assad 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.950
 good first you will have to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.579
 choose one hit software goes 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.860
 miss 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.390
 can be anyone and you are a 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.160
 attack you want but I'll give 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.989
 some tips these tips I consider 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.940
 very important number 1 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.250
 it's really worth your while to use a grip 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 front that is reformed on the board so much 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.170
 to stabilize when it comes to 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.969
 I'm working on someone from a distance, I'm 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.410
 always use never dispenses holster 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.960
 frontal else something also worth 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.339
 very worth it for is the muffler 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 There are a lot of people I see why not 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.590
 use muffler and I do not know what they 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 think because one you will sneak 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.070
 nobody will see you on the map and 2 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.259
 that's exactly what she's going to get 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.930
 behind the whole team, right? 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.880
 without being noticed at last you can 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.070
 everybody and nobody will see you 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.420
 so it's only worth the two here if 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.820
 you do not use any of these you can 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.979
 also use the large chargers too 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.770
 It makes a lot of difference and the nozzle brake 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.659
 In case you want to use your mother tomorrow, 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 run over the crazy ones but there goes the 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.350
 your taste and even times the weapon is more 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.390
 The staff tip that I'm going to pass on. 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 You really matter to me. 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.320
 opinion that will help the hell are 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.909
 the advantages also remembering that you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159
 can not use any secondary 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.110
 no lethal none tactical because no 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.149
 I would trust me very worthwhile 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.170
 you exclude these three to spare more 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.790
 place here 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.530
 the advantages are what matter and they 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.590
 that give skill that your character 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.270
 I understood then you discarded three here. 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 take one through the enemy bush scenery and 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.689
 steal his weapon that's worth more 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.180
 than you put a secondary one that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.829
 space or have any 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.270
 secondary here because I never use 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.069
 then let's go to the advantages 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.780
 now 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.360
 well first you have to put 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.489
 assault rafael is always 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.409
 guy follower sucks 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.720
 at least for me and for most 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.220
 people there that pulls that is basically 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.170
 run on the entire map 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.700
 good your pursuer who will help 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.870
 very much in your sights and also when you 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.319
 hit the face with the guy you go 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.329
 to be able to aim and walk the famous 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.590
 people talk but defends that the guy stays 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.500
 walking on one hand and the other to kill 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.200
 the very olÃ© the guy is very lost and 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.340
 You usually kill him, easy beauty. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.690
 then use the tracker 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.780
 another thing you have to use too 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.609
 It's the quick serve here. 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.260
 basically as the name says you 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.549
 suck is faster you shoot more 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.870
 fast right 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.940
 it's much easier to kill an enemy 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.409
 hit from the front even from far away 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.389
 will there heard of reflex also another 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.470
 carnamar essential thing you have to 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:06.629
 use is the focus was going to the other the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.040
 next is going to be focus here 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.019
 basically as he already said if 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.700
 stabilizes aim both at the time of looking and 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.590
 Shoot someone as soon as you 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.169
 is taking a shot will try to fight back 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.239
 finally will debut his aim and cadence 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.310
 the area will get no smaller but more 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.560
 stabilized, I understand it's worth it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.840
 put also now was prepared human 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.760
 prepared it earned you a point is only very 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.799
 little in my opinion and worth the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.359
 because its own name is 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.190
 description of it here 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.739
 the water gets ready faster after 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.359
 Running this helps too much guy does a lot 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.310
 difference is running beats head 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.970
 with the crazy you can take in the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.799
 hour 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 the same works here is not written 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.359
 but I've already been able to witness some 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.799
 situations so I could see that 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.120
 prepare also works when you are 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.040
 going up somewhere is on when 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.590
 you go up you can take faster 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.819
 so wear it's worth it good now it comes 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.199
 one thing I need you to do 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.569
 decide 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.540
 I'm just going to give you some tips, only you 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:03.479
 that is left of the spaces now of pecs f1 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.079
 you can use precipitation or 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:10.079
 marathon or write use these three here 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.459
 in morals choose one of these three and put me 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.709
 I will put the marathon I like 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.500
 Running around the map, beauty. 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.669
 you choose here the kevin and joe pesci 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.469
 typing if you chose the marathon 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.049
 also comes with me 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:23.530
 good guys now on the attack packets is 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.050
 a personal thing 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.510
 sure because I do not play assault and 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.770
 nor support and if you play you choose 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.389
 What you want is what's best for you. 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.690
 What do you think you can get? 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.840
 easy I always understood then attack 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.710
 support apology assault and support you 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.540
 choose 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.130
 I'll give you a tip to despatch. 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.190
 which is basically based here on the 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.160
 feet like you already noticed a good 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.150
 first species they are 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.470
 opportunist, right? 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.790
 You saw that I chose the marathon. 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.400
 so he is not here if you chose 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.230
 opportunist on the other time choose some 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.190
 type of irritation the marathon itself 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.230
 same beauty 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.440
 after the opportunist one thing that I 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.400
 I always choose is the invisible that 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.590
 is basically to continue to appear 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.260
 7 with why in morals it may not seem 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.090
 but the set with which it can handle 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.190
 many and many times you should not have 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.900
 perceived but you must die in the least 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.360
 about five times per game because of 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.919
 of the set with the enemies then uses that 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.890
 will appear on the face map 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.380
 else you have to put it is also the 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.550
 precipitation to load faster is 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.950
 essential for someone is trying to 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.700
 grab a click load fast in hours 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.050
 tightening 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.729
 Imagine you hit front two 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.229
 crazy is time to love to shoot 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.750
 and if you're smart have reflexes 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.800
 enough to kill kill the other or 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.680
 vice versa 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.180
 so use the beauty typing price there 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.860
 now we come to the last part 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.419
 one of the last parts of our stuff 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.039
 here of species said that the belly 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.460
 here below you are seeing there 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.470
 well what I always use is the on the fly 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.720
 sure it is worth it because you face 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.640
 must know how it works every kilo 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.620
 that you give with this sin the owner of the weapon 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.120
 it gets stronger or a 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.400
 time if you can kill many 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.190
 and die to kill the guys with a shot 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.140
 So it 's very much, it's very important. 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.460
 that you put it here if you 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.979
 Do you want to catch a train? 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.820
 that justifies greater or one than the child 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.430
 crazy 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.500
 So use the fly now you have too. 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.440
 that put something that sends you have 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.750
 to put it without thinking twice is 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.880
 there is a risk of explosions because nowadays 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.800
 This is almost impossible for you to play. 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.080
 in a room where you have no 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.580
 improvised explosive that there of which 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.560
 you walk over does mean 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.630
 that there is too boring so here you 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.190
 protects at least a little and has already thought 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.060
 if you 're killing 12 without dying and 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.070
 dies because of a ball of that 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.590
 has happened to me and since then I use 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.810
 This pec in order to die and help 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.639
 damn already saved me many times beauty 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.720
 Good now you can see what's left 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.280
 a single point 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.050
 and that one point does not matter as much as 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.590
 You think then you can choose 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.930
 between the bettor goes I always use 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.480
 I bet you better bet 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.190
 also because you can see that it 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.030
 serves to give a random advantage 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:04.250
 Are you going to use it to win there? 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:06.919
 some advantage that is no longer the 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:11.810
 point alleged type increasing the balance 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:14.120
 positive does not use the bettor or 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.979
