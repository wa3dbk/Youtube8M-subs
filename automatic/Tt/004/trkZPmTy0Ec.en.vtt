00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you got the pine cone here the black

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
you got the pine cone here the black
outer<00:01:41.189> rim<00:01:41.490> it's<00:01:41.909> got<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> bit<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> shine<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.750> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
outer rim it's got a bit of shine to it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
outer rim it's got a bit of shine to it
it's<00:01:43.110> pretty<00:01:43.560> typical<00:01:43.710> lock<00:01:44.070> seed<00:01:44.310> fair<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
it's pretty typical lock seed fair I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.910 
it's pretty typical lock seed fair I
turn<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> on<00:01:45.450> down<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.320> noises<00:01:49.710> when

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
turn it on down here you get noises when

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
turn it on down here you get noises when
you<00:01:49.979> press<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.280> button<00:01:53.329> you<00:01:54.329> get<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.750> matzah

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
you press the button you get the matzah

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.899 
you press the button you get the matzah
bakery<00:01:55.229> name<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.219> back<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.729> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
bakery name and then back here is the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.830 
bakery name and then back here is the
little<00:01:57.350> noises<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> get

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
little noises you get here so you get

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:16.490 
little noises you get here so you get
the<00:02:00.990> Helheim<00:02:01.259> zipping

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.050 

so<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.560> essentially<00:02:17.890> get<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.400> mix<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.910> what

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
so you essentially get a mix of what

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.030 
so you essentially get a mix of what
they've<00:02:19.209> been<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.720> at<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:19.959> beginning<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
they've been like at the beginning the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.290 
they've been like at the beginning the
lock<00:02:21.250> seeds<00:02:21.489> like<00:02:21.610> this<00:02:21.790> mainly<00:02:22.090> they<00:02:22.209> were

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
lock seeds like this mainly they were

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.059 
lock seeds like this mainly they were
released<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.750> regular<00:02:23.080> sets<00:02:23.350> were<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.739> game

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
released in regular sets were the game

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.070 
released in regular sets were the game
you<00:02:24.489> know<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.670> investing<00:02:25.180> but<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.690> sort<00:02:26.050> of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
you know the investing but that sort of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080 
you know the investing but that sort of
went<00:02:26.230> away<00:02:26.319> in<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> show<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.010> then<00:02:27.640> after

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
went away in the show and then after

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.699 
went away in the show and then after
that<00:02:28.120> stuff<00:02:28.690> like<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.989> golden<00:02:29.260> locks<00:02:29.440> eat<00:02:29.590> and

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
that stuff like the golden locks eat and

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.580 
that stuff like the golden locks eat and
stuff<00:02:29.920> have<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.000> zipping<00:02:31.270> noises<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.500> you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
stuff have the zipping noises so you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.750 
stuff have the zipping noises so you
essentially<00:02:32.770> get<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.950> mix<00:02:33.160> of<00:02:33.310> both<00:02:33.430> which<00:02:33.670> is

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
essentially get a mix of both which is

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.059 
essentially get a mix of both which is
kind<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.000> neat<00:02:34.150> um<00:02:35.020> but<00:02:35.200> let's<00:02:35.380> go<00:02:35.500> ahead<00:02:35.739> and

which<00:05:00.820> has<00:05:00.970> the<00:05:01.150> most<00:05:01.360> amazing<00:05:01.870> invisible

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
which has the most amazing invisible

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.350 
which has the most amazing invisible
artwork<00:05:03.010> now<00:05:03.490> he<00:05:03.550> didn't<00:05:03.850> have<00:05:03.970> an<00:05:04.120> hour<00:05:04.210> work

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
artwork now he didn't have an hour work

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.300 
artwork now he didn't have an hour work
on<00:05:04.510> his<00:05:04.720> I<00:05:04.900> think<00:05:04.930> in<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.530> show<00:05:05.740> was<00:05:05.950> because

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
on his I think in the show was because

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.860 
on his I think in the show was because
his<00:05:06.550> driver<00:05:06.880> was<00:05:07.120> one<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.390> mass-produced

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
his driver was one of the mass-produced

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.230 
his driver was one of the mass-produced
ones<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.350> could<00:05:08.470> work<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.740> anybody<00:05:09.130> but<00:05:09.850> it's

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
ones that could work on anybody but it's

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.850 
ones that could work on anybody but it's
i<00:05:10.419> know<00:05:10.660> i<00:05:10.690> can<00:05:10.810> show<00:05:11.110> that's<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.440> reason<00:05:11.680> i

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
i know i can show that's the reason i

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.980 
i know i can show that's the reason i
think<00:05:12.190> but<00:05:12.729> it<00:05:13.419> would<00:05:13.510> have<00:05:13.570> been<00:05:13.660> cool<00:05:13.810> to

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
think but it would have been cool to

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.719 
think but it would have been cool to
have<00:05:14.139> him<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.950> know<00:05:15.039> get<00:05:15.220> his<00:05:15.370> own<00:05:15.520> little

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
have him you know get his own little

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.110 
have him you know get his own little
design<00:05:16.690> but<00:05:17.410> let's<00:05:17.560> go<00:05:17.710> ahead<00:05:17.800> and<00:05:18.010> here's<00:05:18.910> the

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
design but let's go ahead and here's the

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.200 
design but let's go ahead and here's the
driver<00:05:19.389> let's<00:05:20.289> put<00:05:20.530> it<00:05:20.620> on

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
hate to sound like a broken record in

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.110 
hate to sound like a broken record in
these<00:06:52.210> Lockheed<00:06:52.630> reviews<00:06:52.990> but<00:06:53.850> for<00:06:54.850> the<00:06:54.940> most

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
these Lockheed reviews but for the most

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.730 
these Lockheed reviews but for the most
part<00:06:55.240> within<00:06:55.570> each<00:06:55.840> sort<00:06:56.260> of<00:06:56.350> class<00:06:56.560> of

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
part within each sort of class of

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.810 
part within each sort of class of
lockstate<00:06:57.100> they're<00:06:57.280> roughly<00:06:57.520> the<00:06:57.700> same

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
lockstate they're roughly the same

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.280 
lockstate they're roughly the same
quality<00:06:58.300> and<00:06:58.420> I<00:06:58.480> really<00:06:58.690> do<00:06:58.780> like<00:06:58.810> these<00:06:59.080> locks

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
quality and I really do like these locks

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.930 
quality and I really do like these locks
dates<00:06:59.500> I<00:06:59.590> particularly<00:07:00.100> do<00:07:00.310> like<00:07:00.460> the<00:07:00.580> sounds

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
dates I particularly do like the sounds

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.630 
dates I particularly do like the sounds
on<00:07:01.030> these<00:07:01.680> but<00:07:02.680> it's<00:07:02.800> pretty<00:07:02.980> much<00:07:03.100> up<00:07:03.310> to<00:07:03.340> you

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
on these but it's pretty much up to you

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.730 
on these but it's pretty much up to you
and<00:07:03.880> like<00:07:04.270> that<00:07:04.480> is<00:07:04.660> the<00:07:04.840> case<00:07:05.020> for<00:07:05.080> like<00:07:05.500> all

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740 
and like that is the case for like all

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.410 
and like that is the case for like all
Twitter<00:07:06.100> views<00:07:06.370> essentially<00:07:06.820> regardless<00:07:07.330> of

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
Twitter views essentially regardless of

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.520 
Twitter views essentially regardless of
what<00:07:07.540> I<00:07:07.570> say<00:07:07.810> it's<00:07:07.960> all<00:07:08.020> totally<00:07:08.170> up<00:07:08.380> to<00:07:08.500> you

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
what I say it's all totally up to you

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.260 
what I say it's all totally up to you
but<00:07:08.800> in<00:07:09.250> this<00:07:09.370> case<00:07:09.580> I<00:07:09.760> feel<00:07:09.970> like<00:07:10.030> it<00:07:10.180> even

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
but in this case I feel like it even

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.970 
but in this case I feel like it even
more<00:07:10.420> because<00:07:10.690> they're<00:07:11.170> all<00:07:11.350> pretty<00:07:11.710> much<00:07:11.830> the

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:11.980 
more because they're all pretty much the

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:13.470 
more because they're all pretty much the
same<00:07:12.130> quality<00:07:12.760> unless<00:07:12.970> there's<00:07:13.180> certain

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
same quality unless there's certain

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.360 
same quality unless there's certain
cases<00:07:13.660> where<00:07:13.990> I<00:07:14.050> say<00:07:14.290> this<00:07:14.470> is<00:07:14.620> a<00:07:14.770> step<00:07:15.130> down

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
cases where I say this is a step down

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.070 
cases where I say this is a step down
it's<00:07:16.030> basically<00:07:16.390> up<00:07:16.480> to<00:07:16.570> you<00:07:16.780> whether<00:07:16.930> you

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
it's basically up to you whether you

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.170 
it's basically up to you whether you
