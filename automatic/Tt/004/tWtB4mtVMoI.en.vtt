00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
about 20 pounds I think it might be a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.270 
about 20 pounds I think it might be a
little<00:00:57.300> tight<00:00:57.719> for<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> 20<00:00:58.350> pound<00:00:58.530> dog<00:00:58.829> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
little tight for a 20 pound dog you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920 
little tight for a 20 pound dog you
probably<00:00:59.820> could<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> will

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
probably could do it but it will

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.979 
probably could do it but it will
definitely<00:01:01.109> be<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.530> little<00:01:01.800> tighter<00:01:02.070> um<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:03.270> few

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
definitely be a little tighter um a few

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.590 
definitely be a little tighter um a few
things<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.890> construction<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.270> notice

you can actually open it up as I just

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.179 
you can actually open it up as I just
did<00:01:41.790> by<00:01:42.150> rolling<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.049> down<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.159> just

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
did by rolling this down and it just

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.380 
did by rolling this down and it just
velcro's<00:01:44.880> right<00:01:45.180> into<00:01:45.420> place<00:01:45.890> inside<00:01:47.329> is<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
velcro's right into place inside is a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.569 
velcro's right into place inside is a
piece<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.840> makes<00:01:50.149> the<00:01:51.149> bottom<00:01:51.540> hard<00:01:51.869> and

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
piece that makes the bottom hard and

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.999 
piece that makes the bottom hard and
makes<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> from<00:01:53.939> sort<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.450> going<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.500> itself

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
makes it from sort of going into itself

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.030 
makes it from sort of going into itself
so<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> stabilizes<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.360> entire<00:01:57.780> unit<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.890> that

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so it stabilizes the entire unit so that

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560 
so it stabilizes the entire unit so that
goes<00:01:59.280> straight<00:01:59.430> down<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.880> then<00:02:00.030> on<00:02:00.149> top<00:02:00.390> of

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
goes straight down and then on top of

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.889 
goes straight down and then on top of
this<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.990> this<00:02:01.500> very<00:02:02.009> nice<00:02:02.310> sort<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> mat<00:02:03.090> that

this is this very nice sort of mat that

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.249 
this is this very nice sort of mat that
velcro's<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:05.040> place<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.930> keeps<00:02:06.930> your<00:02:07.079> dog

nice and cozy and comfy

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.260 
nice and cozy and comfy
like<00:02:09.320> a<00:02:09.350> fleece<00:02:09.740> mat<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.490> it's<00:02:10.670> also<00:02:10.880> from

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
like a fleece mat and it's also from

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.210 
like a fleece mat and it's also from
what<00:02:11.390> I<00:02:11.420> understand<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:12.220> highly

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
what I understand is highly

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.040 
what I understand is highly
water-resistant<00:02:14.060> like<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.510> rest<00:02:14.750> of<00:02:14.930> this

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
water-resistant like the rest of this

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.620 
water-resistant like the rest of this
material<00:02:15.710> plenty<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.670> ventilation<00:02:16.850> on<00:02:17.480> this

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
material plenty of ventilation on this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.650 
material plenty of ventilation on this
bag<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.860> you've<00:02:21.980> got<00:02:22.190> side<00:02:22.760> ventilation

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
bag and so you've got side ventilation

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.710 
bag and so you've got side ventilation
both<00:02:24.620> sides<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:25.280> course<00:02:25.520> big<00:02:26.270> front

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
both sides of course big front

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.020 
both sides of course big front
ventilations<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.740> plenty<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.100> airflow<00:02:28.340> here

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
ventilations to plenty of airflow here

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.570 
ventilations to plenty of airflow here
on<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:30.140> bag<00:02:30.710> also<00:02:31.040> inside<00:02:32.680> has<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:34.130> tether

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
on the bag also inside has a tether

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.600 
on the bag also inside has a tether
which<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.900> tether<00:02:36.590> your<00:02:36.860> dog<00:02:37.040> to<00:02:37.310> so<00:02:37.490> they

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
which you can tether your dog to so they

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.610 
which you can tether your dog to so they
don't<00:02:37.790> go<00:02:37.940> very<00:02:37.970> far<00:02:38.420> from<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.750> bag<00:02:38.900> obviously

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
don't go very far from the bag obviously

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.410 
don't go very far from the bag obviously
and<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.490> let's<00:02:40.700> go<00:02:40.880> over<00:02:41.120> some<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.360> these

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
and so let's go over some of these

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.860 
and so let's go over some of these
features<00:02:42.940> one<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.090> cool<00:02:44.270> features<00:02:44.300> is

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
features one of the cool features is

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.140 
features one of the cool features is
this<00:02:45.020> actually<00:02:45.470> expands<00:02:45.920> out<00:02:46.100> there's<00:02:47.090> a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
this actually expands out there's a

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.120 
this actually expands out there's a
zipper<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.750> side<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.260> we<00:02:51.500> get<00:02:52.100> a

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
zipper on the side and so we get a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.440 
zipper on the side and so we get a
little<00:02:52.280> more<00:02:52.550> space<00:02:52.850> here<00:02:55.000> actually<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.209> few

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
little more space here actually a few

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.560 
little more space here actually a few
inches<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:57.020> space<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:59.090> if<00:02:59.180> you're<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.330> really

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
inches of space so if you're a really

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.630 
inches of space so if you're a really
small<00:02:59.810> dog<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.230> might<00:03:00.380> not<00:03:00.590> need<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:00.890> expand

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
small dog you might not need to expand

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.910 
small dog you might not need to expand
it<00:03:01.790> out<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.959> if<00:03:03.110> your<00:03:03.230> dog's<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.560> little<00:03:03.740> bigger

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
it out but if your dog's a little bigger

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.580 
it out but if your dog's a little bigger
it's<00:03:04.550> tighter<00:03:04.850> certainly<00:03:05.540> open<00:03:06.050> it<00:03:06.170> up<00:03:06.320> give

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
it's tighter certainly open it up give

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.680 
it's tighter certainly open it up give
them<00:03:06.740> a<00:03:06.770> little<00:03:06.980> more<00:03:07.430> room<00:03:07.700> so<00:03:07.970> let's<00:03:08.570> go

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
them a little more room so let's go

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.820 
them a little more room so let's go
through<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.110> different<00:03:09.500> things<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.740> you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
through the different things that you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.670 
through the different things that you
can<00:03:10.010> do<00:03:10.160> with<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.490> on<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.390> back<00:03:11.570> here<00:03:11.990> this

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
can do with this on the back here this

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.860 
can do with this on the back here this
turns<00:03:13.340> into<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.670> rolling<00:03:14.239> case<00:03:14.450> with<00:03:14.750> this

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
turns into a rolling case with this

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.449 
turns into a rolling case with this
telescoping<00:03:15.590> bar<00:03:16.340> on<00:03:16.730> very<00:03:17.630> smooth<00:03:18.019> action

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
telescoping bar on very smooth action

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.790 
telescoping bar on very smooth action
high-quality<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.519> can<00:03:19.670> feel<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.030> metal<00:03:20.209> on

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
high-quality you can feel the metal on

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.000 
high-quality you can feel the metal on
basically<00:03:21.800> what<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:22.280> becomes<00:03:22.790> is<00:03:23.180> a<00:03:24.050> roll

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
basically what this becomes is a roll

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.710 
basically what this becomes is a roll
behind<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.550> so<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:25.760> would<00:03:26.000> basically<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.570> the

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
behind you so you would basically on the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.449 
behind you so you would basically on the
floor<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.470> would<00:03:27.590> take<00:03:27.830> it<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.310> would

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
floor you would take it and it would

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.340 
floor you would take it and it would
simply<00:03:28.790> roll<00:03:29.000> behind<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.540> your<00:03:29.780> dog<00:03:29.989> would<00:03:30.230> be

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
simply roll behind you your dog would be

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.670 
simply roll behind you your dog would be
on<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.590> inside<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:32.060> also<00:03:32.390> is<00:03:32.930> a<00:03:33.200> great

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
on the inside it also is a great

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.920 
on the inside it also is a great
backpack<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.850> one<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.360> features<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.750> like

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
backpack and one of the features I like

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.470 
backpack and one of the features I like
about<00:03:36.080> this<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.470> sometimes<00:03:37.459> these<00:03:37.670> bags<00:03:38.060> are

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
about this is sometimes these bags are

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.900 
about this is sometimes these bags are
they're<00:03:39.350> not<00:03:39.380> that<00:03:39.830> comfortable<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.519> put<00:03:40.760> on

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
they're not that comfortable to put on

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.330 
they're not that comfortable to put on
your<00:03:41.090> back<00:03:41.330> this<00:03:42.049> bag<00:03:42.320> happens<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:42.980> be<00:03:43.130> now

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
you'll probably need to adjust the

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.380 
you'll probably need to adjust the
straps<00:03:45.290> for<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.860> but<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.940> have<00:03:47.060> already

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.300 
may not have that kind of car seat the
main<00:05:08.360> thing<00:05:08.600> that<00:05:08.630> holds<00:05:09.289> it<00:05:09.380> in<00:05:09.530> is<00:05:09.770> this

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
main thing that holds it in is this

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.370 
main thing that holds it in is this
would<00:05:10.550> sit<00:05:10.970> up<00:05:11.180> against<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.750> back<00:05:11.930> of<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.169> car

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
would sit up against the back of the car

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.250 
would sit up against the back of the car
seat<00:05:12.620> so<00:05:13.070> it<00:05:13.130> will<00:05:13.220> end<00:05:13.370> up<00:05:13.490> looking<00:05:13.820> like<00:05:13.850> this

woven pieces of well basically they're

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.420 
woven pieces of well basically they're
straps<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:25.210> your<00:05:26.210> belt<00:05:26.780> is<00:05:27.200> literally<00:05:28.160> going

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
through both of these and then you're

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.830 
through both of these and then you're
going<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.669> lock<00:05:31.880> it<00:05:32.120> into<00:05:32.270> place
