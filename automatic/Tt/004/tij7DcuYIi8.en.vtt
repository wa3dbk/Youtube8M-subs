but basically sticking them on to a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.330 
but basically sticking them on to a
thick<00:01:34.439> piece<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.740> paper<00:01:34.920> kind<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.250> like

thick piece of paper kind of like

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.120 
thick piece of paper kind of like
cardstock<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.320> cutting<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> out<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.890> isn't

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
cardstock and cutting it out now isn't

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.980 
cardstock and cutting it out now isn't
that<00:01:38.280> simple<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.210> gonna<00:01:39.390> do<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.840> layer

that simple I'm just gonna do one layer

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.140 
that simple I'm just gonna do one layer
for<00:01:40.290> now<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.590> fans<00:01:41.130> aren't<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.850> thick

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
for now because fans aren't really thick

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.550 
for now because fans aren't really thick
objects<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.460> I'm<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.700> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
objects so I'm just going to do that and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
objects so I'm just going to do that and
see<00:01:46.560> how<00:01:46.950> good<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> looks<00:01:47.490> now<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.299> I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
see how good it looks now now that I

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.670 
see how good it looks now now that I
think<00:01:48.420> about<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.990> should<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.170> gotten<00:01:49.409> two

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
think about it I should have gotten two

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.990 
think about it I should have gotten two
sheets<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.100> these<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.460> could<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.729> put<00:01:50.850> them

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
sheets of these so I could have put them

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
sheets of these so I could have put them
back<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.450> back<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.470> would<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.619> been<00:01:52.680> two

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
back to back and it would have been two

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.889 
back to back and it would have been two
sided<00:01:53.159> fan<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:54.119> only<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.420> one<00:01:54.570> sheet<00:01:54.780> so

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
sided fan but I only have one sheet so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.959 
sided fan but I only have one sheet so
it's<00:01:55.290> gonna<00:01:55.500> be<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.920> sided<00:01:56.159> fan<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.700> it'll

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it's gonna be a one sided fan but it'll

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.730 
it's gonna be a one sided fan but it'll
still<00:01:57.119> look<00:01:57.180> good<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.540> photos<00:01:57.719> for<00:01:58.500> those<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
still look good in photos for those of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
still look good in photos for those of
you<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.950> are<00:01:59.040> curious<00:01:59.310> these<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.939> mind<00:02:00.360> wave

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you that are curious these are mind wave

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.139 
you that are curious these are mind wave
stickers<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.710> were<00:02:01.799> 200<00:02:02.280> yen<00:02:02.369> plus<00:02:02.670> tax

and there is a mind wave online store

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.020 
and there is a mind wave online store
and<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.540> believe<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.920> quite<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.700> few

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and I believe that they have quite a few

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.200 
and I believe that they have quite a few
I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
I

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.610 
I
they<00:02:10.480> have<00:02:10.630> most<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.990> their<00:02:11.080> stickers<00:02:11.410> on<00:02:11.500> the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
they have most of their stickers on the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.860 
they have most of their stickers on the
online<00:02:11.740> store<00:02:12.250> so<00:02:12.640> I'm<00:02:13.240> afraid<00:02:13.630> they<00:02:13.750> don't

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870

I think that was one of the simplest

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.830 
I think that was one of the simplest
crafts<00:03:25.960> that<00:03:26.350> I've<00:03:26.530> ever<00:03:26.770> done<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:28.030> like<00:03:28.750> to

think it's gonna be okay now I just
gotta<00:03:40.720> see<00:03:40.870> if<00:03:40.960> my<00:03:41.080> doll<00:03:41.290> can<00:03:41.710> hold<00:03:41.920> this<00:03:42.190> so

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
gotta see if my doll can hold this so

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.490 
gotta see if my doll can hold this so
back<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:42.850> doll<00:03:43.300> clips<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.080> if<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.200> don't<00:03:44.350> like

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
back to doll clips so if you don't like

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.950 
back to doll clips so if you don't like
it<00:03:44.710> that<00:03:45.220> was<00:03:45.400> actually<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:46.030> not<00:03:46.660> really<00:03:46.840> a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
it that was actually it not really a

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.770 
it that was actually it not really a
tutorial<00:03:47.320> but<00:03:47.800> an<00:03:48.640> experiment<00:03:49.240> that<00:03:49.270> I<00:03:49.420> just

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
tutorial but an experiment that I just

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.990 
tutorial but an experiment that I just
wanted<00:03:49.960> to<00:03:50.050> try<00:03:50.200> for<00:03:50.230> myself<00:03:50.530> basically<00:03:50.970> tada

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
wanted to try for myself basically tada

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.290 
wanted to try for myself basically tada
so<00:03:52.660> here<00:03:52.900> she<00:03:52.930> is<00:03:53.110> holding<00:03:53.500> a<00:03:53.680> fan<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:54.220> think<00:03:54.940> I

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
so here she is holding a fan I think I

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.300 
so here she is holding a fan I think I
could<00:03:56.050> have<00:03:56.170> used<00:03:56.380> one<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.920> bigger<00:03:57.220> ones

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
could have used one of the bigger ones

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.880 
could have used one of the bigger ones
but<00:03:57.850> I<00:03:57.880> wanted<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.270> as<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:58.480> pink<00:03:58.720> one<00:03:58.900> but<00:03:59.530> as<00:03:59.800> you

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
but I wanted it as a pink one but as you

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.170 
but I wanted it as a pink one but as you
can<00:04:00.010> see<00:04:00.130> there<00:04:00.280> are<00:04:00.340> different<00:04:00.670> sized<00:04:00.850> ones

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
can see there are different sized ones

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.600 
can see there are different sized ones
so<00:04:01.720> I'm<00:04:02.410> gonna<00:04:02.530> go<00:04:02.680> ahead<00:04:02.890> and<00:04:03.160> make<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.370> few

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
so I'm gonna go ahead and make a few

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.670 
so I'm gonna go ahead and make a few
more<00:04:03.700> up<00:04:03.880> because<00:04:04.330> I<00:04:04.540> don't<00:04:04.810> really<00:04:05.320> have<00:04:05.650> a

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
more up because I don't really have a

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.470 
more up because I don't really have a
used<00:04:06.040> for<00:04:06.250> these<00:04:06.370> stickers<00:04:06.580> right<00:04:06.820> now<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.270> I

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
used for these stickers right now and I

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.420 
used for these stickers right now and I
bought<00:04:07.720> them<00:04:07.900> with<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.140> purpose<00:04:08.500> but<00:04:09.310> the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
bought them with the purpose but the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.370 
bought them with the purpose but the
intent<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:10.000> using<00:04:10.360> them<00:04:10.480> for<00:04:10.600> this<00:04:10.690> purpose<00:04:10.960> so

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
intent of using them for this purpose so

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.510 
intent of using them for this purpose so
I'm<00:04:11.500> gonna<00:04:11.590> make<00:04:11.740> a<00:04:11.800> bigger<00:04:12.070> one<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.310> we'll

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
I'm gonna make a bigger one and we'll

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:51.930 
I'm gonna make a bigger one and we'll
see<00:04:12.670> how<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.940> looks

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.330 

to<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.600> ha<00:04:53.050> so<00:04:53.170> this<00:04:53.350> band<00:04:53.590> actually<00:04:54.040> looks

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
to the ha so this band actually looks

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.130 
to the ha so this band actually looks
much<00:04:54.910> better<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.300> think<00:04:55.630> it's<00:04:55.750> because<00:04:55.930> it's<00:04:56.080> a

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
much better I think it's because it's a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.190 
much better I think it's because it's a
little<00:04:56.320> bit<00:04:56.470> bigger<00:04:56.710> and<00:04:57.040> I<00:04:57.870> think<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:58.990> looks

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
little bit bigger and I think it looks

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.620 
little bit bigger and I think it looks
really<00:04:59.650> good<00:04:59.800> I'm<00:05:00.130> actually<00:05:00.580> impressed<00:05:00.970> I

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
really good I'm actually impressed I

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.920 
really good I'm actually impressed I
mean<00:05:01.870> I'm<00:05:02.590> sure<00:05:02.650> that<00:05:03.040> they<00:05:03.220> sell<00:05:03.730> fan<00:05:04.390> props

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
mean I'm sure that they sell fan props

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.950 
mean I'm sure that they sell fan props
somewhere<00:05:05.650> but<00:05:06.250> these<00:05:07.120> speakers<00:05:07.390> were<00:05:07.630> just

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
somewhere but these speakers were just

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.610 
somewhere but these speakers were just
perfect

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
perfect

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.280 
perfect
and<00:05:08.890> she<00:05:09.520> looks<00:05:10.120> like<00:05:10.360> she<00:05:10.660> is<00:05:10.690> ready<00:05:11.110> for

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.920 
and she looks like she is ready for

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
summer it's like I said I know this is

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.290 
summer it's like I said I know this is
super<00:05:14.110> simple<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.770> most<00:05:15.610> of<00:05:15.730> you<00:05:15.790> guys<00:05:15.910> could

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
super simple and most of you guys could

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.700 
super simple and most of you guys could
have<00:05:16.420> probably<00:05:16.630> thought<00:05:17.140> of<00:05:17.260> it<00:05:17.380> on<00:05:17.530> your<00:05:17.650> own

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
have probably thought of it on your own

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.130 
have probably thought of it on your own
but<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.370> find<00:05:18.610> that<00:05:18.850> with<00:05:19.480> the<00:05:19.570> littles<00:05:19.840> things

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
but I find that with the littles things

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.870 
but I find that with the littles things
sometimes<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.980> see<00:05:21.130> a<00:05:21.160> video<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.580> you<00:05:21.670> think

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
sometimes you see a video and you think

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.420 
sometimes you see a video and you think
oh<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.390> could<00:05:22.600> do<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.900> too<00:05:23.230> and<00:05:23.500> I<00:05:23.920> thought

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
oh I could do that too and I thought

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.820
