00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:12.299
 Hello, everybody, please come this time to Cherny 12 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.269
 It's time. 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:19.500
 You guys look at the score 12 times. 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:24.779
 If you look at the score , the beat in front of you will have a different beat. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:28.949
 This is about eight minutes, eight. 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.599
 Because the number of stamps on the 8th stretched to one, it was another 2 nights 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.160
 It doubles. 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.480
 Mr. Rachel will drink the first word and two words. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 I'll read it once. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 Shizua 2 3 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.820
 Haha 2 New Haha 2 3 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.619
 Haha, you are so good. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:57.960
 123 123 to the teacher's word now 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:01:03.180
 I read this because your quarter note on your right hand changes to two beats 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.500
 Because of this, you can not feel the speed 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.460
 I feel it, but at first I am a helper in my left hand. 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:18.090
 I do not think you're out of the eighth note, so you're not going to hit the dagger faster . 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:23.219
 Can you also need you mitsul one bream Sol will have to go, one step away 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 After a few minutes of practice, you will practice dpi and then dpi Forte 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:29.969
 You should go to the original tempo of the piano. 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:34.369
 Now, the first time I picked it, I found something weird when I saw you hitting it. 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:38.430
 Orsa. Please show me one time. 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 Look at the above two times 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 Trapani Would you hit it once to pop a teacher connected to the part quickly 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.990
 You did 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.920
 Please take a look at the Palm once more. 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.490
 You have to. 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.729
 Eight minutes is a line on the side of the table. 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.000
 That's where you wash the flies . 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:09.149
 It 's called the body of dreams in music. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.929
 I added an arm to my face and hit it quickly to decorate it nicely. 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.950
 It is. 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:19.980
 I can hear this kind of stuff coming soon, and it sounds really cute. 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.790
 Now, when you guys beat 22 times, your finger burner is very difficult. 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:29.190
 Despite the same number of fingers 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.730
 It just keeps changing, so you keep your eyes wide open and focus more 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:37.050
 If you change your finger to that part 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:42.630
 Out you will need you to hit up a party of our teachers 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.980
 Only gonna drill right hand struck off once the right hand from the first line to the fourth week 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.400
 I'll find you. 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.209
 Please prepare. 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.209
 field 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.810
 Ahaha 2 3 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.050
 Oh bakkwija in the right part 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.400
 uh 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.819
 Ahaha 2 3 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.819
 Ah 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.600
 Ae 5 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.840
 Oh, it's 2 o'clock 5 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.840
 Ah 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.880
 Ah 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.880
 It's changed again. 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:36.239
 Oh, yes, it keeps changing. It's the same as the Soviet Union. 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:38.269
 Guernsey is half-full. Oh, watch out. 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.269
 Ah 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:48.310
 Oh, that was very good. As our teacher showed , 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.230
 Hasyeoseo still changes even as such also exert you continue this quickness 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.700
 You have to change your fingers. 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.250
 Let's look at the left hand once and the left hand first and second 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.790
 I'll finish the line. 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.260
 Show me 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.260
 You should practice slowly . 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:16.000
 To do this well, my little finger does not have power and my thumb is strong. 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.000
 You can grab your fingers pretty while you're not there. 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:24.560
 Then be careful. 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:29.930
 Thank you. 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:35.150
 In the last part, the middle part of the book is a table. 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:38.780
 Because of this, you have to hold it down until you hit it 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:44.780
 Show me the last part. 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:50.030
 Yes, I'll see the whole thing this time. 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.780
 Mr. Rachel will play until the end. The original tempo of this meat is very great. 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.220
 It's fast. 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:58.280
 Because it's fast to Allegro, put it at -30. 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.389
 And then I'll play from start to finish. 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.389
 Please press play button. 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.670
 tera 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:15.900
 5a to negative 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.900
 Be careful with dentures. 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:40.689
 5 ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:47.080
 Please give me one. 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:06:01.419
 Ah we 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:06:06.759
 You were too good at 5 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:08.619
 Those who are still feeling a little faster say - 42 or 50 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.999
 You have to practice enough. 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:14.289
 Now do you see our example, one teacher is very difficult to beat at the end 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:19.779
 You gave it to me. 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:22.569
 I'll show you the last one on the last line. 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:29.319
 Can you look again 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:31.749
 Yes. 2 You have to play it out . Hold it. 

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:34.979
 And turn it on. 

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:34.979
 Save your staccato. 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:44.380
 It's a sash . 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:45.640
 In this section, you can see the stomach, 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.320
 It will be 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:54.610
 I need you to give it a second and then give your hand a little more time to save the staccato. 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:59.830
 I need these parts to be able to beat these nine more perfectly . 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:05.530
 Now that the package came from his right hand, and those two are nearly 8 times 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:10.720
 You must memorize that the 8-part slip becomes one beat when you grow up. 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:14.830
 We saw you at number 13. Number 13 at number three. 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:18.570
 So be sure to memorize 8 minutes for a beat. 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.570
 I'll sell it in room three next time.
