it is certainly a warning for us a

but<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:40.270> conclusion<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.500> inescapable

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.750 

in<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.080> case<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.290> larsen<00:02:49.800> b<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.160> example<00:02:50.640> we

in the case of larsen b for example we

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.670 
in the case of larsen b for example we
know<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.210> i<00:02:51.450> self<00:02:51.750> existed<00:02:52.320> for<00:02:52.500> at

least eleven twelve thousand years in
2002<00:02:56.130> two-thirds<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.030> collapsed<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.780> in

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
less than six weeks and in the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.300 
less than six weeks and in the
intervening<00:03:02.430> period<00:03:02.610> between<00:03:03.030> 2002<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:03.960> now

intervening period between 2002 and now
the<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.340> remaining<00:03:06.210> part<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.690> larsen<00:03:07.140> b<00:03:07.170> has

the the remaining part of larsen b has

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.590 
the the remaining part of larsen b has
also<00:03:07.980> been<00:03:08.340> weakening<00:03:08.790> very<00:03:09.090> very<00:03:09.300> quickly

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
also been weakening very very quickly

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.180 
also been weakening very very quickly
and<00:03:10.160> we<00:03:11.160> expect<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.790> will<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.180> last<00:03:12.710> for<00:03:13.710> more

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
and we expect it will not last for more

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.180 
and we expect it will not last for more
than<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.430> few<00:03:14.490> years<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:15.030> come

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.520 

this<00:03:23.190> will<00:03:23.550> undoubtedly<00:03:23.989> effect<00:03:24.989> sea-level

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
this will undoubtedly effect sea-level

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.910 
this will undoubtedly effect sea-level
rise<00:03:25.680> by<00:03:26.010> putting<00:03:26.430> more<00:03:26.610> ice<00:03:26.910> into<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.440> ocean

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
rise by putting more ice into the ocean

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.070 
rise by putting more ice into the ocean
and<00:03:29.099> in<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.790> case<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.060> don't<00:03:30.330> even<00:03:30.510> need<00:03:30.840> to

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
and in this case you don't even need to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.390 
and in this case you don't even need to
melt<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.470> ice<00:03:31.849> think<00:03:32.849> of<00:03:33.050> your<00:03:34.050> ice<00:03:34.709> cube<00:03:35.190> in

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
melt the ice think of your ice cube in

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.380 
melt the ice think of your ice cube in
your<00:03:35.760> drink<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:37.620> liquid<00:03:38.099> in<00:03:38.400> your<00:03:38.640> cup<00:03:39.090> before

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
your drink the liquid in your cup before

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.210 
your drink the liquid in your cup before
you<00:03:39.660> add<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.870> ice<00:03:40.319> cube<00:03:40.530> with<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.830> certain

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
you add the ice cube with a certain

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.600 
you add the ice cube with a certain
level<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:42.180> put<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.480> ice<00:03:42.630> cube<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:44.250> that

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
level you put the ice cube and the that

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.790 
level you put the ice cube and the that
level<00:03:45.000> will<00:03:45.180> rise<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:46.319> is<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> direct

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
level will rise and this is a direct

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:55.050 
level will rise and this is a direct
analogy<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.819> what<00:03:47.849> is<00:03:48.239> happening<00:03:48.450> here

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.809 

now<00:03:55.780> we<00:03:56.349> have<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.680> rare<00:03:56.980> opportunity<00:03:57.010> of

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
now we have this rare opportunity of

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.160 
now we have this rare opportunity of
this<00:03:58.120> ice<00:03:58.900> shelf<00:03:59.670> destabilizing<00:04:00.670> and

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
this ice shelf destabilizing and

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.600 
this ice shelf destabilizing and
eventually<00:04:02.170> collapsing<00:04:02.680> in<00:04:02.920> front<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.459> our

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
eventually collapsing in front of our

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.610 
eventually collapsing in front of our
eyes<00:04:03.910> and<00:04:04.300> so<00:04:04.690> we're<00:04:04.840> keeping<00:04:04.959> an<00:04:05.200> eye<00:04:05.319> on<00:04:05.349> and

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
eyes and so we're keeping an eye on and

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.589 
eyes and so we're keeping an eye on and
we're<00:04:05.800> studying<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.370> and<00:04:06.520> that<00:04:07.270> will<00:04:07.900> give<00:04:07.930> us

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
we're studying it and that will give us

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.300 
we're studying it and that will give us
incredibly<00:04:10.599> valuable<00:04:10.959> lessons<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:12.099> we

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
incredibly valuable lessons that we

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.309 
incredibly valuable lessons that we
could<00:04:12.489> understand<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.450> we<00:04:13.930> could<00:04:14.110> use<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
could understand that we could use to

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.050 
could understand that we could use to
understand<00:04:14.950> what<00:04:15.459> might<00:04:15.670> be<00:04:15.849> happening

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
understand what might be happening

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.509 
understand what might be happening
elsewhere<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:17.200> better<00:04:17.739> predict<00:04:18.280> what<00:04:18.489> might

elsewhere and better predict what might
