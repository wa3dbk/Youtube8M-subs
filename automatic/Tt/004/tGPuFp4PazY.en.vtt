go back into our resources folder and I

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.889 
go back into our resources folder and I
threw<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> bunch<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.149> textures<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:33.750> that

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
threw a bunch of textures in here that

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.350 
threw a bunch of textures in here that
came<00:00:34.140> default<00:00:34.980> with<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.880> pro<00:00:36.149> games

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360

all right so we'll save that off and if
we'll<00:02:21.620> start<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:21.980> back<00:02:22.100> up<00:02:22.160> will<00:02:22.820> notice<00:02:23.090> where

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
start off with that will just take a

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.680 
start off with that will just take a
look<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.850> we're<00:03:01.850> missing<00:03:02.120> one<00:03:02.150> one<00:03:02.450> two

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
look here we're missing one one two

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.780 
look here we're missing one one two
three<00:03:03.140> four<00:03:03.470> five<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:03.860> we're<00:03:04.519> missing<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
three four five and we're missing the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.699 
three four five and we're missing the
blonde<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:05.989> because<00:03:06.140> I<00:03:06.200> actually<00:03:06.320> spelt

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
blonde and it's because I actually spelt

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.530 
blonde and it's because I actually spelt
it<00:03:06.860> wrong<00:03:09.549> so<00:03:10.549> let's<00:03:10.850> say<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.000> off<00:03:11.329> will

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
it wrong so let's say that off will

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.770 
it wrong so let's say that off will
start<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.810> back<00:03:11.900> up<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:13.700> there<00:03:13.910> we<00:03:14.030> go<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.600> my

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
start it back up and there we go have my

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.830 
start it back up and there we go have my
little<00:03:14.959> hair<00:03:15.230> textures<00:03:15.590> being<00:03:15.769> displayed<00:03:16.160> and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
little hair textures being displayed and

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.780 
little hair textures being displayed and
apparently<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.140> red<00:03:18.410> one<00:03:19.190> seems<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.700> be<00:03:19.760> a

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
apparently the red one seems to be a

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.310 
apparently the red one seems to be a
little<00:03:19.940> bit<00:03:20.090> smaller<00:03:20.480> than<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.870> rest<00:03:21.079> so<00:03:21.230> I'm

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
little bit smaller than the rest so I'm

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.560 
little bit smaller than the rest so I'm
not<00:03:21.470> sure<00:03:21.739> what's<00:03:21.920> going<00:03:22.070> on<00:03:22.220> there<00:03:22.570> it's

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
not sure what's going on there it's

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.190 
not sure what's going on there it's
going<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.810> take<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.989> look<00:03:25.840> we<00:03:26.840> don't<00:03:26.959> actually

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
going to take a look we don't actually

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.550 
going to take a look we don't actually
need<00:03:27.590> that<00:03:27.650> needed<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.370> be<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.640> size<00:03:29.560> it's

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
need that needed to be that size it's

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.670 
need that needed to be that size it's
256<00:03:31.040> x<00:03:31.130> 2<00:03:31.190> 26<00:03:31.610> we<00:03:31.700> probably<00:03:31.940> shrink<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.390> down

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.620 

now<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.739> one<00:03:36.829> hundred<00:03:37.040> percent<00:03:37.070> sure<00:03:37.280> wides

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
now the one hundred percent sure wides

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.670 
now the one hundred percent sure wides
displaying<00:03:38.630> a<00:03:38.810> little<00:03:39.170> bit<00:03:39.320> differently

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
displaying a little bit differently

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.080 
displaying a little bit differently
they're<00:03:39.860> all<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.190> take<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.370> look<00:03:41.170> my<00:03:42.170> other

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
they're all to take a look my other

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.009 
they're all to take a look my other
projects<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.209> know<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.480> other<00:03:44.600> project

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
projects I know the other project

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.940 
projects I know the other project
they're<00:03:45.110> all<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.410> same<00:03:45.440> size<00:03:49.120> but<00:03:50.120> anyway

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
they're all the same size but anyway

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.229 
they're all the same size but anyway
let's<00:03:51.950> actually<00:03:52.100> pick<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.430> hairstyle<00:03:52.940> that<00:03:53.000> has

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
let's actually pick a hairstyle that has

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.039 
let's actually pick a hairstyle that has
some<00:03:53.510> hair<00:03:54.130> rotate<00:03:55.130> our<00:03:55.250> character<00:03:55.610> a<00:03:55.640> bit<00:03:55.790> and

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
some hair rotate our character a bit and

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.970 
some hair rotate our character a bit and
now<00:03:57.049> when<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.290> start<00:03:57.530> clicking<00:03:57.739> on<00:03:57.860> these

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
now when you start clicking on these

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.050 
now when you start clicking on these
buttons<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:59.660> will<00:03:59.810> change<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.140> hair<00:04:00.260> color

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.270 

and<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:04.440> pretty<00:04:04.680> much<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:04.890> for<00:04:05.040> this

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
and that's pretty much it for this

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:14.270 
and that's pretty much it for this
tutorial<00:04:07.069> will<00:04:08.069> change<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:09.680> body<00:04:10.680> type<00:04:13.280> and

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
tutorial will change the body type and

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.740 
tutorial will change the body type and
until<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.670> hair<00:04:14.910> still<00:04:15.150> needs<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.390> be<00:04:15.450> sized

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
until this hair still needs to be sized
