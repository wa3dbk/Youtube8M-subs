00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
Nikon it has the silent wave motor it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
Nikon it has the silent wave motor it
has<00:01:10.619> kind<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:10.950> OneTouch<00:01:11.340> manual<00:01:11.729> focus

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
has kind of OneTouch manual focus

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.780 
has kind of OneTouch manual focus
you've<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> nano<00:01:13.890> crystal<00:01:14.310> coating<00:01:14.340> on

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you've got the nano crystal coating on

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.770 
you've got the nano crystal coating on
the<00:01:14.880> lens<00:01:14.909> which<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> help<00:01:15.600> with

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
the lens which is going to help with

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.289 
the lens which is going to help with
lens<00:01:16.530> flare<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.490> also<00:01:17.610> got<00:01:17.820> two<00:01:18.000> spherical

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
lens flare it's also got two spherical

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.429 
lens flare it's also got two spherical
elements<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.080> you're<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.320> have

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
elements in it so you're going to have

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
elements in it so you're going to have
sharp<00:01:19.740> images<00:01:20.070> straight<00:01:20.520> across<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.880> whole

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
sharp images straight across the whole

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420 
sharp images straight across the whole
frame<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> 9<00:01:22.650> blade<00:01:22.890> aperture<00:01:23.189> which

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
frame and as a 9 blade aperture which

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.649 
frame and as a 9 blade aperture which
gives<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> nice<00:01:23.850> round<00:01:24.210> out-of-focus

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
gives you a nice round out-of-focus

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.830 
gives you a nice round out-of-focus
highlights<00:01:25.549> so<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> had<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.030> 58<00:01:27.630> millimeter

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
highlights so I had this 58 millimeter

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.140 
highlights so I had this 58 millimeter
lens<00:01:28.229> from<00:01:28.470> Nikon<00:01:28.799> 1.4<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> week<00:01:30.030> or
