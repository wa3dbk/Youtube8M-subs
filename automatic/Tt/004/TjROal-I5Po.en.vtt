website Freddie artcom the purpose of
this<00:00:21.119> tool<00:00:21.449> was<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.199> eliminate<00:00:22.699> tedious

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
this tool was to eliminate tedious

this tool was to eliminate tedious
reference<00:00:24.119> gathering<00:00:24.689> than<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> manual<00:00:25.560> way

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
reference gathering than the manual way

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.370 
reference gathering than the manual way
so<00:00:26.910> for<00:00:27.090> example<00:00:27.180> whenever<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:27.990> working<00:00:28.289> on

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
so for example whenever I was working on

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.070 
so for example whenever I was working on
JC<00:00:28.890> all-stars<00:00:29.750> there<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:31.019> of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
JC all-stars there was a lot of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.330 
JC all-stars there was a lot of
reference<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:31.590> different<00:00:31.980> types<00:00:32.099> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
different characters on the team that I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.410 
different characters on the team that I
would<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> beginning<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.329> each

would have to at the beginning of each

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.110 
would have to at the beginning of each
project<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.710> drag<00:00:38.070> these<00:00:38.309> files<00:00:38.579> over

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120

this manually a few times it became

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.119 
this manually a few times it became
apparent<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> would<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.649> better<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.890> do

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
apparent to me it would be better to do

file format that's in there it'll just

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
file format that's in there it'll just
ignore<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.610> once<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.659> find<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> appropriate

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170

there's<00:01:43.619> another<00:01:43.829> window<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.280> pops<00:01:44.520> up<00:01:44.759> this

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
there's another window that pops up this

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.639 
there's another window that pops up this
one<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.810> verify<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.350> we're<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.560> the
