 Well, because that's because the man will now 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.609
 I think it becomes the second semester. 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.609
 Anyone who wants to come in 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.329
 you must have a personal password 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:23.730
 non-transferable 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.130
 of bondage access 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 and although this very simple password 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.419
 You just need to send an email. 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.250
 for us so that we can put your password on the server 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.550

 I think he might have happened 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.200
 nick 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.460
 this is mine 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 discord 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.179
 Reminiscing something 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.850
 olic chosen with you 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.290
 you should use a bit of entering the server if you use a different nike 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.470
 even then the plant will happen in transferred then 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.910
 the Nikkei you choose is a team that you're going to use I gave everything 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.830
 served to enter 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.350
 after entering you can even change the mix 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.210
 more to enter you will have to use Nikkei 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 What did you send us then? 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.080
 tells you to think of units that you want to use 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.740
 because later 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.990
 why did you put a link that you want to change was not power 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.500
 your limit 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.940
 your password 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.080
 try writing a ticket with 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.020
 roth 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.600
 the cartels 5x1 in the colloquy very character and different because it can 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.020
 cause some problem 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.210
 even being the coach 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.619
 ease between the server so the cimi that well simplistic 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.460
 It's just chat of the same sort after the sweet life you can already change how 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.990
 you want 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.990
 these are complications 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.859
 The first explains how to do it. 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.109
 to enter this password 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.489
 it is evident that 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.379
 in his last government 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.909
 well you hear pirate the human being 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.449
 my computer 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.749
 if two points 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.309
 program files 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.969
 with the text is that only the 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.289
 if he leaves 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.129
 if it's cool 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.599
 Lastly 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.979
 and if it had 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:43.139
 a game file with the site 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.519
 that it automatically executes whatever command you put inside it 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:51.839
 good in the case of Japan I learned here from 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.689
 Brasilia considers itself written 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.769
 you should put the following thing in your self example 7 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.239
 in force 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.869
 right with everything together 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.549
 this step 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.549
 candelaria me 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.919
 space 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.059
 your password 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:16.259
 access server 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.539
 with this it is from here 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:20.409
 automatically 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.649
 your game every time you abe eli lilly radesca cento 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.710
 so if there is no complaint of sugarcane without the most power 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.710
 enter a server 

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:36.369
 this is the procedure for you to play without attack from which you are a pirate partner 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.489
 the continuation of playing and if the same password at the top and zack of 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.679
 with strike 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.159
 all have 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.490
 you should stay where you are installed 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.849
 in the unit where this room of your this year 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.949
 in my case it's a colon 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.949
 give passes have 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.769
 of the folder 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.769
 is on the move 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.969
 in the name of your account 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.429
 in the name of the game with three people 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.280
 in the square ceci site 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.389
 from now on it's the same path as the 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.209
 the pirate 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.129
 the fox will fix 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:26.139
 and lastly in the pastoral three years 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.210
 where you must enter the password 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.370
 why do not you need this year every time 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.319
 then when you open your game there will be automatically typed 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.110
 right 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:42.400
 one more time 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.430
 so that you do not forget 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.200
 for you to enter inside the server you should be using olic 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.090
 to which you can see yourself in the e-mail in vienna for us 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.509
 use the password that you also put in that month 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:59.439
 if you put a little more space at the end 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.490
 a little space in between 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.860
 will not work cei will be automatically shocked 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.710
 place exactly the same 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.729
 any doubt any problem 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.729
