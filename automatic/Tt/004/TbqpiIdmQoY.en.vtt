camera<00:01:16.579> angle<00:01:17.079> unfortunately<00:01:18.079> so<00:01:18.819> the<00:01:19.819> second

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
camera angle unfortunately so the second

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.380 
camera angle unfortunately so the second
camera<00:01:20.329> is<00:01:20.479> always<00:01:20.719> sort<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:21.049> compromise<00:01:22.390> in

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
camera is always sort of a compromise in

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.649 
camera is always sort of a compromise in
this<00:01:23.569> case<00:01:23.840> since<00:01:24.409> it's<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:25.399> front<00:01:25.640> shot<00:01:25.880> it's

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
this case since it's a front shot it's

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.630 
this case since it's a front shot it's
all<00:01:26.780> fairly<00:01:27.049> flat<00:01:27.319> light<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:27.829> can<00:01:28.399> get<00:01:28.520> away

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
all fairly flat light I can get away

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.819 
all fairly flat light I can get away
with<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:28.999> that<00:01:29.899> camera<00:01:30.229> angle<00:01:30.350> looks<00:01:30.649> more

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
with this that camera angle looks more

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.139 
with this that camera angle looks more
interesting<00:01:30.859> in<00:01:31.340> terms<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.670> light<00:01:31.850> because

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
interesting in terms of light because

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.520 
interesting in terms of light because
you<00:01:32.240> can<00:01:32.389> actually<00:01:32.689> give<00:01:32.780> the<00:01:32.810> give<00:01:33.409> the

about<00:01:36.499> the<00:01:37.009> DSLRs<00:01:37.909> is<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:38.840> can<00:01:38.990> either

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
about the DSLRs is that you can either

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.050 
about the DSLRs is that you can either
make<00:01:39.350> them<00:01:39.439> look<00:01:39.619> HD<00:01:40.130> in<00:01:40.369> which<00:01:40.609> they're<00:01:40.819> very
