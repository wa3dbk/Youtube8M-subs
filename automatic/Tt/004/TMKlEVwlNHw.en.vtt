00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 good afternoon dear subscribers and jam with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.640
 you quickly finally brought me 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.440
 lighting for shooting and now the picture 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.719
 should be better but I remind you that 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 we have in turn the transfer of fresh gnata 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.019
 program in which we talk about 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 any new in 7 in which 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.670
 really worth playing and know in 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.760
 lately with the team literally 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 some turkey and some 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.570
 incomprehensible andy games that generally 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.430
 even it is not clear who is going to play something 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.630
 have you looked at them and it seems to you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.030
 what the hell why is it who did it who 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.980
 thought of actually allowing sales 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.930
 and accordingly because of this very 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300
 hard to find any game for 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.950
 transfer fresh suit and could be 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.550
 say what 's up guys this game 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.770
 the good 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.260
 play I spent a lot of time 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.210
 on searches but something found in principle 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.550
 Today we will talk about one andy game 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.110
 indie shooter right to say but he 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.390
 there is one feature the fact is that 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.890
 all levels in this game are determined 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.760
 randomly that is when you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 go into it 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.800
 you don't know how the level is generated and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.870
 what is waiting for you in the future we will talk about 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 the name of the game which I say 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.530
 I dare to do it for sure 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 wrong then they will fly to me a bunch 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.189
 as let me provide this translator 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.869
 google and any of our 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.250
 thanks a lot to the plot of this game 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.290
 present but plays quite 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.180
 secondary role as there is only 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.909
 one big picture describing 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.400
 what's happening you play for a hero who 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.009
 trying to understand what is happening in his 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.780
 dark world full of conspiracies and on this 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.950
 everything 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.810
 directly at the storyline level 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 present only as an assignment 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.110
 which need to perform so 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.810
 boast a beautiful story 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.460
 illumination can not yes it is not necessary 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.799
 as as strengths 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.750
 exhibited gameplay design and surroundings 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.750
 they now I will tell more in detail 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.200
 the game has character pumping 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.690
 before starting the game we are given to choose 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.420
 personality who will be the main character and from 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.040
 this depends on the initial characteristics 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.170
 which can be pumped further 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.390
 after each successfully completed level 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.380
 you will get some points which 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.650
 can be spent on improvement 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.600
 characteristics of gameplay here are plain 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.670
 move through the level shoot at 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.690
 enemies look for the necessary items to 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.400
 perform a task 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.650
 but it wo n't always be easy 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.140
 as I said levels in the game 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.180
 generated randomly therefore 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.820
 you never know what awaits you in 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.550
 Further, for example, if you die on 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.590
 level and start it again the entourage and 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.780
 the location of objects and the job itself 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.820
 may already be different with regard to 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.770
 assignments you can charge to collect 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.690
 a certain number of items or 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.209
 kill a certain character or 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.980
 get to your goal after a successful 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.010
 complete the job to complete the level 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.930
 will need to get to the exit design 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.120
 also not bad despite the fact that 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.430
 as the enemies are the usual letters 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.080
 each of them also implies 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.120
 certain person about which we can 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.700
 learn from the inscription located above 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.890
 the opponent also pleased the drawing 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.940
 character's hands weapon and some 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.040
 items at level 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.170
 if you look closely you can see that 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.450
 they are made of software code 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.700
 it creates the feeling that we are in 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.350
 Matrix also amused the game 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.690
 machines from which you can knock out 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.730
 certain things well if you're lucky a 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.130
 if you are not lucky you can blow yourself up 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.010
 bomb and the whole atmosphere in the game 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.630
 created an excellent dark level and gloomy 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.880
 elements give the impression of some 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.130
 hopelessness and totalitarian enslaved 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.720
 sti with which our main fight 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.060
 hero 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.950
 what is the output turned out quite fit 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.780
 Andy shooter with its own features 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.850
 entourage able to lure on a few 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.380
 days but I basically have it all on 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.180
 this will say goodbye to you were astro 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.830
 before the new meetings was the transfer of fresh 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.690
 sunday subscribe to channel spin
