trying to hide from them until I can get
a<00:05:43.039> shot<00:05:43.099> once<00:05:44.000> there<00:05:44.120> uber<00:05:44.360> is<00:05:44.389> gone<00:05:44.660> I<00:05:44.990> take

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
a shot once there uber is gone I take

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.230 
a shot once there uber is gone I take
out<00:05:45.500> the<00:05:45.650> soldier<00:05:46.039> and<00:05:46.070> my<00:05:46.669> teammates<00:05:46.970> take

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.610 

so<00:05:58.190> our<00:05:59.180> car<00:05:59.360> hasn't<00:05:59.600> moved<00:05:59.630> up<00:05:59.900> much<00:06:00.110> much

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
so our car hasn't moved up much much

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.030 
so our car hasn't moved up much much
maybe<00:06:00.890> like<00:06:01.190> a<00:06:01.490> couple<00:06:02.240> feet<00:06:02.530> so<00:06:03.530> I'm<00:06:03.710> still

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
that we can move up a little low on

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.390 
that we can move up a little low on
health<00:06:08.750> here<00:06:09.020> so<00:06:09.290> got<00:06:09.680> to<00:06:09.770> go<00:06:09.830> back<00:06:09.980> for<00:06:10.250> some

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
health here so got to go back for some

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.590 
health here so got to go back for some
health<00:06:15.730> all<00:06:16.730> right<00:06:16.850> so<00:06:16.970> now<00:06:17.060> that<00:06:17.180> I<00:06:17.240> card<00:06:17.480> has

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
health all right so now that I card has

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.050 
health all right so now that I card has
moved<00:06:17.750> up<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:17.960> bunch<00:06:18.500> I<00:06:18.980> Trek<00:06:19.640> about<00:06:19.910> this

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
moved up a bunch I Trek about this

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.060 
moved up a bunch I Trek about this
doorway<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:20.750> I<00:06:21.140> probably<00:06:21.680> should<00:06:22.040> have

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
doorway and I probably should have

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.950 
doorway and I probably should have
checked<00:06:22.340> all<00:06:22.790> these<00:06:23.210> jumped<00:06:23.600> a<00:06:23.630> little<00:06:23.660> bit

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
checked all these jumped a little bit

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.210 
checked all these jumped a little bit
while<00:06:24.080> coming<00:06:24.320> out<00:06:24.410> that<00:06:24.560> door<00:06:24.740> way<00:06:24.890> because

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
while coming out that door way because

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.460 
while coming out that door way because
snipers<00:06:25.700> like<00:06:25.910> to<00:06:26.030> cover<00:06:26.210> that<00:06:26.450> Dory<00:06:26.720> they

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
snipers like to cover that Dory they

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.680 
snipers like to cover that Dory they
have<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.650> lot<00:06:27.950> of<00:06:27.980> a<00:06:28.280> lot<00:06:28.910> of<00:06:29.000> spots<00:06:29.300> and<00:06:29.540> a<00:06:29.570> lot

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
have a lot of a lot of spots and a lot

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.650 
have a lot of a lot of spots and a lot
of<00:06:29.810> lines<00:06:30.590> of<00:06:30.770> sight<00:06:31.010> to<00:06:31.190> get<00:06:31.370> you<00:06:31.550> so<00:06:32.210> I<00:06:32.240> I

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
of lines of sight to get you so I I

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.340 
of lines of sight to get you so I I
guess<00:06:33.140> I<00:06:33.170> should<00:06:33.650> have<00:06:33.710> jumped<00:06:34.030> kind<00:06:35.030> of<00:06:35.090> like

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
guess I should have jumped kind of like

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.140 
guess I should have jumped kind of like
frantically<00:06:36.670> coming<00:06:37.670> out<00:06:37.760> of<00:06:37.790> that<00:06:37.850> doorway

for the engineer get rid of engineer

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.600 
for the engineer get rid of engineer
first<00:06:59.240> or<00:06:59.570> lose<00:06:59.750> the<00:06:59.840> dispenser<00:07:00.350> and<00:07:00.610> from

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
first or lose the dispenser and from

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.870 
first or lose the dispenser and from
there<00:07:01.850> the<00:07:03.190> century<00:07:04.190> would<00:07:04.340> be<00:07:04.460> easier<00:07:04.730> to

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
there the century would be easier to

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.580 
there the century would be easier to
kill

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.370

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
dispenser but this pyro spiral gets me

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.770

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
look a little suspicious so I took them

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.150 
look a little suspicious so I took them
out<00:07:20.640> I'm<00:07:21.390> too<00:07:21.750> weak<00:07:22.140> to<00:07:22.410> help<00:07:22.650> push<00:07:22.830> the<00:07:22.950> cart

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160
