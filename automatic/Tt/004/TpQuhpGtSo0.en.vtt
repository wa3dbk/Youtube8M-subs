throughout the universe we have to

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.420 
throughout the universe we have to
travel<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.350> these<00:00:49.379> weird<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> wacky

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
thing that really makes Mario Galaxy so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.939 
thing that really makes Mario Galaxy so
engaging<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.690> galaxies<00:00:55.170> themselves<00:00:55.350> or

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
engaging is the galaxies themselves or

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.470 
engaging is the galaxies themselves or
more<00:00:56.100> specifically<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> level<00:00:56.879> design<00:00:56.969> these

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
more specifically the level design these

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.420 
more specifically the level design these
are<00:00:57.899> some<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> weirdest<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> most

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
are some of the weirdest and most

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.549 
are some of the weirdest and most
bizarre<00:01:00.030> platformer<00:01:00.660> levels<00:01:00.930> ever<00:01:01.109> created

bizarre platformer levels ever created
and<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.160> lot<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.460> has<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.239> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and a lot of that has to do with the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.729 
and a lot of that has to do with the
celestial<00:01:03.870> theme<00:01:04.140> they'll<00:01:04.559> try<00:01:04.650> these

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
celestial theme they'll try these

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.050 
celestial theme they'll try these
different<00:01:05.159> galaxies<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> you'll<00:01:05.880> find

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
different galaxies and you'll find

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
different galaxies and you'll find
yourself<00:01:06.180> wandering<00:01:06.689> around<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:07.470> crazy

you're<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:12.840> sphere<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
you're on you know one sphere and

you're on you know one sphere and
there's<00:01:13.530> another<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.890> nearby<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.670> just

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
there's another one nearby you can just

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.039 
there's another one nearby you can just
kind<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> jump<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> you'll<00:01:15.780> sort<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
kind of jump and you'll sort of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.380 
kind of jump and you'll sort of
gravitate<00:01:16.590> toward<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.189> other<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.270> can

gravitate toward the other one you can

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
gravitate toward the other one you can

kind of float through space in different
areas<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.790> use<00:01:20.909> these<00:01:21.060> launch<00:01:21.330> stars

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.359 
areas and you can use these launch stars
to<00:01:21.840> jettison<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.350> often<00:01:22.710> these<00:01:22.830> previously
