00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.870
 here we are today to see how we are going to 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.860
 do 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.070
 and 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:21.789
 what he calls in English is a basket for 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.880
 to filter them to filter the hops 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.690
 as we can see we have 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.050
 a drill 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.210
 a coupling of 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.239
 3 to 4 inches 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.170
 a ring to hold the basket 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:45.470
 testa is a 5 gallon bag of color 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.440
 for painting 6 rings and 3 eighths 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:53.080
 six nuts of three eighths and six 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.080
 three octave screws with the tip 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.380
 so let's start the first thing that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.000
 I'm going to be going to be marking the three 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.340
 sites where I'm going to put the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.130
 screws now is that you do not have to 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.610
 be very precise so I'm going to go over or 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.610
 less down 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.440
 no, it was not there 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.040
 because we have one we can calculate that 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.040
 the other will go more in the distance 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 here 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.740
 and the tec but let's put 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.790
 our next one is also not necessary 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.350
 that is too precise 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.350
 we could measure but I do not feel like 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.680
 once we have this marked 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.420
 What is more important is the 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.330
 first the marks are black black 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.430
 over black it looks pretty bad but in 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.100
 Any case what is more 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 important 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.580
 and know how far we want the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.560
 holes so for that we're going to 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.689
 get a meter and let's measure it well 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.179
 we do not want them centered we want them 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.500
 as low as possible 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.700
 so an inch and a half 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.110
 an inch and a half from the top 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.110
 we look for children the brand 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.819
 and an inch and a half 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.819
 we mark 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.220
 Y 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.350
 we make the first hole 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.120
 subject very well is not 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.310
 and command 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.370
 we remove the important back hand 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.810
 and we have the first eye 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.490
 and the same thing we have with us 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.560
 and now the only thing that remains for us 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.410
 do is 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.580
 the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.000
 in each of the screws we put one 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.000
 nut 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.550
 Wants to enter 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.560
 about what 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.560
 let's not be 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.620
 a screw 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.620
 we do not have the other side 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.159
 a candle 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.750
 we have bored down and now not 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 we fit we do not put the flag 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.079
 she 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.079
 only the nut 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.590
 if we press view 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.560
 we already have it firm 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:36.449
 by means of income 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.080
 tighten a tad more 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.470
 and the first one is ready 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.710
 and it's more than ready 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.889
 now we join elaboration is to take the 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.729
 bag 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:20.800
 here we do not have the bag for the hops 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.800
 and put it underneath 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.550
 again 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.470
 we do not have the ring 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.520
 and basically 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.150
 We could use 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.920
 the electric screwdriver but it's going to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:48.060
 be a little complicated if you want with a 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.060
 normal screwdriver and current 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.110
 we have see 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:05.490
 now we tighten the screw 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.720
 to the other side 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:24.300
 and in a matter of five minutes 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.130
 we have our 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:33.660
 our referee for the angle 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.140
 and now let's see how it is going to be in 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.140
 the boil 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.930
 now block 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:45.780
 perfectly and the only problem is that 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.080
 touch 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.970
 the resistance so we're going to have to 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.990
 adjust the height but that does not have 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:58.530
 no good cut because the chicken is already going 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:00.240
 see this is how this gossip is made in 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.810
 5 minutes 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.810
 goodbye
