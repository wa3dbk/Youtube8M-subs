00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
clarity of the screens let's just take a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.450 
clarity of the screens let's just take a
look<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.850> iPod<00:00:48.420> Touches<00:00:49.280> I'm<00:00:50.280> going

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
to show you the physical differences

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.430 
to show you the physical differences
first<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> let's<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.540> a<00:00:54.570> look<00:00:54.870> at<00:00:55.110> a

first so let's just have a look at a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.550 
first so let's just have a look at a
side-by-side<00:00:56.160> difference<00:00:57.149> now<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.840> new<00:00:58.140> iPod

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
side-by-side difference now the new iPod

Touch<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.160> top<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.790> as<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.000> can<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
Touch is on top and as you can see is a

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.789 
Touch is on top and as you can see is a
lot<00:01:01.649> thinner<00:01:02.040> than<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.760> previous<00:01:02.790> generation

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
lot thinner than the previous generation

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.530 
lot thinner than the previous generation
let's<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:05.009> around<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.430> top<00:01:05.700> view<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.390> can

see a bit more clearly there the

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.880 
see a bit more clearly there the
difference<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.030> thickness<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:10.500> again<00:01:10.770> on

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
difference in thickness and again on

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.010 
difference in thickness and again on

generation and the iPhone 4 now the
dimensions<00:02:36.360> as<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.720> probably<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:37.560> aware

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
dimensions as you probably are aware

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.700 
dimensions as you probably are aware
iPod<00:02:38.790> touches<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.240> lot<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.600> thinner<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.590> the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
iPod touches a lot of thinner but the

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.920 
iPod touches a lot of thinner but the
actual<00:02:40.980> physical<00:02:41.490> dimensions<00:02:42.120> if<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.690> look

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
actual physical dimensions if you look

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.590 
actual physical dimensions if you look
at<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.710> saw<00:02:43.890> height<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.400> width<00:02:44.640> they<00:02:45.480> are

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
at the saw height and width they are

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.120 
at the saw height and width they are
pretty<00:02:45.930> similar<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:48.830> that's<00:02:49.830> probably

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
pretty similar so that's probably

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.980 
pretty similar so that's probably
something<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.430> do<00:02:50.580> them<00:02:50.850> both<00:02:51.060> having<00:02:51.420> exactly

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
something to do them both having exactly

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.440 
something to do them both having exactly
the<00:02:52.200> same<00:02:52.500> screen<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> front<00:02:53.220> albeit<00:02:54.210> the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
the same screen on the front albeit the

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.230 
the same screen on the front albeit the
iPhone<00:02:54.930> has<00:02:55.170> IPS<00:02:55.680> technology<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:57.000> new

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
iPhone has IPS technology and the new

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.050 
iPhone has IPS technology and the new
iPod<00:02:58.050> Touch<00:02:58.290> doesn't<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.520> physical

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
iPod Touch doesn't but physical

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.410 
iPod Touch doesn't but physical
dimensions<00:03:00.690> are<00:03:00.870> very<00:03:01.610> similar<00:03:02.610> indeed<00:03:05.420> so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
dimensions are very similar indeed so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.360 
dimensions are very similar indeed so
now<00:03:06.540> let's<00:03:06.750> get<00:03:06.930> these<00:03:07.080> all<00:03:07.380> switched<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.890> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
