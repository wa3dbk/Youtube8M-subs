00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.930 
feel as though these figures really
aren't<00:01:41.990> doing<00:01:42.410> enough<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.860> justify<00:01:43.550> their

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
base and it's transformed into that

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.230

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.520 
character but with amiibo it doesn't
really<00:01:55.670> sound<00:01:55.910> like<00:01:56.060> that's<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.600> case<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.260> I

sort of
unlocked<00:02:14.600> being<00:02:15.020> in<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.230> game<00:02:15.440> they're<00:02:15.740> gonna

want something more fun than that

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.870 
want something more fun than that
so<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.560> really<00:02:18.740> wonder<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.070> based<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.760> what

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
so I really wonder if based on what

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.670 
so I really wonder if based on what
Nintendo<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.330> talking<00:02:20.630> about<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.930> far<00:02:20.960> if<00:02:21.350> this

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
Nintendo is talking about so far if this

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.840 
Nintendo is talking about so far if this
is<00:02:21.860> something<00:02:22.040> that's<00:02:22.250> really<00:02:22.520> just<00:02:22.610> gonna<00:02:22.760> be

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
is something that's really just gonna be

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.690 
is something that's really just gonna be
hardcore<00:02:23.750> Nintendo<00:02:24.410> fans<00:02:24.650> want<00:02:24.980> them<00:02:25.220> but

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
hardcore Nintendo fans want them but

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.460 
hardcore Nintendo fans want them but
they<00:02:26.180> don't<00:02:26.420> really<00:02:26.660> catch<00:02:26.870> on<00:02:27.080> with<00:02:27.350> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
they don't really catch on with the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.380 
they don't really catch on with the
younger<00:02:27.770> audience<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.730> think<00:02:28.910> that's<00:02:29.060> a

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
younger audience and I think that's a

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.270 
younger audience and I think that's a
potential<00:02:30.200> problem<00:02:30.590> in<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.830> future

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
potential problem in the future

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.530 
potential problem in the future
I<00:02:31.310> feel<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:31.940> amiibo<00:02:32.690> needs<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.380> specific<00:02:34.130> game

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
I feel like amiibo needs a specific game

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.330 
I feel like amiibo needs a specific game
that<00:02:35.540> would<00:02:35.750> use<00:02:36.350> all<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.860> figures<00:02:37.160> together

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
that would use all the figures together

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.830 
that would use all the figures together
like<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.940> know<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.120> there<00:02:38.450> are<00:02:38.480> Smash

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.330 
like I know that there are Smash
Brothers<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.560> that's<00:02:39.710> another<00:02:39.920> thing<00:02:40.160> so

go on about that anymore but I think you

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040 
go on about that anymore but I think you
get<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.760> point<00:03:49.910> I'm<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.540> confused<00:03:50.840> how

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
the other thing that I'm pondering is

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.870 
the other thing that I'm pondering is
how<00:03:54.740> much<00:03:54.950> will<00:03:55.160> they<00:03:55.280> cost

of<00:03:59.510> hoping<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.960> they'll<00:04:00.110> be<00:04:00.260> $9.99<00:04:01.300> but<00:04:02.300> then

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
of hoping that they'll be $9.99 but then

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.180 
of hoping that they'll be $9.99 but then
again<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:02.840> don't<00:04:02.900> know<00:04:03.410> cuz<00:04:03.800> like<00:04:03.950> for<00:04:04.100> example

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.110 
I'm totally passing on Disney infinity
2.0<00:04:09.230> because<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:09.650> hate<00:04:09.890> Marvel<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.760> I'm<00:04:10.850> really

saddened<00:04:11.510> by<00:04:11.630> what<00:04:11.660> he<00:04:11.900> did<00:04:12.110> with<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.410> sequel

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
saddened by what he did with that sequel

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.820 
saddened by what he did with that sequel
but<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.360> did<00:04:14.780> spend<00:04:15.080> a<00:04:15.140> decent<00:04:15.260> amount<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.620> cash

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
but I did spend a decent amount of cash

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.770 
but I did spend a decent amount of cash
on<00:04:16.070> those<00:04:16.220> figures<00:04:16.430> but<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.180> thing<00:04:17.390> is<00:04:17.420> when<00:04:17.750> I

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
on those figures but the thing is when I

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.150 
on those figures but the thing is when I
would<00:04:17.959> go<00:04:18.049> out<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.200> buy<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.470> figure<00:04:18.920> I<00:04:19.100> could

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
would go out and buy a figure I could

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.740 
would go out and buy a figure I could
bring<00:04:19.459> it<00:04:19.549> home<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:20.060> then<00:04:20.209> play<00:04:20.480> as<00:04:20.540> that

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
bring it home and then play as that

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.080 
bring it home and then play as that
character<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.260> game<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:22.640> it's<00:04:22.820> kind<00:04:23.030> of

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
character in the game so it's kind of

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.330 
character in the game so it's kind of
worth<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.540> little<00:04:23.690> bit<00:04:23.810> more<00:04:24.080> money<00:04:24.380> than<00:04:24.919> just

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
worth a little bit more money than just

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.950 
worth a little bit more money than just
going<00:04:25.640> out<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:25.970> buying<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.690> Mario<00:04:27.200> amiibo

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
going out and buying the Mario amiibo

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.930 
going out and buying the Mario amiibo
for<00:04:28.139> Super<00:04:28.350> Smash<00:04:28.440> Brothers<00:04:28.770> which<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.819> kind

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
for Super Smash Brothers which just kind

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.270 
for Super Smash Brothers which just kind
of<00:04:30.060> acts<00:04:30.270> as<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.660> computer<00:04:31.319> player<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.919> don't

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
of acts as a computer player I don't

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.590 
of acts as a computer player I don't
even<00:04:32.340> really<00:04:32.550> get<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.819> play<00:04:33.030> as<00:04:33.180> him<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.449> can

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
even really get to play as him I can

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.390 
even really get to play as him I can
already<00:04:33.720> play<00:04:33.990> as<00:04:34.139> Mario<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:35.100> seems<00:04:35.340> like

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
already play as Mario so it seems like

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.760 
already play as Mario so it seems like
they<00:04:35.580> should<00:04:35.610> not<00:04:35.970> be<00:04:36.300> as<00:04:36.569> expensive<00:04:36.990> as<00:04:37.560> like

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
they should not be as expensive as like

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.540 
they should not be as expensive as like
a<00:04:37.800> Skylander

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
a Skylander

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.460

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
they're kind of ultimately doing a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.730 
they're kind of ultimately doing a
little<00:04:42.240> bit<00:04:42.330> less<00:04:42.630> and<00:04:43.380> you<00:04:43.440> know<00:04:43.530> I<00:04:43.560> mean

little bit less and you know I mean

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.900 
little bit less and you know I mean
that's<00:04:43.919> the<00:04:44.039> thing<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.460> way<00:04:44.490> they're<00:04:44.789> being

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
that's the thing the way they're being

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.850 
that's the thing the way they're being
used<00:04:45.000> in<00:04:45.419> Smash<00:04:45.690> Brothers<00:04:45.930> which<00:04:46.349> is<00:04:46.590> the

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
used in Smash Brothers which is the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.339 
used in Smash Brothers which is the
launch<00:04:47.130> game<00:04:47.430> for<00:04:47.729> amiibo<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.449> not<00:04:48.930> that

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
launch game for amiibo is not that

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.650 
launch game for amiibo is not that
engaging<00:04:49.919> it's<00:04:50.370> kind<00:04:50.699> of<00:04:50.819> cool<00:04:51.030> but<00:04:51.330> it's<00:04:51.479> also

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
engaging it's kind of cool but it's also

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.900 
engaging it's kind of cool but it's also
a<00:04:52.199> little<00:04:52.680> bit<00:04:52.889> like<00:04:53.099> what<00:04:53.430> they're<00:04:53.699> just

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
a little bit like what they're just

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.640 
a little bit like what they're just
computer<00:04:54.300> players<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:54.870> mean<00:04:54.990> essentially<00:04:55.470> if

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
computer players I mean essentially if

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.219 
computer players I mean essentially if
you<00:04:55.710> don't<00:04:55.919> know<00:04:56.099> yet<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:57.479> take<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.720> smash

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
you don't know yet you take a smash

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.140 
you don't know yet you take a smash
brothers<00:04:58.410> amiibo<00:04:58.889> figure<00:04:59.190> you<00:04:59.639> scan<00:04:59.910> it<00:05:00.060> on

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
brothers amiibo figure you scan it on

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.210 
brothers amiibo figure you scan it on
the<00:05:00.240> gamepad<00:05:00.599> and<00:05:00.930> then<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.710> can<00:05:01.860> use<00:05:02.039> that

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
the gamepad and then you can use that

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.460 
the gamepad and then you can use that
figure<00:05:02.639> to<00:05:02.910> fight<00:05:03.479> against<00:05:03.900> and<00:05:04.080> it's<00:05:04.259> kind<00:05:04.410> of

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
figure to fight against and it's kind of

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.110 
figure to fight against and it's kind of
acting<00:05:04.830> as<00:05:04.979> like<00:05:05.220> computer-controlled

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
acting as like computer-controlled

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.029 
acting as like computer-controlled
character<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.320> if<00:05:07.410> you<00:05:07.470> fight<00:05:07.680> against<00:05:08.009> that

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
character but if you fight against that

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.189 
character but if you fight against that
character<00:05:08.580> your<00:05:08.820> amiibo<00:05:09.180> quite<00:05:09.720> a<00:05:09.750> bit<00:05:09.960> they

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
character your amiibo quite a bit they

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.020 
character your amiibo quite a bit they
can<00:05:10.349> level<00:05:10.650> up<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:10.979> become<00:05:11.220> better<00:05:11.460> in<00:05:11.639> battle

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
can level up and become better in battle

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.290 
can level up and become better in battle
so<00:05:12.360> get<00:05:12.570> more<00:05:12.830> difficult<00:05:13.830> to<00:05:13.949> take<00:05:14.160> on<00:05:14.340> but

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
so get more difficult to take on but

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.909 
so get more difficult to take on but
again<00:05:15.599> that's<00:05:15.810> really<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.650> mean<00:05:16.800> it's

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
again that's really just I mean it's

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.100 
again that's really just I mean it's
just<00:05:17.099> a<00:05:17.160> computer<00:05:17.699> player<00:05:18.000> it's<00:05:18.630> kind<00:05:18.870> of<00:05:18.960> neat

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
just a computer player it's kind of neat

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.480 
just a computer player it's kind of neat
that<00:05:19.139> you<00:05:19.349> can<00:05:19.530> scan<00:05:19.740> them<00:05:19.949> in<00:05:20.070> have<00:05:20.310> your

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
that you can scan them in have your

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.010 
that you can scan them in have your
friends<00:05:20.849> fight<00:05:21.000> against<00:05:21.240> against<00:05:21.840> them<00:05:21.930> and

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
friends fight against against them and

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.540 
friends fight against against them and
stuff<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.440> how<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.650> stores<00:05:22.830> information<00:05:23.099> on

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
stuff and how it stores information on

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.270 
stuff and how it stores information on
the<00:05:23.639> figure<00:05:23.880> and<00:05:23.970> things<00:05:24.210> but<00:05:24.479> I<00:05:24.919> don't<00:05:25.919> know<00:05:26.009> I

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
the figure and things but I don't know I

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.999 
the figure and things but I don't know I
mean<00:05:26.849> it's<00:05:26.940> not<00:05:27.090> it's<00:05:27.539> not<00:05:27.720> that<00:05:28.110> exciting<00:05:28.620> I'm

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
mean it's not it's not that exciting I'm

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.499 
mean it's not it's not that exciting I'm
excited<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.520> collect<00:05:29.699> the<00:05:29.880> figures<00:05:30.240> just

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
excited to collect the figures just

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:31.939 
excited to collect the figures just
because<00:05:30.720> I'd<00:05:30.840> like<00:05:30.960> to<00:05:31.080> display<00:05:31.349> them<00:05:31.650> but<00:05:31.860> as

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
because I'd like to display them but as

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:33.469 
because I'd like to display them but as
for<00:05:32.159> what<00:05:32.310> they're<00:05:32.460> doing<00:05:32.699> in<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:32.880> game<00:05:33.090> it's

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
for what they're doing in the game it's

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.540 
for what they're doing in the game it's
just<00:05:33.750> not<00:05:33.930> enough<00:05:34.320> although<00:05:35.039> I<00:05:35.159> do<00:05:35.280> have<00:05:35.430> to

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
just not enough although I do have to

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.420 
just not enough although I do have to
say<00:05:35.759> I<00:05:36.270> have<00:05:36.770> kind<00:05:37.770> of<00:05:37.860> tried<00:05:38.070> to<00:05:38.099> use<00:05:38.280> my

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
say I have kind of tried to use my

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.370 
say I have kind of tried to use my
imagination<00:05:38.639> a<00:05:39.150> little<00:05:39.240> bit<00:05:39.449> here<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:39.930> I<00:05:40.259> was

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
imagination a little bit here and I was

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.779 
imagination a little bit here and I was
talking<00:05:40.680> with<00:05:40.800> Nick<00:05:41.009> and<00:05:41.159> a<00:05:41.220> few<00:05:41.370> other<00:05:41.490> people

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
talking with Nick and a few other people

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.760 
talking with Nick and a few other people
that<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:41.940> play<00:05:42.150> Smash<00:05:42.389> Brothers<00:05:42.539> with<00:05:42.840> here<00:05:43.139> um

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
that I play Smash Brothers with here um

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.070 
that I play Smash Brothers with here um
and<00:05:44.159> we<00:05:44.310> were<00:05:44.400> kind<00:05:44.610> of<00:05:44.699> open<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.509> idea<00:05:45.960> of

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
and we were kind of open to the idea of

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.200 
and we were kind of open to the idea of
having<00:05:46.710> some<00:05:47.009> fun<00:05:47.190> with<00:05:47.370> amiibo<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:47.849> where

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
having some fun with amiibo to where

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.339 
having some fun with amiibo to where
it's<00:05:48.330> like<00:05:48.360> we<00:05:48.630> would<00:05:48.750> be<00:05:48.840> playing<00:05:49.050> a<00:05:49.199> four

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
it's like we would be playing a four

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.560 
it's like we would be playing a four
player<00:05:49.500> match<00:05:49.770> and<00:05:50.070> when<00:05:50.699> you're<00:05:50.969> eliminated

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
player match and when you're eliminated

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.300 
player match and when you're eliminated
from<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.840> match<00:05:51.870> you<00:05:52.590> get<00:05:52.710> to<00:05:52.860> take<00:05:53.039> your

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
from the match you get to take your

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.879 
from the match you get to take your
amiibo<00:05:53.789> put<00:05:54.449> it<00:05:54.539> on<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:54.719> gamepad<00:05:55.080> scan<00:05:55.590> it<00:05:55.770> in

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
amiibo put it on the gamepad scan it in

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.589 
amiibo put it on the gamepad scan it in
and<00:05:55.919> then<00:05:56.280> your<00:05:56.460> amiibo<00:05:56.909> can<00:05:57.180> kind<00:05:57.360> of<00:05:57.419> get

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
and then your amiibo can kind of get

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.779 
and then your amiibo can kind of get
revenge<00:05:57.930> for<00:05:58.229> you<00:05:58.409> so<00:05:59.070> giving<00:05:59.370> every<00:05:59.580> player

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
revenge for you so giving every player

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.279 
revenge for you so giving every player
the<00:05:59.940> chance<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:00.240> use<00:06:00.360> an<00:06:00.449> amiibo<00:06:00.810> to<00:06:00.870> get<00:06:01.139> more

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
the chance to use an amiibo to get more

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.350 
the chance to use an amiibo to get more
points<00:06:01.650> that<00:06:01.800> could<00:06:02.219> be<00:06:02.340> kind<00:06:02.520> of<00:06:02.610> cool<00:06:02.759> and<00:06:03.270> I

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
points that could be kind of cool and I

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.760 
points that could be kind of cool and I
also<00:06:03.479> think<00:06:03.750> maybe<00:06:04.050> it's<00:06:04.259> kind<00:06:04.409> of<00:06:04.560> cool<00:06:04.740> to

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
also think maybe it's kind of cool to

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.370 
also think maybe it's kind of cool to
pit<00:06:05.310> an<00:06:05.490> amiibo<00:06:05.909> against<00:06:06.419> an<00:06:06.539> amiibo<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.199> like

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
pit an amiibo against an amiibo and like

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.350 
pit an amiibo against an amiibo and like
I<00:06:07.620> don't<00:06:08.400> know<00:06:08.460> maybe<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:08.699> could<00:06:08.820> bet<00:06:09.090> money

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
I don't know maybe you could bet money

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.480 
I don't know maybe you could bet money
against<00:06:09.810> whose<00:06:10.020> amiibo<00:06:10.500> would<00:06:10.710> win<00:06:10.919> maybe

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
against whose amiibo would win maybe

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.189 
against whose amiibo would win maybe
maybe<00:06:11.909> and<00:06:12.030> there's<00:06:12.150> some<00:06:12.330> great<00:06:12.509> gambling

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:13.199 
maybe and there's some great gambling

that<00:06:17.070> I'm<00:06:17.219> actually<00:06:17.370> really<00:06:17.639> curious<00:06:18.060> about

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
that I'm actually really curious about

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.290 
that I'm actually really curious about
is<00:06:18.509> how<00:06:18.750> many<00:06:19.139> amiibo<00:06:19.860> can<00:06:20.580> be<00:06:20.789> in<00:06:20.880> a<00:06:20.969> Super

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
is how many amiibo can be in a Super

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.779 
is how many amiibo can be in a Super
Smash<00:06:21.419> Brothers<00:06:21.750> match<00:06:22.110> at<00:06:22.440> once<00:06:22.860> so<00:06:23.460> like<00:06:23.639> I'd

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
Smash Brothers match at once so like I'd

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.430 
Smash Brothers match at once so like I'd
imagine<00:06:24.120> maybe<00:06:24.330> four<00:06:24.750> maybe<00:06:25.080> you<00:06:25.229> could<00:06:25.320> watch

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
imagine maybe four maybe you could watch

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.230 
imagine maybe four maybe you could watch
for<00:06:25.860> amiibo<00:06:26.370> take<00:06:26.610> each<00:06:26.759> other<00:06:26.909> on<00:06:27.060> at<00:06:27.150> the

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
for amiibo take each other on at the

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.790 
for amiibo take each other on at the
same<00:06:27.360> time<00:06:27.419> but<00:06:27.960> what<00:06:28.110> if<00:06:28.199> it<00:06:28.289> was<00:06:28.409> like<00:06:28.560> myself

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
same time but what if it was like myself

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.439 
same time but what if it was like myself
and<00:06:29.219> three<00:06:29.400> other<00:06:29.430> friends<00:06:29.729> were<00:06:30.090> playing

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
and three other friends were playing

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.180 
and three other friends were playing
together<00:06:30.659> so<00:06:31.440> there's<00:06:31.620> four<00:06:31.800> people<00:06:31.979> playing

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
together so there's four people playing

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.610 
together so there's four people playing
and<00:06:32.580> we<00:06:32.969> all<00:06:33.150> scanned<00:06:33.659> in<00:06:33.870> an<00:06:33.960> amiibo<00:06:34.380> because

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
and we all scanned in an amiibo because

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.350 
and we all scanned in an amiibo because
could<00:06:34.979> that<00:06:35.070> technically<00:06:35.460> mean<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:36.060> we<00:06:36.180> have

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
could that technically mean that we have

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.360 
could that technically mean that we have
eight<00:06:36.659> characters<00:06:37.529> fighting<00:06:37.830> on<00:06:37.979> screen<00:06:38.279> at

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370 
eight characters fighting on screen at

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.310 
eight characters fighting on screen at
once<00:06:38.580> four<00:06:39.029> of<00:06:39.120> them<00:06:39.270> are<00:06:39.389> amiibos<00:06:39.870> and<00:06:40.139> for

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
once four of them are amiibos and for

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.480 
once four of them are amiibos and for
them<00:06:40.469> are<00:06:40.589> human<00:06:40.860> players

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
them are human players

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.070 
them are human players
I<00:06:41.550> don't<00:06:41.970> know<00:06:42.060> I<00:06:42.300> mean<00:06:42.449> these<00:06:42.599> are<00:06:42.720> questions

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
I don't know I mean these are questions

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.740 
I don't know I mean these are questions
that<00:06:43.139> I<00:06:43.229> don't<00:06:43.319> think<00:06:43.740> they<00:06:43.889> really<00:06:44.160> answered

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.809 
that I don't think they really answered
I'm<00:06:45.750> hoping<00:06:46.199> that<00:06:46.440> the<00:06:46.830> whole<00:06:47.130> ideas<00:06:47.580> with
