00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.409
 he was on the cover of the new trainer together with the 3 but I want too 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.409
 in the store to buy and sell for the project but on 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.139
 also a factor in the flat 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.559
 also my flat 50 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.559
 now has a flex pool in it 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.940
 he was on the cover of the new clip 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.290
 just like the 3 is now also in the store I have a cloth left too 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.290
 one further being the weaver could take the new time from codemasters 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.640
 4 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.640
 what 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.670
 Rejecting an athlete with added value has a lot of substance to do 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.370
 blow up by our editors 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.749
 receiving the first images ideas was a review image m 

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.300
 fair is fair that was 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.800
 on the console hey 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.140
 around ugly against ronnie who served those who had to do this even whole 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.250
 get out of the steering jack and iraq first i head up boys 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.470
 luckily driving festina getting this kind of your 60 version was already better then 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.270
 expected for 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.270
 and the pc version that I have ever tested and is now playing is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.480
 a lot better 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.690
 but it does indicate that after the graphic violence of Cluster 2 according to 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.280
 storm I just want 3 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.479
 the real life turn your head should sit when this game should go more 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.840
 play and yes it is really a very different type in it it is a time of shooters 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.159
 in which you say you are doing missions with three and ten in Tajikistan 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.550
 the vote brand hummer profit 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.430
 and then the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.090
 if you could now divert to your liking and cycling in simple 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.750
 made 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.480
 commands that you give are a bit more understandable, a little more jip and janneke 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.730
 language if you want 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.860
 when just a little more by it what you can do all tents for everything 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.980
 you do in the game you get xp 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.870
 it's a bit weird that they give me a bit of a nod to the convention generation 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.560
 once again this core really has nothing to do with jam 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.540
 What has really improved as a result of we sing is the way 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.640
 let us all put together but also and design the supporters 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.770
 mainly large remains than from the memory chips now there is also finished 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.960
 what more village they in the Netherlands towns and what do you do more 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.920
 cows through like fights she also occasionally has to go into houses 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.489
 to calm things down, those are pretty intense moments 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.739
 other things are the stage group during missions on a stunt 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.849
 Oostpool om topper is a helicopter and the reinforcement arrives 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:22.909
 m 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.439
 away from the enemy 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.650
 and yes then it is really repositioning the bunch of bekkum group there 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.109
 maybe helicopter in order to get rid of you there 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.669
 and that way, those missions remain exciting 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.459
 the single player campaign takes between 8 and 10 hours but you are up 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.809
 you just notice that this game is built for co op 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:44.979
 and I also think it is not a competitive multiplayer check if there is one 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.569
 wise choice there are very many scooters that make you competitive multiplayer 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.109
 to have 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.729
 and cross in between had to be a kilo so it is called but people remain anyway 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.359
 mostly both have competition 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.109
 whether he is or battlefield bad company 2 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.959
 So why would you would be so seriously playing the active role in a competitive one 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.289
 Multiplayer do pharmacists a day after all have risen ingrid klimke 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.979
 on 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:10.129
 together with your job, the headline that players can enjoy is much nicer 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.760
 otherwise you give the headset 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.329
 In addition, there are also real merchants 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.029
 apart from the single play campaign it is and that makes for a very nice one 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.419
 things that are unique and i think i am 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.419
 maybe Opel is all strongest though 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.519
 overijse the bottle of port at twente it is an idea for gourmets i think 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.190
 the finish is not for everyone if you are sure 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.709
 not about that on 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.900
 slightly disappointing breiviks look at the console for a moment then you have to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.789
 don't start 

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:50.619
 even if you call me a duty or arcade shooter, this is a fan 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:54.320
 don't take advantage of the men via twitter tactical game 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.329
 and really work well together designated the groin 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.159
 on the other hand if you are a fan of operation flashpoint in working-class neighborhoods we 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.609
 see the previous game 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.099
 a great transfer 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.539
 Slightly less agreement still tactically enough then neither will the weaver 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:10.719
 fall bump then this game
