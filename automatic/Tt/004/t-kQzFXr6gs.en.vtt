00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:14.579
 congratulations on the purchase of the best system for cleaning swimming pools 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.009
 made in Argentina 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:18.150
 hereinafter 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.800
 your new aquatic explorer 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.470
 will allow you to enjoy your office without problems 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.980
 doing a very effective job for you 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.769
 for many years 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.819
 in a short time you will see what aquatic explorer is the easiest way to 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:32.430
 keep your pool clean 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.430
 and if you are one 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.550
 before starting the automation process 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.640
 It is important that you start the cycle with the pool clean and in perfect 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.670
 terms 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.740
 for that, consider the following points 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.490
 the water must be clinically balanced 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.790
 persist verdÃ­n 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.820
 make a sope clary nation 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.720
 use small amounts of precipitate a tea pull out thanks to the cuatica 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.550
 explorer 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.450
 return to the pool again and again 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.070
 To continue your action to the huti nantes it is convenient that you manually aspirate 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.930
 for the last time the drain operation to not saturate prematurely 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.820
 the filter 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.930
 make sure the filtration system 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.110
 do not have air intakes I know that hydraulic power is the element 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.310
 propeller of the aquatic explore 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.600
 retro the b the filter clean the pump basket remember that the aquatic 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.280
 explorer 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.460
 requires a pump with a minimum power of medium to hp 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.640
 inside the box of your new aquatic explore you will find the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.610
 following components the main body was the base the membrane 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.850
 the rotation support 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.970
 the hose the counterweights the regulating valve 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.650
 the connectors and the deflected disk 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.270
 I took the main body of the aquatic explorer and removed the base 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.020
 place the membrane from the challenge side was the surface used always 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.999
 upwards 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.699
 and the smooth surface down the smooth surface of the membrane 

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:05.449
 will allow the aquatic explorer to be blessed on the sufficiency fund 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.569
 the membrane must be able to rotate freely 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.489
 reposition the base 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.810
 insert the lower end of the rod 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.729
 in the groove of the main body 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.140
 and its top end 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.140
 in the rotary head locking clamp 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.370
 the aquatic explorer hose 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.639
 is supplied in sections that need to be assembled 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:32.159
 will need a sufficient number of sections to mow from the place 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.760
 where the aquatic explorer is connected to the furthest part of 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.059
 the pool plus an additional stretch 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.499
 dampen the sections of the hose 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.650
 I rotated time that the female ends 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.649
 to introduce them to the extremes more 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 continued until all the necessary actions have been connected 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:52.389
 aquatica explorer 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.009
 It has been designed for operation in a variety of swimming pools 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.990
 for this reason 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.650
 We have included certain items in the box 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.459
 which may or may not be necessary 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.040
 depending on the characteristics of the merger 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.550
 Below we will explain both the standard installation and the 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.189
 installation of hotels com ar 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.020
 with the office pump turned off 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.450
 enable the taking of funds, remember that the background shot and the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.060
 'skiman' 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.490
 they must be closed and the filter must be in the filter option 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.029
 place the collectors 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:28.019
 Insert the hose vertically until it is completely water 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.389
 and purged of air 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:34.389
 I connected one end to the suction line 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.309
 enter the aquatic to explore in the water and with zero to the other end 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.729
 for the option to allocate 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:55.239
 enable only everything is more critical what the filter in the filter position 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.909
 connect the aquatic explorer 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.909
 as he usually did with his traditional background pair 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.389
 follow the steps described in the standard connection 

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.459
 In case you have both selections, check which of the two 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.459
 read more convenient 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:28.809
 After completing the installation turn on the pump for a few minutes in order 

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:31.240
 to allow the air output of the system 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.330
 then 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.330
 I checked the following initial settings 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.420
 so that the hose is correctly balanced disconnect the pump you see the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.699
 aquatic explorer to the deep part and observe its position 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.020
 the balance will be correct when the membrane completely fits on the 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.219
 bottom of the pool and the common suction pipes that have an angle 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.219
 Approximately 45 degrees to the ground 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:00.219
 use the provided counterweight to achieve the perfect balance 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.280
 even so the length of the hose will stop depending on the needs and 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.449
 characteristics of each pool 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:13.849
 in some cases a long hose can hinder the operation 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:18.959
 By varying the length of the hose you can control the path of the uat and 

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.740
 that explores 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.970
 The aquatic explorer is equipped with a regulating valve which relieves 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.180
 the excess flow is already perceived that the equipment is on top of the bottom or 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.900
 the walls should place the stands not so its power for its perfect 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.460
 functioning 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.900
 modifying the position of the valve will be able to direct the operation of 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:39.879
 the aquatic explorer 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:42.879
 to a certain sector of the pool 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.719
 If your pool does not require the use of the valve another option 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.650
 is the use of a 90 degree curve in pbs 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.650
 of four millimeters of standard diameter 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.519
 If the bottom of your pool forms a right angle to the wall you 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:01.860
 we recommend placing the deviated disk to ensure a displacement 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.339
 Random of the aquatic explorer 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.769
 in pool with vaulted bottom the aquatic explorer will be able to 

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.899
 continue his work also on the walls for that the team owns three 

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:17.389
 options put with the lead in the top point the aquatic explorer 8 tends to 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:21.579
 stay in the background with the lead at the bottom point I had also for the 

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:26.269
 walls without the lead the aquatic explorer will still have a greater tendency to 

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:29.269
 bread 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.889
 In case you have a workshop with schedule cleaning periods 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.530
 we recommend you stop every 30 minutes 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.480
 to break circuit repetitive and get a better result in less 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.480
 weather 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.849
 the aquatic explorer just requires maintenance 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:54.179
 periodically checked that the equipment is not obstructed by any object 

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:54.939
 strange 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:57.120
 that the triangle can move freely 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.039
 just like the fins 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:02.009
 You can keep it inside the pool except during treatments 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:03.849
 shock chemicals 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:05.780
 remember to honor the hose 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.189
 If you want to save the equipment, remove the 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:11.189
 otherwise it can spoil its operation 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:14.870
 On the other hand, filter more frequently at least once per 

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:18.919
 week I know that thanks to the effective work of the aquatic explorer will retain ear 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.919
 dirt entity of what he was used to 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.530
 now enjoy sutiss and your free time 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.960
 and that the dirty work to the aquatic explorer
