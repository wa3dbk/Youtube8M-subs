00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
out to the platform the platform is

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.220 
out to the platform the platform is
right<00:00:15.030> there<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:15.900> set<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.349> and

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
right there I have it set up and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.839 
right there I have it set up and
normally<00:00:19.230> what<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.439> would<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.919> is<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.490> would<00:00:20.520> put

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
normally what I would do is I would put

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.569 
normally what I would do is I would put
out<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> big<00:00:21.300> white<00:00:21.570> target<00:00:22.110> play<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.399> would

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
out a big white target play and I would

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.859 
out a big white target play and I would
have<00:00:23.759> him<00:00:24.090> targeting<00:00:24.809> to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.829> plate<00:00:26.419> but<00:00:27.419> he

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
have him targeting to the plate but he

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.799 
have him targeting to the plate but he
is<00:00:28.079> quite<00:00:28.410> insistent<00:00:28.860> on<00:00:29.430> when<00:00:30.270> he<00:00:30.360> goes<00:00:30.540> to

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
is quite insistent on when he goes to

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.350 
is quite insistent on when he goes to
get<00:00:30.930> his<00:00:31.169> treat<00:00:31.669> retrieving<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.820> plate<00:00:33.120> as

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
get his treat retrieving the plate as

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.310 
get his treat retrieving the plate as
well<00:00:33.890> now<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.160> could<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.239> go<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.140> get<00:00:37.289> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
well now what I could do is go and get a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
well now what I could do is go and get a
ceramic<00:00:37.920> tile<00:00:38.250> something<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.359> a<00:00:39.480> little

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
ceramic tile something that's a little

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
ceramic tile something that's a little
bit<00:00:39.780> heavier<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.559> as<00:00:40.710> nice<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> pick<00:00:41.820> up

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
bit heavier and not as nice to pick up

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.079 
bit heavier and not as nice to pick up
but<00:00:42.420> haven't<00:00:42.929> done<00:00:43.109> that<00:00:43.289> yet<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.940> and<00:00:44.940> he's

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.089 
but haven't done that yet so and he's

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:46.729 
but haven't done that yet so and he's
not<00:00:45.300> gonna<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> target<00:00:46.320> plate<00:00:46.499> for

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
not gonna be on the target plate for

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.340 
not gonna be on the target plate for
very<00:00:46.920> long<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.489> what<00:00:47.730> I've<00:00:47.879> done<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:49.320> have

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
very long so what I've done is I have

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.919 
very long so what I've done is I have
some<00:00:50.010> treats<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.879> they're<00:00:51.059> white<00:00:51.359> in<00:00:51.600> color

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
some treats and they're white in color

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.619 
some treats and they're white in color
so<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.649> very<00:00:52.949> obvious<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.909> I'm<00:00:54.120> putting<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
so it's very obvious that I'm putting it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.509 
so it's very obvious that I'm putting it
down<00:00:54.659> so<00:00:55.589> this<00:00:55.769> is<00:00:55.920> what<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> would<00:00:56.309> look<00:00:56.370> like

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
down so this is what it would look like

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.430 
down so this is what it would look like

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.020 
more platform training and I'll show you
what<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.630> finished<00:03:50.500> go<00:03:51.010> out<00:03:51.220> for<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.550> fun

what the finished go out for a fun

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:06.180 
what the finished go out for a fun
project<00:03:52.630> looks<00:03:53.170> like<00:03:53.410> okay

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.320 

buddy

hey<00:04:14.490> good<00:04:15.480> boy

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.680 

I<00:04:36.850> just<00:04:37.570> gives<00:04:37.810> you

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.440 

information<00:04:41.690> that<00:04:42.410> when<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.850> the<00:04:44.030> second<00:04:44.390> one

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
information that when on the second one

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.930 
information that when on the second one
when<00:04:44.720> he<00:04:44.870> did<00:04:45.080> his<00:04:45.200> turn<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.680> said<00:04:45.980> that<00:04:46.790> it

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
when he did his turn and said that it

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.070 
when he did his turn and said that it
was<00:04:47.060> you<00:04:47.900> know<00:04:47.930> he<00:04:48.050> wanted<00:04:48.410> to<00:04:48.470> come<00:04:48.740> forward

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.920 

so<00:04:54.080> it<00:04:54.560> gives<00:04:54.800> him<00:04:55.010> a<00:04:55.160> nice<00:04:55.370> parameter<00:04:56.240> it

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
so it gives him a nice parameter it

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:04.780 
so it gives him a nice parameter it
makes<00:05:01.630> moving<00:05:02.630> forward<00:05:03.170> so<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.830> lot<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.280> muscle

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
makes moving forward so a lot of muscle

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.660 
makes moving forward so a lot of muscle
memory<00:05:05.000> using<00:05:05.720> the<00:05:05.840> platform<00:05:06.140> I've<00:05:07.070> got<00:05:07.400> the

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
memory using the platform I've got the

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.340 
memory using the platform I've got the
black<00:05:08.030> side<00:05:08.390> up<00:05:08.630> so<00:05:08.660> it's<00:05:09.020> a<00:05:09.050> little<00:05:09.260> bit

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
black side up so it's a little bit

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
black side up so it's a little bit
harder<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.770> see<00:05:10.070> in<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.340> grass<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:12.500> just

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
harder to see in the grass and it just

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.840 
harder to see in the grass and it just
build<00:05:13.640> and<00:05:13.880> build<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.150> build<00:05:14.240> on<00:05:14.600> success
