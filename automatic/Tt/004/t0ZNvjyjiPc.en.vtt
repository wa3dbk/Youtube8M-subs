00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
this video will tear a hole into the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.490 
this video will tear a hole into the
universe<00:02:12.410> where<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:14.350> where's<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
universe where is it where's the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.680 
universe where is it where's the
generator<00:02:16.000> somebody<00:02:17.000> tell<00:02:17.150> me<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.239> generator

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
generator somebody tell me the generator

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.090 
generator somebody tell me the generator
was<00:02:17.810> here<00:02:18.140> oh<00:02:18.320> for<00:02:19.160> God's<00:02:19.400> sake<00:02:19.790> where<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.510> I

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
was here oh for God's sake where is it I

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.840 
was here oh for God's sake where is it I
literally<00:02:22.100> have<00:02:22.250> no<00:02:22.370> idea<00:02:22.640> where<00:02:22.790> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
literally have no idea where the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.360 
literally have no idea where the
generator<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.300> then<00:02:23.570> out<00:02:23.900> there<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.560> what<00:02:25.340> I

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
generator is then out there it is what I

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.490 
generator is then out there it is what I
was<00:02:25.550> wondering<00:02:25.730> where<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.060> was<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:27.230> how<00:02:27.350> do<00:02:27.410> I

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
was wondering where that was so how do I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.690

no stay on the roasting on the road all
right<00:03:12.140> what<00:03:12.320> do<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.470> need<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.739> fire<00:03:12.920> a<00:03:12.950> weapon

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
right what do I need to fire a weapon

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.970 
right what do I need to fire a weapon
someone's<00:03:14.390> hit<00:03:14.570> me<00:03:14.769> someone's<00:03:15.769> done<00:03:15.890> my

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
someone's hit me someone's done my

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.789 
someone's hit me someone's done my
engine<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:17.480> did<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:18.200> think<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.620> might

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
engine in you did that I think we might

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.259 
engine in you did that I think we might
actually<00:03:18.980> be<00:03:19.190> in<00:03:19.280> first<00:03:19.459> place<00:03:19.519> here<00:03:19.940> I<00:03:20.090> do

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
actually be in first place here I do

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.640 
actually be in first place here I do
have<00:03:20.510> an<00:03:20.600> iron<00:03:20.780> mike<00:03:20.900> replace<00:03:21.140> down<00:03:21.350> i'm<00:03:21.530> gonna

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
have an iron mike replace down i'm gonna

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.069 
have an iron mike replace down i'm gonna
drop<00:03:21.860> it<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.250> think<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.640> wasn't<00:03:22.880> mine<00:03:23.030> ah<00:03:23.329> but

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
drop it I think that wasn't mine ah but

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.720 
drop it I think that wasn't mine ah but
let<00:03:24.170> go<00:03:24.350> straight<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:24.769> him<00:03:24.860> on<00:03:24.980> yeah<00:03:25.549> i<00:03:25.610> think

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
let go straight with him on yeah i think

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.920 
let go straight with him on yeah i think
that<00:03:25.910> wasn't<00:03:26.239> mine<00:03:26.360> it'll<00:03:26.540> take<00:03:26.660> somebody

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that wasn't mine it'll take somebody

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.259 
that wasn't mine it'll take somebody
drove<00:03:27.079> into<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.500> enough<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.489> though<00:03:28.700> let's

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
drove into it enough that though let's

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.100 
drove into it enough that though let's
