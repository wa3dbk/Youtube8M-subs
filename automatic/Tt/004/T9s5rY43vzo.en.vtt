nexus<00:00:15.480> by<00:00:16.230> beta<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.279> always<00:00:17.880> german<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.510> it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
nexus by beta and always german so it

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.330 
nexus by beta and always german so it
would<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.900> behavior<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:19.529> maybe<00:00:19.770> it's<00:00:19.949> weary

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
would be behavior but maybe it's weary

but i don't think so and the first one

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.700 
but i don't think so and the first one
is<00:00:22.619> called<00:00:22.650> enhanced<00:00:23.150> HDD<00:00:24.150> dragon<00:00:24.480> bones<00:00:24.710> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
effort and in textures and he also said

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.840 
effort and in textures and he also said
great<00:02:08.550> value<00:02:09.000> on

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
great value on

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.870 
great value on
monotone<00:02:10.360> linear<00:02:10.900> structures<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:11.920> even<00:02:12.670> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
monotone linear structures and even that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.540 
monotone linear structures and even that
he<00:02:13.180> looks<00:02:13.420> very<00:02:13.540> alive<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.650> must<00:02:14.800> say<00:02:15.040> that

he looks very alive and I must say that

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.370 
he looks very alive and I must say that
he<00:02:15.670> was<00:02:15.850> successful<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.750> mentioned

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
he was successful I mentioned

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.170

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
screenshots earlier anything with that

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.570 
screenshots earlier anything with that
new<00:02:19.750> texture<00:02:20.380> there<00:02:20.560> will<00:02:20.710> be<00:02:20.860> some<00:02:21.100> new<00:02:21.310> great

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
new texture there will be some new great

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.880 
new texture there will be some new great
shots<00:02:21.910> but<00:02:22.630> don't<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.990> think<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.710> would

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
shots but don't you think this would

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.300 
shots but don't you think this would
also<00:02:24.220> make<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.790> new<00:02:25.090> great<00:02:25.480> enemy<00:02:26.160> despite<00:02:27.160> of

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
also make a new great enemy despite of

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.700 
also make a new great enemy despite of
the<00:02:27.400> would<00:02:27.640> inform<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.600> author<00:02:28.810> also<00:02:29.260> tried

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
the would inform the author also tried

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.070 
the would inform the author also tried
to<00:02:29.740> imitate<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.310> natural<00:02:30.820> structure<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.510> the

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
to imitate a natural structure of the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.500 
to imitate a natural structure of the
muscles<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:33.130> even<00:02:33.250> see<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.910> here<00:02:34.360> and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
muscles you can even see that here and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.560 
muscles you can even see that here and
soon<00:02:35.110> there<00:02:35.320> will<00:02:35.410> be<00:02:35.470> optional<00:02:36.100> files<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:37.000> 1k

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
soon there will be optional files for 1k

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.170 
soon there will be optional files for 1k
and<00:02:37.840> 2k<00:02:38.290> textures<00:02:38.680> because<00:02:39.250> right<00:02:39.700> now<00:02:39.730> there

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
and 2k textures because right now there

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.660 
and 2k textures because right now there
are<00:02:40.210> just<00:02:40.540> four<00:02:40.900> K<00:02:41.200> textures<00:02:41.740> available<00:02:42.490> and

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
are just four K textures available and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.700 
are just four K textures available and
also<00:02:42.970> he<00:02:43.300> wants<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.630> do<00:02:43.750> some<00:02:43.930> other<00:02:44.080> textures

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
also he wants to do some other textures

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.670 
also he wants to do some other textures
instead<00:02:45.520> of<00:02:45.670> moss<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.360> dragon<00:02:46.960> bones<00:02:47.170> he

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
instead of moss on the dragon bones he

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.560 
instead of moss on the dragon bones he
wants<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.100> put<00:02:48.310> autumn<00:02:48.730> leaves<00:02:48.970> on<00:02:49.270> them<00:02:51.570> and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
wants to put autumn leaves on them and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.740 
wants to put autumn leaves on them and
also<00:02:52.750> here<00:02:53.320> we<00:02:53.530> have<00:02:53.710> some<00:02:53.950> variety

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
also here we have some variety

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.390 
also here we have some variety
optionally<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.750> can<00:02:56.080> get<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> file<00:02:57.040> which<00:02:57.370> is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
optionally you can get a file which is

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.020 
optionally you can get a file which is
called<00:02:57.790> Massey<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:59.320> place<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.130> moss<00:03:00.760> on

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
called Massey and this place is moss on

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.390 
called Massey and this place is moss on
the<00:03:01.120> actual<00:03:01.510> bones<00:03:01.780> itself<00:03:02.530> not<00:03:02.890> just<00:03:02.950> as

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
the actual bones itself not just as

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.940 
the actual bones itself not just as
little<00:03:03.730> objects<00:03:04.360> that<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.660> saw<00:03:04.930> earlier<00:03:05.170> but

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
little objects that you saw earlier but

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.920 
little objects that you saw earlier but
also<00:03:06.220> on<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> texture<00:03:06.970> itself<00:03:07.240> here<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.690> looks

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
also on a texture itself here that looks

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.710 
also on a texture itself here that looks
really<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:09.340> great<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.940> have<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.390> say<00:03:10.540> that

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
really really great I have to say that

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.770 
really really great I have to say that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
looks fantastic absolutely nice and then

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.690 
looks fantastic absolutely nice and then
there<00:03:13.960> is<00:03:13.990> a<00:03:14.080> file<00:03:14.380> that<00:03:14.410> completely<00:03:15.010> removes

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
there is a file that completely removes

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.420 
there is a file that completely removes
all<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.510> moss<00:03:16.870> on<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:17.500> texture<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
all the moss on the texture and the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.550 
all the moss on the texture and the
little<00:03:18.970> objects<00:03:19.570> we<00:03:19.720> have<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.080> a<00:03:20.260> wooden
