the<00:03:11.510> laser<00:03:11.780> flash<00:03:12.169> one<00:03:12.949> issue<00:03:13.159> I<00:03:13.280> did<00:03:13.579> have

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
the laser flash one issue I did have

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.399 
the laser flash one issue I did have
with<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.419> flip<00:03:14.900> cover<00:03:15.049> was<00:03:15.379> that

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 
with the flip cover was that

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:17.020 
with the flip cover was that
unfortunately<00:03:16.099> when<00:03:16.219> you<00:03:16.310> open<00:03:16.669> the<00:03:16.790> camera

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
unfortunately when you open the camera

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.569 
unfortunately when you open the camera
and<00:03:17.329> flip<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.569> backwards<00:03:17.949> half<00:03:18.949> the<00:03:19.129> camera<00:03:19.430> is

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
and flip it backwards half the camera is

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.740 
and flip it backwards half the camera is
covered<00:03:19.939> which<00:03:20.090> makes<00:03:20.269> for<00:03:20.419> some<00:03:20.569> really

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
covered which makes for some really

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.409 
covered which makes for some really
awkward<00:03:20.959> cutout<00:03:21.590> photos<00:03:21.980> which<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:23.000> kind<00:03:23.329> of

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
awkward cutout photos which is kind of

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.530 
awkward cutout photos which is kind of
disturbing<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.079> as<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.560> mentioned<00:03:25.010> my<00:03:25.549> only<00:03:26.000> one

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
disturbing so as I mentioned my only one

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.030 
disturbing so as I mentioned my only one
of<00:03:26.659> my<00:03:26.719> only<00:03:26.870> complaints<00:03:27.319> about<00:03:27.409> the<00:03:27.650> case<00:03:27.829> was

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
of my only complaints about the case was

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.949 
of my only complaints about the case was
actually<00:03:28.189> that<00:03:28.489> when<00:03:28.609> you<00:03:28.699> flip<00:03:28.879> it<00:03:28.969> open<00:03:29.329> the

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
actually that when you flip it open the

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.929 
actually that when you flip it open the
top<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:30.620> camera<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:31.069> cut<00:03:31.280> off<00:03:31.400> by<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.639> top

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
top of the camera is cut off by the top

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.670 
top of the camera is cut off by the top
of<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.120> quick<00:03:32.269> circle<00:03:32.599> splitting<00:03:32.989> which<00:03:33.530> is

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
of the quick circle splitting which is

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.780 
of the quick circle splitting which is
kind<00:03:33.859> of<00:03:33.919> annoying<00:03:34.069> as<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.340> can<00:03:34.459> see<00:03:34.579> here<00:03:34.759> I

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
kind of annoying as you can see here I

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.520 
kind of annoying as you can see here I
have<00:03:35.030> that<00:03:35.180> little<00:03:35.329> rim<00:03:35.629> right<00:03:35.750> here<00:03:35.989> but<00:03:36.500> I

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
have that little rim right here but I

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.780 
have that little rim right here but I
mean<00:03:36.769> that's<00:03:36.889> not<00:03:37.009> really<00:03:37.099> an<00:03:37.370> issue<00:03:37.459> you<00:03:37.669> can

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
mean that's not really an issue you can

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.039 
mean that's not really an issue you can
just<00:03:37.939> hold<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.180> film<00:03:38.479> like<00:03:38.629> this<00:03:38.780> take

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
just hold the film like this take

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.659 
just hold the film like this take
pictures<00:03:39.439> which<00:03:39.919> is<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.099> bit<00:03:40.220> awkward<00:03:40.310> but

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:40.669 
pictures which is a bit awkward but

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:42.520 
pictures which is a bit awkward but
whatever<00:03:40.939> in<00:03:41.150> terms<00:03:41.449> of<00:03:41.599> actually<00:03:42.019> protecting

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
whatever in terms of actually protecting

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.199 
whatever in terms of actually protecting
the<00:03:42.620> device<00:03:42.709> the<00:03:43.220> quick<00:03:43.549> circle<00:03:43.849> case<00:03:44.000> does<00:03:44.180> a

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
the device the quick circle case does a

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.309 
the device the quick circle case does a
really<00:03:44.359> good<00:03:44.540> job<00:03:44.659> of<00:03:44.720> keeping<00:03:44.900> all<00:03:45.199> the

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
really good job of keeping all the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.589 
really good job of keeping all the
corners<00:03:45.650> covered<00:03:46.009> which<00:03:46.519> are<00:03:46.729> of<00:03:47.030> course<00:03:47.329> the

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
corners covered which are of course the

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.140 
corners covered which are of course the
most<00:03:47.750> prone<00:03:48.109> areas<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.739> drop<00:03:49.009> damage<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:49.849> I

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
most prone areas to drop damage so I

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.729 
most prone areas to drop damage so I
mean<00:03:50.329> all<00:03:50.449> my<00:03:50.509> phones<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:50.989> have<00:03:51.199> have<00:03:51.470> little

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
mean all my phones I have have little

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.469 
mean all my phones I have have little
scuffs<00:03:52.009> and<00:03:52.159> marks<00:03:52.549> on<00:03:52.729> the<00:03:52.819> corner<00:03:53.090> except

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
scuffs and marks on the corner except

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.659 
scuffs and marks on the corner except
for<00:03:53.689> the<00:03:53.840> g3<00:03:54.259> beat<00:03:54.439> so<00:03:54.620> far<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.040> that's<00:03:55.400> thanks

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
for the g3 beat so far and that's thanks

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.249 
for the g3 beat so far and that's thanks
to<00:03:55.909> the<00:03:56.060> little<00:03:56.209> nice<00:03:56.449> quick<00:03:56.810> circle<00:03:57.109> case

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:57.259 
to the little nice quick circle case

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.199 
to the little nice quick circle case
protecting<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.709> corners<00:03:58.040> it<00:03:58.340> also<00:03:58.729> goes<00:03:58.909> all

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
protecting the corners it also goes all

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.610 
protecting the corners it also goes all
the<00:03:59.239> way<00:03:59.329> around<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.659> sides<00:03:59.870> of<00:03:59.989> course<00:04:00.169> but<00:04:00.470> I

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
the way around the sides of course but I

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.499 
the way around the sides of course but I
mean<00:04:00.769> both<00:04:01.310> areas<00:04:01.699> are<00:04:01.790> less<00:04:02.000> prone<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.389> damage

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:02.509 
mean both areas are less prone to damage

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.949 
mean both areas are less prone to damage
than<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:02.989> actual<00:04:03.349> corners<00:04:04.090> so<00:04:05.090> basically<00:04:05.780> the

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
than the actual corners so basically the

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.390 
than the actual corners so basically the
case<00:04:06.079> is<00:04:06.229> really<00:04:06.500> cool<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.829> I<00:04:06.979> think<00:04:07.159> it's<00:04:07.310> a

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
case is really cool and I think it's a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.399 
case is really cool and I think it's a
must-have<00:04:07.759> accessory<00:04:08.239> for<00:04:08.509> the<00:04:08.719> phone<00:04:08.930> not

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
must-have accessory for the phone not

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.749 
must-have accessory for the phone not
only<00:04:09.469> does<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.709> feel<00:04:09.949> really<00:04:10.250> nice<00:04:10.400> and<00:04:10.639> has<00:04:10.729> a

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:10.759 
only does it feel really nice and has a

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.879 
only does it feel really nice and has a
premium<00:04:11.239> feel<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.689> it<00:04:11.780> with<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.930> nice<00:04:12.560> hard

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
premium feel to it with a nice hard

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.129 
premium feel to it with a nice hard
plastic<00:04:12.919> shell<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.729> gives<00:04:14.569> protection

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
plastic shell that gives protection

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.140 
plastic shell that gives protection
without<00:04:15.259> adding<00:04:15.680> too<00:04:15.799> much<00:04:15.919> bulk<00:04:16.159> it<00:04:16.729> also<00:04:16.880> has

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
without adding too much bulk it also has
