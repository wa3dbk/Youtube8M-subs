a<00:02:59.810> process<00:03:00.440> over<00:03:00.650> time<00:03:00.799> rather<00:03:01.400> than<00:03:01.730> just<00:03:01.940> an

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
a process over time rather than just an

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.290 
a process over time rather than just an
event<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.570> went<00:03:02.720> off<00:03:02.900> event
