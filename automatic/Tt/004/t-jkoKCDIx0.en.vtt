00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
interesting video when folded on deuce

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.110 
interesting video when folded on deuce
going<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> fold<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.440> 10<00:03:00.590> 7<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.820> looks<00:03:01.970> like

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
going to fold to 10 7 and it looks like

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.320 
going to fold to 10 7 and it looks like
we're<00:03:02.300> right<00:03:02.510> around<00:03:03.760> ok<00:03:04.760> I'm<00:03:04.850> sorry<00:03:05.180> we're

math<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.350> going<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.920> vary<00:03:16.880> significantly<00:03:17.209> in

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
math is going to vary significantly in

math is going to vary significantly in
18<00:03:18.230> mins<00:03:18.820> because<00:03:19.820> you're<00:03:20.480> going<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.630> be

shorter than a a nine-man and it's going

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.030 
shorter than a a nine-man and it's going
