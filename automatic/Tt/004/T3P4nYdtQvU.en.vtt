00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.309
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.320
 this new video as true telethon 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.480
 from the title let's see how to install 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.730
 laforge mode and consequently fashions 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.650
 which require the forge mode since 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.630
 in the previous video I made 12 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.580
 months ago illustrated how to install the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.650
 fashions that only required form 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.210
 ater surely many of you will have 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.390
 had problems installing to the fashions 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.740
 because they require force strength voice 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.770
 what is a bike that allows you to 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.600
 install other fashions 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.700
 well then rumors of course 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.100
 find all the links you will find also 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 this link would be the page 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.280
 official with all the files of the forge e 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.750
 where you can just download what 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.040
 want you in this case I give you 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.580
 monster for the latest version available 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.910
 the moment you need 1.6.10 you can 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.910
 download it from here for example here not 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.070
 step 7.10 have an installer installed 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.030
 for windows the same thing you decide 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.000
 you 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.369
 once downloaded what he asks us in 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.140
 this case for the 1.7 point 10 then 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.350
 we must also be in possession 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.350
 of the 1.7 point 10 clean 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.240
 for example if we at the moment let's use 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.700
 1.6.4 we first update our 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.290
 minecraft the 1.7 point 10 which is a lot 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.290
 simple just reopen the launcher 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.820
 click on equa edit profile 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.159
 obviously we click for example on 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.320
 this case the 1 against 7.10 if the 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.150
 profile play will download everything 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.060
 etc. I already did it of course 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.840
 launch 1.7 point 10 can start 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.590
 obviously the forge just started 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.570
 simple click and just click ok 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.340
 check the path to the file here 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.640
 it's okay to do a few install clients 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.290
 now obviously download the libraries in the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.970
 install we wait a few seconds 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.970
 procedure is very simple indeed 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.690
 we await here completed with 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.480
 success 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.550
 do ok and force mode is installed 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.850
 that's all but the girl wo n't be enough 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.910
 just close our launcher if 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.760
 in case it is open and reopen it like this 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.270
 which reloads all versions 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:34.010
 installed once done this will be enough 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.990
