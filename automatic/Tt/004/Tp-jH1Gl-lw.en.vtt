00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.500 
trim and how this would be installed you
would<00:00:33.930> lay<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.920> piece<00:00:35.190> over<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:38.270> scribe<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
would lay the piece over here scribe you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.369 
would lay the piece over here scribe you
align<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:42.270> know<00:00:42.300> where<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.690> z<00:00:42.870> plugs<00:00:43.200> are

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
