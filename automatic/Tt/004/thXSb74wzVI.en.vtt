one of the most common problems that
most<00:00:12.349> of<00:00:12.500> us<00:00:12.590> run<00:00:12.800> into<00:00:13.099> is<00:00:13.910> that<00:00:14.300> we<00:00:15.019> don't

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
most of us run into is that we don't

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.890 
most of us run into is that we don't
have<00:00:15.410> time<00:00:15.590> to<00:00:15.800> cook<00:00:16.009> and<00:00:16.309> a<00:00:17.180> lot<00:00:17.390> of<00:00:17.480> times<00:00:17.689> we

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
have time to cook and a lot of times we

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.720 
have time to cook and a lot of times we
when<00:00:18.140> we<00:00:18.170> think<00:00:18.590> about<00:00:18.740> cooking<00:00:19.279> it<00:00:19.460> seems

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
when we think about cooking it seems

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.150 
when we think about cooking it seems
like<00:00:19.910> this<00:00:20.090> time<00:00:20.570> consuming<00:00:21.230> effort<00:00:21.710> where

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
like this time consuming effort where

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.429 
like this time consuming effort where
we're<00:00:22.340> putting<00:00:22.520> in<00:00:22.789> an<00:00:22.939> hour<00:00:23.480> for<00:00:23.930> a<00:00:23.960> meal<00:00:24.230> and
