the<00:01:43.109> egg<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.039> right<00:01:44.280> over<00:01:44.490> there

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
the egg is just like right over there

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:45.950 
the egg is just like right over there
it's<00:01:44.789> spinning<00:01:45.119> around<00:01:45.179> so<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:45.780> I'm<00:01:45.869> gonna

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it's spinning around so what I'm gonna

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.989 
it's spinning around so what I'm gonna
do<00:01:46.139> is<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> hit<00:01:47.039> right<00:01:47.219> bumper<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:47.969> a

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
do is if you hit right bumper you get a

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.719 
do is if you hit right bumper you get a
little<00:01:48.299> boost<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:49.920> gonna<00:01:50.069> jump<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.490> boost

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
little boost so I'm gonna jump in boost

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.080 
little boost so I'm gonna jump in boost
Boop<00:01:50.999> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.100> roll<00:01:53.819> right<00:01:54.030> over

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
Boop and then you just roll right over

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.160 
Boop and then you just roll right over
to<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.539> Easter<00:01:54.810> Egg<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:56.899> already<00:01:57.899> found<00:01:58.020> this

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to the Easter Egg I already found this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.779 
to the Easter Egg I already found this
egg<00:01:58.380> cuz<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.679> already<00:01:58.889> had<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.639> knew

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
egg cuz I already had it because I knew

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.440 
egg cuz I already had it because I knew
where<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.939> was<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> onto<00:02:02.459> the<00:02:02.609> next<00:02:02.819> secret<00:02:02.999> all

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
where it was so onto the next secret all

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
where it was so onto the next secret all
right<00:02:03.569> so<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.780> next<00:02:03.929> Easter<00:02:04.200> egg<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.560> found<00:02:04.799> on

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
right so the next Easter egg is found on

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.150 
right so the next Easter egg is found on
level<00:02:05.039> 3<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.179> let's<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:06.630> start<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.259> up<00:02:07.499> I'll

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
level 3 so let's just start this up I'll

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.130 
level 3 so let's just start this up I'll
show<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.459> how<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> get<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.600> one<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:10.110> a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
show you how to get to it this one was a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.860 
show you how to get to it this one was a
little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.410> trickier<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.950> find<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
little bit trickier to find so what you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.740 
little bit trickier to find so what you
have<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.640> up<00:02:14.640> nope<00:02:14.940> wrong<00:02:15.150> way<00:02:15.300> I'm

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
have to do is up nope wrong way I'm

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.770 
have to do is up nope wrong way I'm
going<00:02:16.170> up<00:02:16.260> here<00:02:16.640> going<00:02:17.640> up<00:02:17.760> here<00:02:17.910> going<00:02:18.450> around

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
going up here going up here going around

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.750 
going up here going up here going around
time-travel<00:02:19.590> powerup<00:02:19.920> stop<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> clock<00:02:20.459> let

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
time-travel powerup stop the clock let

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.850 
time-travel powerup stop the clock let
you're<00:02:20.940> letting<00:02:21.870> your<00:02:21.990> fast<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.410> get<00:02:22.500> faster

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
you're letting your fast to get faster

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.010 
you're letting your fast to get faster
times<00:02:23.069> that's<00:02:23.880> how<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.120> got<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.569> lot<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.810> my

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
times that's how I got a lot of my

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.320 
times that's how I got a lot of my
really<00:02:25.230> fast<00:02:25.530> times<00:02:25.830> was<00:02:26.220> just<00:02:26.459> using<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
really fast times was just using the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.900 
really fast times was just using the
clock<00:02:27.569> thing<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.440> if<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.890> pop<00:02:29.520> up<00:02:29.670> right<00:02:29.849> here

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
clock thing so if you pop up right here

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270 
clock thing so if you pop up right here
using<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.510> boost<00:02:30.690> again<00:02:30.950> see<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.070> little

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
using the boost again see this little

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.240 
using the boost again see this little
gyrocopter<00:02:33.120> magic<00:02:33.450> here<00:02:33.750> wait<00:02:34.680> wait<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.890> second

gyrocopter magic here wait wait a second

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.290 
gyrocopter magic here wait wait a second
for<00:02:35.280> my<00:02:35.400> boost<00:02:35.610> to<00:02:35.760> come<00:02:35.880> back<00:02:36.060> so

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
for my boost to come back so

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.820 
for my boost to come back so
I can<00:02:36.560> definitively<00:02:37.560> get<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.390> high<00:02:39.590> my<00:02:40.590> own

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
I can definitively get up high my own

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.660 
I can definitively get up high my own
boost<00:02:41.130> load<00:02:42.060> o<00:02:42.300> load<00:02:42.600> I'm<00:02:43.290> too<00:02:43.440> impatient<00:02:43.670> oh

boost load o load I'm too impatient oh
that<00:02:45.360> was<00:02:45.480> stupid<00:02:45.900> nope<00:02:46.580> messed<00:02:47.580> up<00:02:47.790> messed<00:02:48.630> up

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
that was stupid nope messed up messed up

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.200 
that was stupid nope messed up messed up

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.290 
take two that just goes to show you kids
and<00:02:53.760> patients<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.870> not<00:02:55.740> good<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.280> patience<00:02:57.180> is

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
and patients is not good and patience is

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.270 
and patients is not good and patience is
bad<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.380> let's<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.710> be<00:02:58.830> patient

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
bad so let's just be patient

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.470 
bad so let's just be patient
except<00:02:59.520> for<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.700> don't<00:02:59.850> have<00:02:59.940> to<00:03:00.060> wait<00:03:00.210> I'll

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
except for you don't have to wait I'll

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.600 
except for you don't have to wait I'll
just<00:03:00.510> cut<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.350> full<00:03:01.560> all<00:03:02.190> right<00:03:02.460> it's

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
just cut to it it's full all right it's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.050 
just cut to it it's full all right it's
full

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
full

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.270 
full
so<00:03:03.330> let's<00:03:03.570> engage<00:03:03.840> that<00:03:05.450> Kamehameha<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:07.280> just

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
so let's engage that Kamehameha I just

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.990 
so let's engage that Kamehameha I just
want<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.490> get<00:03:08.550> down<00:03:09.530> gyrocopter<00:03:10.760> where<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:11.820> got

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
want to get down gyrocopter where I got

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.910 
want to get down gyrocopter where I got
that<00:03:12.030> we<00:03:12.630> wait<00:03:12.750> for<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.990> boost<00:03:13.140> again<00:03:13.410> do<00:03:13.830> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
that we wait for the boost again do the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.890 
that we wait for the boost again do the
eggs<00:03:14.040> it's<00:03:14.190> right<00:03:14.370> over<00:03:14.580> there

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
eggs it's right over there

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.170 
eggs it's right over there
wonky<00:03:15.900> camera<00:03:16.260> wonky<00:03:16.770> camera<00:03:17.160> okay<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.150> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
wonky camera wonky camera okay so I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:25.870 
wonky camera wonky camera okay so I
think<00:03:18.390> this<00:03:18.750> should<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:19.110> good<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:24.080> egg

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
think this should be good and egg

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.950 
think this should be good and egg
alright<00:03:26.880> so<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.060> next<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.390> located<00:03:27.870> on

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
alright so the next one is located on

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.700 
alright so the next one is located on
the<00:03:28.020> level<00:03:28.230> first<00:03:28.500> flight<00:03:28.830> which<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.400> level<00:03:29.820> 9

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
the level first flight which is level 9

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.690 
the level first flight which is level 9
this<00:03:31.710> one's<00:03:31.890> actually<00:03:32.040> kind<00:03:32.310> of<00:03:32.370> fun<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:32.520> get

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
this one's actually kind of fun you get

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.570 
this one's actually kind of fun you get
to<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:33.450> get<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.660> fly<00:03:33.810> pretty<00:03:34.050> far<00:03:34.580> first

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
to you get to fly pretty far first

to you get to fly pretty far first
flight

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
flight

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.480 
flight
make<00:03:36.420> my<00:03:36.690> way<00:03:36.990> back<00:03:37.020> home<00:03:37.710> while<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.100> learn<00:03:38.460> to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
make my way back home while I learn to

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.920
