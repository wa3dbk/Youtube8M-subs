 angler service see both lines 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.559
 turnam and positioned as a top 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:37.390
 the series consists of rods 3 meters 40 grams 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:41.930

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.850
 positioned as universal and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.239
 the series consists of rods from 3 meters 40 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.540
 grams 33 100 grams 36 120 grams 39 130

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.689
 rods interested me I asked 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.159
 on trial 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.979
 thereby from 360 to 120 is my favorite 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.369
 test my favorite size so my 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.149
 the choice 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:20.899
 I am just now preparing for 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:24.130
 Kiev Cup is an excellent reason to look 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.130
 rods at work 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.880
 and so first look at the onboard feeder 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.610
 there is enough here velvet us 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.460
 four branches all these lines 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.440
 of the same length 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:57.259
 could of course make his branch 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:02:04.039
 let's talk a little about the rod itself and 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:17.120
 360 test to 120 grams 3 private traders in 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:18.250
 bundled with 32 bundled together in one 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.540
 ounces 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.290
 2 cardboard for 2 and a half on the dismantling 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:31.130
 one hundred twenty eight centimeters 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.799
 the blank is made of 336 carbon 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.370
 high taper what makes him 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.280
 fast on the form are personal 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.430
 look sick 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.210
 first two rings 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:50.640
 reinforced 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:53.790
 3 plate entrance ring of 20 millimeters and 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.900
 located at a distance of 52 centimeters from 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.340
 I want to reel separately 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.210
 stop at the handle 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.760
 it is long enough that it cannot but 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.010
 to please 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.560
 66 centimeters I like rods with 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.620
 long handles they are suited if 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:20.730
 it is physiologically made 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:25.500
 combined and ate with cork him so 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.470
 this is something that is easy to wash and something that rates 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.840
 are made 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.070
 made just in places hold in 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.900
 shield is good on my opinion 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:42.540
 fuji reel seat back nut and 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:46.680
 downwards the handle expands comfortable 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:55.370
 hold as i said we have four 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:57.180
 2 pieces of one ounce glass and 2 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.350
 graphite on the door for 2 and a half 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.040
 function connecting diameter of 3 s 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.310
 half the menu or not well not really 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.260
 I understand why two identical glass 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:18.000
 one thing is super it would be better to add 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:23.280
 probably one chart for 3 just 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.600
 aggressive and make it with large 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:30.100
 rings for lovers of shock leaders 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.900
 although I do not understand why use 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:38.800
 shock leader on rods up to 120 grams but 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.190
 Now fashion on them in principle rings 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.080
 which stand on carpet types quite 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:50.980
 suitable for shock leader use 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.210
 Cord Vova with fishing line may be what 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.280
 then questions if there is a tass thick fishing line 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:04.320
 the rod itself is assembled with high quality and 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:10.570
 neatly no stains no chips 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:13.590
 great now is indicative and well a couple 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.590
 times different weights 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.180
 77 grams 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.300
 view in telegram 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.190
 did not say 98 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.160
 this is a full rampal 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:03.380
 uniquely stick light fast as 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:10.550
 time I want it will not die bite 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:14.560
 visible without problems and even without problems 

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:18.470
 castrated casting qualities excellent 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:23.000
 the most comfortable weights on a cast 

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:25.460
 will be up to 84 grant 90 grams also casts 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.330
 no problem but there is some 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:31.370
 discomfort trough 70 grams whether 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.780
 rusanovsky is free tossed 

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:37.250
 the channel is about 70 meters of courtship 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.710
 big fish nothing concrete yet 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:43.310
 I can not say 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:47.420
 the largest fish was under only a gram 

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:51.110
 300 350 he did not force the form 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.240
 practice at all with this stick I would 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.990
 Recommended to use bid from 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:59.350
 feeder din 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.350
 If you catch on the cord with thin floor.
