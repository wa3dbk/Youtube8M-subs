00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to me I think the best quality arching

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.500 
to me I think the best quality arching
her<00:01:49.409> back

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
her back

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.610 
her back
not<00:01:51.510> only<00:01:51.660> from<00:01:51.900> a<00:01:52.110> player<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.440> player

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
not only from a player to player

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.020 
not only from a player to player
standpoint<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.220> from<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.610> coaching<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
standpoint but from a coaching the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.730 
standpoint but from a coaching the
players<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.510> I<00:01:54.750> think<00:01:54.990> everyone<00:01:55.320> was<00:01:55.470> very
