00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.360
 Well, guys, I hope you are 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.950
 very good and welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.230
 In this video I will teach as 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.459
 put the windows bar in our 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.259
 Android devices 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.329
 for this you will have to have two 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.759
 basic options first be users 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.260
 root and the second one will incordia 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.519
 description to download the 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.039
 application the application is called 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.280
 touchco and as you see the creator already 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.020
 indicates is rupturist 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.490
 the application that has more than one 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.440
 million downloads and four as two 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 stars in the google play and the 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.710
 comments from people so good to be 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.460
 pretty good and the stars 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.460
 pretty good too 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.940
 once we have the application we are going to 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.520
 open it and as you can see we are going to activate it and 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.210
 greek us a little little button that 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.900
 will allow to enter the said bar 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.020
 we can edit the start menu 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.770
 changing the design of the application and 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 some other option 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.370
 we can change the elements of the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.370
 settings to activate +11 activate 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:07.870
 add more so you can see that then 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.640
 they are all that we have added 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.250
 all the votes with more years work 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840
 perfectly well with which I do not 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.640
 worry that that will not be 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.010
 any problem how are you going to see here already 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.660
 we have totally added all we can 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.270
 change the brightness disable the wifi the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.560
 bluetooth wifi settings good our 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.560
 company et cetera et cetera 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.580
 we can change the start button but 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 for this you have to have the version 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.039
 pro 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.619
 and we can also change the opacity 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.619
 with what we want the button to look 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.190
 if we give one we can change the subject 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.560
 from the bar but obviously also 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.090
 we will have to have the pro version 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.170
 no doubt with the free may seem 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.940
 that is pretty good since it is 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.530
 quite accomplished and it works quite 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.320
 well you can also use it as 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.830
 export module I have not used it 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.479
 with export works perfectly as 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.340
 you see and we are in the main part in 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.740
 the main screen we give to the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.000
 bubble and it will create us the one that overcomes 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.590
 the options from here we can see 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.720
 all the applications that we have in 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.680
 our device or even look for them 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.740
 manually whatsapp 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.340
 Youtube 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.770
 skype and any other application that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.080
 We want to focus on some of 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.930
 example for example the former club and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.030
 we enter we can enter perfectly 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.220
 here we are for example in a 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.810
 application that can be handsome we can 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.850
 also enter applications 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.260
 directly from there without having to go to 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.450
 main menu for example I want to enter 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.460
 on android wear 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.410
 we enter from there directly fast 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.020
 we can also activate some other 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.060
 option or go directly to the settings 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.280
 we can also eliminate multitasking and 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.460
 have more rom bar forgiveness in our 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.460
 device 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.069
 and up to here has been today's video 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.599
 I hope you liked it to come and 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.829

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.390
