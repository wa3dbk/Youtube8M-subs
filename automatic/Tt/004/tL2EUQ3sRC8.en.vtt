00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello how are you friend of youtube 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:08.370
 again he brings you a new tutorial 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.320
 this we will learn to know how 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.820
 is our ip today there are many of us 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.930
 asked how can I do to know 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.420
 what is my p 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.880
 we have two ways as knowing what 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.320
 is our ip one is very simple and short 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.990
 but that regrets and allows us to see 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.240
 only the pp and the other the other 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.960
 procedure that we are also going to do 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.310
 We are also going to be able to see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 our ip but we have the option of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.710
 change of change stripe 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.980
 let's start with the first option the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.620
 first being going here to start of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.290
 here we do not go to the control panel and here 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 we go where it says internet networks 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.800
 let's go to the first option where it says 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.050
 center of networks and shared resources 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.050
 and here we go where it says connection 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.719
 local area one click there and this box 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.600
 what do we need here where it says 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.780
 properties 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.339
 we accept and here to know cleaning 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.430
 we go where it says internet protocol 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.820
 version 4 we give you a click here and from 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.560
 here we go to where these properties 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:14.590
 this the ip that we are looking for 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.479
 ip address 19 2,168 point 1,133 that's 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.920
 the ip we want to know the rest 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.570
 simply the machine its straight the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.229
 gateway where we are going to 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.020
 internet and these are the servers dns 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.630
 but here the ips is in the case this one 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.159
 I show him because sometimes this person 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.990
 who complain that sometimes they do not have 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.360
 internet is that sometimes what happens that 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.369
 the ip of two machines and the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.569
 there is an ip conflict and to be able 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.310
 solve that problem you are going to 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.840
 enter in this way and you will be able to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.159
 change with t with what changes in the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.500
 last number although you put there a 4 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.710
 so say a 4 or you do not look seriously anymore 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.119
 this number can be 140 160 70 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.420
 any other number 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.420
 this number any other number from 3 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 to 255 then this immediately 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 will solve that problem 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.650
 in this way you will be able to know which 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.690
 stripe in this case is when you can 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.920
 see it and you can also change I'm going to 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.050
 close 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.230
 now let's go to the other case where 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.700
 he simply wants to know what the ip 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.989
 we go again home and here in 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 Navarre below we will not write what 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.890
 next cmd 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.850
 and we're going up here we have a click 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.980
 and here what we have to write is what 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.980
 following 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.560
 we have to write the following config 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.349
 and give yourself to the center 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.760
 and here we get all the information with 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.230
 regarding our network card if 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.800
 we had a wireless card too 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.180
 is going to go out there 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.290
 let's go to the top 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.150
 and here we did not finish talking, he tells me 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.519
 area connection ethernet adapter 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.379
 local the data is the physical address 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.170
 or go to a mac as they call it another is 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.379
 it is this but the ip here which direction 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:17.209
 ip version 4 as they lived it before is 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:19.549
 this 192 168 point 1 point initially 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.670
 I had it 133 if they decided to count 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.349
 change it to 134 and here is observing 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.000
 just the same value that we saw in 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.439
 the previous procedure but in the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.810
 procedure shot as I said then 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.750
 you have the option of being able to change the ip to 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.280
 an ip that preferably is good 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.480
 way you will be able to know what is the ip 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.359
 of your pc and then change the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.340
 web simply know it this way 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.709
 You'll be able to know the ip of your pc as 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.459
