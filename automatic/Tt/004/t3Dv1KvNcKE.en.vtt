cards first you get one card and they
need<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:31.009> sum<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.280> ten<00:01:31.780> they<00:01:32.780> need<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.170> be

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
need to sum to ten they need to be

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.580 
need to sum to ten they need to be
number<00:01:33.740> ten<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:35.330> is<00:01:35.509> three<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.930> how<00:01:36.409> many

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
number ten so this is three and how many

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.859 
number ten so this is three and how many
more<00:01:36.770> cards<00:01:37.159> before<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.610> need<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.909> 10/7<00:01:38.659> right

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
more cards before you need to 10/7 right

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
so three four five six seven eight nine

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.580 
so three four five six seven eight nine
ten<00:01:46.840> two<00:01:47.840> three<00:01:48.740> four<00:01:49.280> five<00:01:49.789> six<00:01:50.569> seven<00:01:51.110> eight

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
ten two three four five six seven eight

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.940 
ten two three four five six seven eight
nine<00:01:51.860> ten<00:01:54.069> seven<00:01:55.069> eight<00:01:55.729> nine<00:01:56.710> ten

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
nine ten seven eight nine ten

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.270 
nine ten seven eight nine ten
so<00:01:58.159> you're<00:01:58.399> going<00:01:58.610> to<00:01:58.640> add<00:01:58.880> all<00:01:58.909> these<00:01:59.450> cards
