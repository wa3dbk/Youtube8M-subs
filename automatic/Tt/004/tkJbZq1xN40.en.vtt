think they'd be happy about that if they

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.770 
think they'd be happy about that if they
were<00:02:33.370> able<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.730> really<00:02:34.150> think<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.750> through

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
liberty so even though it didn't happen

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.890 
liberty so even though it didn't happen
in<00:02:37.960> their<00:02:38.110> time<00:02:38.320> do<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.770> think<00:02:38.950> things<00:02:39.280> like

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900

equality for gay people those type of

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.160 
equality for gay people those type of
things<00:02:42.250> would<00:02:42.520> make<00:02:42.760> them<00:02:42.970> proud<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:43.990> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
things would make them proud I think the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.040 
things would make them proud I think the
yes<00:02:44.530> I<00:02:44.740> think<00:02:44.800> if<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.190> deconstruct<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.690> the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
yes I think if you deconstruct the the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.540 
yes I think if you deconstruct the the
documents<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.800> were<00:02:48.670> written<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.780> really

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
documents that were written they really

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.699 
documents that were written they really
echo<00:02:51.550> what's<00:02:52.240> going<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.200> in<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> in

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
echo what's going on in the in the in

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.460 
echo what's going on in the in the in
those<00:02:53.890> areas<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.550> I<00:02:54.640> think<00:02:54.670> those<00:02:55.150> those<00:02:55.810> men

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
those areas and I think those those men

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.330 
those areas and I think those those men
because<00:02:56.980> because<00:02:57.310> they<00:02:57.430> were<00:02:57.490> all<00:02:57.700> men<00:02:57.970> would

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
because because they were all men would

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.920 
because because they were all men would
look<00:03:00.340> at<00:03:00.490> it<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.910> you<00:03:01.330> know<00:03:01.420> maybe<00:03:01.630> initially

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
look at it and you know maybe initially

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.750 
look at it and you know maybe initially
would<00:03:02.350> be<00:03:02.470> like<00:03:02.650> wow<00:03:02.860> what<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.220> hell<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.490> going

on<00:03:03.850> here<00:03:04.180> but<00:03:04.600> they<00:03:04.750> would<00:03:04.900> look<00:03:05.020> at<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.260> and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
on here but they would look at it and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.699 
on here but they would look at it and
say<00:03:05.560> yeah<00:03:05.800> this<00:03:06.490> is<00:03:06.930> progress<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.260> is<00:03:08.470> what

so<00:03:28.300> yes<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.810> would<00:03:28.959> think<00:03:29.080> that<00:03:29.260> they<00:03:29.380> would<00:03:29.530> be

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.530 
so yes I would think that they would be
horrified<00:03:30.310> and<00:03:30.550> what<00:03:30.700> happened<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.269> think<00:03:31.330> they

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
horrified and what happened I think they

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.020 
horrified and what happened I think they
would<00:03:31.660> also<00:03:31.780> be<00:03:32.019> horrified<00:03:32.500> at<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.459> corporate

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
would also be horrified at the corporate

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.970 
would also be horrified at the corporate
money<00:03:34.209> takeover<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.080> politics<00:03:35.620> I<00:03:35.709> think<00:03:35.739> they

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
money takeover of politics I think they

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.259 
money takeover of politics I think they
would<00:03:36.100> be<00:03:36.130> against<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.640> they<00:03:36.910> could<00:03:37.120> not

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
would be against that they could not

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.390 
would be against that they could not
envision<00:03:38.019> the<00:03:38.380> Koch<00:03:38.590> brothers<00:03:38.620> being<00:03:39.250> able

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
envision the Koch brothers being able

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.460 
envision the Koch brothers being able
they<00:03:39.580> didn't<00:03:39.760> envision<00:03:39.970> televisions<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.050> so

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
they didn't envision televisions and so

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.449 
they didn't envision televisions and so
they<00:03:41.560> didn't<00:03:41.709> understand<00:03:42.070> how<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.250> can

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
they didn't understand how you can

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.250 
they didn't understand how you can
control<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.940> message<00:03:43.120> just<00:03:43.570> with<00:03:43.780> money<00:03:43.959> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
control the message just with money and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.190 
control the message just with money and
right<00:03:45.010> now<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.250> idea<00:03:45.790> that<00:03:46.060> money<00:03:46.630> equals

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
right now the idea that money equals

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.110 
right now the idea that money equals
free<00:03:47.260> speech<00:03:47.860> well<00:03:48.190> some<00:03:48.430> people<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.880> more

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
the Tea Party because the Tea Party's

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.280 
the Tea Party because the Tea Party's
whole<00:03:57.730> thing<00:03:57.880> was<00:03:58.000> no<00:03:58.180> taxation<00:03:58.660> without

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
whole thing was no taxation without

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.590 
whole thing was no taxation without
representation<00:04:00.010> which<00:04:00.519> goes<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.510> the

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
representation which goes to the to the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.320 
representation which goes to the to the
money<00:04:01.780> issue<00:04:02.100> they<00:04:03.100> obviously<00:04:03.730> believed<00:04:04.120> in

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
working pretty hard I guess it's over an

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.930 
working pretty hard I guess it's over an
average<00:06:18.290> you<00:06:18.710> know<00:06:18.740> I'm<00:06:18.980> guessing<00:06:19.370> most<00:06:19.670> of

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
average you know I'm guessing most of

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.520 
average you know I'm guessing most of
the<00:06:20.060> Chinese<00:06:20.450> a<00:06:20.480> rural<00:06:20.810> they're<00:06:21.200> not<00:06:21.380> working

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.040 
the Chinese a rural they're not working
so<00:06:21.860> yeah<00:06:22.580> yeah<00:06:22.970> final<00:06:23.570> thought<00:06:23.690> is<00:06:23.720> what<00:06:23.990> do

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
so yeah yeah final thought is what do

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.910 
so yeah yeah final thought is what do
you<00:06:24.080> what<00:06:24.230> do<00:06:24.290> you<00:06:24.350> think<00:06:24.500> they<00:06:24.590> would<00:06:24.710> think

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:24.920 
you what do you think they would think

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.790 
you what do you think they would think
about<00:06:25.040> our<00:06:25.340> sort<00:06:25.580> of<00:06:25.670> Bush<00:06:25.940> Clinton<00:06:26.800> dynasty

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800

and we left yeah they just wanted to
escape<00:06:34.050> kings<00:06:34.980> and<00:06:35.310> queens<00:06:35.580> and<00:06:35.850> I<00:06:35.940> think

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
escape kings and queens and I think

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.270 
escape kings and queens and I think
we're<00:06:36.330> doing<00:06:36.540> it<00:06:36.720> to<00:06:36.870> ourselves<00:06:37.020> right<00:06:37.890> here

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
we're doing it to ourselves right here

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.890 
we're doing it to ourselves right here
yeah<00:06:39.090> I<00:06:39.300> mean<00:06:39.450> it<00:06:39.690> does<00:06:39.930> it<00:06:40.170> does<00:06:40.440> seem<00:06:40.830> rather

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
yeah I mean it does it does seem rather

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.510 
yeah I mean it does it does seem rather
akin<00:06:42.900> to<00:06:43.080> that<00:06:43.110> but<00:06:43.590> I<00:06:43.800> mean<00:06:43.950> I<00:06:44.100> guess<00:06:44.160> the<00:06:44.370> big

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
akin to that but I mean I guess the big

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.890 
akin to that but I mean I guess the big
difference<00:06:44.880> here<00:06:45.030> is<00:06:45.120> that<00:06:45.150> they're<00:06:45.390> elected

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
difference here is that they're elected

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.520 
difference here is that they're elected
and<00:06:47.240> there<00:06:48.240> they<00:06:48.450> were<00:06:48.510> just<00:06:48.600> you<00:06:49.050> know<00:06:49.170> kind

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
and there they were just you know kind

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.460 
and there they were just you know kind
of<00:06:50.060> appointed<00:06:51.060> because<00:06:51.240> of<00:06:51.540> their<00:06:51.720> bloodline

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
of appointed because of their bloodline

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.140 
of appointed because of their bloodline
but<00:06:52.920> doesn't<00:06:53.190> like<00:06:53.550> they're<00:06:53.670> sort<00:06:54.090> of

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150 
but doesn't like they're sort of

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.670 
but doesn't like they're sort of
appointed<00:06:54.690> Hilary<00:06:54.960> seems<00:06:55.230> like<00:06:55.380> she's<00:06:55.560> being

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
appointed Hilary seems like she's being

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.560 
appointed Hilary seems like she's being
anointed<00:06:56.040> well<00:06:56.580> the<00:06:56.730> thing<00:06:56.940> is<00:06:56.970> well<00:06:57.390> yeah

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
anointed well the thing is well yeah

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.330 
anointed well the thing is well yeah
because<00:06:57.780> like<00:06:58.200> I<00:06:58.380> think<00:06:58.590> back<00:06:58.800> to<00:06:58.830> what<00:06:59.040> Jimmy

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
because like I think back to what Jimmy

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.910 
because like I think back to what Jimmy
said<00:06:59.580> it's<00:06:59.850> about<00:06:59.970> having<00:07:00.780> money<00:07:01.170> and<00:07:01.500> being

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
said it's about having money and being

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.900 
said it's about having money and being
able<00:07:02.070> to<00:07:02.250> like<00:07:03.770> kind<00:07:04.770> of<00:07:04.830> stage<00:07:05.100> a<00:07:05.130> stage<00:07:05.700> a

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
able to like kind of stage a stage a

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.480 
able to like kind of stage a stage a
campaign<00:07:06.510> where<00:07:07.470> you<00:07:07.500> can<00:07:07.800> get<00:07:07.950> yourself<00:07:08.070> out

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 
campaign where you can get yourself out

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.430 
campaign where you can get yourself out
there<00:07:08.700> and<00:07:08.760> then<00:07:08.880> I'm<00:07:09.510> sure<00:07:09.570> there<00:07:09.960> were<00:07:10.080> were

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
there and then I'm sure there were were

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.460 
there and then I'm sure there were were
many<00:07:10.830> other<00:07:11.280> qualified<00:07:11.910> people<00:07:12.120> who<00:07:12.840> aren't

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470 
many other qualified people who aren't

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.740 
many other qualified people who aren't
able<00:07:13.680> to<00:07:13.860> get<00:07:14.070> themselves<00:07:14.310> out<00:07:14.790> there<00:07:14.850> and<00:07:15.330> put

think that's obvious and I think they

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.800 
think that's obvious and I think they
would<00:07:41.520> be<00:07:41.580> horrified<00:07:41.760> at<00:07:42.150> that<00:07:42.270> too<00:07:42.480> I<00:07:42.630> mean

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:43.070 
would be horrified at that too I mean
that's

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 
that's
