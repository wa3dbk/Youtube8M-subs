00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
not really being there I think the only

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.780 
not really being there I think the only
reason<00:03:10.050> why<00:03:10.320> we<00:03:10.500> managed<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.100> because<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.610> both

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790

still<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.069> think<00:03:20.400> maybe<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.790> should

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
still think that I think maybe I should

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.580 
still think that I think maybe I should
have<00:03:21.120> kept<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.450> open<00:03:21.540> maybe<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.319> would<00:03:22.560> have
