of connectors for these gas Springs one

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.189 
of connectors for these gas Springs one
is<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.500> plastic<00:01:02.399> snap<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.180> socket<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:03.930> then

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
is the plastic snap on socket and then

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.219 
is the plastic snap on socket and then
the<00:01:04.680> blade<00:01:04.979> style<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> each<00:01:06.869> here

one that is too strong ultimately what

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.110 
one that is too strong ultimately what
ends<00:03:00.780> up<00:03:00.900> happening<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.829> that<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.609> fasters

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
ends up happening is is that the fasters

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.659 
ends up happening is is that the fasters
that<00:03:03.299> hold<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.930> mounting<00:03:04.319> bracket<00:03:04.769> are

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
pressure and then ultimately they end up

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.539

breaking<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.220> you've<00:03:11.370> got<00:03:11.519> a
