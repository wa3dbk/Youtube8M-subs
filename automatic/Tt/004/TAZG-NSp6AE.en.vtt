00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:11.306
 Windows 8 - first launch 

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:17.026
 The tablet with Windows 8 on board offers many possibilities. 

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:21.440
 Immediately after the purchase, however, you must carry out its first configuration 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.860
 and create an account that allows you to download applications 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.860
 operating on the start screen. 

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:29.706
 In this guide you will learn how to do it. 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.300
 Time for the first launch of a new tablet with Windows 8. 

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:39.080
 If your device has the option of connecting the docking station 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.820
 and you have one, connect it to the device. 

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:46.566
 If not, click "skip" at the bottom of the screen. 

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:52.120
 The next step is to accept the license terms. 

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:56.633
 The contract contains provisions that the user undertakes to complete 

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.860
 when using a tablet with Windows 8. 

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:02.406
 After reading the agreement, check the option 

00:01:02.406 --> 00:01:06.960
 "Accepts the Windows license terms on this computer" 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.133
 and click "accept". 

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:14.080
 The next step is initial personalization. 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.000
 Here you can give your device a name, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.726
 which will be displayed, for example, in a local network 

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:22.713
 and choose the colors of Windows 8. 

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:27.766
 Choose the colors and name you like and click "next". 

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:33.086
 The next step is to connect to a wireless network. 

00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:35.606
 If you do not want to connect your tablet to the network now, 

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:38.660
 select the option "connect to a wireless network later". 

00:01:39.026 --> 00:01:41.360
 If you want to connect your device, 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.033
 select your network from the list of searched networks and click "next". 

00:01:45.586 --> 00:01:47.786
 If the network is secured with a password, 

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:49.960
 enter them and click "connect". 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.900
 Then it's time for the initial settings of the tablet. 

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:58.606
 We can use express settings or manually set selected options. 

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:02.333
 All settings can also be entered later. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.333
 Manual settings consist of the following options: 

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:10.000
 The first time you connect to the network 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.926
 the tablet will ask us about the possibility of sharing files on the local network, 

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:16.640
 Choose the option that suits you. 

00:02:17.606 --> 00:02:19.893
 The next windows concern respectively: 

00:02:19.893 --> 00:02:21.600
 security settings, 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.226
 sending notifications to the producer of the operating system, 

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:28.133
 searching for solutions to problems in the network 

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.926
 and sharing information with applications. 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.926
 It's time to log in to Windows 8 using a Microsoft account. 

00:02:36.126 --> 00:02:39.540
 The account allows you to download applications from the Windows Store, 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.060
 getting access to online content 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.726
 and synchronization of various devices running on Windows 8. 

00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:50.746
 To create an account, we need any email address. 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.880
 Enter your address and click "next". 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.426

 "Create an account to receive a new email address". 

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:03.600
 You can also log in without using an account, 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.746
 however, you will not be able to use the features discussed above. 

00:03:10.313 --> 00:03:13.740
 The next step is to fill in the personal data form 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.853
 and a form with security information. 

00:03:16.853 --> 00:03:21.286
 They will be used when you need to recover your password. 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.733
 After completing the form, click "next". 

00:03:26.913 --> 00:03:29.753
 The next step is communication preferences. 

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:34.653
 At this point you can allow sending information about your account to the system manufacturer 

00:03:34.653 --> 00:03:37.240
 to personalize web content 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.193
 and to send the newsletter to the e-mail address provided. 

00:03:41.793 --> 00:03:43.886

00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:45.546
 and click "next." 

00:03:45.546 --> 00:03:47.546
 Your account will be created. 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.280
 Wait for the preparation of the device. 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.633
 After the procedure is finished, the start screen will be displayed. 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.273
 You can now use your tablet freely. 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.660
 Finally, it is worth mentioning how to turn off the device with Windows 8. 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.873
 Anywhere in the system, simply drag your finger across the screen from the right edge to the left. 

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:11.613
 Then select the "settings" option from the menu displayed.

 Under the icon called "power" you can turn off your tablet or go into sleep mode.
