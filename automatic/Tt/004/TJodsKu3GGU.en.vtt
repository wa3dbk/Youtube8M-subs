appearance now is what we call residual
self-image<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:45.220> is<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.490> mental<00:01:45.700> projection

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
self-image it is the mental projection

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.600 
self-image it is the mental projection
of<00:01:46.390> your<00:01:46.899> digital<00:01:47.049> self<00:01:47.679> from<00:01:47.890> this<00:01:48.130> dialogue

it's evident that neo is reluctant to

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.570 
it's evident that neo is reluctant to
admit<00:01:52.209> that<00:01:52.750> his<00:01:52.990> experiences<00:01:53.890> are<00:01:54.039> imaginary

admit that his experiences are imaginary

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.020 
admit that his experiences are imaginary
because<00:01:54.970> they<00:01:55.299> are<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:55.780> fully<00:01:56.110> realistic

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
because they are so fully realistic

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.789 
because they are so fully realistic
let's<00:01:58.030> again<00:01:58.360> come<00:01:58.630> back<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.049> film<00:01:59.319> matrix

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
let's again come back to the film matrix

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.219 
let's again come back to the film matrix
the<00:02:00.670> following<00:02:01.060> dialogue<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.659> used<00:02:01.929> between
