they make if he and they had the same

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.390 
they make if he and they had the same
time<00:04:25.890> it'll<00:04:26.280> be<00:04:26.370> slow<00:04:26.580> but<00:04:27.380> yes<00:04:28.380> exactly

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
time it'll be slow but yes exactly

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.310 
time it'll be slow but yes exactly
eighty<00:04:29.610> nine<00:04:29.880> shooting<00:04:30.360> well<00:04:30.660> we<00:04:30.810> got<00:04:30.930> nothing

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
eighty nine shooting well we got nothing

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.440 
eighty nine shooting well we got nothing
that<00:04:31.350> was<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.070> here<00:04:32.250> we<00:04:32.370> go<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:32.730> into<00:04:33.150> Game

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
that was so here we go on into Game

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.970 
that was so here we go on into Game
two<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.780> guess<00:04:34.200> there's<00:04:34.470> nothing<00:04:34.590> we<00:04:34.860> can

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
two I guess there's nothing we can

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.710 
two I guess there's nothing we can
really<00:04:35.010> do<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:35.310> change<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.330> team<00:04:36.510> as

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
really do to change the the team as

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.870 
really do to change the the team as
usual<00:04:37.290> I<00:04:37.440> love<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.830> team<00:04:38.040> I<00:04:38.250> think<00:04:38.580> our<00:04:38.700> few

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
usual I love the team I think our few

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.700 
usual I love the team I think our few
substitutions<00:04:39.570> helped<00:04:40.170> us<00:04:40.290> out<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.470> bit

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.380 
substitutions helped us out a bit
I<00:04:40.800> think<00:04:41.010> Juan<00:04:41.220> fron<00:04:41.520> gets<00:04:41.790> burned<00:04:42.030> down<00:04:42.210> the

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
I think Juan fron gets burned down the

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.240 
I think Juan fron gets burned down the
right<00:04:42.570> wing<00:04:42.870> but<00:04:43.260> we<00:04:43.830> don't<00:04:43.980> have<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.130> better

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
right wing but we don't have a better

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.130 
right wing but we don't have a better
option<00:04:44.370> at<00:04:44.700> right<00:04:44.820> back<00:04:45.000> do<00:04:45.150> we<00:04:45.270> like<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.990> put

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
option at right back do we like to put

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.350 
option at right back do we like to put
on<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.320> bench<00:04:46.470> maybe<00:04:46.740> no<00:04:47.130> oh<00:04:47.550> we<00:04:48.000> could<00:04:48.150> go<00:04:48.240> up

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
on the bench maybe no oh we could go up

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.040 
on the bench maybe no oh we could go up
