at the transmitter you can tell which

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.280 
at the transmitter you can tell which
one's<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.970> transmitter<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:15.750> it<00:02:15.900> says<00:02:16.110> on

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
one's the transmitter because it says on

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.410 
one's the transmitter because it says on
the<00:02:16.410> back<00:02:16.530> transmitter<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.730> it<00:02:17.880> also<00:02:18.000> has<00:02:18.209> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
happen is if you adjust the sensitivity

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.000 
happen is if you adjust the sensitivity
and<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.600> up<00:02:57.720> too<00:02:57.900> high<00:02:58.010> what'll

back into sensitivity say negative
twenty<00:03:59.020> and<00:03:59.110> let's<00:03:59.290> bring<00:03:59.380> it<00:03:59.560> up<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.650> negative

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
twenty and let's bring it up to negative

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.590 
twenty and let's bring it up to negative

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
here you will ride those levels so that

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.630 
here you will ride those levels so that
you're<00:04:05.530> getting<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.770> numbers<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.370> be<00:04:06.459> about

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
you're getting the numbers to be about

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.520 
you're getting the numbers to be about
halfway<00:04:06.910> so<00:04:07.750> now<00:04:07.900> that's<00:04:08.200> looking<00:04:08.500> pretty

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
halfway so now that's looking pretty

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.009 
halfway so now that's looking pretty
good<00:04:08.860> right<00:04:09.040> there<00:04:12.180> now<00:04:13.180> the<00:04:13.239> other<00:04:13.810> thing

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
maybe maybe somebody is also on this

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.090 
maybe maybe somebody is also on this
frequency<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.450> you<00:04:19.570> want<00:04:19.750> to<00:04:19.810> retune<00:04:20.200> so<00:04:20.950> what

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
frequency and you want to retune so what

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.830 
frequency and you want to retune so what
you<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.370> do<00:04:21.489> now<00:04:21.669> is<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.450> can<00:04:22.480> go<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:24.570> set<00:04:25.570> and

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
you can do now is you can go to set and

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.840 
you can do now is you can go to set and
let's<00:04:26.440> go<00:04:26.620> ahead<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.130> go<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:29.100> Bank<00:04:30.100> now<00:04:30.790> you

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
let's go ahead and go to Bank now you

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.200 
let's go ahead and go to Bank now you
have<00:04:31.479> eight<00:04:32.050> banks<00:04:32.770> and<00:04:33.220> one<00:04:33.460> user-definable

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
have eight banks and one user-definable

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.530 
have eight banks and one user-definable
Bank<00:04:35.040> basically<00:04:36.040> what<00:04:36.190> these<00:04:36.430> are<00:04:36.729> are<00:04:37.030> groups

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
Bank basically what these are are groups

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.420 
Bank basically what these are are groups
of<00:04:37.720> channels<00:04:38.110> so<00:04:38.440> you<00:04:38.530> have<00:04:38.650> eight<00:04:38.830> groups<00:04:39.250> of

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
of channels so you have eight groups of

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.180 
of channels so you have eight groups of
channels<00:04:40.229> so<00:04:41.229> you<00:04:41.260> can<00:04:41.470> see<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.770> if<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:41.979> go<00:04:42.160> to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
channels so you can see that if we go to

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
channels so you can see that if we go to
bank<00:04:42.729> one<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:44.130> we<00:04:45.130> go<00:04:45.280> over<00:04:45.430> to<00:04:45.580> channel<00:04:46.060> that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
bank one and we go over to channel that

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.000 
bank one and we go over to channel that
we<00:04:46.360> have<00:04:46.570> one<00:04:47.020> two<00:04:47.800> three<00:04:47.850> four<00:04:49.860> channels<00:04:50.860> for

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
we have one two three four channels for

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.890 
we have one two three four channels for
this<00:04:51.100> Bank<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.580> this<00:04:51.700> is<00:04:51.820> Bank<00:04:52.060> One<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.419> as<00:04:52.570> for

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
this Bank so this is Bank One and as for

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.450 
this Bank so this is Bank One and as for
channels<00:04:53.289> in<00:04:53.410> it<00:04:54.450> these<00:04:55.450> are<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.720> four<00:04:56.460> so

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
channels in it these are the four so

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.779 
channels in it these are the four so
let's<00:04:57.490> say<00:04:57.760> we<00:04:57.910> want<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.240> go<00:04:58.539> to<00:04:59.400> five<00:05:00.400> twenty

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
let's say we want to go to five twenty

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.500 
let's say we want to go to five twenty
nine<00:05:00.940> fifty<00:05:01.390> we'll<00:05:01.990> go<00:05:02.110> ahead<00:05:02.229> and<00:05:02.590> say<00:05:02.890> set

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
nine fifty we'll go ahead and say set

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.750 
nine fifty we'll go ahead and say set
and<00:05:04.510> now<00:05:05.050> it's<00:05:05.200> stored<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.800> we<00:05:06.220> can<00:05:06.400> get<00:05:06.610> out

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
and now it's stored and we can get out

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.870 
and now it's stored and we can get out
of<00:05:06.789> here<00:05:07.030> five<00:05:07.750> twenty<00:05:08.200> nine<00:05:08.380> fifty<00:05:08.950> now<00:05:09.610> we'll

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
of here five twenty nine fifty now we'll

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.880 
of here five twenty nine fifty now we'll
jump<00:05:10.090> back<00:05:10.180> over<00:05:10.539> to<00:05:10.840> the<00:05:10.990> receiver<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.740> we'll

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
jump back over to the receiver and we'll

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.010 
jump back over to the receiver and we'll
set<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.340> up<00:05:12.550> so<00:05:13.330> what<00:05:13.450> we're<00:05:13.600> going<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.750> do<00:05:13.900> is

we're<00:05:21.039> going<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.250> go<00:05:21.460> to<00:05:21.520> bank<00:05:21.850> one<00:05:22.150> set<00:05:22.840> then

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
we're going to go to bank one set then

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.219 
we're going to go to bank one set then
we're<00:05:23.680> going<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.830> go<00:05:23.979> over<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.610> channel<00:05:25.270> one

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
we're going to go over to channel one

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.480 
we're going to go over to channel one
and<00:05:26.620> it<00:05:27.039> was<00:05:27.419> 529<00:05:28.419> fifty<00:05:28.840> set<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:30.160> see<00:05:30.370> the

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
and it was 529 fifty set and you see the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.860 
and it was 529 fifty set and you see the
little<00:05:30.640> RF<00:05:31.060> light<00:05:31.360> light<00:05:31.630> up

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.570 

now<00:05:35.870> on<00:05:36.050> the<00:05:36.170> receiver<00:05:36.560> unit<00:05:36.890> you<00:05:37.220> might<00:05:37.400> also

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
now on the receiver unit you might also

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.540 
now on the receiver unit you might also
want<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.060> adjust<00:05:38.450> your<00:05:38.870> squelch<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:40.250> squelch

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
want to adjust your squelch the squelch

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.340 
want to adjust your squelch the squelch
should<00:05:40.760> always<00:05:40.910> be<00:05:41.240> at<00:05:41.420> low<00:05:41.660> unless<00:05:41.990> you<00:05:42.200> are

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
should always be at low unless you are

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.170 
should always be at low unless you are
getting<00:05:42.740> a<00:05:42.950> ton<00:05:43.400> of<00:05:43.430> Wireless<00:05:44.000> interference

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
getting a ton of Wireless interference

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.090 
getting a ton of Wireless interference
say<00:05:44.690> for<00:05:45.050> example<00:05:45.410> you're<00:05:45.560> at<00:05:45.710> a<00:05:45.740> trade<00:05:46.070> show

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
say for example you're at a trade show

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.660 
say for example you're at a trade show
you<00:05:46.790> might<00:05:46.970> want<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.240> bring<00:05:47.450> this<00:05:47.630> up<00:05:47.870> to

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
you might want to bring this up to

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.280 
you might want to bring this up to
something<00:05:49.670> a<00:05:49.760> little<00:05:49.910> bit<00:05:50.210> more<00:05:50.690> like<00:05:50.900> mid<00:05:51.140> or

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
something a little bit more like mid or

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.600 
something a little bit more like mid or
high<00:05:51.440> but<00:05:51.740> you're<00:05:51.890> going<00:05:52.010> to<00:05:52.070> decrease<00:05:52.580> your

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
high but you're going to decrease your

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.790 
high but you're going to decrease your
range<00:05:54.520> so<00:05:55.520> we'll<00:05:55.640> bring<00:05:55.760> that<00:05:55.820> back<00:05:56.090> down<00:05:56.240> low

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.720 

another<00:06:00.800> interesting<00:06:01.400> feature<00:06:01.640> is<00:06:03.730> pilot

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
another interesting feature is pilot

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.360 
another interesting feature is pilot
tone<00:06:05.320> with<00:06:06.320> these<00:06:06.470> units<00:06:06.800> you<00:06:06.920> always<00:06:07.160> want<00:06:07.310> to

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
tone with these units you always want to

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.340 
tone with these units you always want to
leave<00:06:07.850> the<00:06:08.030> pilot<00:06:08.360> tone<00:06:08.540> on<00:06:08.690> basically<00:06:09.230> what

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
leave the pilot tone on basically what

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.170 
leave the pilot tone on basically what
the<00:06:09.470> pilot<00:06:09.800> tone<00:06:09.980> does<00:06:10.190> is<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.550> looks<00:06:10.790> for<00:06:10.940> the

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
the pilot tone does is it looks for the

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.210 
the pilot tone does is it looks for the
transmitter<00:06:11.870> and<00:06:12.080> if<00:06:12.140> it<00:06:12.230> doesn't<00:06:12.410> hear<00:06:12.980> its

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
transmitter and if it doesn't hear its

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.950 
transmitter and if it doesn't hear its
pilot<00:06:13.730> tone<00:06:13.940> and<00:06:14.210> it's<00:06:14.360> a<00:06:14.450> super<00:06:14.840> high

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
pilot tone and it's a super high

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.080 
pilot tone and it's a super high
frequency<00:06:15.500> that<00:06:15.530> not<00:06:16.160> even<00:06:16.370> dogs<00:06:16.580> can<00:06:16.820> hear<00:06:16.970> if

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
frequency that not even dogs can hear if

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.060 
frequency that not even dogs can hear if
it<00:06:17.180> doesn't<00:06:17.480> hear<00:06:17.630> that<00:06:17.780> pilot<00:06:18.200> tone<00:06:18.380> what

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
it doesn't hear that pilot tone what

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.680 
it doesn't hear that pilot tone what
it'll<00:06:19.220> do<00:06:19.400> is<00:06:19.430> it<00:06:19.610> will<00:06:19.700> automatically<00:06:20.150> mute

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
it'll do is it will automatically mute

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.390 
it'll do is it will automatically mute
the<00:06:20.900> unit

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.970 

you<00:06:28.400> can<00:06:28.550> also<00:06:28.670> name<00:06:29.060> each<00:06:29.420> unit<00:06:30.020> maybe<00:06:30.500> you

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
you can also name each unit maybe you

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.410 
you can also name each unit maybe you
have<00:06:31.220> different<00:06:31.460> talent<00:06:32.030> and<00:06:32.120> you<00:06:32.180> want<00:06:32.360> to

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
have different talent and you want to

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.750 
have different talent and you want to
name<00:06:32.570> each<00:06:32.750> one<00:06:32.810> this<00:06:33.590> one's<00:06:33.800> called<00:06:33.980> the<00:06:34.130> ek

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
name each one this one's called the ek

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.270 
name each one this one's called the ek
100<00:06:35.410> you<00:06:36.410> could<00:06:36.530> change<00:06:36.710> this<00:06:36.890> name<00:06:37.100> to

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
100 you could change this name to

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.189 
100 you could change this name to
whatever<00:06:37.430> you<00:06:37.640> want

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:42.199 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:44.499 

so<00:06:43.189> the<00:06:43.310> last<00:06:43.460> thing<00:06:43.669> that<00:06:43.699> we<00:06:43.879> want<00:06:44.029> to<00:06:44.090> set<00:06:44.300> is

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
so the last thing that we want to set is

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.269 
so the last thing that we want to set is
the<00:06:44.779> levels<00:06:45.110> on<00:06:45.289> our<00:06:45.499> camera<00:06:45.949> so<00:06:46.099> we're<00:06:46.189> going

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:46.279 
the levels on our camera so we're going

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:48.730 
the levels on our camera so we're going
to<00:06:46.340> first<00:06:46.580> set<00:06:46.939> the<00:06:47.360> record<00:06:47.689> level<00:06:47.930> to<00:06:48.289> manual

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
to first set the record level to manual

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.140 
to first set the record level to manual
then<00:06:49.279> what<00:06:49.460> we<00:06:49.520> want<00:06:49.580> to<00:06:49.669> do<00:06:49.819> is<00:06:49.909> we<00:06:49.999> want<00:06:50.120> to

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
then what we want to do is we want to

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.159 
then what we want to do is we want to
take<00:06:50.300> this<00:06:50.479> guy<00:06:50.659> down<00:06:50.689> to<00:06:51.289> about<00:06:51.979> 30%<00:06:53.050> now<00:06:54.050> if

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:54.169 
take this guy down to about 30% now if

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.330 
take this guy down to about 30% now if
you<00:06:54.259> notice<00:06:54.499> that<00:06:54.590> the<00:06:54.740> levels<00:06:55.039> are<00:06:55.159> way<00:06:55.310> too

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
you notice that the levels are way too

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.089 
you notice that the levels are way too
hot<00:06:55.789> on<00:06:55.969> your<00:06:56.150> cameras<00:06:56.479> vu<00:06:56.810> meters<00:06:57.169> go<00:06:57.860> into

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:58.099 
hot on your cameras vu meters go into

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.059 
hot on your cameras vu meters go into
the<00:06:58.189> AF<00:06:58.490> out<00:06:58.729> on<00:06:58.969> your<00:06:59.180> receiver<00:06:59.479> and<00:07:00.069> bring

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
the AF out on your receiver and bring

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:03.070 
the AF out on your receiver and bring
the<00:07:01.219> levels<00:07:01.550> down<00:07:01.819> to<00:07:02.180> something<00:07:02.840> like

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
the levels down to something like

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.899 
the levels down to something like
negative<00:07:03.560> 30<00:07:03.800> so<00:07:04.129> right<00:07:04.310> now<00:07:04.400> I<00:07:04.460> have<00:07:04.550> it<00:07:04.729> at

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
negative 30 so right now I have it at

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.489 
negative 30 so right now I have it at
negative<00:07:05.300> 30<00:07:05.569> and<00:07:05.719> this<00:07:05.840> seems<00:07:06.020> to<00:07:06.139> be<00:07:06.259> a<00:07:06.289> good

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:06.499 
negative 30 and this seems to be a good

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:08.950 
negative 30 and this seems to be a good
match<00:07:06.879> another<00:07:07.879> trick<00:07:08.210> that<00:07:08.240> I<00:07:08.389> like<00:07:08.569> to<00:07:08.689> do<00:07:08.810> is

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:08.960 
match another trick that I like to do is

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.719 
match another trick that I like to do is
I<00:07:09.050> like<00:07:09.229> to<00:07:09.259> change<00:07:09.560> the<00:07:09.770> balance<00:07:09.949> I<00:07:10.340> like<00:07:10.610> to

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:10.729 
I like to change the balance I like to

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.589 
I like to change the balance I like to
bring<00:07:10.909> the<00:07:11.169> balance<00:07:12.169> a<00:07:12.710> little<00:07:13.639> bit<00:07:13.789> down<00:07:14.210> so

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 
bring the balance a little bit down so

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.050 
bring the balance a little bit down so
what<00:07:14.870> you<00:07:15.020> have<00:07:15.229> is<00:07:15.589> one<00:07:16.400> side<00:07:16.639> a<00:07:16.669> little<00:07:16.849> bit

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
what you have is one side a little bit

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.029 
what you have is one side a little bit
lower<00:07:17.240> than<00:07:17.360> the<00:07:17.509> other<00:07:17.629> so<00:07:18.560> this<00:07:18.710> way<00:07:18.889> if

00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 
lower than the other so this way if
