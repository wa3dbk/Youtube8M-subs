00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.220
 6 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.660
 the illusion of needs 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.189
 what do you want peace 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.249
 you can only find it by forgiving completely 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.020
 nobody learns 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.740
 unless you want to learn and believe that you need it somehow 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.859
 although in the creation of God there are no shortages 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.519
 is what you have made is very evident 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.989
 in fact that is the fundamental difference between the one and the other 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.399
 the idea of ​​lack implies that you think you would be better off in a state than 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.220
 somehow it was different 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.360
 from the one in which this time you are 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.960
 before the separation that is the same what is the meaning of the fall 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.190
 nothing was lacking 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.580
 there was no need is of any kind 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.740
 the needs arise due only here you 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.200
 you deprive yourself 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.340
 you act according to the particular order of needs that you yourself 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.140
 you set 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.580
 this in turn 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.110
 depends on the perception that their 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.110
 of what is not 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.030
 the only lack you really need to correct 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.730
 These feelings of being separate from God 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 that feeling of separation 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 never would have arisen if you had not distorted your perception of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 true 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.070
 perceiving you like that to yourself as someone in need 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.950
 the idea of ​​an order of needs 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.360
 it arose because having committed that fundamental error 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 you have already fragmented into levels 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.290
 that behave different is viver needs 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.190
 As you integrate, you become 1 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 and your needs therefore become a 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.330
 When needs are unified, they lead to unified action 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
 because it eliminates all conflict 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.200
 the idea of ​​an order of needs 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.390
 that comes from the final round that one can be separated from God 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.719
 requires correction at its own level 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.049
 before the error of perceiving levels can be corrected 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.349
 you can not behave effectively while operating at different levels 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.150
 however while flowers 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.150
 the correction must proceed vertically 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.329
 from the bottom up 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.219
 this is because you think you live in space 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.510
 where concepts like 'up and down' 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.259
 makes sense 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:37.919
 ultimately 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.389
 neither space nor time 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.559
 they make no sense 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.559
 both are merely beliefs 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.739
 the true purpose of this world 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.590
 is to use it to correct 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.590
 disbelief 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.269
 you can never control for yourself the effects of fear 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.449
 because fear is your own invention 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.449
 and you can not if you do not believe in what you have invented 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.409
 in attitudes, although not in content 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:14.919
 you are like your creator 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.700
 who has perfect faith in his creations 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.369
 because he created them 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.409
 believing in something produces the separation of its existence 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:27.719
 that's why you can believe that what nobody else thinks is true 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:29.919
 for you it is true 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.919
 because you do not manufacture this 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.439
 all aspects of fear are false 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.079
 because they do not exist at the creative level 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.579
 and therefore 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.579
 they do not exist at all 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:50.439
 to the extent that you are willing to submit your beliefs to this test 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.229
 in that same measure your perceptions will be corrected 

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:59.349
 in the process of separating it from the true 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.349
 the miracle proceeds according to the following 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:09.069
 perfect love expels fear 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.499
 if there is fear 

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:13.499
 is that there is no perfect love 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.849
 only perfect love exists 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:18.979
 if there is fear 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.979
 it produces a state that does not exist 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.180
 you believe and you will be free 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.879
 only god can establish this solution 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.749
 and these people 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:32.329
 your goal
