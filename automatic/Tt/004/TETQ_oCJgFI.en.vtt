welcome to NCIX tech tips folks in front

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.749 
welcome to NCIX tech tips folks in front
of<00:00:03.240> me<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:03.689> see<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.200> bunch<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.859> drives<00:00:05.370> we've

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
of me you see a bunch of drives we've

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.639 
of me you see a bunch of drives we've
got<00:00:05.940> some<00:00:06.120> hard<00:00:06.330> drives<00:00:06.569> we've<00:00:06.839> got<00:00:06.960> some<00:00:07.109> SSDs

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
got some hard drives we've got some SSDs

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.890 
got some hard drives we've got some SSDs
they<00:00:08.280> all<00:00:08.460> have<00:00:08.730> something<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.269> common

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
they all have something in common

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.880 
they all have something in common
these<00:00:10.620> are<00:00:10.769> RMA<00:00:11.190> slips<00:00:11.519> they're<00:00:11.910> all<00:00:12.030> dead

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890 
these are RMA slips they're all dead

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.280 
these are RMA slips they're all dead

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.770 

so<00:00:19.220> why<00:00:19.400> do<00:00:19.460> we<00:00:19.640> have<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.850> bunch<00:00:20.060> of<00:00:20.180> dead<00:00:20.420> drives

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.780 
so why do we have a bunch of dead drives

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.360 
so why do we have a bunch of dead drives
here<00:00:21.140> well<00:00:21.350> this<00:00:21.800> is<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.010> bit<00:00:22.160> of<00:00:22.250> an

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
here well this is a bit of an

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.840 
here well this is a bit of an
educational<00:00:23.150> episode<00:00:23.630> on<00:00:23.900> how<00:00:24.520> devices<00:00:25.520> fail

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
educational episode on how devices fail

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.970 
educational episode on how devices fail
and<00:00:26.180> how<00:00:26.420> to<00:00:26.480> protect<00:00:26.990> yourself<00:00:27.380> from<00:00:27.439> it<00:00:27.770> and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
and how to protect yourself from it and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.790 
and how to protect yourself from it and
how<00:00:28.310> to<00:00:28.369> tell<00:00:28.790> when<00:00:29.570> they're<00:00:29.960> failing<00:00:30.320> so

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
how to tell when they're failing so

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.370 
how to tell when they're failing so
without<00:00:31.730> further<00:00:31.970> ado<00:00:32.360> solid<00:00:32.960> state<00:00:33.110> drives

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
without further ado solid state drives

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.990 
without further ado solid state drives
are<00:00:33.590> becoming<00:00:33.860> more<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:34.250> more<00:00:34.309> popular<00:00:34.580> their

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
price and low capacity are still

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.100 
price and low capacity are still
barriers<00:00:37.340> to<00:00:37.640> using<00:00:37.790> them<00:00:38.030> exclusively<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:38.900> if

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
barriers to using them exclusively so if

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.380 
barriers to using them exclusively so if
you<00:00:39.320> have<00:00:39.530> a<00:00:39.559> computer<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:40.309> probably<00:00:40.850> have<00:00:41.360> a

mechanical hard drive and all mechanical
devices<00:00:45.020> fail<00:00:45.830> it<00:00:46.160> is<00:00:46.220> simply<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.239> matter<00:00:47.540> of

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
devices fail it is simply a matter of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.840 
devices fail it is simply a matter of
when<00:00:47.989> with<00:00:48.199> that<00:00:48.440> said<00:00:48.770> it's<00:00:49.040> not<00:00:49.160> like<00:00:49.340> SSDs

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
when with that said it's not like SSDs

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.520 
when with that said it's not like SSDs
don't<00:00:50.150> fail<00:00:50.390> -<00:00:50.659> they<00:00:50.809> have<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:50.960> finite<00:00:51.500> number

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
don't fail - they have a finite number

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.799 
don't fail - they have a finite number
of<00:00:51.860> right<00:00:52.280> cycles<00:00:52.790> that<00:00:53.269> they<00:00:53.449> can<00:00:53.629> withstand

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
of right cycles that they can withstand

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.049 
of right cycles that they can withstand
before<00:00:54.229> they<00:00:54.589> eventually<00:00:54.739> die<00:00:55.309> but<00:00:55.820> hard

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
before they eventually die but hard

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.140 
before they eventually die but hard
drives<00:00:56.330> can<00:00:56.600> be<00:00:56.659> a<00:00:56.960> little<00:00:57.379> bit<00:00:57.530> less

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
drives can be a little bit less

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.670 
drives can be a little bit less
predictable<00:00:59.150> so<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.659> most<00:00:59.809> common<00:00:59.960> causes

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
predictable so the most common causes

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.399 
predictable so the most common causes
for<00:01:00.890> hard<00:01:01.190> drive<00:01:01.400> failure<00:01:01.760> are<00:01:02.000> heat<00:01:02.629> although

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
for hard drive failure are heat although

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.079 
for hard drive failure are heat although
this<00:01:03.650> has<00:01:03.860> been<00:01:04.040> hotly<00:01:04.370> debated<00:01:04.909> back<00:01:05.030> and

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
this has been hotly debated back and

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.840 
this has been hotly debated back and
forth<00:01:05.449> how<00:01:05.630> much<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.200> factor<00:01:06.409> it<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.220> bear

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
forth how much of a factor it is so bear

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.300 
forth how much of a factor it is so bear
that<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.180> mind<00:01:08.210> more<00:01:08.720> heat<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.260> is<00:01:09.320> from<00:01:09.740> WD<00:01:10.280> I

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
that in mind more heat this is from WD I

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.649 
that in mind more heat this is from WD I
talked<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.790> them<00:01:10.909> about<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.120> they<00:01:11.270> said<00:01:11.450> yes

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
talked to them about it they said yes

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.020 
talked to them about it they said yes
more<00:01:11.870> heat<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:12.140> bad<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:12.710> in<00:01:13.130> general<00:01:13.370> heat<00:01:13.880> is

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
more heat is bad so in general heat is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.030 
more heat is bad so in general heat is
not<00:01:14.210> good<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:14.450> your<00:01:14.690> hard<00:01:14.870> drive<00:01:15.080> physical

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
not good for your hard drive physical

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.130 
not good for your hard drive physical
trauma<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:16.729> terrible<00:01:17.420> for<00:01:17.600> hard<00:01:17.750> drives<00:01:17.990> if

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
trauma is terrible for hard drives if

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.390 
trauma is terrible for hard drives if
you've<00:01:18.260> ever<00:01:18.440> had<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.680> portable<00:01:19.040> hard<00:01:19.310> drive

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
you've ever had a portable hard drive

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.340 
you've ever had a portable hard drive
and<00:01:19.790> when<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.330> put<00:01:20.479> it<00:01:20.570> in<00:01:20.659> your<00:01:20.750> pocket<00:01:21.229> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
and when to put it in your pocket and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.780 
and when to put it in your pocket and
dropped<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:21.799> on<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.920> ground<00:01:22.070> there's<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.520> good

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
dropped it on the ground there's a good

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.060 
dropped it on the ground there's a good
chance<00:01:23.120> that<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:23.960> dead<00:01:24.230> at<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.500> point<00:01:24.560> and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
chance that it is dead at that point and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.910 
chance that it is dead at that point and
then<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.550> course<00:01:25.880> general<00:01:26.840> wear<00:01:27.230> and<00:01:27.440> tear<00:01:27.680> so

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
then of course general wear and tear so

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.150 
then of course general wear and tear so
time<00:01:28.280> is<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:29.150> last<00:01:29.390> major<00:01:29.900> factor<00:01:30.500> for<00:01:30.710> hard

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
time is the last major factor for hard

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.550 
time is the last major factor for hard
drive<00:01:31.430> failure<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.630> how<00:01:32.780> do<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.020> know<00:01:33.290> when

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
drive failure so how do you know when

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.140 
drive failure so how do you know when
your<00:01:33.680> hard<00:01:33.830> drives<00:01:34.040> gonna<00:01:34.250> fail<00:01:34.490> hopefully

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
your hard drives gonna fail hopefully

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.390 
your hard drives gonna fail hopefully
your<00:01:35.570> drive<00:01:35.810> fails<00:01:36.110> gradually<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.190> an

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
your drive fails gradually this is an

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.040 
your drive fails gradually this is an
advantage<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.150> hard<00:01:38.330> drive<00:01:38.540> side<00:01:38.810> where<00:01:39.020> a

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
advantage on the hard drive side where a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.140 
advantage on the hard drive side where a
lot<00:01:39.290> of<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.530> time<00:01:39.740> they<00:01:40.340> will<00:01:40.580> start<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:40.970> give

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
lot of the time they will start to give

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.960 
lot of the time they will start to give
you<00:01:41.330> signs<00:01:41.870> and<00:01:42.260> symptoms<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.340> you<00:01:43.430> can<00:01:43.730> have<00:01:43.940> a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
you signs and symptoms so you can have a

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.730 
you signs and symptoms so you can have a
chance<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.450> go<00:01:44.570> oh<00:01:44.600> no<00:01:44.990> that's<00:01:45.230> probably

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
chance to go oh no that's probably

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
that that can crop up is if you have an

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.850 
that that can crop up is if you have an

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
difference but with something like a

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.060 
difference but with something like a
razor<00:04:53.780> blade<00:04:54.050> where<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.440> chassis<00:04:54.920> is

some of the heat that kind of thing

some of the heat that kind of thing
could<00:04:58.670> come<00:04:58.910> in<00:04:59.060> very<00:04:59.450> very<00:04:59.720> handy<00:05:00.760> okay<00:05:01.760> so

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
could come in very very handy okay so

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.600 
could come in very very handy okay so
theoretically<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:03.410> most<00:05:03.710> power<00:05:03.980> is<00:05:04.190> consumed
