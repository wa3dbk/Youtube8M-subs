thing about you can notice there's a big

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.850 
thing about you can notice there's a big
change<00:00:10.679> since<00:00:11.010> last<00:00:11.280> time<00:00:11.610> probably<00:00:12.110> or<00:00:13.110> since

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
change since last time probably or since

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.390 
change since last time probably or since
the<00:00:14.009> beginning<00:00:14.780> this<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.049> nearly<00:00:16.619> three<00:00:17.100> years

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
the beginning this is nearly three years

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.939 
the beginning this is nearly three years
without<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.730> cut<00:00:20.090> stallion<00:00:21.090> look<00:00:21.300> pretty<00:00:21.570> long

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
without a cut stallion look pretty long

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.340 
without a cut stallion look pretty long
and<00:00:23.150> for<00:00:24.150> everyone<00:00:24.449> else<00:00:24.630> up<00:00:24.840> there<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:25.140> just

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
and for everyone else up there I just

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.019 
and for everyone else up there I just
thought<00:00:25.710> I'd<00:00:25.859> throw<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.490> there<00:00:26.519> as<00:00:26.880> it's

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
thought I'd throw it up there as it's

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.060 
thought I'd throw it up there as it's
been<00:00:27.269> approached<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.960> me<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.349> maybe<00:00:28.949> I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
been approached to me that maybe I

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.880 
been approached to me that maybe I
should<00:00:29.279> do<00:00:29.400> some<00:00:29.609> video<00:00:29.849> blogging<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.890> if

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
I don't know that I can think of many

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.590 
I don't know that I can think of many
things<00:00:47.309> off<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> top<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.030> head<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.420> not

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
things off the top of my head I'm not

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.880 
things off the top of my head I'm not
one<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> those<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:50.510> does<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.930> video<00:00:52.500> for

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
one of those that just does a video for

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.200 
one of those that just does a video for
the<00:00:52.980> sake<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.489> need<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> purpose<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:55.010> so

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
the sake of it I need a purpose to it so

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.459 
the sake of it I need a purpose to it so
if<00:00:57.210> anyone<00:00:57.570> wants<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:58.140> guitar

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
if anyone wants to see more guitar

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.250 
if anyone wants to see more guitar
playing<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.160> try<00:00:59.609> practicing<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:01.079> more

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
playing I can try practicing some more

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.689 
playing I can try practicing some more
stuff<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:02.070> what<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.250> come<00:01:02.370> up<00:01:02.550> with

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
stuff and see what I can come up with

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.850 
stuff and see what I can come up with
and<00:01:04.280> other<00:01:05.280> than<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.810> no<00:01:06.810> much<00:01:07.080> new<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and other than that no much new to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.289 
and other than that no much new to
reports<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:09.140> guess<00:01:10.520> that's<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> best<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.060> do

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
reports I guess that's the best I can do

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:35.980 
reports I guess that's the best I can do
is<00:01:12.479> show<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.619> massive<00:01:14.040> length

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.370 

and<00:01:36.530> as<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:36.770> can<00:01:36.890> see<00:01:36.950> it's<00:01:37.340> not<00:01:38.180> as<00:01:38.390> greasy<00:01:39.049> or

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
and as you can see it's not as greasy or

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.810 
and as you can see it's not as greasy or
wet<00:01:40.310> looking<00:01:41.180> because<00:01:41.799> this<00:01:42.799> time<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.490> has

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
wet looking because this time it has

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.710 
wet looking because this time it has
dried<00:01:44.330> properly<00:01:44.690> since<00:01:46.030> getting<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.240> wet<00:01:47.450> but

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
dried properly since getting a wet but

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.749 
dried properly since getting a wet but
my<00:01:48.200> last<00:01:48.440> video<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.950> probably<00:01:49.400> more<00:01:49.610> on<00:01:49.670> the

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
my last video is probably more on the

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.249 
my last video is probably more on the
premises<00:01:50.300> that<00:01:50.479> I<00:01:50.509> thought<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.020> wet<00:01:51.229> hair

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
premises that I thought the wet hair

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.620 
premises that I thought the wet hair
would<00:01:51.680> show<00:01:52.640> more<00:01:52.850> what<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.150> length<00:01:53.390> was

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
would show more what the length was

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.080 
would show more what the length was
because<00:01:54.259> as<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:54.650> can<00:01:54.770> see<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:55.070> do<00:01:55.250> have<00:01:55.369> an

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
because as you can see I do have an

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.440 
because as you can see I do have an
effect<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.630> curl<00:01:56.840> at<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.140> bottom<00:01:57.440> so<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:59.119> will

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
effect to curl at the bottom so it will

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
effect to curl at the bottom so it will
be<00:01:59.690> deceptive<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.479> probably<00:02:02.479> looks<00:02:02.720> longer

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
be deceptive and probably looks longer

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.060 
be deceptive and probably looks longer
when<00:02:04.009> it's<00:02:04.159> not<00:02:04.340> actually<00:02:04.640> killing<00:02:05.119> so<00:02:06.070> that

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
when it's not actually killing so that

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.410 
when it's not actually killing so that
was<00:02:07.250> one<00:02:07.490> reason<00:02:07.670> why<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:07.970> was<00:02:08.119> wet<00:02:09.100> otherwise

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
was one reason why it was wet otherwise

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.759 
was one reason why it was wet otherwise
it's<00:02:11.420> not<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.050> bad<00:02:16.209> and<00:02:17.209> that's<00:02:17.390> about<00:02:17.870> all<00:02:18.050> so

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
it's not so bad and that's about all so

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.640 
it's not so bad and that's about all so
take<00:02:19.610> care
