very<00:00:29.490> simple<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.390> take<00:00:30.539> any<00:00:30.720> time

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
very simple and they don't take any time

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.959

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.240 
to show you so I decided to put them all
in<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.390> one<00:00:33.690> video<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.320> since<00:00:34.950> they're<00:00:35.130> all

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so that's very very simple I've had a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.840
