00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.940
 Briefing session on new technology that car maker Mazda will put to practical use in the future 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:06.000
 opened 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 Automakers also make hybrid and electric cars 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.309
 While focusing on the development of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.809
 What Mazda announced 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.129
 It is a gasoline engine that has been greatly improved 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.130
 After subsidy for feeling of resistance is over 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.090
 Konaka Mazda of car sales was equipped with this engine 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.269
 Achieves low fuel consumption of 30 kg per liter of small salmon 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 It is a policy to aim for a return 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.320
 Here 9 people 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.130
 It is a conventional gasoline engine but its fuel consumption is 30 kg / liter 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 And have been improved to taste like a hybrid car 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.770
 It was held in Tokyo today 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.570
 Briefing session on new technology of Mazda 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.470
 In a series of new technologies named Skymark 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.810
 But the new engine was the most watched 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.540
 The biggest point of fuel efficiency improvement is compression of air mixed with gasoline 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 It has been enhanced to the wide end 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.380
 New engines with high compression ratio have more pistons than conventional ones 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.610
 Down to the bottom 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 Inhale air mixed with a lot of gasoline 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.970
 By compressing it and burning it at once, combustion efficiency was improved 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
 is 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.350
 Realized because raising the compression ratio causes problems such as abnormal combustion 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.300
 It was said that it was impossible 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
 Practical application after six years of research 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.370
 It went to the place called British Prime Minister 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.120
 Ranked 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.160
 If you clean it, you will get power too. 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.840
 Very like this concept of being cut 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.440
 There is no watermark in Magnum, but I will pursue thoroughly 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.500
 I think it is an outcome 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.380
 Manabu Matsuda 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.850
 It is announced that this engine will also be equipped with a small model 242 in the first half of next year 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.090
 I made it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.300
 While keeping the price at the same level as before 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.810
 Increase sales by increasing up to 30 kg per liter per year 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 Wish 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.329
 In the future, the body etc. will be improved and the vehicle will be separated by approximately 100 kilometers 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:17.579
 Weight saving 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.579
 We will further improve fuel efficiency 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.089
 Instead of hybrid and electric cars 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:30.089
 It is summer to put power 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:31.649
 The background is 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:35.589
 Gasoline will continue to be the mainstream of the world for the next 10 years 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.589
 It is a view that 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.649
 In the fast-growing emerging country history 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.259
 Low price gasoline engine compared to hybrid vehicles 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.719
 But 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.489
 An eye that is advantageous 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.109
 If low fuel consumption is achieved, it will be possible to compete in developed countries. 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.829
 Because how much is the hybrid 7th or less base 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.059
 In that sense that base coined word of internal combustion engine 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:03.489
 It will be the first step ahead to improve firmly 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.739
 This unfolds to riding 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.739
 It was a result of impersonation 

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:10.890
 At first 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.670
 Development of a hybrid vehicle following the procedure from Toyota 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.720
 It is recommended, but the new model announced this time over and over again 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.789
 It is an engine 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:21.309
 For a fuel-efficient engine 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.879
 Further improvement of fuel efficiency by combining the hybrid 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.319
 I'm going to
