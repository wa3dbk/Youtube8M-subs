00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.539
 do you play the ball 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.330
 easy to clean here pulzetti transfer 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.379
 penalty 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:11.379
 penalty shows referee 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.029
 hand question game all the fighters of the group in 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:14.919
 second time 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:16.519
 as long as today's match I remind you 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.359
 it was royce that failed to prevent the militia 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.409
 sending the ball head into the net 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.269
 at 20 we are a minute but now he plays 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.259
 hand and why it was done absolutely not 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.569
 it is clear yes there was a penalty but 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.040
 andrew array he probably would have prevented 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.540
 inter attacker 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.830
 dispose of the ball but so here is the penalty and 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.200
 this is a much more explicit chance to take 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 gate here interom 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.630
 she is ready to break through 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.070
 there is something guests have to talk to 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.860
 arbiter but the maximum that can survive 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.940
 this talk is a yellow card 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.940
 but they need 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.260
 four minutes played after the break 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 Samuel's penalty kick is about 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.730
 connection 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.770
 assists 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.140
 in the first half, scoring also adds 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.470
 ball scored 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 in the second 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.700
 fourth ball of the plane 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.130
 now championship attacks 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 very good indicator 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.410
 if you can watch 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.920
 13 goals scored last season 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.820
 ready 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.620
 There is such an assumption that in 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.390
 current season tons 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.860
 He can significantly raise the bar of his 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.420
 portable yourself 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.220
 we have an inter
