this to cook down a little bit more so
that<00:03:46.070> the<00:03:46.190> flavors<00:03:46.670> get<00:03:46.880> into<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.330> chicken

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
that the flavors get into the chicken

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.240 
that the flavors get into the chicken
right<00:03:50.360> now<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.720> can<00:03:50.990> see<00:03:51.200> how<00:03:51.560> our<00:03:51.590> chicken<00:03:52.130> is

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
right now you can see how our chicken is

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.800 
right now you can see how our chicken is
down<00:03:52.520> we're<00:03:52.730> gonna<00:03:52.790> turn<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.330> off

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
down we're gonna turn it off

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.140 
down we're gonna turn it off
and<00:03:54.080> see<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.440> sauce<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.370> why<00:03:55.760> it's<00:03:55.940> so

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
and see the sauce this is why it's so

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.330 
and see the sauce this is why it's so
good<00:03:56.360> for<00:03:56.420> pasta<00:03:57.110> that<00:03:57.230> just<00:03:57.470> makes<00:03:57.680> delicious

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
good for pasta that just makes delicious

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.940 
good for pasta that just makes delicious
on<00:03:58.700> pasta<00:03:59.270> so<00:04:00.110> we're<00:04:00.260> gonna<00:04:00.350> turn<00:04:00.650> our<00:04:00.830> stove

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
on pasta so we're gonna turn our stove

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.980 
on pasta so we're gonna turn our stove
off<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.460> we're<00:04:01.760> gonna<00:04:01.880> go<00:04:02.120> prepare<00:04:02.330> a<00:04:02.600> bread

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
off and we're gonna go prepare a bread

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.650 
off and we're gonna go prepare a bread
for<00:04:03.260> our<00:04:03.320> sandwiches<00:04:04.010> okay<00:04:04.640> this<00:04:05.270> is<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.540> way

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
for our sandwiches okay this is the way

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.190 
for our sandwiches okay this is the way
I<00:04:05.690> cut<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.260> bread<00:04:06.530> for<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:08.030> sandwiches<00:04:08.660> you

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
I cut the bread for the sandwiches you

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.490 
I cut the bread for the sandwiches you
can<00:04:09.350> just<00:04:09.650> cut<00:04:09.980> around<00:04:10.190> like<00:04:10.580> this<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:12.140> the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
can just cut around like this and the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.820 
can just cut around like this and the
reason<00:04:12.620> why<00:04:12.920> we<00:04:13.100> do<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:13.520> is<00:04:14.170> you'll<00:04:15.170> see<00:04:15.470> that

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
reason why we do this is you'll see that

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.110 
reason why we do this is you'll see that
it<00:04:16.340> keeps<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:17.030> bread<00:04:17.330> from<00:04:18.520> the<00:04:19.520> juices<00:04:19.940> from

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
it keeps the bread from the juices from

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.620 
it keeps the bread from the juices from
draining<00:04:20.510> into<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.710> bread<00:04:22.010> so<00:04:22.640> you<00:04:22.730> cut<00:04:23.480> it

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
draining into the bread so you cut it

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.310 
draining into the bread so you cut it
like<00:04:23.660> that<00:04:23.840> and<00:04:24.380> then<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.740> push<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:26.320> bread

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
like that and then you push the bread

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.750 
like that and then you push the bread
down<00:04:27.980> into<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.960> loaf<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.430> keeps<00:04:31.580> the

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
down into the loaf so that it keeps the

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.550 
down into the loaf so that it keeps the
juices<00:04:32.120> from<00:04:32.870> draining<00:04:33.520> below<00:04:34.520> your<00:04:36.460> sandwich

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
juices from draining below your sandwich

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.750 
juices from draining below your sandwich
okay<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.620> can<00:04:39.830> see<00:04:40.040> here<00:04:40.160> we<00:04:40.430> made<00:04:40.730> our
