 palace if he disappears at some point 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.660

 Lost game, can you? 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.350
 This fight for ipca 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.789
 button intelligence many people 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.129
 ipconnection knows a lot about the character 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.460

 It was only a little how I go. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.439

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.720
 How is it on the ship of the chapter that he 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.420
 is there in caruaru pe lonely want 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.580
 words use here you will reach him 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 like stone but maybe at the same time 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.579
 this part of the pike is of his power is the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.520
 pee name or I'm wrong to absorb 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.740
 stone will be that time when you hit 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.630
 in it with rafael whole castle 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.299
 Are you just a little hurt? 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.880
 because, come on, let's face it. 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.590
 Castle where he designs his head in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 Stone form and it hits the head 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.829
 his 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.560
 I think it hits the head and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.930
 does the effect of type one kn 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.970
 head trauma in one he broke 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 some stones from that castle I think 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.969
 that to defeat pica in this condition that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 He is like a castle, he has to put the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.579
 castle down below and today I'm here 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.930
 grace of the cup reign of d help but not 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.969
 I know now how you think 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.770
 this is going to happen is it will only have 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.400
 who attracted pica in a way that he did not 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.800
 may more is this castle fuse 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.720
 because making it easier to exit 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.640
 is to take the old palace but I think 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.920
 This is not going to happen, not now. 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.750
 business fucking average box to be rock 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.060
 cutting galleon that the sun was already there and 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.970
 soap and around the place to meet 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 But that's it folks, I leave the question 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.410
 for you how will the user 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.750
 do to fight against the enemy is that 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.150
 is not a swordsman is a very enemy 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.530
 peculiar way he faced me 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.980
 I think it's a legal challenge for osorio 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.280
 and we'll see how our parents did. 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.470
