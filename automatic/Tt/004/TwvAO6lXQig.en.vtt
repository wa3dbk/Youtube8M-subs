00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
in preparation for shoeing the farrier

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.789 
in preparation for shoeing the farrier
must<00:00:03.149> first<00:00:03.449> trim<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> hoof<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.259> remove<00:00:04.560> any

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799

the same way as our fingernails do they

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.570 
the same way as our fingernails do they
also<00:00:09.660> need<00:00:10.050> trimming<00:00:10.349> frequently<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.219> prevent
