 more neighbors

 and I'm sure it will be a party as we have had it 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 there are many opportunities of coconuco corroborates that every day very 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.380
 early 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.140
 since five in the morning they are 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.540
 training 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.740
 iii christmas 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 with their behavior they show others that they are made 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.879
 how will it be thing already with cloth inspections 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.270
 it does not make it very simple to do such an innovative thing because 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.929
 that the whole country can 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.019
 when finding through a page a web page that usually double-double 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:26.009
 42k lime 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.139
 at least 42 k 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.849
 and through that 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.789
 the fire was recorded electronically do not not require to come 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.369
 iy that can be done through that system there was very modern and a couple of 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:40.449
 days before to see 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.379
 the distribution in the south where 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.889
 of the shirts 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.189
 mikel affirms díaz is implementing for these races 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.549
 we as a community are also coordinating with other districts 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.969
 that was not an easy path in our district in that community to see the 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.129
 issue of safety and operation of universities all facilities for 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.729
 that really is a pleasure towards satisfaction that is a work 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.200
 platform really of order and respect for others because the fact of 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:08.599
 that people have decided physics you did not want 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:09.959
 let's invade too 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.289
 you're 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:14.579
 privacy or the tranquility of our neighbors and that we are taking 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.999
 All the sizes 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.839
 it is possible we already have experience are seven years doing 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:22.089
 this purpose of taking public space and here there are thousands of people 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.519
 that this group to the environmental management for their health do activity 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.709
 physical we fought against him there was tobacco and against this lifestyle 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.139
 modern because this the future city 10 the real concept that I think today 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.349
 from Sudan and we do have bulls but does not take out allows you two minutes to 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.650
 talk with grapefruit adidas manager 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.510
 beautiful and I'm leaving the monk at the same 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.480
 politics - 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.429
 percent and we already know that those that are organized through the website 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:48.439
 that's why the awards you can deny 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.760
 also good constraints there is a video in the Egyptian not with intent to pique 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.349
 enter what is a whole team 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.209
 of objective competition this a cute polo pole and technology that offer to 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.829
 place in 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.969
 in the hand not good another color and other textile technology is expected to deliver to 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.619
 all the participants there is no vision armenteros manu we have a series 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:11.040
 of office adore for this great event as each one can make delivery of 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.249
 certain things 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.729
 private not decade marcano 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.449
 i have the experience there is no source claimed that it is the first time 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.129
 wealth says that in Peru 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.570
 minorities have completed 40 years of career left 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.410
 between the kilometers the good thing of this competition axis that we are arias is 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.410
 cutting with everything the international certification 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.860
 if it is that this race is going to have the certification of iaaf and the street 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.400
 the Belgian association 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.410
 of marathons and races of international instances, Bolocco will allow 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.550
 despite all that they are in the athletes 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.620
 not the power with these times to qualify for tournaments are the marathons 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.449
 of the world 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.440
 thank you very much for the help of the managers 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.350
 of the company 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.050
 there he is mayor 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.290
 tell me mayor before fleeing from continuing with this topic yesterday newspaper 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.699
 changes in the regulation of 

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:02.629
 the encyclopedia 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.520
 js background with you quique it seems some speak to you 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.789
 that could be generated by corruption when raising the scope of the fine 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:11.380
 well we do not have for the police 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.380
 emery attending that night possession to the best 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.650
 they believe that from that moment on that reason people are going to lend more to 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.960
 not met by the high 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.099
 that always I think the opposite I think that it is necessary to put order 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.339
 and in that we have to compromise everyone I'm sure the police 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:29.610
 will play a role 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.919
 truly exemplary and their commitment 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.249
 for what 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:34.990
 is really punished 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.860
 this road insecurity 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.370
 that is also a product of the lack of clear sanctions, there is no more dirty here 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.090
 education can take a long time when it was made to politics to 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.560
 seatbelt people complied because the sanction was clear and concrete 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.520
 so I rather think it has to do a crusade so that that probable 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.150
 corruption I do not know and it will depend a lot on us that we too 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.210
 we do not get critical printing authorship but also commit and try 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.509
 monitor and supervise is to catch the PSOE does not accept maybe some kind of 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.169
 police car requirement and 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.510
 and it has happened many arrived at cavenez are watching the transmission 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.740
 the one that has passed a policeman has asked for something 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.389
 how to avoid that, how to create awareness in both the population and the force 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.180
 it depends on you punishing the corrupting element crap up when you do not 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.910
 he says is not that I'm just innocent because the authorship is suddenly and that 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.340
 the east is corrupt 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.139
 well you have to put the corrupt prisoners who also implicitly 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.430
 the authority to this crime I believe 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.650
 and we are always with a shipment violated 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.139
 worried about seeing how we killed the biologist and we forgot about child 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:37.680
 I notice raised that potentially being a rapist I think here close to the 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.970
 At the same time, what responsibility does the citizenry have and 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.319
 what happens to him is not possible that also people 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:48.789
 go a dangerously dangerous place ie9 jewels willing to be robbed not 

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:52.289
 There's a need for me to be robbed soon and my house but that first one that I hired 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.580
 a staff that nobody knows and does not know if it's a brand that really 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.220
 assigned follow-up one takes precautions in taking care of oneself there is no need 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.059
 blame others for what is most responsible for all of us and 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:06.349
 many spelling mistakes Alberto alberto tejada arielito with this 

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.630
 group d but lan since then they live 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.050
