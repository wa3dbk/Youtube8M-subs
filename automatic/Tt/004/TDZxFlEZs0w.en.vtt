this<00:00:00.840> here<00:00:01.050> is<00:00:01.290> the<00:00:01.859> revamped<00:00:02.520> loss<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.570> space

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
this here is the revamped loss of space

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.829 
this here is the revamped loss of space
second<00:00:04.319> season<00:00:04.680> laser<00:00:05.250> pistol<00:00:05.730> what<00:00:06.660> we've

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
second season laser pistol what we've

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.870 
second season laser pistol what we've
done<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.290> basically<00:00:07.319> at<00:00:08.040> least<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.490> we've

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
done is basically at least is we've

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.390 
done is basically at least is we've
taken<00:00:09.350> to<00:00:10.350> the<00:00:10.440> lunar<00:00:10.740> models<00:00:11.130> which<00:00:11.250> is

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
taken to the lunar models which is

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.570 
taken to the lunar models which is
totally<00:00:11.940> inaccurate<00:00:12.300> for<00:00:12.600> that<00:00:12.900> time<00:00:13.490> but<00:00:14.490> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
totally inaccurate for that time but it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.610 
totally inaccurate for that time but it
was<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.700> good<00:00:14.820> problem<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.290> the<00:00:16.410> only

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
was a good problem this is the only

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.790 
was a good problem this is the only
thing<00:00:17.180> that<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.300> lunar<00:00:18.510> models<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.140> now<00:00:19.260> it

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
thing that is lunar models for now it

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.800 
thing that is lunar models for now it
starts<00:00:20.190> out<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.960> like<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.400> piece<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.550> crap

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
starts out like like this piece of crap

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.160 
starts out like like this piece of crap
when<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.900> goes<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:26.190> this<00:00:26.780> and<00:00:27.780> then

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
when it goes in to this and then

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.930 
when it goes in to this and then
eventually<00:00:28.260> we're<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.699> ribs

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
eventually we're going to take the ribs

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.479 
eventually we're going to take the ribs
off<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:31.020> redo<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> ribs<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.800> for<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:32.099> we

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
off and redo the ribs but for now we

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.550 
off and redo the ribs but for now we
started<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.140> and<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.230> ribs

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
started with this and these ribs

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.260 
started with this and these ribs
actually<00:00:34.950> should<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.310> be<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.640> much<00:00:35.790> global<00:00:36.000> as

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
actually should not be so much global as

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.030 
actually should not be so much global as
it<00:00:36.420> should<00:00:36.540> be<00:00:36.630> flat<00:00:36.930> piece<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.680> started

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
it should be flat piece of started

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.600 
it should be flat piece of started
stripper<00:00:38.399> styrene<00:00:39.110> this<00:00:40.110> piece<00:00:40.380> here<00:00:40.649> was

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
stripper styrene this piece here was

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.950 
stripper styrene this piece here was
completely<00:00:42.560> redone<00:00:43.730> if<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.910> recall<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.690> my

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
completely redone if you recall on my

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
completely redone if you recall on my
other<00:00:46.110> video<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.800> on<00:00:46.920> YouTube<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
other video which is on YouTube I have a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
other video which is on YouTube I have a
lunar<00:00:48.270> models<00:00:48.690> on<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.320> did<00:00:49.470> for<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
lunar models on it which I we did for a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.880 
lunar models on it which I we did for a
customer<00:00:50.100> these<00:00:51.090> came<00:00:51.840> down<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.440> rested<00:00:52.800> on

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
customer these came down and rested on

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.950 
customer these came down and rested on
these<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:54.329> totally<00:00:54.750> inaccurate

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
these up here that's totally inaccurate

the handle was totally redone and you
can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:04.339> as<00:01:05.339> he<00:01:05.369> curves<00:01:05.819> in<00:01:06.590> here<00:01:07.590> this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
can see as he curves in here this is a

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.889 
can see as he curves in here this is a
lunar<00:01:08.609> models<00:01:09.060> handle<00:01:11.630> didn't<00:01:12.630> see<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
lunar models handle didn't see it

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.080 
lunar models handle didn't see it
doesn't<00:01:13.829> matter<00:01:14.100> okay<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:16.740> has<00:01:17.670> light<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
doesn't matter okay this has light and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260 
doesn't matter okay this has light and
sound<00:01:18.479> effects<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.759> what<00:01:20.759> we've<00:01:20.880> done<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
sound effects and what we've done is

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.199 
sound effects and what we've done is
we've<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.590> try<00:01:22.889> replicate<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.579> as<00:01:23.909> best

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
we've got we try replicate this as best

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.690 
we've got we try replicate this as best
we<00:01:24.270> could<00:01:24.569> and<00:01:24.829> buy<00:01:25.829> store-bought<00:01:26.069> material

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
we could and buy store-bought material

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.179 
we could and buy store-bought material
this<00:01:27.209> is<00:01:27.359> actually<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.749> metal<00:01:28.229> rod<00:01:28.709> in<00:01:28.950> here

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this is actually a metal rod in here

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.069 
this is actually a metal rod in here
it's<00:01:29.429> all<00:01:29.549> serrated<00:01:30.029> it's<00:01:30.450> metal

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
it's all serrated it's metal

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.980 
it's all serrated it's metal
it's<00:01:31.649> reinforced<00:01:32.340> with<00:01:32.459> a<00:01:32.490> brass<00:01:32.819> rod<00:01:33.179> which

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
it's reinforced with a brass rod which

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.440 
it's reinforced with a brass rod which
follows<00:01:34.409> through<00:01:34.679> through<00:01:35.609> here<00:01:35.789> so<00:01:36.329> it's

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
follows through through here so it's

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.099 
follows through through here so it's
pretty<00:01:36.599> sturdy<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.770> trigger<00:01:38.069> was<00:01:38.369> also

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
pretty sturdy the trigger was also

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.199 
pretty sturdy the trigger was also
replicated<00:01:40.109> we<00:01:40.829> replicated<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.549> look<00:01:41.969> more

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
replicated we replicated to look more

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.959 
replicated we replicated to look more
like<00:01:42.389> the<00:01:42.539> original<00:01:43.279> you<00:01:44.279> pick<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.639> up<00:01:44.819> and

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
like the original you pick this up and

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.679 
like the original you pick this up and
show<00:01:45.029> you<00:01:45.179> how<00:01:45.569> I<00:01:45.929> put<00:01:46.529> my<00:01:46.679> hand<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.069> here<00:01:47.689> you

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
show you how I put my hand in here you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.419 
show you how I put my hand in here you
watch<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.049> videos<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.799> should<00:01:50.039> come<00:01:50.189> down<00:01:50.219> a

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
watch the videos it should come down a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:51.019 
watch the videos it should come down a
little<00:01:50.609> bit

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:51.029 
little bit

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:55.730 
little bit
they<00:01:51.569> have<00:01:51.749> little<00:01:52.049> models<00:01:53.569> nothing<00:01:54.569> okay

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
they have little models nothing okay

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.499 
they have little models nothing okay
here<00:01:56.489> is<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.849> the<00:01:56.939> improvements<00:01:57.419> we<00:01:57.479> made

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
here is one of the improvements we made

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.779 
here is one of the improvements we made
this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.989> the<00:01:58.020> first<00:01:58.349> run<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.859> had<00:01:59.069> for<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
this is the first run we had for the

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.940 
this is the first run we had for the
acrylic<00:02:00.029> tip<00:02:00.419> that's<00:02:01.020> pretty<00:02:01.289> accurate<00:02:01.770> but

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
acrylic tip that's pretty accurate but

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.010 
acrylic tip that's pretty accurate but
actually<00:02:02.520> looking<00:02:02.789> upon<00:02:03.060> I'll<00:02:03.749> show<00:02:03.959> you

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
actually looking upon I'll show you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.910 
actually looking upon I'll show you

laser<00:02:13.840> pistol<00:02:14.350> problems<00:02:15.150> okay<00:02:16.150> I'm<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.390> lathe

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
laser pistol problems okay I'm a lathe

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.400 
laser pistol problems okay I'm a lathe
on<00:02:17.070> want<00:02:18.070> you<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> look<00:02:18.370> at<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:19.110> let's<00:02:20.110> see<00:02:20.290> it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
on want you to look at it let's see it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.770 
on want you to look at it let's see it
what<00:02:21.070> we<00:02:21.190> tried<00:02:21.460> to<00:02:21.490> do<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:22.030> make<00:02:22.270> this<00:02:22.480> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
what we tried to do is make this the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.990 
what we tried to do is make this the
next<00:02:23.020> generation<00:02:23.500> this<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.760> will<00:02:24.970> be

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
next generation this this this will be

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.670 
next generation this this this will be
redone<00:02:25.480> eventually<00:02:25.930> with<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.260> thing<00:02:26.470> being

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
redone eventually with this thing being

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.230 
redone eventually with this thing being
more<00:02:26.950> accurate<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.430> little<00:02:27.610> bit<00:02:27.700> shorter<00:02:28.060> here

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
more accurate a little bit shorter here

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.740 
more accurate a little bit shorter here
but<00:02:29.080> look<00:02:29.350> at<00:02:29.560> it

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
but look at it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.140 
but look at it
nothing<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.870> lunar<00:02:32.110> models<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.880> pretty

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
nothing like lunar models it's pretty

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.170 
nothing like lunar models it's pretty
accurate<00:02:34.300> but<00:02:34.810> what<00:02:34.900> we<00:02:34.990> did<00:02:35.200> was<00:02:35.230> -<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:37.000> had<00:02:37.150> a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
accurate but what we did was - we had a

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.000 
accurate but what we did was - we had a
light<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.630> sound<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.290> because<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
light and sound but because of the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.070 
light and sound but because of the
configuration<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.880> body<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.660> speaker

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
configuration of the body the speaker

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.290 
configuration of the body the speaker
lies<00:02:41.650> back<00:02:41.980> here<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> very<00:02:42.610> small<00:02:42.850> speaker

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
lies back here it's a very small speaker

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.700 
lies back here it's a very small speaker
you're<00:02:43.450> not<00:02:43.600> gonna<00:02:43.750> get<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:43.990> lot<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.290> sound<00:02:44.440> out

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
you're not gonna get a lot of sound out

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.950 
you're not gonna get a lot of sound out
of<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:44.860> even<00:02:45.130> though<00:02:45.220> it's<00:02:45.370> hollow<00:02:45.960> all

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960 
of this even though it's hollow all

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.740 
of this even though it's hollow all
right<00:02:47.140> take<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.280> sound<00:02:48.550> put<00:02:49.480> lightning

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
right take it the sound put lightning

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.680 
right take it the sound put lightning
here<00:02:50.110> let<00:02:50.410> me<00:02:50.500> turn<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.830> off<00:02:51.040> real<00:02:51.280> quick

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
here let me turn this off real quick

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
know anything about lots of space I'm

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.520 
know anything about lots of space I'm
hoping<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.150> do<00:03:19.300> you're<00:03:19.510> gonna<00:03:19.630> know<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:20.380> is

hoping you do you're gonna know this is

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.949 
hoping you do you're gonna know this is
very<00:03:20.560> accurate<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:21.670> very<00:03:21.970> accurate<00:03:22.120> like

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
very accurate this is very accurate like

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.690 
very accurate this is very accurate like
I<00:03:22.989> said<00:03:23.200> all<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.590> was<00:03:23.800> machined<00:03:24.220> right<00:03:24.459> here

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
I said all this was machined right here

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.660 
I said all this was machined right here
from<00:03:24.970> foam<00:03:25.709> these<00:03:26.709> two<00:03:26.920> pieces<00:03:27.160> were<00:03:27.400> machine

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
from foam these two pieces were machine

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.220 
from foam these two pieces were machine
from<00:03:27.850> foam<00:03:28.030> we'll<00:03:28.300> be<00:03:28.390> working<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:28.780> later<00:03:29.020> on

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
from foam we'll be working this later on

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.350 
from foam we'll be working this later on
but<00:03:29.440> as<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:29.680> can<00:03:29.800> see<00:03:30.040> it's<00:03:30.790> really<00:03:31.150> different

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
but as you can see it's really different

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.740 
but as you can see it's really different
from<00:03:31.570> literal<00:03:31.870> models<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:33.280> if<00:03:34.239> like<00:03:34.480> I<00:03:34.540> said

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
from literal models and if like I said

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.860 
from literal models and if like I said
again<00:03:34.840> if<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.260> check<00:03:35.620> out<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.980> picture

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
again if you just check out the picture

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.770 
again if you just check out the picture
you'll<00:03:37.870> see<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.620> thickness<00:03:38.920> right<00:03:39.370> here

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
you'll see the thickness right here

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.090 
you'll see the thickness right here
Robley<00:03:40.780> thickness<00:03:41.260> lunar<00:03:41.560> models<00:03:41.950> had<00:03:42.070> a

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
Robley thickness lunar models had a

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.520 
Robley thickness lunar models had a
little<00:03:42.430> eighth<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.150> an<00:03:43.270> inch<00:03:43.360> one<00:03:43.630> there<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
little eighth of an inch one there the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.380 
little eighth of an inch one there the
ribs<00:03:44.800> weren't<00:03:45.130> right<00:03:45.340> like<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:45.940> said<00:03:46.270> again

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
ribs weren't right like I said again

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.310 
ribs weren't right like I said again
this<00:03:47.320> was<00:03:47.500> all<00:03:47.709> machine<00:03:48.130> from<00:03:48.459> foam<00:03:49.320> casks

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
this was all machine from foam casks

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.500 
this was all machine from foam casks
from<00:03:50.440> foam<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:52.000> give<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.300> the<00:03:52.390> nice

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
from foam to give you the nice

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.110 
from foam to give you the nice
indentations<00:03:53.380> right<00:03:53.620> here<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
indentations right here the

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.000 
indentations right here the
follow-through<00:03:55.620> nice<00:03:56.620> oval<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.550> long<00:03:57.850> curve

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
follow-through nice oval the long curve

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.060 
follow-through nice oval the long curve
okay<00:04:00.010> hope<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.940> enjoy<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.709> let<00:04:02.709> me<00:04:02.800> know<00:04:02.920> what
