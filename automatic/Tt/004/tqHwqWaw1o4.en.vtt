all right this is a budget tricopter

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.579 
all right this is a budget tricopter
build<00:00:05.250> I'll<00:00:06.120> spend<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:06.690> how<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:06.899> built<00:00:07.379> it

build I'll spend to you how I built it

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.589 
build I'll spend to you how I built it
and<00:00:07.880> what's<00:00:08.880> going<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.240> with<00:00:09.420> it

and what's going on with it
after<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.080> fly<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.440> because<00:00:10.740> most<00:00:10.980> people<00:00:11.160> just

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
after I fly it because most people just

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:28.300 
after I fly it because most people just
apply<00:00:11.700> so<00:00:12.080> here<00:00:13.080> we<00:00:13.170> go

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:01:08.680 

Oh

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:31.270 

got<00:01:09.690> extremely<00:01:10.110> good<00:01:10.320> vertical<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:10.920> go

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.670 

my<00:01:32.280> heart<00:01:32.490> come<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.850> those<00:01:33.409> alright<00:01:34.409> so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
my heart come out of those alright so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:02:11.210 
my heart come out of those alright so
that's<00:01:35.100> how<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> flies<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:37.100> steady

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.910 

okay<00:02:13.080> here<00:02:14.430> what<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.490> get<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.910> RC<00:02:16.420> explores

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
okay here what we get is RC explores

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.020 
okay here what we get is RC explores
awesome<00:02:17.920> design<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.230> did<00:02:20.530> was<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.520> enlarged

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
awesome design what I did was I enlarged

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.230 
awesome design what I did was I enlarged
the<00:02:22.450> plate<00:02:22.720> bigger<00:02:23.650> than<00:02:23.920> his<00:02:24.100> design<00:02:24.460> so<00:02:25.210> I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
the plate bigger than his design so I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.110 
the plate bigger than his design so I
could<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.690> my<00:02:26.020> board<00:02:26.290> here<00:02:26.380> my<00:02:27.340> battery<00:02:27.760> here

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
could have my board here my battery here

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.030 
could have my board here my battery here
I<00:02:28.300> have<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> place<00:02:29.230> for<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.500> battery<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:29.950> the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
I have a place for the battery on the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.890 
I have a place for the battery on the
back<00:02:31.710> kind<00:02:32.710> of<00:02:32.800> stretches<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:34.300> then<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
back kind of stretches and then the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930 
back kind of stretches and then the
video<00:02:35.140> camera<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.560> go<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.710> front<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.670> camera

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
video camera can go up front the camera

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.250 
video camera can go up front the camera
where<00:02:37.030> actually<00:02:37.240> are<00:02:37.420> here<00:02:37.720> can<00:02:37.870> go<00:02:37.990> up<00:02:38.050> front

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
where actually are here can go up front

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.660 
where actually are here can go up front
that<00:02:38.380> go<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.740> back<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.130> kind<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.310> bounces

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
that go on the back and kind of bounces

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.940 
that go on the back and kind of bounces
all<00:02:39.820> back<00:02:40.000> out<00:02:41.280> arms<00:02:42.280> do<00:02:42.430> fold<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.800> easy

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
all back out arms do fold so it's easy

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.010 
all back out arms do fold so it's easy
to<00:02:45.040> transport<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:48.030> servo<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.480> back<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
to transport the servo in the back is

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.330 
to transport the servo in the back is
the<00:02:50.140> most<00:02:50.260> rudimentary<00:02:50.620> thing<00:02:51.130> you'll<00:02:51.250> ever

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
the most rudimentary thing you'll ever

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.420 
the most rudimentary thing you'll ever
see<00:02:51.490> I<00:02:51.730> literally<00:02:52.240> took<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:53.410> piece<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.890> this<00:02:54.130> cut

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
see I literally took a piece of this cut

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.540 
see I literally took a piece of this cut
in<00:02:54.520> three<00:02:54.700> pieces<00:02:54.910> glued<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.780> together<00:02:55.900> and

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
in three pieces glued it together and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.770 
in three pieces glued it together and
then<00:02:57.550> mount<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.030> motor<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.450> drilled<00:02:58.720> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
then mount the motor and I drilled a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.199 
then mount the motor and I drilled a
hole<00:02:58.810> through<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.260> crooked<00:02:59.910> into<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.000> back

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
hole through it crooked into the back

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.740 
hole through it crooked into the back
crooked<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.410> it's<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.730> sheetrock<00:03:04.240> screw

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
crooked and it's just a sheetrock screw

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.190 
crooked and it's just a sheetrock screw
and<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:07.150> know<00:03:07.270> it's<00:03:07.420> tightened<00:03:07.750> up<00:03:07.810> until<00:03:08.110> it

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
and you know it's tightened up until it

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.080 
and you know it's tightened up until it
becomes<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.890> you<00:03:09.280> know<00:03:09.400> where<00:03:09.580> you<00:03:09.640> can<00:03:09.760> turn<00:03:09.970> it

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
becomes a you know where you can turn it

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.150 
becomes a you know where you can turn it
but<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.270> doesn't<00:03:10.510> have<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> slot<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:11.950> for

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
but it doesn't have a slot and then for

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.130 
but it doesn't have a slot and then for
control<00:03:12.489> mechanism<00:03:13.090> again<00:03:13.390> very<00:03:13.660> very<00:03:13.720> very

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
control mechanism again very very very

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.910 
control mechanism again very very very
very<00:03:14.260> simple

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
very simple

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.320 
very simple
I<00:03:14.950> took<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.260> control<00:03:17.590> rod<00:03:17.800> cleaveth<00:03:18.730> did

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
I took a just a control rod cleaveth did

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.660 
I took a just a control rod cleaveth did
a<00:03:19.360> 90<00:03:19.660> degree<00:03:19.900> Bend<00:03:20.110> on<00:03:20.320> it<00:03:20.500> shot<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> hole

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
a 90 degree Bend on it shot a hole

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.280 
a 90 degree Bend on it shot a hole
through<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.450> again<00:03:22.720> you'll<00:03:22.870> notice<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.260> put

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
through it and again you'll notice I put

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.100 
through it and again you'll notice I put
it<00:03:23.530> through<00:03:23.730> crooked<00:03:24.730> because<00:03:25.600> that's<00:03:26.019> just

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
it through crooked because that's just

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.580 
it through crooked because that's just
what<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.320> do

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
what I do

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.870 
what I do
and<00:03:27.690> that's<00:03:28.690> your<00:03:28.810> whole<00:03:28.989> mechanism<00:03:29.880> let's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
and that's your whole mechanism let's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.120 
and that's your whole mechanism let's
turn<00:03:31.150> that<00:03:31.269> up<00:03:31.420> there<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.780> couple<00:03:32.350> zip<00:03:32.620> ties<00:03:32.890> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
turn that up there a couple zip ties the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.650 
turn that up there a couple zip ties the
other<00:03:33.310> thing<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.670> helps<00:03:33.970> as<00:03:34.090> we<00:03:34.209> zip<00:03:34.450> time

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
other thing that helps as we zip time

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.080 
other thing that helps as we zip time
the<00:03:34.840> motors<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:36.430> built<00:03:36.640> this<00:03:36.730> last<00:03:36.940> night

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
the motors I just built this last night

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.370 
the motors I just built this last night
so<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.300> having<00:03:37.480> trimmed<00:03:37.780> all<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:37.930> stuff<00:03:38.140> off

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
so I having trimmed all this stuff off

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.860 
so I having trimmed all this stuff off
you<00:03:39.280> zip<00:03:39.489> tie<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.670> motor<00:03:39.910> straight<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.330> it's

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
you zip tie the motor straight on it's

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.630 
you zip tie the motor straight on it's
getting<00:03:41.110> tight<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.739> have<00:03:41.800> a<00:03:41.980> rack<00:03:42.190> hopefully

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
getting tight you have a rack hopefully

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.840 
getting tight you have a rack hopefully
it'll<00:03:42.730> bust<00:03:42.910> loose<00:03:44.400> other<00:03:45.400> nice<00:03:45.610> thing<00:03:45.820> about

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
it'll bust loose other nice thing about

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.790 
it'll bust loose other nice thing about
this<00:03:46.090> build<00:03:46.269> as<00:03:46.420> you're<00:03:46.540> using<00:03:46.690> GWS<00:03:47.350> eight<00:03:47.500> for

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
this build as you're using GWS eight for

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.690 
this build as you're using GWS eight for
