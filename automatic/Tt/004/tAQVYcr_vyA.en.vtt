00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.880
 yes 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.559
 Peru from the beginning of his life 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.469
 Republican has established relationships 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.699
 bilateral with several sovereign states 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.670
 with which he has laid bridges 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.760
 intended to complement its development 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.400
 economic social cultural or security 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.890
 among others, they have been able to improve 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.189
 our abilities to preserve the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.990
 sovereignty and national integrity the 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.020
 progress of other countries in terms of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.440
 defense has helped us to progress 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.720
 in aspects such as education doctrine and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.900
 as well as military training 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.430
 our own industry for defense 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.560
 the establishment of relationships 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.680
 bilateral agreements in the field of defense 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:52.500
 is not limited to a neighborhood criterion or 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.380
 regional but global where also 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.510
 of the development of the countries also 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.480
 takes into account the asymmetry and the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.000
 mutual benefit relations with the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.970
 French republic go back to the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.619
 pre-war era with chile 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.259
 Both Francisco Bolognesi and Andrés 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.000
 avelino cáceres fulfilled missions to 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.940
 the purchase of weapons 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.220
 artillery pieces in that country results 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.870
 obvious that relationships with this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.570
 country have at least 150 years also 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.200
 we must emphasize that in the last 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.350
 decades 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.140
 for example the mirage aircraft were 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.580
 acquired by Peru in the decade of 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.340
 60 and 80 in the second in the first 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.020
 government of the president of the sin 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.290
 they acquired the first mirage aircraft 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.300
 and in the second government of the president 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.700
 from the sinks aircraft were bought 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.440
 mirage 2000 process that was varied 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.450
 during the first government of the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.229
 President Garcia with the well-known 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.720
 reduction of them in your second 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.210
 government the president garcía destined 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.090
 more than 420 million soles in 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.280
 acquisitions to French companies 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.700
 made for the air force likewise 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.070
 between 2006 and 2011 he did what 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.440
 own for the navy gunsight by 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.500
 an amount of approximately 20 million 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.810
 soles in conclusion both relationships 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.060
 as the use of 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.690
 and by French for our forces 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.240
 armed have decades of existence 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.850
 about the relationship with Korea in the field 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.850
 of the defense it should be noted that in 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.220
 years 2009 and 2011 the government of 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.770
 President Garcia acquired the government 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.740
 Korean tactical transport medium and 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.810
 assault and reconnaissance vehicles 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.750
 including the process for the acquisition 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.910
 of the planes that 1p started in 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.190
 the second government of the former president 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.710
 Garcia that later our 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.870
 government has concluded incorporating the 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.320
 coproduction the transfer 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.440
 technological and offset linking 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.200
 with korea therefore it is recent but 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.360
 is advantageous for both countries reason why 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.940
 which there is now an alliance 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.460
 strategic that increases the relationship 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.550
 military with greater cooperation in the 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.820
 field of training and education 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.740
 for our officers , however, 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.560
 are the French Republic or the 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.630
 republic of korea the countries to which 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.530
 more military equipment has been purchased 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.530
 next question
