00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.429
 good afternoon to all the good people in this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.029
 video i want to talk about on the eaves 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.830
 which we apply our practice to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.760
 making furniture and on some 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.779
 other things well, like a piece 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.990
 the cornice that I left was like 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.329
 such a notion is first made pay 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.600
 attention this cornice goes for the kitchen 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.379
 This part of it goes to the kitchen 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 means the profile corner was made with 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.660
 using a special cutter then done 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.760
 This is what they call her under the eaves to me. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.420
 here I painted over but since the length 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.270
 was over 3 meters then i need 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.930
 was to solve the issue of stiffness and mounting 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.469
 top kitchen cabinet due to here 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.199
 this one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.870
 boards I made a plane which 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.450
 fastened by a kitchen box at the expense of here 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.020
 this groove and thorn 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.119
 on a cornice ki I solved the question 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.670
 stiffness because such a connection 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.920
 first she does not require any screws 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.590
 authorities and so on secondly this 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.619
 the corner becomes hard in itself and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.540
 does not bend in one and the other side well and 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.880
 curly pad itself directly 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.500
 the eaves which went on under the eaves q 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.720
 fastened also without connections from above 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.299
 some nails with hands he strengthened 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.280
 so here on the screws that we 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.229
 twisted back and glue and if 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.320
 you want to save these screws can be 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.090
 unscrew after gluing unfortunately 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.189
 our 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.320
 miter cut saw takes height 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.439
 only up to 10 centimeters and me 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.329
 you have to make a cornice 10 centimeters 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.240
 no more so that I could tie it under 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.490
 angle and so on of course have those 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 who have 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.500
 miter saw then example makita or 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.070
 boron with a large disk whose height 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.429
 soaking higher 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.280
 can do cornice and above since 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.660
 we had a kitchen by request 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.400
 relatively simple I'm nothing here 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.480
 milling like this left slightly 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.750
 littered the edges 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.510
 but you can mill the profile here 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:25.140
 similar to this we call them these 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.740
 pros to pupik for example in order to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:32.100
 it was more beautiful in this case 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.890
 this is a cornice on the window but he did a little 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.830
 slightly different principle here this one 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:43.980
 Shtapik curly on the bed itself under the eaves 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.350
 to and eaves but the eaves are already charging on 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.570
 finished construction i.e. here is the height 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.800
 did not play a role and so here we have 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:56.760
 14 centimeters high I want to say that 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.500
 can be combined and make eaves 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.750
 big massive 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.239
 wider board with a profile on it 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.820
 more narrowly and so on it all depends on 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.880
 your imagination and desire to surprise 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.650
 customer and of course your 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.090
 creative inspiration thank you for
