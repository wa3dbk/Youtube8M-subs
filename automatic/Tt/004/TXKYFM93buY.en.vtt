completely<00:01:54.569> intuitive<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.590> steers<00:01:56.130> by

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
completely intuitive it steers by

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
completely intuitive it steers by
turning<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.909> fork<00:01:57.209> even<00:01:57.689> though<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.959> wheel

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
turning the fork even though the wheel

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.919 
turning the fork even though the wheel
doesn't<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.740> an<00:01:58.860> impact<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.459> the<00:01:59.610> steering

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
doesn't have an impact on the steering

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.240 
doesn't have an impact on the steering
the<00:02:00.929> other<00:02:01.049> thing<00:02:01.289> is<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> has<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> regular

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
twist grip throttle like a motorcycle it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.160
