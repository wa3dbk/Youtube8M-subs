and the various components to it and the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.209 
and the various components to it and the
idea<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> every<00:00:45.780> story<00:00:46.140> needs<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.559> hero<00:00:46.829> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
idea that every story needs a hero and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.250 
idea that every story needs a hero and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
every story needs supporting action when

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.529 
every story needs supporting action when
you<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.950> about<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.760> proportion

there<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:53.850> heroes<00:00:54.149> but<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> story<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> very

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
there are heroes but the story is very

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.020 
there are heroes but the story is very
dull<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.860> fact<00:00:56.100> its<00:00:56.280> lifeless<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.910> may<00:00:57.000> not

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
dull in fact its lifeless and may not

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.139 
dull in fact its lifeless and may not
even<00:00:57.300> exist<00:00:57.480> without<00:00:58.230> hero<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.190> we<00:00:59.969> were
