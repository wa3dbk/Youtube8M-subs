survive jun 26 2015 this is going to be

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.970 
survive jun 26 2015 this is going to be
a<00:00:04.950> very<00:00:05.220> quick<00:00:05.520> video<00:00:05.839> but<00:00:06.839> it's<00:00:07.259> awesome

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
a very quick video but it's awesome

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.589 
a very quick video but it's awesome
because<00:00:08.099> you<00:00:08.670> know<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.880> didn't<00:00:09.330> even<00:00:09.480> think

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
because you know I didn't even think

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.610 
because you know I didn't even think
about<00:00:09.719> until<00:00:09.990> recently<00:00:10.469> but<00:00:11.719> meteors<00:00:12.719> meteor

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
about until recently but meteors meteor

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.589 
about until recently but meteors meteor
showers<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.330> different<00:00:15.330> times<00:00:15.480> in

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
showers that we have different times in

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.820 
showers that we have different times in
a<00:00:15.660> year<00:00:15.690> depending<00:00:15.900> on<00:00:16.199> what<00:00:16.350> comment<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.800> was

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
a year depending on what comment it was

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.529 
a year depending on what comment it was
it<00:00:17.070> came<00:00:17.220> by<00:00:17.400> that's<00:00:17.640> what<00:00:17.789> usually<00:00:17.940> causes

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
it came by that's what usually causes

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.470 
it came by that's what usually causes
the<00:00:18.869> meteors<00:00:19.230> are<00:00:19.640> these<00:00:20.640> little<00:00:20.850> particles

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
the meteors are these little particles

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.160 
the meteors are these little particles
that<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:22.020> hanging<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.590> space<00:00:22.740> after<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
that are out hanging in space after the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.830 
that are out hanging in space after the
path<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.849> B<00:00:26.849> comment<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.420> or<00:00:27.510> whatever

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
path of the B comment what or whatever

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
path of the B comment what or whatever
the<00:00:27.960> path<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.769> comet<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.939> leaves

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the path that the comet was it leaves

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.139 
the path that the comet was it leaves
behind<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:31.219> these<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:32.489> debris<00:00:32.759> things

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
behind the these little debris things

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.299 
behind the these little debris things
you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:33.989> they<00:00:34.140> range<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> different<00:00:34.829> sizes

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you know they range a different sizes

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.760 
you know they range a different sizes
size<00:00:35.489> tells<00:00:35.880> us<00:00:36.090> from<00:00:36.329> very<00:00:36.960> miniscule<00:00:37.590> all

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
size tells us from very miniscule all

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.709 
size tells us from very miniscule all
the<00:00:37.860> way<00:00:37.950> up<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.239> well<00:00:39.239> I'll<00:00:39.329> probably<00:00:39.480> no<00:00:39.690> more

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the way up to well I'll probably no more

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.680 
the way up to well I'll probably no more
than<00:00:39.930> maybe<00:00:40.469> maybe<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.550> couple<00:00:41.850> feet<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.390> even

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
than maybe maybe a couple feet but even

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.450 
than maybe maybe a couple feet but even
that<00:00:42.840> better<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.469> something<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.219> burn

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
that better be something that can burn

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.650 
that better be something that can burn
up<00:00:44.610> otherwise<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> hit<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> earth

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
up otherwise it's going to hit the earth

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.860 
up otherwise it's going to hit the earth
probably<00:00:46.190> we've<00:00:47.190> seen<00:00:47.460> like<00:00:48.000> there's<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.780> don't

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
probably we've seen like there's I don't

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.270 
probably we've seen like there's I don't
know<00:00:49.079> they<00:00:49.320> really<00:00:49.649> weren't<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:49.980> why<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
know they really weren't that why the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.279 
know they really weren't that why the
one<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.820> came<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> exploded<00:00:52.079> over

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
one that came down and exploded over

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
one that came down and exploded over
Russia<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.399> size<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.879> was<00:00:54.210> actually

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
Russia the size of that was actually

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
Russia the size of that was actually
smaller<00:00:54.840> than<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.170> thought<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.440> would<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.190> if

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
smaller than I thought it would be so if

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.119 
smaller than I thought it would be so if
we<00:00:56.910> ever<00:00:57.030> did<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.690> these<00:00:57.780> huge

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
we ever did have one of these huge

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.760 
we ever did have one of these huge
meteorites<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.340> supposedly<00:01:00.289> the<00:01:01.289> size<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
meteorites it's supposedly the size of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.619 
meteorites it's supposedly the size of
two<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.039> three<00:01:02.219> school<00:01:02.820> buses<00:01:02.850> long<00:01:03.420> or

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
two or three school buses long or

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390 
two or three school buses long or
whatever<00:01:03.899> hit<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.110> earth<00:01:04.379> god<00:01:04.710> help<00:01:04.979> us<00:01:05.129> but

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
whatever hit the earth god help us but

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.880 
whatever hit the earth god help us but
anyway<00:01:05.840> we've<00:01:06.840> got<00:01:06.990> these<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.260> things<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
anyway we've got these little things so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.399 
anyway we've got these little things so
what<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> have<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:08.479> comet<00:01:09.479> Swift<00:01:09.780> causes

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
what you have here comet Swift causes

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.719 
what you have here comet Swift causes
these<00:01:11.689> perseid<00:01:12.689> meteor<00:01:13.290> showers<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.490> think

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
these perseid meteor showers and I think

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.880 
these perseid meteor showers and I think
that's<00:01:14.909> what<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.290> don't<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that's what is it I don't know what the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.640 
that's what is it I don't know what the
constellation<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> behind<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.659> but<00:01:19.380> they're

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
constellation is behind that but they're

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.200 
constellation is behind that but they're
usually<00:01:19.680> named<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.490> constellation

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
usually named for the constellation

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.179 
usually named for the constellation
where<00:01:21.659> they<00:01:21.869> appear<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.590> come<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
where they appear to come out of in the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.149 
where they appear to come out of in the
sky<00:01:23.549> every<00:01:24.509> year<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> geminids

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
sky every year I like the geminids

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
sky every year I like the geminids
meteor<00:01:26.220> showers<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.540> Gemini<00:01:27.960> constellation

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
meteor showers the Gemini constellation

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.050 
meteor showers the Gemini constellation
is<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.130> they're<00:01:29.310> named<00:01:29.490> after<00:01:29.640> because

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
is what they're named after because

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
is what they're named after because
every<00:01:30.270> year<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.659> look<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.020> constellation

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
every year you look in the constellation

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.960 
every year you look in the constellation
Gemini<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:32.369> where<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.610> shooting

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
Gemini and that's where these shooting

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179 
Gemini and that's where these shooting
stars<00:01:33.000> come<00:01:33.540> from<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:34.680> does<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> work

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
stars come from now how does that work

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
stars come from now how does that work
okay<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> comet<00:01:36.030> comes<00:01:36.180> by<00:01:36.479> zipping<00:01:36.930> by

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
okay the comet comes by zipping by

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.660 
okay the comet comes by zipping by
whatever<00:01:37.470> speed<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.369> there<00:01:38.520> pretty

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
whatever speed it is it's there pretty

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.999 
whatever speed it is it's there pretty
fast<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.840> see<00:01:40.020> its<00:01:40.290> orbit<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> much

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
fast as you can see its orbit is much

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.530 
fast as you can see its orbit is much
different<00:01:41.490> than<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> Earth's<00:01:41.970> orbit<00:01:42.450> around

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
different than the Earth's orbit around

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.350 
different than the Earth's orbit around
the<00:01:42.869> Sun<00:01:43.110> okay<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.979> much<00:01:44.220> different<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the Sun okay it's much different so

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.560 
the Sun okay it's much different so
let's<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.979> recap<00:01:46.979> here<00:01:47.570> these

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
let's do a little recap here these

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.179 
let's do a little recap here these
meteorites<00:01:48.930> here<00:01:49.409> these<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.770> pieces<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
meteorites here these little pieces and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.230 
meteorites here these little pieces and
stuff<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.780> come<00:01:51.780> by<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> comet<00:01:52.710> does<00:01:52.920> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
stuff they come by as the comet does and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.249 
stuff they come by as the comet does and
the<00:01:55.369> debris<00:01:56.369> trail<00:01:56.670> from<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> comet<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.780> what

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the debris trail from the comet is what

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
the debris trail from the comet is what
leaves<00:01:58.619> these<00:01:58.799> particles<00:01:59.310> behind<00:01:59.640> now<00:01:59.820> I'm

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
leaves these particles behind now I'm

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.310 
leaves these particles behind now I'm
sure<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.270> first<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.659> they're<00:02:00.810> moving<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
sure at first as they're moving with the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.490 
sure at first as they're moving with the
comet<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.520> they<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:03.170> some<00:02:04.170> sort<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
comet that they have some sort of

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.249 
comet that they have some sort of
forward<00:02:04.740> momentum<00:02:05.899> they're<00:02:06.899> definitely<00:02:07.079> not

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
forward momentum they're definitely not

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.210 
forward momentum they're definitely not
pulled<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.979> by<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.160> earth<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.759> least<00:02:10.009> not<00:02:11.009> too

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
pulled in by the earth at least not too

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
pulled in by the earth at least not too
many<00:02:11.569> otherwise<00:02:12.569> we'd<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:12.900> these<00:02:13.200> things

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
many otherwise we'd have these things

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.259 
many otherwise we'd have these things
coming<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.099> earth<00:02:14.219> all<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.579> time<00:02:14.790> correct

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
coming to the earth all the time correct

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.910 
coming to the earth all the time correct
so<00:02:15.480> even<00:02:16.140> though<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.319> earth<00:02:16.439> goes<00:02:16.680> through

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so even though the earth goes through

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.349 
so even though the earth goes through
the<00:02:17.010> path<00:02:17.219> these<00:02:17.549> things<00:02:17.819> have<00:02:18.030> their<00:02:18.060> they

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
the path these things have their they

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.839 
the path these things have their they
just<00:02:18.569> kind<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.810> hang<00:02:19.019> in<00:02:19.200> space<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.799> mean<00:02:20.549> look

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
just kind of hang in space I mean look

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.030 
just kind of hang in space I mean look
at<00:02:20.969> the<00:02:21.090> moon<00:02:21.239> we<00:02:21.359> go<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.629> moon<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.049> look

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
at the moon we go to the moon and look

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.399 
at the moon we go to the moon and look
how<00:02:23.159> big<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.519> moon<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.480> yet<00:02:24.719> the<00:02:24.930> gravity

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
how big the moon is and yet the gravity

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.110 
how big the moon is and yet the gravity
is<00:02:25.439> so<00:02:25.829> much<00:02:26.189> lower<00:02:26.400> than<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.090> earth

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
is so much lower than it is on the earth

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.679 
is so much lower than it is on the earth
and<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:29.430> course<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.909> know<00:02:30.000> astronauts<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.659> the

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
and of course you know astronauts in the

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.830 
and of course you know astronauts in the
ISS<00:02:31.340> they're<00:02:32.340> much<00:02:32.519> bigger<00:02:32.760> than<00:02:33.120> even<00:02:33.689> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
ISS they're much bigger than even the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.599 
ISS they're much bigger than even the
people<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.409> ISS<00:02:34.799> are<00:02:34.950> much<00:02:35.099> bigger<00:02:35.340> than

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:35.609 
people in the ISS are much bigger than

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.280 
people in the ISS are much bigger than
this<00:02:35.760> they<00:02:36.030> just<00:02:36.239> float<00:02:36.450> around<00:02:36.629> on<00:02:36.930> their<00:02:37.109> own

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
this they just float around on their own

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.410 
this they just float around on their own
all<00:02:38.129> right<00:02:38.340> they're<00:02:38.489> not<00:02:38.639> really<00:02:38.819> attracted

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
all right they're not really attracted

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
all right they're not really attracted
to<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.689> Sun<00:02:39.930> or<00:02:40.170> anything<00:02:40.469> else<00:02:40.650> it's<00:02:40.889> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
to the Sun or anything else it's just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.250 
to the Sun or anything else it's just
whether<00:02:41.219> this<00:02:41.430> path<00:02:41.670> is<00:02:41.969> and<00:02:42.389> of<00:02:42.719> course<00:02:42.959> we<00:02:43.109> go

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
whether this path is and of course we go

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.349 
whether this path is and of course we go
through<00:02:43.469> this<00:02:43.590> path<00:02:43.889> every<00:02:44.189> year<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.790> that's

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
through this path every year and that's

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.059 
through this path every year and that's
why<00:02:45.540> every<00:02:45.930> August<00:02:46.319> twelfth<00:02:46.530> now<00:02:46.769> we're<00:02:46.950> going

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
why every August twelfth now we're going

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.619 
why every August twelfth now we're going
to<00:02:47.129> have<00:02:47.250> these<00:02:47.370> meteor<00:02:47.700> showers<00:02:48.150> okay

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
to have these meteor showers okay

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.869 
to have these meteor showers okay
because<00:02:48.840> they<00:02:48.959> just<00:02:49.290> hang<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:49.650> we<00:02:50.459> come<00:02:50.730> back

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
because they just hang here we come back

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.039 
because they just hang here we come back
around<00:02:51.060> next<00:02:51.540> year<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.780> there<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:52.019> are

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
around next year and there they are

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.110 
around next year and there they are
again<00:02:52.260> that's<00:02:52.829> explanation<00:02:53.489> science<00:02:53.879> tells

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
again that's explanation science tells

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.770 
again that's explanation science tells
us<00:02:54.299> well<00:02:54.959> this<00:02:55.439> so<00:02:56.099> can<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.430> tell<00:02:56.669> how<00:02:57.359> fast<00:02:57.569> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
us well this so can we tell how fast the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.569 
us well this so can we tell how fast the
earth<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.139> moving<00:02:58.290> by<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.829> if<00:02:58.980> every<00:02:59.219> August

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
earth is moving by this if every August

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.479 
earth is moving by this if every August
twelfth<00:02:59.989> we<00:03:00.989> come<00:03:01.200> back<00:03:01.349> around<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.950> yes<00:03:02.280> we

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
twelfth we come back around this yes we

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.250 
twelfth we come back around this yes we
can<00:03:02.519> tell<00:03:02.819> absolutely<00:03:03.030> we<00:03:03.719> are<00:03:03.840> moving<00:03:03.959> at

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
can tell absolutely we are moving at

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.649 
can tell absolutely we are moving at
zero<00:03:04.500> miles<00:03:04.709> per<00:03:04.950> hour<00:03:05.239> how<00:03:06.239> do<00:03:06.299> I<00:03:06.419> know<00:03:06.540> this

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
zero miles per hour how do I know this

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.709 
zero miles per hour how do I know this
because<00:03:07.669> let's<00:03:08.669> see<00:03:08.819> what<00:03:08.909> science<00:03:09.299> says<00:03:09.329> see

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
because let's see what science says see

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.809 
because let's see what science says see
we<00:03:09.930> go<00:03:10.319> in<00:03:10.439> this<00:03:10.560> order<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:11.010> circular<00:03:11.430> orbit

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
we go in this order this circular orbit

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.599 
we go in this order this circular orbit
close<00:03:12.329> up<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.659> circular<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:14.370> Sun

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
close up the circular and the Sun

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.459 
close up the circular and the Sun
doesn't<00:03:15.060> just<00:03:15.480> sit<00:03:15.689> here<00:03:15.900> though<00:03:16.109> that's<00:03:16.349> the

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
doesn't just sit here though that's the

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.280 
doesn't just sit here though that's the
problem<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.639> Sun<00:03:17.940> moves<00:03:18.239> let's<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:18.780> say<00:03:18.959> it

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
problem the Sun moves let's just say it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.270 
problem the Sun moves let's just say it
doesn't<00:03:19.440> matter<00:03:19.650> what<00:03:19.709> direction<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.099> pick

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
doesn't matter what direction you pick

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.949 
doesn't matter what direction you pick
it<00:03:20.400> doesn't<00:03:20.729> matter<00:03:20.849> let's<00:03:21.419> just<00:03:21.629> pick<00:03:21.810> this

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
it doesn't matter let's just pick this

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.379 
it doesn't matter let's just pick this
direction<00:03:22.290> here<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.459> go<00:03:23.609> sort<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.970> opposite

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
direction here so we go sort of opposite

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.849 
direction here so we go sort of opposite
of<00:03:24.479> this<00:03:24.599> where<00:03:24.720> we<00:03:24.780> can<00:03:24.900> go<00:03:25.049> this<00:03:25.229> way<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.650> don't

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
of this where we can go this way I don't

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.770 
of this where we can go this way I don't
care<00:03:26.040> maybe<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.909> Sun<00:03:27.120> goes<00:03:27.299> through<00:03:27.479> the<00:03:27.569> belt

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
care maybe the Sun goes through the belt

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.219 
care maybe the Sun goes through the belt
too<00:03:27.959> huh<00:03:28.169> anyway<00:03:29.069> pick<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.579> direction<00:03:30.229> let's

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
too huh anyway pick a direction let's

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.409 
too huh anyway pick a direction let's
just<00:03:31.409> say<00:03:31.500> we're<00:03:31.620> heading<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:31.949> way<00:03:32.389> none<00:03:33.389> I

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
just say we're heading this way none I

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.000 
just say we're heading this way none I
can't<00:03:33.720> be<00:03:33.840> because<00:03:34.049> if<00:03:34.319> we<00:03:34.409> head<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.799> way

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
can't be because if we head this way

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.800 
can't be because if we head this way
we'd<00:03:35.220> actually<00:03:35.370> go<00:03:35.579> through<00:03:35.609> these<00:03:36.030> twice<00:03:36.419> in

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
we'd actually go through these twice in

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.750 
we'd actually go through these twice in
a<00:03:36.989> year<00:03:37.019> wouldn't<00:03:37.349> we<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.129> we<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.639> be

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
a year wouldn't we so we have to be

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.490 
a year wouldn't we so we have to be
heading<00:03:39.120> actually<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.079> opposite

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
heading actually in the opposite

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.839 
heading actually in the opposite
direction<00:03:40.650> that's<00:03:41.159> what<00:03:41.310> makes<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:41.579> funny

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
direction that's what makes it funny

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.270 
direction that's what makes it funny
because<00:03:42.000> no<00:03:42.180> matter<00:03:42.299> what<00:03:42.389> comes<00:03:43.349> in<00:03:43.680> we're

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
because no matter what comes in we're

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.890 
because no matter what comes in we're
always<00:03:44.459> heading<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.939> opposite<00:03:45.329> direction<00:03:45.479> so

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
always heading the opposite direction so

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.050 
always heading the opposite direction so
only<00:03:46.049> once<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.470> year<00:03:46.500> we<00:03:47.340> come<00:03:47.549> around<00:03:47.849> but

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
only once a year we come around but

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.670 
only once a year we come around but
here's<00:03:48.299> the<00:03:48.359> problem<00:03:48.540> again<00:03:49.139> these<00:03:49.349> things

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
here's the problem again these things

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.830 
here's the problem again these things
right<00:03:49.859> here<00:03:49.919> this<00:03:50.909> debris<00:03:51.180> path<00:03:51.479> they<00:03:51.659> just

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
right here this debris path they just

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.939 
right here this debris path they just
hang<00:03:52.049> here<00:03:52.079> there's<00:03:52.620> not<00:03:52.739> enough

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
hang here there's not enough

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.979 
hang here there's not enough
gravitational<00:03:53.489> attraction<00:03:54.150> between<00:03:54.479> them<00:03:54.810> in

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
gravitational attraction between them in

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.259 
gravitational attraction between them in
the<00:03:55.109> Sun<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.680> mean<00:03:56.370> maybe<00:03:56.489> they<00:03:56.699> start<00:03:57.000> drifting

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
the Sun I mean maybe they start drifting

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.999 
the Sun I mean maybe they start drifting
after<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> while<00:03:57.900> towards<00:03:58.409> the<00:03:58.590> Sun<00:03:58.799> or

00:03:58.999 --> 00:03:59.009 
after a while towards the Sun or

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.179 
after a while towards the Sun or
whatever<00:03:59.370> but<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.780> don't<00:04:01.560> think<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.769> happens

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
whatever but I don't think that happens

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.949 
whatever but I don't think that happens
either<00:04:02.340> because<00:04:02.729> the<00:04:02.879> Sun<00:04:03.060> is<00:04:03.090> moving<00:04:03.359> so<00:04:03.689> fast

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
either because the Sun is moving so fast

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.379 
either because the Sun is moving so fast
it's<00:04:04.919> moving<00:04:05.569> 483<00:04:06.569> thousand<00:04:07.259> miles<00:04:07.530> per<00:04:07.859> hour

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
it's moving 483 thousand miles per hour

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.939 
it's moving 483 thousand miles per hour
all<00:04:09.389> right<00:04:09.599> 483<00:04:10.470> thousand<00:04:11.099> miles<00:04:11.250> per<00:04:11.489> hour

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:12.949 
all right 483 thousand miles per hour

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.689 
all right 483 thousand miles per hour
how<00:04:13.949> fast<00:04:14.220> do<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.430> have<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.939> move<00:04:16.250> how<00:04:17.250> fast<00:04:17.549> do

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
how fast do we have to move how fast do

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.189 
how fast do we have to move how fast do
we<00:04:17.759> have<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.120> move<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:18.329> make<00:04:18.659> it<00:04:18.780> around<00:04:18.989> the

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
we have to move to make it around the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.009 
we have to move to make it around the
Milky<00:04:19.500> Way<00:04:19.739> in<00:04:19.979> one<00:04:20.250> galactic<00:04:20.729> year<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.840> a

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
Milky Way in one galactic year it's a

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.310 
Milky Way in one galactic year it's a
huge<00:04:22.440> circle<00:04:22.770> yes<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.639> very<00:04:23.880> huge<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.810> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
huge circle yes it is very huge and the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.170 
huge circle yes it is very huge and the
speed<00:04:25.590> with<00:04:25.800> which<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.979> Sun<00:04:26.370> has<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.700> move<00:04:26.880> is

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
speed with which the Sun has to move is

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.020 
speed with which the Sun has to move is
astounding<00:04:27.990> 483<00:04:28.860> thousand<00:04:29.340> miles<00:04:29.520> per<00:04:29.850> hour

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
astounding 483 thousand miles per hour

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.999 
astounding 483 thousand miles per hour
which<00:04:30.660> means<00:04:30.690> you're<00:04:31.169> moving<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.590> fast<00:04:31.770> too

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
which means you're moving that fast too

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.529 
which means you're moving that fast too
because<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.340> earth<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.820> dragged<00:04:33.120> with<00:04:33.360> it

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
because the earth to is dragged with it

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.700 
because the earth to is dragged with it
okay<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:35.460> earth<00:04:35.669> anchored<00:04:36.509> to<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.289> Sun<00:04:37.500> by

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
okay the earth anchored to the Sun by

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.390 
okay the earth anchored to the Sun by
gravity<00:04:38.539> follows<00:04:39.539> along<00:04:39.750> at<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.400> same

gravity follows along at the same

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.450 
gravity follows along at the same
fantastic<00:04:42.060> speed<00:04:42.979> and<00:04:43.979> you<00:04:44.070> know<00:04:44.190> what<00:04:44.310> I'm

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
fantastic speed and you know what I'm

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.640 
fantastic speed and you know what I'm

in<00:05:07.050> fact<00:05:07.229> I<00:05:07.320> might<00:05:07.470> have<00:05:07.620> to<00:05:07.710> go<00:05:07.800> look<00:05:08.070> at<00:05:08.130> this

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
in fact I might have to go look at this

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.249 
in fact I might have to go look at this

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
because I'm going to see what the total

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.260

other times of the year and these just
float<00:05:32.789> around<00:05:32.940> there<00:05:33.300> okay<00:05:33.990> they<00:05:34.199> don't<00:05:34.380> they

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
float around there okay they don't they

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
eight billion miles of a year now that's

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.300 
eight billion miles of a year now that's
wrong<00:06:11.580> it<00:06:11.820> was<00:06:11.940> 400<00:06:12.539> billion<00:06:12.870> miles<00:06:13.380> a<00:06:13.560> year

I'm<00:06:17.310> sorry<00:06:17.580> I<00:06:17.610> want<00:06:17.729> to<00:06:17.789> say<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:17.970> right<00:06:18.120> figure

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
I'm sorry I want to say the right figure

I'm sorry I want to say the right figure
4<00:06:18.960> billion<00:06:19.169> I<00:06:19.349> believe<00:06:19.530> we're<00:06:19.740> being<00:06:19.860> miles<00:06:20.699> a

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:20.909 
4 billion I believe we're being miles a

4 billion I believe we're being miles a
year<00:06:20.940> we<00:06:21.270> move<00:06:21.479> this<00:06:21.659> direction<00:06:22.050> this<00:06:22.889> thing

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
year we move this direction this thing

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.740 
year we move this direction this thing
hasn't<00:06:23.610> been<00:06:23.909> here<00:06:24.090> since<00:06:26.030> 1993<00:06:27.030> it<00:06:27.509> comes

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
hasn't been here since 1993 it comes

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.589 
hasn't been here since 1993 it comes
around<00:06:27.960> every<00:06:28.080> 133<00:06:28.770> years<00:06:29.280> so<00:06:29.909> since<00:06:30.270> nineteen

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
around every 133 years so since nineteen

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.450 
around every 133 years so since nineteen
thirty-three<00:06:30.960> when<00:06:31.289> this<00:06:31.409> actually<00:06:32.009> happened

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
thirty-three when this actually happened

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.629 
thirty-three when this actually happened
according<00:06:32.699> to<00:06:32.970> this<00:06:33.090> model<00:06:34.159> we<00:06:35.159> have<00:06:35.190> moved

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639 
according to this model we have moved

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.999 
according to this model we have moved
are<00:06:36.000> you<00:06:36.120> ready<00:06:36.330> for<00:06:36.570> this<00:06:36.690> we<00:06:37.260> have<00:06:37.469> moved

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
are you ready for this we have moved

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.070 
are you ready for this we have moved
eighty<00:06:39.159> eight<00:06:39.339> billion<00:06:40.029> miles<00:06:40.539> in<00:06:40.930> this

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
eighty eight billion miles in this

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.679 
eighty eight billion miles in this
direction<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:42.400> this<00:06:43.089> thing<00:06:43.300> doesn't<00:06:43.599> come

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 
direction and this thing doesn't come

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.820 
direction and this thing doesn't come
back<00:06:43.839> again<00:06:44.020> until<00:06:44.619> 21<00:06:45.039> 26<00:06:45.610> and<00:06:46.349> yet<00:06:47.349> we're<00:06:47.589> to

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
back again until 21 26 and yet we're to

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.339 
back again until 21 26 and yet we're to
believe<00:06:47.949> every<00:06:48.610> year<00:06:48.639> we<00:06:49.330> come<00:06:49.360> around<00:06:49.839> here

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
believe every year we come around here

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.700 
believe every year we come around here
somehow<00:06:51.039> we<00:06:51.249> hit<00:06:51.699> the<00:06:51.849> same<00:06:52.089> spot<00:06:52.119> in<00:06:52.930> space

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
somehow we hit the same spot in space

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.920 
somehow we hit the same spot in space
even<00:06:54.039> though<00:06:54.849> these<00:06:55.119> things<00:06:55.419> are<00:06:55.539> not<00:06:55.689> moving

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
even though these things are not moving

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.129 
even though these things are not moving
okay<00:06:56.770> this<00:06:56.949> path<00:06:57.219> is<00:06:57.399> here<00:06:57.779> and<00:06:58.779> it's<00:06:58.899> what<00:06:59.050> the

00:06:59.129 --> 00:06:59.139 
okay this path is here and it's what the

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.320 
okay this path is here and it's what the
diagram<00:06:59.499> says<00:06:59.710> we<00:06:59.919> come<00:07:00.099> around<00:07:00.219> all<00:07:01.119> right

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
diagram says we come around all right

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.149 
diagram says we come around all right
now<00:07:01.779> we<00:07:01.839> don't<00:07:02.050> hit<00:07:02.259> it<00:07:02.379> down<00:07:02.529> here<00:07:02.889> because

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.159 
now we don't hit it down here because

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:04.920 
now we don't hit it down here because
this<00:07:03.610> is<00:07:03.789> actually<00:07:03.969> you're<00:07:04.389> not<00:07:04.419> looking<00:07:04.809> at

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
this is actually you're not looking at
