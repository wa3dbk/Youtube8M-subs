00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.150
 welcome musical academy we are 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.750
 back with more exercises to read 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.900
 sheet music with the piano keyboard up 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.240
 here we already saw the pattern with the key of sun 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.609
 or to the right hand 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.000
 Let's start to see the agenda with the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.610
 knife kraft in left hand 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:47.640
 Let's start with the notes it's sunny and there. 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:51.420
 there's sun there the line between these two 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.239
 nail dots is fa note below the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.789
 central 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.789
 right after the sun and over there 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.129
 this time with whom the numbers above 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.310
 notes to indicate which of the following 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.360
 move from one place and 51 nobody remembers 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.970
 What 's important is that you look at the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.650
 score and look at this keyboard only 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.540
 to confirm that you are doing 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.580
 correctly 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.600
 if you rely only on the keyboard do not train 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.600
 reading scores 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:58.760
