 forging Austrian tractors 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.019
 lindner has his model range in 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:14.820
 recently increased steadily 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.010
 while using the innovative windmill 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 90 reinforced again on the alpine 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 Customer circles you had with the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.280
 end of 2012 featured geotrac 134 ep 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.710
 another clientele in front of the 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.980
 mixed plant with grassland and also 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.539
 a few hectares of market crops for 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 the top model should not only 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:37.679
 lindner's reputation as a founder specialist 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.449
 but also on the 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.730
 make a good figure 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:44.579
 whether the successful traction has the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.760
 practical application and the dlg test center 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.129
 checked under the chic designed 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.159
 hood works a perkins four cylinder 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.249
 with 4.4 liters displacement perkins the 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.039
 means exhaust gas purification without scr resp 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.379
 adblue accordingly come one 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.879
 oxidation catalyst and its diesel 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.119
 particle filter for use 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.369
 the regeneration of the particle filter 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.710
 takes place automatically 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:15.119
 lindner gives the rating 98 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.700
 kilowatts respectively 133 ps at 2200 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.200
 turns per minute 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.049
 can work at the tap 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.430
 four-cylinder up to 8 kw or 11 ps 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.450
 additionally deliver 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.280
 according to the factory specification maximum 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.729
 560 newton meters over the crankshaft 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.439
 come 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.109
 that is not much for this 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.140
 Performance class in front of the PTO brake 

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:40.049
 the deg were even only 500 newton meters 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.700
 maximum torque at 1500 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.939
 measured revolutions per minute 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.100
 here we would have expected more 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.469
 speed remains of 4 111 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.200
 newtonmeter left over the calculated 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.740
 torque increase is thus 22 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.700
 percent of consumption at speed 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.679
 is 2 169 grams per kilowatt hour 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.649
 slightly above the class average 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.660
 maximum output of 2 158 grams per 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.160
 kilowatt hour about ten percent more 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.160
 even if you deny the competition 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.250
 adblue consumption on it expects 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.790
 the geotrac 124 could be consumed 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.100
 have been lowered by a good five percent 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.070
 the values ​​show a high level of work 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.000
 requested torques and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.420
 Power reserves are not 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.490
 specialty of the red tyrolean important 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.050
 when working the engine speed lets 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.020
 limit yourself to the top 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.750
 to save sprit of these can be far 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.620
 down to 1,800 revolutions per minute 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.340
 make use 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.840
 the performance drops noticeably below that 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.520
 in the gmx is the geotrac 134 ep round 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.130
 6 percent above the class average 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.530
 the animal 4i exhaust standard 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.270
 to work and mix with heavy ones 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.010
 Working the differences come on 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.870
 clearest during the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.850
 Tug at light to work and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.360
 At Zapf all work good to very 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.140
 good values ​​delivered we now come to 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.980
 gearbox zf supplies for the geotrac 134 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:16.100
 ep 1 4-speed power shift transmission with 32 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.320
 forward and 32 reverse go the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.239
 gears are easy to load 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.459
 switching stages work in warm 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.670
 Tug jerk-free thanks to a 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.530
 Clutch damage when changing the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.260
 groups do not necessarily have diffuse coupling 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.570
 occur at the back of the rocker arm 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.550
 there is a toggle button for the 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.640
 Change between fields and roads 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.739
 Group switching takes place after 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.230
 preselection via push button and clutch 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.230
 activity and is possible up to 8 km h 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.300
 good even with automated circuit 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.280
 The last switching stages can be considered as 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.220
 driver over steer thus manually 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.160
 intervene in the gear menu can be 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.170
 also specify whether instead of the full 4 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:04.700
 only three or two load stages 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.770
 to be switched automatically and 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.230
 there is a speed for the gear change 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.570
 matching function the walls circuit 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.160
 with shuttle lever left of the steering wheel 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.209
 the geotrac 134 ps standard installed 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.370
 the responsiveness of the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.390
 Change of direction can be in gear 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.270
 set the menu in five levels 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.669
 points collects the geotrac 134 ep 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.530
 The Zab fell outfit as standard 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.520
 the tug has four 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.980
 speeds 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.870
 it left nothing to be desired of 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.430
 Activation button in the right 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.800
 side console sits too far back 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.770
 impress the geotrac 134 ep 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.710
 also with the hydraulic power ex works 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.290
 comes the tractor with a 121 liter 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.290
 per minute axial piston pump with 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.180
 200 bar pressure works that is 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.610
 neat, though, will be out of this 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.710
 cycle also the steering assistance 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.110
 supplied to control units, the 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.940
 large lindner standard three double 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.430
 acting couples with two of them 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.440
 proportional with time and quantity regulation 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.110
 and one with mechanical 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.540
 Flow control are optional 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.370
 can accommodate up to two additional electro 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.820
 hydraulic valves come to it 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.390
 the surcharge for this is 1,200 five 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.419
 Euro 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:25.280
 the control over the multifunction 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.289
 lever or the optional cross 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.450
 Rocker is no mystery 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.280
 however, the activ 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.340
 Button better colored by subdivided 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.340
 his 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.860
 in terms of lifting power, the 134 is no 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.710
 Top area but good average 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.650
 behind the kat2 rod held good 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.500
 six tons of very neat 3 5 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.480
 tons that he is at the center 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.970
 nicely arranged in the right armrest 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.640
 The bosch hydraulic camps will be here 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.050
 get by right away 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.020
 the cabin offers a very good 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.210
 All-round visibility the standard heated 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.400
 windshield is quite deep for 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.970
 front loader work but there are with me 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.920
 attached panoramic window in things 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.050
 lena uses its own service 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.970
 concept that through a clear menu 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.820
 and a clear design 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.920
 like the service is done over the 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.410
 Steering wheel console one access option 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.090
 of the operator refuse there is unfortunately 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.150
 Not 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:29.060
 when comfort plays the geotrac 134 ep 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.620
 in the first league with standard 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.840
 lindner delivers the tractor with one 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.090
 hydro mechanical cab suspension out 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.890
 our test tractor was with the 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.170
 optional pneumatic suspension 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.060
 equipped the extremely sovereign 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.670
 works and in connection with a 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.350
 to have compressed air system is that 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.560
 interact with the hydraulic 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:50.600
 Front axle suspension works very well 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.030
 the detailed test report with all 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.350
