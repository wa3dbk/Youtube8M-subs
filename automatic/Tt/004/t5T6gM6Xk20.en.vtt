00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
hey everybody today we're taking a look

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.649 
hey everybody today we're taking a look
at<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.129> manga<00:00:02.550> collection<00:00:02.970> which<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.330> gonna<00:00:03.510> be

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
at my manga collection which is gonna be

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.059 
at my manga collection which is gonna be
a<00:00:03.689> little<00:00:03.899> bit<00:00:04.110> different<00:00:04.500> than<00:00:04.620> my<00:00:04.740> anime

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
a little bit different than my anime

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.550 
a little bit different than my anime
collection<00:00:05.520> because<00:00:06.200> that<00:00:07.200> was<00:00:07.379> all

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
collection because that was all

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.620 
collection because that was all
alphabetical<00:00:08.130> order<00:00:08.400> but<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.880> really<00:00:09.389> isn't

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
alphabetical order but this really isn't

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.720 
alphabetical order but this really isn't
this<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.349> kind<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.710> just<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.280> try<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
this is kind of just I try to

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.060 
this is kind of just I try to
alphabetize<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.540> best<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.929> I<00:00:13.049> could<00:00:13.110> but

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
alphabetize it the best that I could but

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.950 
alphabetize it the best that I could but
there's<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.429> lot<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.700> spacing<00:00:15.269> issues<00:00:15.420> because

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
there's a lot of spacing issues because

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.420 
there's a lot of spacing issues because
manga<00:00:16.260> comes<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:16.740> different<00:00:16.890> shapes<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
manga comes in all different shapes and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.910 
manga comes in all different shapes and
sizes<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.720> really<00:00:18.900> difficult<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.770> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
sizes so it's really difficult to get it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.189 
sizes so it's really difficult to get it
alphabetized<00:00:20.580> properly<00:00:21.119> so<00:00:21.600> starting<00:00:21.960> off<00:00:22.050> at

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
alphabetized properly so starting off at

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.580 
alphabetized properly so starting off at
the<00:00:22.260> top<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.010> berserk<00:00:24.170> volumes<00:00:25.170> 1

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the top we have berserk volumes 1

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.210 
the top we have berserk volumes 1
through<00:00:26.240> volume<00:00:27.240> 37<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.590> feel<00:00:28.769> ashamed<00:00:28.890> to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
through volume 37 and I feel ashamed to

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.550 
through volume 37 and I feel ashamed to
say<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.119> lot<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> these<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:31.140> still

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
say this but a lot of these are still

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.590 
say this but a lot of these are still
plastic<00:00:31.800> wrapped<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.880> because<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.329> still

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
plastic wrapped just because I'm still

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
plastic wrapped just because I'm still
on<00:00:33.809> volume<00:00:34.050> 9<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.010> I've<00:00:35.130> been

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
on volume 9 just because I've been

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.729 
on volume 9 just because I've been
pacing<00:00:35.460> myself<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.210> slowly<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> usually

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
pacing myself so slowly with it usually

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.799 
pacing myself so slowly with it usually
I'll<00:00:37.890> read<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.340> 5<00:00:38.610> volumes<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> time<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
I'll read like 5 volumes at a time and

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
I'll read like 5 volumes at a time and
just<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.110> crazy<00:00:40.620> through<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.190> now<00:00:41.280> I'll<00:00:41.370> take<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
just go crazy through it now I'll take a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.250 
just go crazy through it now I'll take a
break<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.329> read<00:00:42.480> something<00:00:42.809> else<00:00:42.899> and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
break and go read something else and

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350

shrink-wrap like that so that whenever I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.889 
shrink-wrap like that so that whenever I
move<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> next<00:00:50.640> volume<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.449> open<00:00:51.780> it
