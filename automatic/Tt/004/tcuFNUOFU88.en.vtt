00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.290
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.050
 tutorial protective gear with julian 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.890
 fuchs and sebastian have the longboard 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.600
 deluxe team now something for me first 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.550
 Wear and what are the most important things 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.530
 are definitely 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.400
 the helmet is the most important because 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.900
 No one can drive without his head 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.430
 and very important to make the helmet 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:01.260
 just let it on its head 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 bring not at all really 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.460
 Let's go further than I am for that 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.510
 unfortunately already take 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.520
 so a few different ones here 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.880
 which ones are made of leather 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.549
 If that's not so boring 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:24.310
 and you must be comfortable in any case 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:26.880
 and should be a good lie that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.000
 it will then pull knee-high 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.360
 religion school already more are also 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.560
 again different variants of the boys 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.180
 a little smaller 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 now should be tight anyway 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.130
 so that they do not slip in the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.130
 Endgame is pizzas 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:55.820
 Sun closed dyck who spins at 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.500
 fall on your butt on the side 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.180
 quite good wood then in any case completely 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.420
 good is can definitely protect 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.310
 should give to the topic of gateway determined 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.070
 known that one has holes again and again 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:26.150
 what are you doing there or no holes 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:26.150
 I'll take care of it every time
