playing past them an area and a honda

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
playing past them an area and a honda
motor<00:01:54.840> home<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> life

about<00:02:05.759> two<00:02:05.909> mins<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.600> think<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.289> key<00:02:07.440> way

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
about two mins I think that's a key way

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.949 
about two mins I think that's a key way
to<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.399> keep<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.539> maintaining<00:02:09.899> your<00:02:10.530> health

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
to just keep in maintaining your health

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.750 
to just keep in maintaining your health

okay right now we're in Sparta Kentucky
I'm<00:02:15.239> assuming<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.050> don't<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.380> lot

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650
