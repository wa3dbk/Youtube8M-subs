here<00:00:42.090> you'll<00:00:42.300> notice<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.170> mouse<00:00:43.559> look

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
here you'll notice that the mouse look

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.200 
here you'll notice that the mouse look
works<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.340> differently<00:00:44.789> than<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> did

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
works a little differently than it did

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.029 
works a little differently than it did

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
button so it's a little bit more fluid

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700 
button so it's a little bit more fluid
and<00:01:02.100> intuitive<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.789> way<00:01:03.110> on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> top<00:01:04.500> you'll

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and intuitive that way on the top you'll

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.429 
and intuitive that way on the top you'll
find<00:01:04.979> switch<00:01:05.369> scene<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> really

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
find switch scene this is a really

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.469 
find switch scene this is a really
powerful<00:01:07.619> feature<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.700> enables<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.450> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
powerful feature that enables you to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.469 
powerful feature that enables you to
have<00:01:09.960> multiple<00:01:10.590> models<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.310> your<00:01:11.670> unity

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
have multiple models in your unity

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.600 
have multiple models in your unity
project<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.680> load<00:01:14.220> them<00:01:14.369> into

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
project and then load them into

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.609 
project and then load them into
individual<00:01:15.240> scenes<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.049> call<00:01:16.350> those

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
individual scenes and then call those

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
individual scenes and then call those
scenes<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:17.100> by<00:01:17.220> clicking<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> button<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.390> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
scenes up by clicking on a button so you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
scenes up by clicking on a button so you
might<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.990> several<00:01:19.830> different<00:01:19.979> design

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
might have several different design

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.890 
might have several different design
iterations<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.270> project<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.720> you're

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
iterations of a project that you're

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
iterations of a project that you're
working<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.380> instead<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> having<00:01:23.460> them<00:01:23.610> all

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
working on instead of having them all

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.240 
working on instead of having them all
side<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.240> side<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> same<00:01:24.990> scene<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:26.070> can

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
side by side in the same scene you can

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.969 
side by side in the same scene you can
now<00:01:26.479> divide<00:01:27.479> them<00:01:27.750> up<00:01:27.900> if<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.650> were<00:01:28.710> all<00:01:28.890> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
now divide them up if they were all in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.230 
now divide them up if they were all in
the<00:01:29.070> same<00:01:29.250> scene<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.000> lot<00:01:30.210> of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the same scene you would have a lot of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.969 
the same scene you would have a lot of
polygons<00:01:30.900> you'd<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.200> generating<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.829> lot<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
polygons you'd be generating a lot of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
polygons you'd be generating a lot of
draw<00:01:32.280> calls<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.880> would<00:01:33.000> really<00:01:33.240> have<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
draw calls and it would really have a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.200 
draw calls and it would really have a
negative<00:01:33.869> impact<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.409> your<00:01:34.500> performance<00:01:35.210> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
negative impact on your performance but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
negative impact on your performance but
if<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.680> divide<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> project<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.369> into

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
if you divide the project up into

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.130 
if you divide the project up into
different<00:01:38.820> scenes<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.450> only<00:01:39.600> rendering

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
different scenes you're only rendering

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.450 
different scenes you're only rendering
what<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> want<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.250> given

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
what you want to see at that given

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.050 
what you want to see at that given
moment<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:43.079> helps<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:44.100> design

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
moment so that really helps for design

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.020 
moment so that really helps for design
iteration<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.430> know<00:01:47.520> even<00:01:47.670> having

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
iteration and you know even having

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.080 
iteration and you know even having
different<00:01:48.329> material<00:01:49.520> assignments<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
different material assignments and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.910 
different material assignments and
things<00:01:51.329> like<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.990> I've<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.649> two

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
things like that so I've got two

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460 
things like that so I've got two
different<00:01:53.250> scenes<00:01:53.460> design<00:01:53.909> option<00:01:54.299> one<00:01:54.570> just

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
different scenes design option one just

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.109 
different scenes design option one just
for<00:01:55.619> demonstration<00:01:56.250> purposes<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.939> then<00:01:57.030> I've

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
for demonstration purposes and then I've

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.170 
for demonstration purposes and then I've
got<00:01:57.270> design<00:01:57.630> option<00:01:58.549> design<00:01:59.549> option<00:01:59.850> one<00:02:00.000> and

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
got design option design option one and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.100 
got design option design option one and
two<00:02:00.329> are<00:02:00.630> included<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> kit<00:02:03.110> switching

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
two are included in the kit switching

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.700 
two are included in the kit switching

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
views in your scene and then switch to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.030 
views in your scene and then switch to
those

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
those

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.319 
those
different<00:02:12.280> camera<00:02:12.579> views<00:02:12.760> by<00:02:12.879> clicking<00:02:13.209> on

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
different camera views by clicking on

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.209 
different camera views by clicking on
these<00:02:13.450> buttons<00:02:13.719> so<00:02:13.959> right<00:02:14.799> now<00:02:14.920> we're<00:02:15.099> in<00:02:15.159> the

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
these buttons so right now we're in the

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.369 
these buttons so right now we're in the
first-person<00:02:15.810> kind<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.870> traditional

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
first-person kind of traditional

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.309 
first-person kind of traditional
perspective<00:02:17.980> view<00:02:18.280> but<00:02:18.849> sometimes<00:02:19.150> you<00:02:19.269> want

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
perspective view but sometimes you want

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.080 
perspective view but sometimes you want
you<00:02:20.650> know<00:02:20.739> those<00:02:20.920> orthogonal<00:02:21.519> views<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.909> the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you know those orthogonal views like the

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.110 
you know those orthogonal views like the
plan<00:02:22.450> view<00:02:23.099> which<00:02:24.099> looks<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:24.939> and<00:02:25.030> you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
plan view which looks like that and you

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.729 
plan view which looks like that and you
use<00:02:25.329> the<00:02:25.540> arrow<00:02:25.719> keys<00:02:26.019> can<00:02:26.260> actually<00:02:26.500> pan

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
use the arrow keys can actually pan

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.390 
use the arrow keys can actually pan
around<00:02:27.010> we've<00:02:27.909> got<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.090> side<00:02:28.420> view<00:02:28.450> front

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
around we've got a side view front

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.149 
around we've got a side view front
elevation<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:32.049> that's<00:02:32.230> kind<00:02:32.470> of<00:02:32.530> useful<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.950> be

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
elevation so that's kind of useful to be

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.729 
elevation so that's kind of useful to be
able<00:02:33.189> to<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.609> get<00:02:33.730> a<00:02:34.109> sense<00:02:35.109> of<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.409> design

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
able to just get a sense of the design

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.569 
able to just get a sense of the design
through<00:02:36.670> those<00:02:36.790> more<00:02:36.970> traditional<00:02:37.120> views

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
through those more traditional views

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.399 
through those more traditional views
then<00:02:39.579> we<00:02:39.730> have<00:02:39.849> waypoints<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.720> waypoints<00:02:41.319> are

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
then we have waypoints and waypoints are

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.759 
then we have waypoints and waypoints are
simply<00:02:42.239> different<00:02:43.239> assigned<00:02:43.810> destinations

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
simply different assigned destinations

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.009 
simply different assigned destinations
within<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.220> scene<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:46.239> you<00:02:46.299> could<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:46.689> if

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
within the scene so you could have if

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.780 
within the scene so you could have if
you've<00:02:47.200> got<00:02:47.379> different<00:02:47.799> highlighted<00:02:48.459> areas

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
you've got different highlighted areas

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.869 
you've got different highlighted areas
like<00:02:48.970> an<00:02:49.090> auditorium<00:02:49.829> or<00:02:50.829> a<00:02:50.889> lobby<00:02:51.189> space<00:02:51.489> or

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
like an auditorium or a lobby space or

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.520 
like an auditorium or a lobby space or
something<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:52.389> want<00:02:52.569> to<00:02:52.750> feature<00:02:53.230> you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
something that you want to feature you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.720 
something that you want to feature you
just<00:02:53.739> assign<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.099> waypoint

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
just assign a waypoint

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.860 
just assign a waypoint
each<00:02:54.819> one<00:02:55.030> of<00:02:55.150> those<00:02:55.299> and<00:02:55.480> then<00:02:55.540> when<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> user

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
each one of those and then when the user

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.050 
each one of those and then when the user
clicks<00:02:56.349> on<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.620> they're<00:02:57.430> taken<00:02:57.760> right<00:02:57.909> to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
clicks on that they're taken right to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.780 
clicks on that they're taken right to
that<00:02:58.180> destination<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.220> here<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.430> am<00:03:00.519> in<00:03:00.639> the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
that destination so here I am in the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.940 
that destination so here I am in the
interior<00:03:01.329> if<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.569> click<00:03:01.780> on<00:03:01.900> exterior<00:03:02.379> then<00:03:02.799> I'm

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
interior if I click on exterior then I'm

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.250 
interior if I click on exterior then I'm
brought<00:03:03.579> out<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.909> the<00:03:04.030> exterior<00:03:04.389> Waypoint<00:03:05.019> I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
brought out to the exterior Waypoint I

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.059 
brought out to the exterior Waypoint I
also<00:03:06.069> have<00:03:06.310> a<00:03:06.340> quality<00:03:06.819> toggle<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:08.069> it's

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
also have a quality toggle and it's

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.530 
also have a quality toggle and it's
pretty<00:03:09.310> self-explanatory<00:03:09.700> but<00:03:10.389> it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
pretty self-explanatory but it's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050 
pretty self-explanatory but it's
actually<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:10.870> very<00:03:11.139> useful<00:03:11.519> tool<00:03:12.519> because<00:03:12.760> if

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
actually a very useful tool because if

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.119 
actually a very useful tool because if
you're<00:03:13.180> on<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.359> lower-end<00:03:14.319> machine<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.040> you're

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
you're on a lower-end machine and you're

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.099 
you're on a lower-end machine and you're
getting<00:03:15.250> some<00:03:15.519> lag<00:03:15.760> all<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.690> have<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.900> do<00:03:17.019> is

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
getting some lag all you have to do is

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.589 
getting some lag all you have to do is
decrease<00:03:17.409> the<00:03:17.530> quality<00:03:17.889> a<00:03:18.099> little<00:03:18.220> bit<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:19.389> or

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
decrease the quality a little bit and or

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.569 
decrease the quality a little bit and or
you'll<00:03:20.349> get<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.620> little<00:03:20.829> bit<00:03:21.040> smoother

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
you'll get a little bit smoother

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.030 
you'll get a little bit smoother
experience<00:03:21.819> with<00:03:22.359> hopefully<00:03:22.690> less<00:03:22.900> lag<00:03:23.169> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
experience with hopefully less lag the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.250 
experience with hopefully less lag the
only<00:03:24.250> thing<00:03:24.430> that'll<00:03:24.699> affect<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.419> the<00:03:25.449> texture

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
only thing that'll affect is the texture

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.110 
only thing that'll affect is the texture
quality<00:03:26.409> and<00:03:26.979> the<00:03:27.069> shadow<00:03:27.310> quality<00:03:27.879> might

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
quality and the shadow quality might

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.719 
quality and the shadow quality might
decrease<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.930> little<00:03:29.109> bit<00:03:29.379> you<00:03:30.129> can<00:03:30.280> customize

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
decrease a little bit you can customize

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.899 
decrease a little bit you can customize
all<00:03:30.970> that<00:03:31.180> inside<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.690> unity<00:03:32.019> editor

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
all that inside the unity editor

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:34.920 
all that inside the unity editor
likewise<00:03:33.909> if<00:03:34.090> you're<00:03:34.209> on<00:03:34.329> a<00:03:34.359> really<00:03:34.599> high<00:03:34.780> end

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
likewise if you're on a really high end

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.439 
likewise if you're on a really high end
machine<00:03:35.019> you<00:03:35.440> can<00:03:35.620> increase<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.760> quality<00:03:37.209> so

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
machine you can increase the quality so

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.580 
machine you can increase the quality so
that<00:03:37.479> it<00:03:37.659> looks<00:03:37.810> great<00:03:38.049> and<00:03:38.199> you<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.440> those

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
that it looks great and you get those

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.460 
that it looks great and you get those
really<00:03:38.799> nice<00:03:39.510> crisp<00:03:40.510> textures<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.319> shadows

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
really nice crisp textures and shadows

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.409 
really nice crisp textures and shadows
so<00:03:44.470> that's<00:03:44.680> it<00:03:44.919> if<00:03:45.370> you<00:03:45.430> have<00:03:45.549> any<00:03:45.669> ideas<00:03:46.150> for

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
so that's it if you have any ideas for

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.939 
so that's it if you have any ideas for

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
functions that you'd like to see built

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:49.830 
functions that you'd like to see built
into<00:03:48.250> future<00:03:48.609> kits<00:03:48.879> just<00:03:49.299> send<00:03:49.479> an<00:03:49.569> email<00:03:49.690> to

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
into future kits just send an email to

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.830 
into future kits just send an email to
info<00:03:50.109> at<00:03:50.440> art<00:03:50.590> virtual<00:03:51.069> comm<00:03:51.549> so<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.510> that's
