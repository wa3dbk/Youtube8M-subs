fuse as your heartrate monitor which I

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.460 
fuse as your heartrate monitor which I
really<00:01:35.579> think<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> nice<00:01:36.299> feature<00:01:36.600> because<00:01:37.170> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
really think is a nice feature because I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.590 
really think is a nice feature because I

and<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.360> fuse<00:01:51.689> only<00:01:52.140> syncs<00:01:52.530> via<00:01:52.710> bluetooth

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and the fuse only syncs via bluetooth

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
and the fuse only syncs via bluetooth
also<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> fuse<00:01:54.030> has<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> display<00:01:54.689> that's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
also the fuse has a display that's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840 
also the fuse has a display that's
similar<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> polar<00:01:56.250> loop<00:01:56.549> or

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
similar to that of the polar loop or

similar to that of the polar loop or
Nike<00:01:57.180> FuelBand<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.899> basically<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
Nike FuelBand it's basically a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.789 
Nike FuelBand it's basically a

collection of red LEDs that you navigate

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
collection of red LEDs that you navigate
through<00:02:01.979> by<00:02:02.219> tapping<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.729> right<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.180> left

was<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.020> really<00:02:25.410> motivating<00:02:26.010> factor<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.580> have

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
was a really motivating factor to have

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.880 
was a really motivating factor to have
it<00:02:26.819> right<00:02:27.090> on<00:02:27.300> my<00:02:27.330> wrist<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.050> showed<00:02:28.530> me<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.740> I

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
it right on my wrist it showed me that I

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.070 
it right on my wrist it showed me that I
had<00:02:29.069> only<00:02:29.250> completed<00:02:29.850> 50%<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.600> my<00:02:30.690> daily<00:02:30.900> goal

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
goal that day and it also displays

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.610

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
workout for example a run it will also

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.020 
workout for example a run it will also

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
track your heart rate it doesn't do so

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.620 
track your heart rate it doesn't do so
24/7<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.160> only<00:02:53.580> monitors<00:02:54.030> your<00:02:54.239> heart<00:02:54.480> rate

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
24/7 it only monitors your heart rate

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.840 
24/7 it only monitors your heart rate
during<00:02:54.870> workouts<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.680> that's<00:02:56.190> basically<00:02:56.730> how

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
during workouts and that's basically how

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.210 
during workouts and that's basically how
it<00:02:57.060> achieves<00:02:57.660> such<00:02:58.019> good<00:02:58.319> battery<00:02:58.769> life<00:02:58.860> I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it achieves such good battery life I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100 
it achieves such good battery life I
wish<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.790> could<00:02:59.970> get<00:03:00.060> all-day<00:03:00.480> heart<00:03:00.750> rate<00:03:00.870> data

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
wish I could get all-day heart rate data

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.449 
wish I could get all-day heart rate data
but<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.440> understand<00:03:01.950> there's<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.190> trade-off

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
but I understand there's a trade-off

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.000 
but I understand there's a trade-off
here<00:03:02.790> also<00:03:03.150> I'd<00:03:03.540> much<00:03:03.840> rather<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.410> accurate

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
here also I'd much rather have accurate

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.400 
here also I'd much rather have accurate
heart<00:03:05.280> rate<00:03:05.459> data<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.120> my<00:03:06.300> workouts<00:03:06.870> which

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
heart rate data for my workouts which

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.860 
heart rate data for my workouts which
you<00:03:07.590> can<00:03:07.769> expect<00:03:08.190> from<00:03:08.430> me<00:03:08.730> Oh<00:03:08.760> than<00:03:09.330> having

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
you can expect from me Oh than having

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.140 
you can expect from me Oh than having
all-day<00:03:10.620> heart<00:03:10.950> rate<00:03:11.100> tracking<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.790> doesn't

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
all-day heart rate tracking that doesn't

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.150 
all-day heart rate tracking that doesn't
function<00:03:12.390> well<00:03:12.780> during<00:03:13.170> my<00:03:13.290> workouts<00:03:13.830> I'm

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
function well during my workouts I'm

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.710 
function well during my workouts I'm
going<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.580> full<00:03:14.850> video<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.540> how

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
going to have a full video up on how

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.690 
going to have a full video up on how
accurate<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.560> heart<00:03:16.890> rate<00:03:17.040> sensors<00:03:17.459> are<00:03:17.670> on

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
accurate the heart rate sensors are on

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.660 
accurate the heart rate sensors are on
both<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.390> alpha<00:03:18.720> 2<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.320> Mia<00:03:19.530> fuse<00:03:19.980> so

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
both the alpha 2 and the Mia fuse so

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.460 
both the alpha 2 and the Mia fuse so
look<00:03:20.850> out<00:03:21.000> for<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.239> video<00:03:21.450> as<00:03:21.900> far<00:03:22.230> as<00:03:22.320> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
look out for that video as far as the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.140 
look out for that video as far as the
other<00:03:22.620> major<00:03:22.950> features<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.640> really<00:03:23.940> liked

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
other major features that I really liked

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.940 
other major features that I really liked
about<00:03:24.239> diffuse<00:03:24.810> besides<00:03:25.350> its<00:03:25.590> heart<00:03:25.799> rate

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
about diffuse besides its heart rate

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.560 
about diffuse besides its heart rate
monitor<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.730> has<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:26.910> really<00:03:27.329> great

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
monitor it has a really great

this<00:05:27.030> was<00:05:27.210> really<00:05:27.600> disappointing<00:05:28.260> for<00:05:28.470> me<00:05:28.500> now

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
this was really disappointing for me now

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.470 
this was really disappointing for me now
in<00:05:29.040> terms<00:05:29.220> of<00:05:29.340> my<00:05:29.460> recommendation<00:05:30.090> should<00:05:30.360> you

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
in terms of my recommendation should you

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.840 
in terms of my recommendation should you
buy<00:05:30.660> or<00:05:31.020> not<00:05:31.230> buy<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.500> fuse<00:05:31.980> I<00:05:32.220> think<00:05:32.760> it

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
buy or not buy the fuse I think it

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.130 
buy or not buy the fuse I think it
really<00:05:32.940> comes<00:05:33.180> down<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:33.480> one<00:05:33.870> thing

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
really comes down to one thing

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.590 
really comes down to one thing
how<00:05:34.560> much<00:05:34.770> do<00:05:34.950> you<00:05:35.010> value<00:05:35.070> risk<00:05:35.880> based<00:05:36.210> heart

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
how much do you value risk based heart

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.600 
how much do you value risk based heart
rate<00:05:36.780> tracking<00:05:37.020> if<00:05:37.500> your<00:05:37.740> answer<00:05:38.040> is<00:05:38.190> a<00:05:38.220> lot

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
rate tracking if your answer is a lot

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.160
