and<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.820> torque<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:53.450> have<00:02:53.600> improve<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.440> way

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
and the torque we have improve a way

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.099 
and the torque we have improve a way
shape<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.030> curve<00:02:56.269> of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.540> torque<00:02:56.930> in

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
have changed starting from the front of

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.760 
have changed starting from the front of
the<00:03:42.640> car<00:03:42.850> we<00:03:43.360> have<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.660> completely<00:03:44.290> new<00:03:44.470> front

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
the car we have a completely new front

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.680 
the car we have a completely new front
bumper<00:03:44.980> where<00:03:45.700> we<00:03:45.850> have<00:03:45.940> improved<00:03:46.240> the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
bumper where we have improved the

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.630 
bumper where we have improved the
efficiency<00:03:46.780> of<00:03:47.290> their<00:03:47.500> our<00:03:47.680> cooler<00:03:48.100> system

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
efficiency of their our cooler system

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.490 
efficiency of their our cooler system
because<00:03:49.300> we<00:03:49.390> have<00:03:49.510> improved<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.020> higher

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
because we have improved the higher

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.110 
because we have improved the higher
surface<00:03:50.800> that<00:03:51.220> is<00:03:51.370> needed<00:03:51.550> you<00:03:51.819> to<00:03:51.970> pay

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
surface that is needed you to pay

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.080 
surface that is needed you to pay
increase<00:03:52.390> also<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.530> power<00:03:53.739> of<00:03:53.980> energy<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.580> we

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
increase also the power of energy and we

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.170 
increase also the power of energy and we
have<00:03:55.180> created<00:03:56.220> some<00:03:57.220> spoiler<00:03:57.580> in<00:03:57.819> the<00:03:57.850> front

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
have created some spoiler in the front

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.030 
have created some spoiler in the front
in<00:03:58.330> order<00:03:58.569> to<00:03:58.750> have<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.930> better<00:03:59.020> aerodynamic<00:03:59.950> of

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
in order to have a better aerodynamic of

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.680 
in order to have a better aerodynamic of
behavior<00:04:00.340> of<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.640> car<00:04:00.850> we<00:04:01.030> have<00:04:01.120> improved<00:04:01.390> the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
behavior of the car we have improved the

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.400 
behavior of the car we have improved the
downfalls<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.860> in<00:04:03.489> order<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.730> give<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.000> more<00:04:04.410> a

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
a family feeling for how our car and is

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.390 
a family feeling for how our car and is
important<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.350> everybody<00:04:23.740> would<00:04:24.100> see<00:04:24.280> the

because<00:04:27.820> it's<00:04:27.970> like<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.240> sign<00:04:28.570> metal<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:28.960> you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
because it's like a sign metal that you

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.020 
because it's like a sign metal that you
can<00:04:29.200> have<00:04:29.320> in<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.530> front<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.890> the<00:04:29.979> car<00:04:30.190> about

aerodynamic like I want to say is the

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.299 
aerodynamic like I want to say is the
car<00:06:30.149> better<00:06:30.839> aerodynamic<00:06:31.529> live<00:06:31.709> in<00:06:31.829> the<00:06:31.979> open

00:06:32.299 --> 00:06:32.309 
car better aerodynamic live in the open

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:34.159 
car better aerodynamic live in the open
yes<00:06:32.579> we<00:06:32.759> have<00:06:32.849> improved<00:06:33.179> not<00:06:33.389> in<00:06:33.539> six<00:06:33.839> but

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
yes we have improved not in six but
