 colors 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.390
 that says its main particularity 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.150
 remain its size 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.770

 competitors requires the use of 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.650
 two hands because of their size 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.780
 precisely despite the size of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.300

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.769
 moment

 another particularity of z a compact sound 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.269
 sony camera has endowed 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.940
 smartphone of a 20 million sensor 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.980
 of pixels associated with a sensor a little 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.660
 upright a bright optics that 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.150

 low light situation as per 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.380
 example at night or when darkness 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.030
 comes to fall second specificity on 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.810
 found on lausanne a compact a mode 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.640
 manual 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.410
 the latter allows to disengage 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.970
 of cameras and manage 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.100
 manually a number of 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.519
 parameters like for example the balance 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.290
 whites 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.840
 the type of scene you want 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.060
 filming or taking a picture or by 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.560
 example the flash power 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.239
 what I have least appreciated about this 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.970
 phone is concerned at first 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.739
 applications indeed sony after a 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.239
 alone and very many programs on 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.910
 his phone that we can not d 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.130
 install in a second second time 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.480
 negative point the fingerprints in 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.519
 effect the two glass plates are 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.900
 very his license takes very easily 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.269
 many fingerprints that tell you 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.130
 then clean up what I have 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.560
 the most appreciated on this phone is 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.660
 undoubtedly its format it is very 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.730
 compact so will be very easily in 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.040
 a pocket and can be used at a 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.819
 only in a second time other 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.010
 positive 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.989
 its power despite its size is a 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.070
 high-end phone very powerful 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.350
 that we can do everything without rowing 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.880
 last positive point and not 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.690
 least this phone fully 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.580
 watertight 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.220
 it can be used outdoors
