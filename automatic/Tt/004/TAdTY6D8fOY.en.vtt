00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.720
 hello in this video tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:19.869
 teach how to weave these mini hearts 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 in crochet fabric ideal for gifts 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.800
 on valentine's day 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.289
 look how cute they are 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.030
 They are very fast and easy to weave 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:39.550
 They are woven with cotton thread 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.550
 they can also weave with macramÃ© thread 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.570
 and weave us 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.370
 use steel needle number 40 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.640
 starts from the tip 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:11.340
 it starts with seven strings I here already 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:17.290
 I've knitted them and now we're going to chop 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.230
 the fifth 1 2 3 4 5 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.190
 in the fifth chain we go and we weave 1 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.190
 high point 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.890
 now let's jump 1 string and in the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:39.360
 next and in the last one in this case 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.360
 let's chop and knit 1 medium high 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.100
 and here 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.980
 we make the first row now we go 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.520
 to spin and weave the second row 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.700
 from here we are going to weave everything in a 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.340
 mid- high point 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.550
 the first medium high point we are going to 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.170
 replace with 2 chains 1 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.090
 two 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.090
 and we are going to make an increase 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.370
 stinging 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.680
 in the first mid-high point 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.650
 thus 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.960
 then we are going to chop at the high point and 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.960
 let's knit another mid-high point 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:58.300
 and in the last point we are going to make a 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:03.130
 increase by weaving 2 medium high points 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.910
 in the same place 1 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.910
 and 2 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:17.450
 and in total we should be 5 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:20.560
 mid-high points we're going to spin and 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.560
 let's repeat the same 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.510
 It starts with two chains for 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:32.250
 replace the first mid-high point and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:35.900
 in the same place we weave the second 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.900
 to make the increase 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:45.180
 and then we're going to nibble on each of the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:49.100
 next points and we knit 1 point 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.100
 medium high in each of them 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.680
 one 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.680
 two 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:15.370
 3 that is, I count 3 after the increases 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:19.049
 we have 1 2 2 stitches in the 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.169
 first point and then 3 points 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.650
 chopped at each of the points 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:28.430
 next and at the last point we're going to 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.740
 knit 2 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.009
 mid-high points 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:40.310
 to make the increase so we're going 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:40.310
 to increase at the beginning and at the end 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.740
 so we're going to weave a total of 6 rows 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:58.059
 here I have already worked the 6 rows 

00:04:53.799 --> 00:04:58.059
 increasing at the beginning and at the end 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:07.580
 and we should stay in this sixth row 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.580
 altogether 13 medium high points 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.370
 now we are going to turn and we are going to weave the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.430
 seventh and last row we are going to weave 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.590
 a chain 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:27.820
 and we jumped three points in the room 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.820
 let's chop 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:36.229
 here 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.229
 and we weave 10 high points 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.150
 one 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.229
 two 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.430
 3 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:58.589
 4 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.050
 5 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.350
 6 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.990
 7 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.670
 8 

00:06:26.489 --> 00:06:29.489
 9 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.930
 10 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:46.660
 now let's jump 2 points and in the 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.660
 third we prick and weave 1 point low 

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:56.520
 now we are going to jump 2 points and in the 3rd 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:07:00.569
 we chop 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:04.340
 and we weave again the fan of 10 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.340
 high points 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:15.010
 once the 10 high points are woven 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.010
 let's chop on the last point 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.310
 and we weave 1 flat point 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:29.150
 to finish the row 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:31.760
 and they know how the heart is formed 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:34.370
 here we are going to weave a last chain 

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:37.160
 to cut 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:41.770
 and finish 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.770
 then we are going to hide the threads 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.600
 let's stay like this 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.569
 this heart in crochet fabric with 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.210
 mini heart 

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:58.369
 to give as a gift on Valentine's Day or 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:02.779
 You can also use it to apply 

00:07:58.369 --> 00:08:08.619
 of clothes for children and so on and I hope that 

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:08.619
 have it and give many hearts
