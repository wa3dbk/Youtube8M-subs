00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.030 
lights coming from down here so only
here's<00:03:41.340> going<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.610> be<00:03:41.700> shadow<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:43.590> no<00:03:43.740> cow

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
here's going to be shadow so no cow

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.060 
here's going to be shadow so no cow
light<00:03:44.310> there's<00:03:44.520> tippy<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:44.910> almost<00:03:45.360> black

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
light there's tippy and almost black

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.810 
light there's tippy and almost black
well<00:03:47.070> like<00:03:47.940> us<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.180> gray<00:03:48.360> leg<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:48.750> do<00:03:49.670> this<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.790> a

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
well like us a gray leg can do this is a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.730 
well like us a gray leg can do this is a
good<00:03:51.000> practice<00:03:51.510> for<00:03:52.200> your<00:03:52.790> shading<00:03:54.470> gonna<00:03:55.470> get

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
good practice for your shading gonna get

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.260 
good practice for your shading gonna get
about<00:03:55.920> here<00:03:56.370> it's<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.700> be<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:56.970> because

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
about here it's going to be like because

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.890 
about here it's going to be like because
what<00:03:57.450> happens<00:03:57.810> is<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.350> light<00:03:58.560> comes<00:03:58.860> down

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
what happens is the light comes down

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.290 
what happens is the light comes down
hits<00:04:00.900> us<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.410> bounces<00:04:02.250> back<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:02.970> makes<00:04:03.180> the

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
hits us and bounces back and makes the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.850 
hits us and bounces back and makes the
underneath<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.900> bit<00:04:04.080> lighter<00:04:04.350> even<00:04:04.740> though

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
underneath a bit lighter even though

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.360 
underneath a bit lighter even though
it's<00:04:05.400> light<00:04:05.670> anyway<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:07.350> that's<00:04:07.560> dark<00:04:10.370> he's

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
it's light anyway so that's dark he's

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.410 
it's light anyway so that's dark he's
not<00:04:11.610> quite<00:04:11.970> as<00:04:12.209> dark

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.009 

he<00:04:15.420> is<00:04:15.480> lighter<00:04:15.930> still<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:18.750> it's<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> real

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
he is lighter still so it's a real

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.140 
he is lighter still so it's a real
practice<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.919> you<00:04:20.669> know<00:04:20.760> shading<00:04:21.390> in<00:04:21.570> here<00:04:23.150> the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
practice of you know shading in here the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.920 
practice of you know shading in here the
pencils<00:04:24.630> hardly<00:04:25.110> even<00:04:25.260> touching<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:25.980> paper

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.570 

yeah<00:04:30.930> let's<00:04:31.169> see<00:04:31.410> if<00:04:31.560> I<00:04:31.680> can<00:04:31.860> do<00:04:32.040> all<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.370> in

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
yeah let's see if I can do all the in

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.850 
yeah let's see if I can do all the in
betweens<00:04:35.960> now<00:04:36.960> if<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.110> had<00:04:37.260> another<00:04:37.440> pencil

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
betweens now if I had another pencil

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.070 
betweens now if I had another pencil
 it<00:04:38.520> sort<00:04:38.700> of<00:04:38.820> hold<00:04:39.419> it<00:04:39.600> like<00:04:39.750> that<00:04:39.780> and

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
 it sort of hold it like that and

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.969 
 it sort of hold it like that and
get<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> flatter<00:04:41.160> area<00:04:41.729> I<00:04:42.000> only<00:04:42.360> got<00:04:42.540> this

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
get a flatter area I only got this

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.510 
get a flatter area I only got this
little<00:04:43.979> mechanical<00:04:44.610> pencil<00:04:45.000> today<00:04:46.370> which<00:04:47.370> I

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
little mechanical pencil today which I

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.190 
little mechanical pencil today which I
picked<00:04:47.760> up<00:04:47.910> cheap<00:04:48.270> from<00:04:48.510> where<00:04:48.660> those<00:04:48.840> really

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:49.200 
picked up cheap from where those really

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.340 
picked up cheap from where those really
cheap<00:04:49.229> two<00:04:49.830> dollar<00:04:50.040> shops<00:04:50.460> so<00:04:51.240> I<00:04:51.270> do<00:04:51.720> some<00:04:51.990> bull

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
cheap two dollar shops so I do some bull

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.560 
cheap two dollar shops so I do some bull
watches<00:04:52.800> here<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.600> that<00:04:54.630> flap<00:04:55.050> over<00:04:55.229> here

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
watches here and on that flap over here

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.440 
watches here and on that flap over here
maybe<00:04:57.570> a<00:04:57.720> bit<00:04:57.870> on<00:04:57.990> her<00:04:58.110> face<00:04:58.380> there<00:04:59.210> I'm<00:05:00.210> kind

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
maybe a bit on her face there I'm kind

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.580 
maybe a bit on her face there I'm kind
of<00:05:00.540> very<00:05:00.780> very<00:05:01.080> gently<00:05:01.470> just<00:05:03.260> covering<00:05:04.260> around

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
of very very gently just covering around

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:12.750 
of very very gently just covering around
those

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.120 

all<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.630> other<00:05:13.780> way<00:05:13.870> taints<00:05:14.380> just<00:05:14.530> imagine

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
all the other way taints just imagine

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.910 
all the other way taints just imagine
this<00:05:15.250> one<00:05:15.490> there<00:05:15.730> just<00:05:16.060> leave<00:05:16.330> a<00:05:16.360> white<00:05:16.720> patch

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.440 

yeah<00:05:21.150> wrinkles<00:05:23.160> wrinkles<00:05:24.160> there<00:05:24.700> maybe<00:05:25.300> a

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
yeah wrinkles wrinkles there maybe a

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.330 
yeah wrinkles wrinkles there maybe a
dark<00:05:25.750> patch<00:05:26.020> there<00:05:28.680> often<00:05:29.680> was<00:05:29.800> training<00:05:30.220> what

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
dark patch there often was training what

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.670 
dark patch there often was training what
I<00:05:30.370> do<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.760> I<00:05:30.940> start<00:05:31.000> off<00:05:31.390> light<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:31.990> just<00:05:32.500> go<00:05:32.650> a

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
I do is I start off light I just go a

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.170 
I do is I start off light I just go a
little<00:05:32.800> bit<00:05:33.070> heavier<00:05:33.340> and<00:05:33.850> a<00:05:33.880> little<00:05:34.090> bit

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
little bit heavier and a little bit

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.780 
little bit heavier and a little bit
heavier<00:05:34.620> so<00:05:35.620> if<00:05:35.680> you<00:05:35.770> start<00:05:36.040> off<00:05:36.160> lightly<00:05:36.460> it

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
heavier so if you start off lightly it

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.000 
heavier so if you start off lightly it
means<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.420> you<00:05:37.570> know<00:05:37.720> oh<00:05:37.960> you<00:05:38.800> can<00:05:38.920> add<00:05:38.980> a

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
means that you know oh you can add a

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.610 
means that you know oh you can add a
little<00:05:39.190> bit<00:05:39.280> more<00:05:39.400> but<00:05:39.760> if<00:05:39.850> you<00:05:40.440> put<00:05:41.440> too<00:05:41.470> much

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
little bit more but if you put too much

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.410 
little bit more but if you put too much
training<00:05:42.160> on<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.370> start<00:05:42.640> with<00:05:42.820> then<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.180> sort

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
training on to start with then it sort

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.120 
training on to start with then it sort
of<00:05:43.510> gets<00:05:43.630> tricky<00:05:44.020> because<00:05:44.140> you<00:05:44.560> have<00:05:44.830> to<00:05:44.950> try

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
of gets tricky because you have to try

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:51.450 
of gets tricky because you have to try
and<00:05:45.430> erase<00:05:45.850> them<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.510> it<00:05:46.720> gets<00:05:47.560> messy<00:05:50.280> if<00:05:51.280> I<00:05:51.400> do

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
and erase them and it gets messy if I do

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.930 
and erase them and it gets messy if I do
ever<00:05:51.850> use<00:05:52.150> the<00:05:52.330> eraser<00:05:52.660> it's<00:05:53.080> usually<00:05:53.290> just<00:05:53.940> to

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
ever use the eraser it's usually just to

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.060 
ever use the eraser it's usually just to
rub<00:05:55.090> out<00:05:55.300> lines<00:05:57.810> they're<00:05:58.810> more<00:05:59.110> outside<00:05:59.830> the

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
rub out lines they're more outside the

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.490 
rub out lines they're more outside the
body<00:06:00.310> not<00:06:00.580> actually<00:06:01.030> in<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.450> body<00:06:01.710> itself<00:06:04.500> and

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
body not actually in the body itself and

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.570 
body not actually in the body itself and
I'm<00:06:05.620> gonna<00:06:05.830> heavy<00:06:06.160> up<00:06:06.370> this<00:06:06.610> line<00:06:06.910> here<00:06:08.580> that's

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
I'm gonna heavy up this line here that's

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.610 
I'm gonna heavy up this line here that's
when<00:06:09.730> I<00:06:09.760> draw<00:06:10.150> an<00:06:10.270> object<00:06:10.390> with<00:06:10.840> lines<00:06:11.080> I<00:06:11.410> like

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
when I draw an object with lines I like

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.980 
when I draw an object with lines I like
to<00:06:11.890> make<00:06:12.070> the<00:06:12.280> lines<00:06:12.460> underneath<00:06:12.910> just<00:06:13.360> heavy

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.650 

he<00:06:16.990> was<00:06:17.110> it<00:06:17.230> a<00:06:17.290> bit<00:06:17.410> of<00:06:17.530> white<00:06:18.270> with<00:06:19.270> this<00:06:19.420> law

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
he was it a bit of white with this law

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.190 
he was it a bit of white with this law
he<00:06:20.050> is<00:06:20.080> very<00:06:20.410> very<00:06:20.680> light<00:06:21.480> another<00:06:22.480> heavy<00:06:22.870> one

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
he is very very light another heavy one
