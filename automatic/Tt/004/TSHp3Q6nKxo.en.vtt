well today we start at the pole I'm
using<00:00:06.880> the<00:00:07.029> car<00:00:07.210> bench<00:00:07.450> learning<00:00:08.230> about<00:00:08.379> how

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
using the car bench learning about how

over in Troutdale what we're doing is
we're<00:00:16.299> doing<00:00:16.330> multiple<00:00:16.869> fixtures<00:00:17.050> on<00:00:17.410> this

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
we're doing multiple fixtures on this

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.890 
we're doing multiple fixtures on this
side<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:18.190> spread<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.640> stress<00:00:18.910> of<00:00:19.119> holiness

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
side to spread the stress of holiness

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.359 
side to spread the stress of holiness
when<00:00:20.019> he<00:00:20.140> pulls<00:00:20.349> that<00:00:20.500> middle<00:00:20.830> there<00:00:20.980> we're

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
when he pulls that middle there we're

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:22.710 
when he pulls that middle there we're
going<00:00:21.490> to<00:00:21.550> start<00:00:21.759> doing<00:00:21.820> initial<00:00:22.240> pulls<00:00:22.419> today

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
going to start doing initial pulls today

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.169 
going to start doing initial pulls today
just<00:00:23.320> to<00:00:23.439> see<00:00:23.650> how<00:00:23.800> tough<00:00:24.490> this<00:00:24.699> aluminum

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
just to see how tough this aluminum

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.989 
just to see how tough this aluminum
frame<00:00:25.419> is<00:00:25.449> the<00:00:26.079> more<00:00:26.320> everything's<00:00:27.039> welded

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:27.999 
frame is the more everything's welded

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.700 
frame is the more everything's welded
together<00:00:28.179> and<00:00:28.689> meshed<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.109> riveted<00:00:29.619> together

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
together and meshed and riveted together

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.310 
together and meshed and riveted together
that<00:00:30.189> stronger<00:00:30.789> it<00:00:30.880> is<00:00:30.909> too<00:00:31.659> much<00:00:31.810> point<00:00:32.110> pound

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
that stronger it is too much point pound

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.660 
that stronger it is too much point pound
on<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.529> side<00:00:32.800> without<00:00:33.010> enough<00:00:33.220> clamping<00:00:33.579> on

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
on that side without enough clamping on

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.430 
on that side without enough clamping on
this<00:00:33.790> side<00:00:34.000> this<00:00:34.480> will<00:00:34.720> start<00:00:34.930> walking<00:00:35.140> over

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
this side this will start walking over

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.750 
this side this will start walking over
it<00:00:35.590> will<00:00:35.740> start<00:00:35.950> bending<00:00:36.070> this<00:00:36.400> so<00:00:36.640> we're

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
it will start bending this so we're

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.430 
it will start bending this so we're
trying<00:00:36.940> to<00:00:37.060> spread<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.540> stress<00:00:37.960> that's<00:00:38.290> going

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
trying to spread the stress that's going

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.200 
trying to spread the stress that's going
to<00:00:38.590> be<00:00:38.680> on<00:00:38.830> this<00:00:39.010> after<00:00:39.490> that<00:00:39.640> Ram<00:00:39.880> starts

popping these aircraft rivets we'll be

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.790 
popping these aircraft rivets we'll be
ordering<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.220> from<00:01:09.520> this<00:01:09.610> company<00:01:10.030> here

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
ordering it from this company here

ordering it from this company here
aircraft<00:01:11.800> spruce<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.280> specialty<00:01:12.729> these<00:01:12.880> are

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
aircraft spruce and specialty these are

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.430 
aircraft spruce and specialty these are
all<00:01:13.119> aircraft<00:01:13.330> rivets<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:13.990> are<00:01:14.050> being<00:01:14.260> used

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
all aircraft rivets that are being used

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.800 
all aircraft rivets that are being used
by<00:01:14.590> Ferrari<00:01:15.010> you<00:01:15.940> think<00:01:16.180> it<00:01:16.270> would<00:01:16.479> cut<00:01:16.660> this

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
by Ferrari you think it would cut this

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.430 
by Ferrari you think it would cut this
out<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.050> here

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
out of here

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:27.680 
out of here
oh<00:01:17.470> no<00:01:18.369> just<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.970> good<00:01:19.119> section<00:01:19.570> so<00:01:19.750> let's<00:01:19.960> do<00:01:20.259> it

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.210 

we're<00:01:28.690> working<00:01:29.050> our<00:01:29.170> way<00:01:29.320> in<00:01:29.560> testing<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
we're working our way in testing the

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.540 
we're working our way in testing the
strength<00:01:30.280> of<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.729> puller<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.840> frame<00:01:32.110> and

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
strength of the puller to the frame and

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.050 
strength of the puller to the frame and
clamping<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:33.640> down<00:01:33.670> it's<00:01:34.479> a<00:01:34.539> trial<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:34.930> error

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
clamping it down it's a trial and error

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.550 
clamping it down it's a trial and error
because<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.330> center<00:01:37.660> pole<00:01:37.869> you're

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
because it's a center pole you're

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.350 
because it's a center pole you're
basically<00:01:39.070> pulling<00:01:39.340> against<00:01:39.700> itself<00:01:40.090> because

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
basically pulling against itself because

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.150 
basically pulling against itself because
you're<00:01:40.450> clamping<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.050> two<00:01:41.229> ends<00:01:41.500> here<00:01:41.649> but

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
you're clamping the two ends here but

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.139 
you're clamping the two ends here but
then<00:01:42.280> you're<00:01:42.399> pulling<00:01:42.610> against<00:01:42.970> them<00:01:43.060> they

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
then you're pulling against them they

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.910 
then you're pulling against them they
want<00:01:43.300> to<00:01:43.360> spread<00:01:43.660> out<00:01:43.810> so<00:01:44.470> what<00:01:44.680> we're<00:01:44.800> going

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
want to spread out so what we're going

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.960 
want to spread out so what we're going
to<00:01:44.950> do<00:01:45.100> right<00:01:45.250> now<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.550> we're<00:01:45.670> going<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:45.850> get

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
to do right now is we're going to get

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.120 
to do right now is we're going to get
this<00:01:46.119> up<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:46.690> front<00:01:47.200> suspension<00:01:47.770> pulled<00:01:47.979> out

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
this up this front suspension pulled out

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.670 
this up this front suspension pulled out
two<00:01:48.310> squared<00:01:48.610> there's<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.390> small<00:01:50.080> crack<00:01:50.410> right

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
two squared there's a small crack right

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.609 
two squared there's a small crack right
here<00:01:50.950> in<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.700> casting<00:01:52.330> and<00:01:52.539> what<00:01:53.410> I<00:01:53.440> was

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
here in the casting and what I was

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.960 
here in the casting and what I was
really<00:01:53.710> curious<00:01:53.979> about<00:01:54.160> was<00:01:54.430> figuring<00:01:54.880> out

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
really curious about was figuring out
