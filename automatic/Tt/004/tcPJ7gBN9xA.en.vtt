00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.209
 I hope you are fine we have 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:09.870
 back upcycling design was yes and 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:13.410
 Although this cool thing is here 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.670
 pencil case and granted but now 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.949
 I'm sure you say 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.470
 yes, what's so special about that 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.990
 special is the technology from which I get that 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.390
 and I did the whole thing 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.390
 bags made quite normal 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.429
 shopping bags and that's how the whole thing looks 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.019
 inside and I'll show you how we do that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.760
 Whole you do what you in any case 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.370
 you need bags for that 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.460
 I have my cock so beautiful here 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 rausgekramt then you need on 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 every case of packing paper very important piece 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.880
 felt that is already tailored 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.430
 I bought so the size of 30 times 20 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:55.980
 a ruler scissors and now the whole 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.080
 important things to an iron that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.240
 you definitely need and 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.100
 hot glue gun you need of course 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.920
 also a bit of tape that it has to be too 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.290
 not too long but there you can like 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.690
 just take a tape or a simple tape 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.090
 take or maybe it's even whole 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.470
 good if you take a rubber for it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.540
 then come the donors 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.090
 in between 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.100
 we'll come soon we want the bags 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.300
 Iron together and I'll take it 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.310
 now my first felt as a 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.490
 clue to the size and will 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.660
 my types cut apart and 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.790
 then try that in patchwork-like 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.330
 this unity with the people too 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.330
 stick 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.700
 Berlin I have the types here now 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.430
 always cut out times to the square 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.310
 here tried to bring in forms or 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.049
 triangle or just a train 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 cut out and now you have to 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.460
 put down your baking paper called for you 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.899
 so put it on the pieces so 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.020
 This puzzle is a bit like that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.539
 patchwork looks moderate and a surface 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.940
 make it bigger 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.550
 every case as your felt piece and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.319
 Sophies then puts on a baking paper like that 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.600
 The whole thing will be in the end 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.370
 So it looks like trying to puzzle 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.900
 and I'm considering that now again 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.900
 everything here so a bit cope 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.530
 it is important that you if you bag your 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.930
 fritter so before you go places that the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.150
 really complete is that we 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.329
 see no baking paper underneath and then 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.430
 Do you take your second paper sets 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.859
 Do this and grab yours 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.780
 iron goes to the lowest 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:47.970
 step and press your thumb 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.950
 no, but be careful not too long 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.200
 was on hold 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.269
 otherwise it may be becker 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.269
 Watch how long it takes approximately 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.780
 it looks like the whole thing has something like that 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.060
 I get an animal print 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.970
 think it's pretty cool and that 's up 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.720
 every now the area with the us 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.970
 can work 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.620
 now the whole time turns and take 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.270
 your felt piece and is that there 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.160
 and now we have to do that 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.170
 actually only cut around it 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.910
 but it would not directly s.der film 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.200
 cut but a bit bigger 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.700
 still leave because maybe that sees 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.330
 also good because I can cut off 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.150
 still 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.600
 and that's why I'll take it the best 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.940
 times just snail schnecker pin 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.940
 and fortified the whole was 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.610
 I cut it out here now 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.680
 and as you can see I have here 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.520
 the edges a little bag from 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.680
 leave 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.540
 and the next step is now the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.490
 hot glue gun now we have to 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.790
 namely to fix felt to the tables 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.320
 and mine is definitely hot 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.160
 we can run the pins 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.160
 lose weight again 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.530
 i make the hot glue on the 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.790
 films and not too much on the edge of it 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.790
 do not stop pushing 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.229
 I cut myself against them now 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.000
 decided and put that around because 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.849
 I think that values the whole again 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.699
 on there is a stable knew and 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.699
 Of course, we still have to 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.789
 take care of the inside of the et 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:43.830
 you take a new band and we want 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.280
 whence ye do know that determines 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.409
 all there - and from the pen holder it 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.479
 Tend something in the trees page 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.340
 usually a rubber band is there 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.379
 then stop the donors 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 and we will be so relative here 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:58.940
 get stuck in the middle 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.789
 I already have a pen here 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.500
 plugged in and it really looks 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.030
 I think from the case I wanted 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.550
 originally actually continuous 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.169
 make the band but since you have a 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.110
 want want is that I think better 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.210
 if I leave here in the middle gap 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.099
 and then on the right and left 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.590
 divide what he might do 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:33.849
 should be what i have completely forgotten 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:36.560
 if you want to record that then 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:39.050
 This is best done before you film 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.310
 attached to the bag then both goes 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.889
 easier at the beginning I was lucky now 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.870
 that is not visible to the outside 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.400
 yes my luck but it is definitely 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.199
 a bit awkward and I have it 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.690
 somehow forgotten so does it in 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:53.270
 each case only to the felt and lives 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:56.780
 The fans then on the bag that as 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.479
 Tip by the way and then if you 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.130
 The corners here folded and then sticks 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.080
 you can also like to with the 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.469
 iron temporarily that too 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.659
 is already fixed and now we only have to 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:13.350
 still the whole one want like that 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:15.970
 looks and then 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.250
 still attach it so that too 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.400
 beautiful as it looks ever rolled 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.229
 from but of course does not count it goes 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.940
 again, that's why we have to get there 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.960
 think again and I thought so 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:33.389
 only wall and there I count just like that 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.389
 attach so the piece 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.230
 So you either take it one day 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.419
 this 3d does not matter 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.350
 and then the whole thing is attached to the 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:51.639
 best double location so that all here 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.639
 so the middle divides 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.680
 anyone can just sew on 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.959
 I really was my life again 

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:13.999
 I'm sure I can play 

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.679
 comes pretty cool things out of that 

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:18.649
 Of course you can also do it with fabric 

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:21.110
 but just make the technology with the 

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:22.789
 bag i found pretty cool because after 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.739
 you did that and it works 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.599
 as you can see, you can do that 

00:07:24.739 --> 00:07:29.179
 do everything possible as it were 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:31.579
 I also use fabric 

00:07:29.179 --> 00:07:34.309
 the optics pretty course has something legal 

00:07:31.579 --> 00:07:36.439
 is and somehow also sony with pressure 

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:39.619
 So it even looks like one 

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:40.219
 snake brewster and I'm pretty 

00:07:39.619 --> 00:07:42.169
 cool 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:43.819
 I hope you like it also let me 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.139
 In any case, a thumb is allowed if you 

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:47.269
 the first time you have turned on then 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:49.159
 let me be happy abo that let me happy 

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:51.289
 I have a lot of comments for example 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:52.639
 really care what you have 

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.279
 other made of it 

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.599
 yes, there comes a lot together 

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:58.579
 I like reading it then 

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:00.169
 otherwise you will see more videos from 

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:02.329
 me to two of me are already here 

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:05.169
 and I hope you are that 

00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:05.169
 again next time
