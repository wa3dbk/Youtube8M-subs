gives<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.299> a<00:02:21.360> little<00:02:21.569> round<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.019> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
gives it a little round in that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.690 
gives it a little round in that
direction<00:02:22.379> and<00:02:23.010> then<00:02:23.819> you<00:02:23.939> pull<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.810> way

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
direction and then you pull this way

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.770 
direction and then you pull this way
gives<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.909> little<00:02:27.120> round<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.599> that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
gives it a little round in that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.460 
gives it a little round in that
direction<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.879> little<00:02:30.409> you<00:02:31.409> have

a little round on it you can see and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.839 
a little round on it you can see and
then<00:02:34.650> you<00:02:34.769> take<00:02:34.980> your<00:02:35.129> boards<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.610> put<00:02:35.849> them

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
then you take your boards and put them

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.190 
then you take your boards and put them
about<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.879> quarter<00:02:39.359> of<00:02:39.390> an<00:02:39.569> inch<00:02:40.760> below<00:02:42.200> the

stitching so that you have your area for

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.160 
stitching so that you have your area for
your<00:02:47.700> hinge<00:02:49.250> get<00:02:50.250> my<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.569> can<00:02:51.690> kind<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.930> see

your hinge get my so you can kind of see
where<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.650> it's<00:02:53.129> going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.400> be<00:02:53.579> a<00:02:55.310> little<00:02:56.310> bit

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
where it it's going to be a little bit

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.740 
where it it's going to be a little bit
below<00:02:56.819> there<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.150> that's<00:02:57.389> where<00:02:57.629> you're

below there and that's where you're

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.809 
below there and that's where you're
going<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.959> do<00:02:58.739> your<00:02:58.920> round<00:02:59.190> you<00:02:59.430> want<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.670> line

going to do your round you want to line

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.699 
going to do your round you want to line
it<00:02:59.849> up<00:03:00.030> on<00:03:00.239> both<00:03:00.420> sides<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:01.109> it's<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> same

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
it up on both sides so it's the same

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.020 
it up on both sides so it's the same
trying<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.799> do<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.040> quickly<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:05.819> not<00:03:05.970> a

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
trying to do this quickly so it's not a

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.869 
trying to do this quickly so it's not a
fifteen<00:03:06.510> minute<00:03:06.750> video<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:10.700> use<00:03:11.700> my

fifteen minute video and I use my

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.250 
fifteen minute video and I use my
finishing<00:03:12.209> press<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:12.750> small<00:03:12.989> books

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
sure that round is even on both sides

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.770 
sure that round is even on both sides
here<00:03:21.109> I<00:03:22.250> use<00:03:23.250> my<00:03:23.430> finishing<00:03:23.790> press<00:03:24.150> easier

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
here I use my finishing press easier

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.309 
here I use my finishing press easier
than<00:03:26.090> getting<00:03:27.090> out<00:03:27.209> my<00:03:27.329> backing<00:03:27.780> press<00:03:28.049> but

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
than getting out my backing press but

than getting out my backing press but
you<00:03:28.349> do<00:03:28.709> have<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.040> use<00:03:29.160> for<00:03:29.340> larger<00:03:29.609> books<00:03:29.819> and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
you do have to use for larger books and

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.360 
you do have to use for larger books and
then<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.180> slide<00:03:30.419> it<00:03:30.569> down<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.319> line<00:03:32.160> the

time<00:06:19.500> you're<00:06:19.860> going<00:06:19.950> to<00:06:20.010> get<00:06:20.210> see<00:06:21.210> what<00:06:21.360> I'm

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
time you're going to get see what I'm

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.230 
time you're going to get see what I'm
going<00:06:21.660> for<00:06:21.810> here<00:06:22.160> and<00:06:23.160> you<00:06:23.490> can<00:06:23.610> see<00:06:23.880> how<00:06:24.180> you

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
going for here and you can see how you

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.380 
going for here and you can see how you
have<00:06:24.360> your<00:06:24.690> round<00:06:24.990> and<00:06:25.350> you<00:06:25.410> have<00:06:25.590> your<00:06:25.860> hinge

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.550 

this<00:06:30.390> one's<00:06:30.630> a<00:06:30.720> little<00:06:30.840> tough<00:06:31.169> because<00:06:31.320> it's

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
this one's a little tough because it's

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.100 
this one's a little tough because it's
so<00:06:31.740> thin<00:06:32.130> a<00:06:32.400> lot<00:06:33.000> of<00:06:33.150> times<00:06:33.360> I<00:06:33.510> can't<00:06:33.840> get<00:06:33.960> that

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
so thin a lot of times I can't get that

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.490 
so thin a lot of times I can't get that
final<00:06:34.410> hinge<00:06:35.660> then<00:06:36.660> I'll<00:06:36.780> just<00:06:36.960> work<00:06:37.169> it<00:06:37.350> by

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
final hinge then I'll just work it by

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.360 
final hinge then I'll just work it by
hand<00:06:37.830> and<00:06:38.100> pull<00:06:39.090> it<00:06:39.830> get<00:06:40.830> it<00:06:40.950> to<00:06:41.070> where<00:06:41.250> I<00:06:41.280> want

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
hand and pull it get it to where I want

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.280 
hand and pull it get it to where I want
it<00:06:41.640> to<00:06:41.760> go<00:06:42.680> so<00:06:43.680> I<00:06:43.710> have<00:06:43.919> a<00:06:43.950> nice<00:06:44.190> strong<00:06:45.290> hinge

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
it to go so I have a nice strong hinge

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.610 
it to go so I have a nice strong hinge
there<00:06:46.680> this<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:46.980> a<00:06:47.010> crucial<00:06:47.550> part<00:06:48.110> the<00:06:49.110> process

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
there this is a crucial part the process

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.510 
there this is a crucial part the process
for<00:06:49.830> the<00:06:49.890> book<00:06:50.070> to<00:06:50.220> function<00:06:50.700> properly<00:06:52.040> then

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.830 

so<00:06:56.520> you<00:06:56.580> see<00:06:56.880> what<00:06:57.060> you<00:06:57.180> have<00:06:57.330> there<00:06:57.600> you<00:06:57.720> have

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
so you see what you have there you have

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.760 
so you see what you have there you have
a<00:06:57.870> good<00:06:58.110> round<00:06:58.970> and<00:07:00.470> something<00:07:01.470> to<00:07:01.560> work<00:07:01.740> with

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
a good round and something to work with

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.370 
a good round and something to work with
and<00:07:01.979> then<00:07:02.220> at<00:07:02.370> this<00:07:02.520> point<00:07:02.990> you're<00:07:03.990> ready<00:07:04.020> to
