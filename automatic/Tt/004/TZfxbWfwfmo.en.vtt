00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
on to deliver and perform there and i'm

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.700

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
sure you'll rise to the challenge

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.350 
sure you'll rise to the challenge
because<00:01:29.009> i<00:01:29.310> can't<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.970> anyone<00:01:30.180> better

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
because i can't think of anyone better

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.910 
because i can't think of anyone better
equipped<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.960> country<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.409> do<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
equipped in this country to do it and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
equipped in this country to do it and
then<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.189> means<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.549> DC<00:01:32.939> comes<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.360> sits

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
then that means that DC comes and sits

gems<00:01:51.149> from<00:01:51.360> Eddie<00:01:51.570> Jordan<00:01:51.869> after<00:01:52.320> David's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649

gone<00:01:52.770> off<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> commentary<00:01:53.520> box<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
gone off to the commentary box and I

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.950 
gone off to the commentary box and I
think<00:01:54.030> that's<00:01:54.180> good<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.479> Eddie<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.780> well

think that's good for Eddie as well

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.420 
think that's good for Eddie as well
because<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.229> gives<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.560> chance<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.070> him<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.310> do

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
because it gives a chance to him to do

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.100 
because it gives a chance to him to do
his<00:01:56.610> own<00:01:56.729> thing<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> think<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.899> everybody

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
bull will come out of the blocks firing

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.600 
bull will come out of the blocks firing
again<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:50.680> take<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.950> fight<00:05:51.130> to<00:05:51.160> them<00:05:51.370> so<00:05:51.520> I'm

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
again and take the fight to them so I'm

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.770 
again and take the fight to them so I'm
looking<00:05:51.760> forward<00:05:51.910> to<00:05:52.240> seeing<00:05:52.480> some

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
looking forward to seeing some

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.450 
looking forward to seeing some
interesting<00:05:53.170> technical<00:05:53.440> advances<00:05:54.100> you<00:05:54.340> know

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
interesting technical advances you know

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.610 
interesting technical advances you know
the<00:05:54.580> curves<00:05:54.850> and<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.330> movable<00:05:55.990> real<00:05:56.200> wings<00:05:56.440> I

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
the curves and the movable real wings I

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.690 
the curves and the movable real wings I
think<00:05:56.740> they<00:05:56.800> think<00:05:56.920> we'll<00:05:57.070> have<00:05:57.160> another<00:05:57.340> F

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
think they think we'll have another F

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.700 
think they think we'll have another F
kind<00:05:58.210> of<00:05:58.300> story<00:05:58.510> I<00:05:58.720> think<00:05:58.960> so<00:05:59.140> i<00:05:59.380> think<00:05:59.560> that

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
kind of story I think so i think that

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.840 
kind of story I think so i think that
seems<00:05:59.950> to<00:06:00.070> be<00:06:00.100> the<00:06:00.160> way<00:06:00.310> it's<00:06:00.430> going<00:06:00.610> at<00:06:00.760> the

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
seems to be the way it's going at the

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.580 
seems to be the way it's going at the
moment<00:06:00.880> we<00:06:01.210> had<00:06:01.300> a<00:06:01.330> double<00:06:01.600> diffuser<00:06:01.990> in<00:06:02.410> the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
moment we had a double diffuser in the

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.200 
moment we had a double diffuser in the
previous<00:06:02.890> year<00:06:03.100> then<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.370> effort<00:06:03.670> last<00:06:03.820> year

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
previous year then the effort last year

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.880 
previous year then the effort last year
and<00:06:04.600> maybe<00:06:04.840> mclaren<00:06:05.380> it<00:06:05.470> delaying<00:06:05.740> their

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
and maybe mclaren it delaying their

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.200 
and maybe mclaren it delaying their
launch<00:06:06.070> because<00:06:06.250> they've<00:06:06.430> got<00:06:06.580> a<00:06:06.760> sneaky

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
launch because they've got a sneaky

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.940 
launch because they've got a sneaky
little<00:06:07.330> part<00:06:07.600> on<00:06:07.750> their<00:06:07.870> car<00:06:08.080> they<00:06:08.110> don't<00:06:08.830> want

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
little part on their car they don't want

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.100 
little part on their car they don't want
others<00:06:09.190> others<00:06:09.760> to<00:06:09.910> see<00:06:10.120> and<00:06:10.570> I've<00:06:10.870> you<00:06:11.080> know

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
others others to see and I've you know

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.480 
others others to see and I've you know
people<00:06:11.440> don't<00:06:11.530> saying<00:06:11.830> all<00:06:11.980> are<00:06:12.130> we<00:06:12.220> seeing

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
people don't saying all are we seeing

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.820 
people don't saying all are we seeing
almost<00:06:13.090> a<00:06:13.330> false<00:06:13.630> formula<00:06:14.200> one<00:06:14.350> here<00:06:14.560> because

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
almost a false formula one here because

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.380 
almost a false formula one here because
if<00:06:15.130> you're<00:06:15.310> pressing<00:06:15.610> a<00:06:15.760> button<00:06:15.790> to<00:06:16.030> overtake

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
if you're pressing a button to overtake

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.330 
if you're pressing a button to overtake
is<00:06:16.540> that<00:06:16.690> skillful<00:06:17.170> I<00:06:17.410> think<00:06:17.800> the<00:06:17.890> skill<00:06:18.160> the

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
is that skillful I think the skill the

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.260 
is that skillful I think the skill the
shoe<00:06:18.490> is<00:06:18.550> going<00:06:18.670> to<00:06:18.730> be<00:06:18.820> in<00:06:18.910> the<00:06:19.000> clever

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
shoe is going to be in the clever

shoe is going to be in the clever
drivers<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:20.200> know<00:06:20.290> being<00:06:20.560> close<00:06:20.800> enough<00:06:21.010> to

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
drivers you know being close enough to

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.010

use<00:06:21.310> the<00:06:21.490> real<00:06:21.700> wing<00:06:21.940> knowing<00:06:22.570> when<00:06:22.690> to<00:06:22.720> press

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
use the real wing knowing when to press

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.480 
use the real wing knowing when to press
that<00:06:23.200> curves<00:06:23.440> button<00:06:23.830> using<00:06:24.040> it<00:06:24.220> to<00:06:24.370> defend

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:24.490 
that curves button using it to defend

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.340 
that curves button using it to defend
and<00:06:24.820> don't<00:06:24.970> forget<00:06:25.240> it's<00:06:25.780> still<00:06:25.960> the<00:06:26.050> rest<00:06:26.200> of

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
and don't forget it's still the rest of

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:27.750 
and don't forget it's still the rest of
the<00:06:26.440> track<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.680> do<00:06:26.860> the<00:06:26.950> proper<00:06:27.160> rating<00:06:27.640> as

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
the track to do the proper rating as

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.130 
the track to do the proper rating as
well<00:06:27.910> as<00:06:28.090> yeah<00:06:28.330> as<00:06:28.510> well<00:06:28.720> as<00:06:28.810> the<00:06:28.870> sort<00:06:29.080> of

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
well as yeah as well as the sort of

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.470 
well as yeah as well as the sort of
artificial<00:06:30.040> stuff<00:06:30.370> if<00:06:30.550> you<00:06:30.640> like<00:06:30.820> so<00:06:31.360> I<00:06:31.390> think

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:31.480 
artificial stuff if you like so I think

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.940 
artificial stuff if you like so I think
it<00:06:31.660> isn't<00:06:31.780> going<00:06:31.990> to<00:06:32.050> detract<00:06:32.410> from<00:06:32.530> it<00:06:32.680> at<00:06:32.800> all

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
it isn't going to detract from it at all

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.409 
it isn't going to detract from it at all
and<00:06:33.160> if<00:06:33.250> you're<00:06:33.430> into<00:06:33.640> your<00:06:33.760> technical<00:06:34.120> stuff

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
and if you're into your technical stuff

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.300 
and if you're into your technical stuff
you'll<00:06:35.020> love<00:06:35.230> knowing<00:06:35.620> about<00:06:35.740> the<00:06:35.950> curves<00:06:36.160> and

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
you'll love knowing about the curves and

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:37.860 
you'll love knowing about the curves and
how<00:06:36.400> it<00:06:36.520> operates<00:06:36.940> and<00:06:37.150> who<00:06:37.240> can<00:06:37.510> and<00:06:37.690> can't

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
how it operates and who can and can't

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.230 
how it operates and who can and can't
operate<00:06:38.290> it<00:06:38.560> very<00:06:38.740> well<00:06:38.919> as<00:06:39.100> a<00:06:39.130> driver<00:06:39.460> and<00:06:39.940> if

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
operate it very well as a driver and if

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.940 
operate it very well as a driver and if
you<00:06:40.630> like<00:06:40.810> my<00:06:40.960> mom<00:06:41.140> and<00:06:41.169> you<00:06:41.380> just<00:06:41.560> watch<00:06:41.710> it
