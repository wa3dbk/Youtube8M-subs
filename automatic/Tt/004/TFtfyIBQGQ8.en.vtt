00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
black that that doesn't mean you can

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.370 
black that that doesn't mean you can
have<00:01:44.399> legitimate<00:01:44.939> policy<00:01:45.119> we<00:01:45.840> complain<00:01:46.259> about

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
have legitimate policy we complain about

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.630 
have legitimate policy we complain about
all<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:47.549> have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
all the time you know you can have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
legitimate policy issues with the guy

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.830 
legitimate policy issues with the guy
and<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.490> doesn't<00:01:50.790> mean<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> based<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.509> race

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and that doesn't mean it's based in race

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.480 
and that doesn't mean it's based in race
so<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.530> she<00:01:52.770> wants<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.310> some

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
so that she wants it to be in some

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.060 
so that she wants it to be in some
perfect<00:01:53.909> world<00:01:54.149> where<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:55.020> only<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.770> but

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
perfect world where that is only it but

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.230 
perfect world where that is only it but
that's<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.700> world<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.000> live<00:01:57.180> in

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that's just not the world we live in

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.910 
that's just not the world we live in
well<00:01:57.420> they<00:01:57.540> will<00:01:57.689> never<00:01:57.899> ever<00:01:58.229> admit<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.890> I

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
well they will never ever admit that I

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.289 
well they will never ever admit that I
think<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.430> something<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.850> they

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
think that that's something that they

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.120 
think that that's something that they
realized<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.350> Republicans<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
realized that the Republicans and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.399 
realized that the Republicans and
conservatives<00:02:02.670> realize<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.509> constantly

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
conservatives realize this is constantly

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.319 
conservatives realize this is constantly
lobbed<00:02:04.950> upon<00:02:05.340> them<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.909> think<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.180> there

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
lobbed upon them and I think that there

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.960 
lobbed upon them and I think that there
is<00:02:06.360> justification<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.979> obviously<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
is justification for for obviously that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.430 
is justification for for obviously that
there<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.270> still<00:02:09.509> racism<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.259> are

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
there is still racism and there are

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.309 
there is still racism and there are
segments<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
segments of the

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.539 
segments of the
elation<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.739> will<00:02:11.950> vote<00:02:12.069> against<00:02:12.430> him

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
elation that will vote against him

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.369 
elation that will vote against him
because<00:02:12.670> he's<00:02:12.939> black<00:02:13.120> but<00:02:13.180> he<00:02:13.659> also<00:02:13.870> said

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
because he's black but he also said

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.259 
because he's black but he also said
there<00:02:14.620> are<00:02:15.040> some<00:02:15.489> segments<00:02:15.909> of<00:02:15.969> the<00:02:16.090> black

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
there are some segments of the black

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.610 
there are some segments of the black
population<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:17.019> will<00:02:17.170> vote<00:02:17.319> for<00:02:17.499> him

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
population that will vote for him

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.530 
population that will vote for him
because<00:02:17.769> he's<00:02:18.099> black<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.340> she<00:02:19.060> wouldn't<00:02:19.239> even

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
because he's black so she wouldn't even

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.509 
because he's black so she wouldn't even
acknowledge<00:02:20.049> that<00:02:20.620> part<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.189> know<00:02:21.280> I<00:02:21.310> think

acknowledge that part you know I think

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.059 
acknowledge that part you know I think
that<00:02:21.849> for<00:02:22.120> for<00:02:22.359> Obama<00:02:22.629> just<00:02:23.200> being<00:02:23.439> black<00:02:23.799> is

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
that for for Obama just being black is

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.739 
that for for Obama just being black is
playing<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.489> race<00:02:24.670> card<00:02:24.700> for<00:02:25.389> these<00:02:25.540> people

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
playing the race card for these people

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.809

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
people than there were before President

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.969 
people than there were before President
Obama<00:05:34.839> took<00:05:35.020> office<00:05:35.169> so<00:05:35.680> if<00:05:35.800> you're<00:05:35.919> gonna

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
Obama took office so if you're gonna

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.230 
Obama took office so if you're gonna
play<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.430> race<00:05:36.550> card<00:05:36.580> at<00:05:36.879> least<00:05:37.060> we'd<00:05:37.210> have

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
play the race card at least we'd have

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.600 
play the race card at least we'd have
some<00:05:37.599> evidence<00:05:38.020> of<00:05:38.199> it<00:05:38.500> being<00:05:38.680> played<00:05:39.069> but

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
some evidence of it being played but

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.180 
some evidence of it being played but
actually<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:40.089> don't<00:05:40.330> see<00:05:40.750> any<00:05:40.900> mama<00:05:41.289> has<00:05:41.710> done

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
actually I don't see any mama has done

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.360 
actually I don't see any mama has done
nothing<00:05:42.789> when<00:05:43.479> it<00:05:43.509> comes<00:05:43.839> to<00:05:44.199> uh<00:05:44.589> certain

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
nothing when it comes to uh certain

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.070 
nothing when it comes to uh certain
disparities<00:05:46.000> between<00:05:46.240> black<00:05:46.690> people<00:05:46.719> and

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
disparities between black people and

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.899 
disparities between black people and
white<00:05:47.199> people<00:05:47.319> and<00:05:48.039> I<00:05:48.279> think<00:05:48.310> part<00:05:48.759> of<00:05:48.819> the

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
white people and I think part of the

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.519 
white people and I think part of the
reason<00:05:48.939> why<00:05:49.210> he<00:05:49.659> hasn't<00:05:49.900> done<00:05:50.110> anything<00:05:50.169> is

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
reason why he hasn't done anything is

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:52.800 
reason why he hasn't done anything is
because<00:05:50.650> he's<00:05:50.949> worried<00:05:51.430> that<00:05:51.699> he's<00:05:52.419> gonna<00:05:52.599> get

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
because he's worried that he's gonna get

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.600 
because he's worried that he's gonna get
that<00:05:52.990> criticism<00:05:53.500> from<00:05:54.009> the<00:05:54.129> most<00:05:54.310> right-wing

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
that criticism from the most right-wing

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.939 
that criticism from the most right-wing
opponents<00:05:55.539> right<00:05:55.719> so<00:05:56.139> for<00:05:56.500> instance<00:05:56.529> you

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
opponents right so for instance you

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.709 
opponents right so for instance you
mentioned<00:05:57.279> uh<00:05:57.339> wealth<00:05:58.000> inequality<00:05:58.539> and

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
mentioned uh wealth inequality and

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.230 
mentioned uh wealth inequality and
income<00:05:59.229> inequality<00:05:59.259> that<00:06:00.159> gap<00:06:00.490> is<00:06:00.669> definitely

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
income inequality that gap is definitely

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.820 
income inequality that gap is definitely
widening<00:06:01.689> right<00:06:01.930> and<00:06:02.139> Obama<00:06:02.379> hasn't<00:06:02.620> done

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
widening right and Obama hasn't done

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.499 
widening right and Obama hasn't done
much<00:06:03.009> to<00:06:03.250> address<00:06:03.550> it<00:06:03.729> now<00:06:04.000> you<00:06:04.060> can<00:06:04.240> make<00:06:04.360> an

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
much to address it now you can make an

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.059 
much to address it now you can make an
argument<00:06:04.599> that<00:06:04.960> it's<00:06:05.169> because<00:06:05.500> of<00:06:05.529> you<00:06:05.949> know

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:06.069 
argument that it's because of you know

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:07.890 
argument that it's because of you know
his<00:06:06.250> corporate<00:06:06.639> donors<00:06:07.089> and<00:06:07.389> money<00:06:07.750> in

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
amount of them are uh imprisoned under

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.839 
amount of them are uh imprisoned under
our<00:06:20.199> justice<00:06:20.650> system<00:06:20.680> right<00:06:21.370> for<00:06:21.400> doing<00:06:21.759> the

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
our justice system right for doing the

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:23.399 
our justice system right for doing the
exact<00:06:22.060> same<00:06:22.089> activities<00:06:22.810> that<00:06:22.960> why<00:06:23.110> people

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
exact same activities that why people

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.409 
exact same activities that why people
are<00:06:23.529> doing<00:06:23.740> so<00:06:24.159> marijuana<00:06:24.879> use<00:06:25.089> is<00:06:25.120> one

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
are doing so marijuana use is one

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:27.029 
are doing so marijuana use is one
example<00:06:25.539> that<00:06:25.930> I<00:06:25.990> throw<00:06:26.199> out<00:06:26.319> there<00:06:26.560> you<00:06:26.889> know

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
example that I throw out there you know

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.159 
example that I throw out there you know
so<00:06:27.250> these<00:06:27.580> are<00:06:27.759> all<00:06:27.880> issues<00:06:28.180> that<00:06:28.719> he's<00:06:28.899> never

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
so these are all issues that he's never

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.689 
so these are all issues that he's never
addressed<00:06:29.620> and<00:06:29.949> I<00:06:30.250> think<00:06:30.459> that<00:06:30.580> it's

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
addressed and I think that it's

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:31.740 
addressed and I think that it's
problematic

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
problematic

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.450 
problematic
and<00:06:31.840> I<00:06:32.020> think<00:06:32.140> that<00:06:32.530> he's<00:06:32.740> worried<00:06:33.100> about<00:06:33.280> that

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:33.460 
and I think that he's worried about that

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.980 
and I think that he's worried about that
criticism<00:06:33.880> and<00:06:34.300> you<00:06:34.420> know<00:06:34.510> I<00:06:34.570> think<00:06:34.690> you<00:06:34.870> could

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
criticism and you know I think you could

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.690 
criticism and you know I think you could
also<00:06:35.140> argue<00:06:35.410> that<00:06:35.590> when<00:06:35.830> you<00:06:35.980> have<00:06:36.250> a<00:06:36.280> certain

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:36.700 
also argue that when you have a certain

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.120 
also argue that when you have a certain
ethnic<00:06:37.210> group<00:06:37.480> a<00:06:37.630> religious<00:06:38.080> group<00:06:38.290> uh<00:06:38.740> in

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
ethnic group a religious group uh in

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.280 
ethnic group a religious group uh in
your<00:06:39.340> pocket<00:06:39.760> no<00:06:40.030> matter<00:06:40.210> what<00:06:40.480> you<00:06:41.020> don't

your pocket no matter what you don't

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.650 
your pocket no matter what you don't
have<00:06:41.470> to<00:06:41.620> do<00:06:41.830> anything<00:06:42.130> for<00:06:42.520> them<00:06:42.760> so<00:06:43.300> it's

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
have to do anything for them so it's

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.120 
have to do anything for them so it's
true<00:06:43.750> I<00:06:43.960> mean<00:06:44.260> it<00:06:44.380> really<00:06:44.410> is<00:06:44.620> true<00:06:44.860> so<00:06:45.070> you

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
true I mean it really is true so you

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.470 
true I mean it really is true so you
know<00:06:45.340> something<00:06:45.460> like<00:06:45.730> ninety<00:06:46.030> percent<00:06:46.150> of

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
know something like ninety percent of

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.960 
know something like ninety percent of
black<00:06:46.690> people<00:06:46.990> voted<00:06:47.320> for<00:06:47.350> Obama<00:06:48.010> so<00:06:48.730> in<00:06:48.910> a

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
black people voted for Obama so in a

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.610 
black people voted for Obama so in a
weird<00:06:49.210> way<00:06:49.330> he<00:06:49.690> always<00:06:49.870> them<00:06:50.140> nothing<00:06:50.500> well

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
weird way he always them nothing well

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.560 
weird way he always them nothing well
now<00:06:50.710> he's<00:06:50.890> not<00:06:51.010> running<00:06:51.190> for<00:06:51.430> re-election<00:06:51.640> but

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
now he's not running for re-election but

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.330 
now he's not running for re-election but
in<00:06:52.720> another<00:06:52.810> way<00:06:53.020> if<00:06:53.170> he<00:06:53.350> knew<00:06:53.590> going<00:06:53.920> into<00:06:54.160> the

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
in another way if he knew going into the

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.130 
in another way if he knew going into the
last<00:06:54.490> election<00:06:55.000> that<00:06:55.330> they<00:06:55.510> were<00:06:55.750> gonna<00:06:55.900> vote

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.140 
last election that they were gonna vote

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.170 
last election that they were gonna vote
for<00:06:56.170> him<00:06:56.470> in<00:06:56.560> huge<00:06:56.920> numbers<00:06:57.160> regardless<00:06:58.000> well

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
for him in huge numbers regardless well

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.520 
for him in huge numbers regardless well
then<00:06:58.360> it<00:06:58.450> shows<00:06:58.690> why<00:06:58.870> he<00:06:58.990> didn't<00:06:59.140> have<00:06:59.230> to<00:06:59.320> do

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
then it shows why he didn't have to do

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.770 
then it shows why he didn't have to do
much<00:06:59.560> for<00:07:00.370> the<00:07:00.550> mid<00:07:00.670> the<00:07:00.790> first<00:07:01.030> time<00:07:01.300> around<00:07:01.450> i

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
much for the mid the first time around i

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.600 
much for the mid the first time around i
know<00:07:02.020> that's<00:07:02.230> a<00:07:02.320> little<00:07:02.350> a<00:07:02.830> little<00:07:02.980> cynical<00:07:03.370> to

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
know that's a little a little cynical to

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.950 
know that's a little a little cynical to
look<00:07:03.730> at<00:07:03.820> it<00:07:03.910> that<00:07:04.030> way<00:07:04.060> but<00:07:04.210> I<00:07:04.419> I<00:07:04.600> think

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
look at it that way but I I think

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.480 
look at it that way but I I think
there's<00:07:05.110> some<00:07:05.200> truth<00:07:05.350> any<00:07:05.860> kind<00:07:06.070> of<00:07:06.190> reminds

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
there's some truth any kind of reminds

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.100 
there's some truth any kind of reminds
me<00:07:06.610> of<00:07:06.730> why<00:07:06.970> Obama<00:07:07.419> always<00:07:07.720> comes<00:07:07.960> to

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
me of why Obama always comes to

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.870 
me of why Obama always comes to
California<00:07:08.710> just<00:07:09.070> to<00:07:09.190> raise<00:07:09.370> money<00:07:09.580> and<00:07:09.730> then

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
California just to raise money and then

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.400 
California just to raise money and then
he<00:07:09.970> leaves<00:07:10.240> he<00:07:10.510> never<00:07:10.660> gives<00:07:10.960> a<00:07:11.050> speech<00:07:11.230> he

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 
he leaves he never gives a speech he

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.930 
he leaves he never gives a speech he
never<00:07:11.830> you<00:07:12.370> know<00:07:12.490> meets<00:07:12.700> with<00:07:12.850> the

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
never you know meets with the

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.730 
never you know meets with the
constituents<00:07:13.660> here<00:07:13.870> and<00:07:14.200> then<00:07:14.320> part<00:07:14.620> of<00:07:14.680> the

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
constituents here and then part of the

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.440 
constituents here and then part of the
reason<00:07:14.950> why<00:07:15.070> is<00:07:15.130> because<00:07:15.390> California<00:07:16.390> is

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
reason why is because California is

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.880 
reason why is because California is
always<00:07:16.780> gonna<00:07:16.960> vote<00:07:17.169> for<00:07:17.200> the<00:07:17.470> Democratic

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 
always gonna vote for the Democratic

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.330 
always gonna vote for the Democratic
candidate<00:07:18.340> that's<00:07:18.640> just<00:07:18.850> the<00:07:18.940> way<00:07:19.090> it<00:07:19.210> works
