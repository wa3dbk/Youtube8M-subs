 make a delicious cream 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.750
 spinach 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.809

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.110
 prepare it do not miss in the next 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.110
 video 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.900
 the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.899
 to prepare this delicious cream 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.120
 spinach for four people are four 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.980
 chicken broth cups 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.920
 a cup of milk 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.600
 half a pound of spinach previously 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.170
 gone through ice water so that it 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.170
 hold firm 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.260
 and bright green 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:03.329
 half carrot paprika a little bit of 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.810
 onion two potatoes small things 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.790
 or if everything is previously cooked this 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.000
 will serve as the basis of our 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.000
 weather 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.399
 for the base we also need 2 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.399
 teaspoons of linate 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.600
 and I say that they will give us the consistency 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.770
 who needs our cream and half 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 spoonful of sugar 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.080
 once we have all our 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.150
 ingredients and what we are going to do is 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.450
 put to heat the broth again 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:43.710
 chicken and when you have boiling we are going to 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.700
 add the spinach for three minutes without 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.700
 stop stirring 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.810
 It is important to clarify that the broth 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.800
 let's divide into two two cups the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.830
 let's put to heat 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.830
 the other two cups are going to be left in 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.840
 the container and we will use them 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.619
 later when we are finishing 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.010
 of stirring let's take it out little by little in 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.840
 the spinach leaves of the broth until 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.989
 remove them completely 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.319
 we put in a container so that it 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.319
 cool 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.930
 when the spinach has settled 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.870
 what we are going to do is pour all the 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.090
 ingredients to the blender one by one 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.330
 first let's add the broth 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.330
 chicken 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.100
 the milk 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.240
 spinach 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.250
 we also take the chicken broth that 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 remains in the container 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:10.090
 and let's add the carrot 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:10.090
 paprika the potato and the little piece of that 8 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.450
 and the two tablespoons of flour 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.360
 let's move on 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.310
 Mix 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.760
 we have to wait until the 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.760
 Blender content is fine 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.270
 well mixed 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.130
 we see how the mixture goes 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.380
 putting up 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.230
 of that shade of green that gives you the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.290
 the spinach and meanwhile our 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.040
 chicken broth continues 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.040
 typing 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.500
 when the mixture is already in the blender 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.959
 what we are going to do is incorporate it into 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.270
 chicken broth that we let go seeing 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.570
 previously 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.260
 and we mix it well 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.440
 and we revolve it 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.840
 at this time it is very important not 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.690
 stop stirring during the next 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.820
 five minutes because because if we stop 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:37.390
 of stirring and we can get on the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.370
 mix by the heat and we can create a 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.590
 disaster everything can come out of the 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.590
 cooking pot 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.590
 we come back 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.160
 after 5 minutes we go and our 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.700
 fire cream 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:58.090
 let it rest a few seconds and the 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.090
 we serve 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.530
 either hot 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.590
 to enjoy it and the cream 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.100
 We can accompany of 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:16.270
 and some delicious pieces of bread 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:20.550
 previously hot or french fries 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.550
 thin and we're going 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.350
 a delicious entry for our 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.350
 foods
