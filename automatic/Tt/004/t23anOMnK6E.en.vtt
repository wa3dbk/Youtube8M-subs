00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
in the Western Conference I think

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.770 
in the Western Conference I think
sometimes<00:01:17.580> when<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.210> win<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.600> we

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
sometimes when you have a win like we

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.710 
sometimes when you have a win like we
had<00:01:18.960> down<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.170> LA<00:01:20.030> you<00:01:21.030> know<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.450> pretty

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
had down in LA you know you can pretty

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.300 
had down in LA you know you can pretty
much<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.350> know<00:01:22.380> stand<00:01:22.680> on<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:22.920> head<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
much you know stand on your head in a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850 
much you know stand on your head in a
locker<00:01:23.549> room<00:01:23.759> before<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.180> game<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> guys<00:01:24.860> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
locker room before the game the guys the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
locker room before the game the guys the
edge<00:01:26.009> sometimes<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.670> off<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> little<00:01:27.150> bit<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
edge sometimes is off a little bit and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.670 
edge sometimes is off a little bit and
you<00:01:27.509> try<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.840> keep<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.110> focused<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you try and keep them focused and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.649 
you try and keep them focused and
motivated<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.250> just<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.850> edges<00:01:30.180> off<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
motivated but just the edges off and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.569 
motivated but just the edges off and
obviously<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.740> know<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.040> didn't<00:01:32.280> start<00:01:32.460> off

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
obviously you know we didn't start off

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.450 
obviously you know we didn't start off
well<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.030> put<00:01:33.180> ourselves<00:01:33.299> behind<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:34.200> nothing

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
well we put ourselves behind one nothing

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.200 
well we put ourselves behind one nothing
but<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.490> think<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:35.880> our<00:01:35.970> first

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
but I think it's our first
