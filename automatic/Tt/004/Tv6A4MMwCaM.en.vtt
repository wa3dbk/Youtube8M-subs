centralizing<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.170> whole

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
centralizing and then the whole

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.569 
centralizing and then the whole

out things mall well and um kangaskhan

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
out things mall well and um kangaskhan
is<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:28.049> interesting<00:01:28.350> match<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.920> sometimes

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
is a very interesting match up sometimes

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
is a very interesting match up sometimes
and<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.640> mean<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.329> makes<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> where<00:01:30.810> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and I mean it just makes it to where you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
and I mean it just makes it to where you
bring<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.770> mega<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.759> either<00:01:32.880> stop<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> mega

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
bring your mega to either stop the mega

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
bring your mega to either stop the mega
or<00:01:33.780> take<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> lot<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.439> team<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.159> stop<00:01:35.369> you

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
or take out a lot of team to stop you

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.670 
or take out a lot of team to stop you
and<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.140> dynamic

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and I think that that's kind of dynamic

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.140 
and I think that that's kind of dynamic

pokemons going for mega Pokemon are
supposed<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.540> stronger<00:01:39.960> than<00:01:40.049> your

like<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.630> two<00:01:43.110> out<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.520> there's<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
like a two out of one like there's a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it's pure strength and how well you can

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.819 
it's pure strength and how well you can
use<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> kind<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.119> idea<00:01:51.420> or<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.500> gives<00:01:52.680> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
use it kind of idea or it just gives you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
use it kind of idea or it just gives you
a<00:01:53.040> much<00:01:53.610> more<00:01:53.880> diverse<00:01:54.090> handling<00:01:54.689> on<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
a much more diverse handling on the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.569 
a much more diverse handling on the
battle<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:55.920> ready<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.399> more

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
battle and that you're ready for more

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.370 
battle and that you're ready for more
situations<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.450> mega<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.259> have

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
situations with that mega so they have

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
situations with that mega so they have
to<00:01:58.500> use<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> lot<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.920> resources<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.520> take<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> out

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
to use a lot of resources to take it out

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.270 
to use a lot of resources to take it out
or<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:01.020> use<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.649> kind<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> either

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
or you use it to kind of either

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.069 
or you use it to kind of either
counteract<00:02:02.939> their<00:02:03.090> mega<00:02:03.299> or<00:02:03.540> really<00:02:03.750> weak<00:02:03.990> in

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
counteract their mega or really weak in

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.179 
counteract their mega or really weak in
their<00:02:04.259> mega<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> use<00:02:05.070> as

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
their mega so you don't have to use as

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.100 
their mega so you don't have to use as
many<00:02:05.280> resources<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.909> take<00:02:06.060> out<00:02:06.240> theirs<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
many resources to take out theirs and I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
many resources to take out theirs and I
think<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.740> brilliant<00:02:07.890> dynamic

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
think that that's a brilliant dynamic

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.240 
think that that's a brilliant dynamic
but<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.179> thing<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.660> smoke

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
but the thing is the smoke

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.470 
but the thing is the smoke
game<00:02:10.399> hasn't<00:02:10.640> understood<00:02:11.120> this<00:02:11.270> or

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
game hasn't understood this or

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.000 
game hasn't understood this or
stabilized<00:02:11.930> enough<00:02:12.200> to<00:02:12.410> really<00:02:12.620> figure<00:02:12.980> out

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
stabilized enough to really figure out

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.380 
stabilized enough to really figure out
how<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.250> handle<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.670> because<00:02:13.970> when<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.240> also

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
how to handle it because when you also

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.520 
how to handle it because when you also

all the things that should be benefiting

centralization<00:04:26.460> really<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.150> even<00:04:27.960> then

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
centralization really is and even then

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.680 
centralization really is and even then
it's<00:04:28.410> not<00:04:28.590> we<00:04:29.220> banned<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.700> top<00:04:29.970> 20<00:04:30.300> Pokemon

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
it's not we banned the top 20 Pokemon

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.240 
it's not we banned the top 20 Pokemon
we've<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.020> more<00:04:31.320> Pokemon<00:04:31.710> from<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.040> list

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
we've and more Pokemon from that list

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.780 
we've and more Pokemon from that list
it's<00:04:32.460> we<00:04:33.180> introduced<00:04:33.900> things<00:04:34.470> back<00:04:34.770> in<00:04:35.040> we<00:04:35.550> see

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
it's we introduced things back in we see

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.910 
it's we introduced things back in we see
how<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.120> reacts<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.750> then<00:04:37.050> we<00:04:37.170> figure<00:04:37.530> out<00:04:37.560> how

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
how it reacts and then we figure out how

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.590 
how it reacts and then we figure out how
to<00:04:37.980> go<00:04:38.160> from<00:04:38.340> there<00:04:38.520> instead<00:04:38.820> of<00:04:38.880> threat

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
to go from there instead of threat

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.360 
to go from there instead of threat
thread<00:04:39.900> threat<00:04:40.200> and<00:04:40.410> now<00:04:40.650> you're<00:04:40.830> creating<00:04:41.070> a

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
thread threat and now you're creating a

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.970 
thread threat and now you're creating a
reverse<00:04:41.940> tower<00:04:42.210> Creek<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:43.170> with<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.800> power

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
reverse tower Creek that with the power

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.460 
reverse tower Creek that with the power
level<00:04:44.430> overall<00:04:44.730> going<00:04:45.000> down<00:04:45.120> now<00:04:45.570> more<00:04:46.200> things

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
level overall going down now more things

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.830 
level overall going down now more things
can<00:04:46.800> start<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.550> become<00:04:47.700> convinced<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.570> that's

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
can start to become convinced and that's

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.510 
can start to become convinced and that's
where<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.200> true<00:04:49.380> over<00:04:49.650> centralization<00:04:50.340> laws

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
where the true over centralization laws

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.370 
where the true over centralization laws
not<00:04:51.030> when<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.270> have<00:04:51.420> all<00:04:51.720> these<00:04:51.870> things<00:04:51.930> that

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
not when you have all these things that

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.560 
not when you have all these things that
like<00:04:52.890> well<00:04:53.100> if<00:04:53.400> Kangaskhan<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.180> chilling<00:04:54.480> up

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
like well if Kangaskhan is chilling up

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.730 
like well if Kangaskhan is chilling up
here<00:04:54.750> there<00:04:54.930> might<00:04:55.080> be<00:04:55.110> something<00:04:55.560> down<00:04:55.710> here

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
here there might be something down here

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.800 
here there might be something down here
that<00:04:55.950> can<00:04:56.190> actually<00:04:56.430> stop<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:56.970> now<00:04:57.390> that<00:04:57.600> gets

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
that can actually stop it now that gets

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.050 
that can actually stop it now that gets
introduced<00:04:58.530> a<00:04:58.740> little<00:04:59.010> lower<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.550> then

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
introduced a little lower and then

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.120 
introduced a little lower and then
Kangaskhan<00:05:00.570> drops<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.990> bit<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.410> then<00:05:01.620> things

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
Kangaskhan drops a bit and then things

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.070 
Kangaskhan drops a bit and then things
start<00:05:02.430> messing<00:05:02.850> around<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.300> that's<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.750> fun

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
start messing around and that's the fun

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.900 
start messing around and that's the fun
and<00:05:04.350> excitement<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.950> meta<00:05:05.130> game<00:05:05.340> that<00:05:05.820> you

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
and excitement of a meta game that you

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.640 
and excitement of a meta game that you
have<00:05:06.030> to<00:05:06.180> build<00:05:06.419> your<00:05:06.540> team<00:05:06.750> several<00:05:07.110> times<00:05:07.440> in

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
have to build your team several times in

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.590 
have to build your team several times in
a<00:05:07.740> month<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.460> understand<00:05:09.060> what's<00:05:09.270> going<00:05:09.510> on

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
a month to understand what's going on

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.750 
a month to understand what's going on
that<00:05:09.750> you<00:05:09.810> can<00:05:10.140> really<00:05:10.980> make<00:05:11.280> it<00:05:11.310> go<00:05:11.550> and

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
that you can really make it go and

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.220 
that you can really make it go and
that's<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:12.030> also<00:05:12.270> another<00:05:12.600> thing<00:05:12.810> about<00:05:12.930> the

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
that's it also another thing about the

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.840 
that's it also another thing about the
new<00:05:13.410> generation<00:05:13.919> is<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.070> there's<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:14.700> many

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
new generation is that there's so many

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.909 
new generation is that there's so many
Pokemon<00:05:15.300> now<00:05:15.480> there's<00:05:15.900> no<00:05:16.050> true<00:05:16.380> anti<00:05:16.710> meta

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
Pokemon now there's no true anti meta

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.950 
Pokemon now there's no true anti meta
there's<00:05:17.370> no<00:05:17.550> true<00:05:17.760> Medic<00:05:18.090> even<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.600> I<00:05:18.780> think

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
there's no true Medic even and I think

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.300 
there's no true Medic even and I think
that's<00:05:19.110> why<00:05:19.260> Simone's<00:05:19.830> having<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.100> hard<00:05:20.250> time

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
that's why Simone's having a hard time

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.920 
that's why Simone's having a hard time
balancing<00:05:20.669> their<00:05:21.060> game<00:05:21.240> because<00:05:21.840> they

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
balancing their game because they

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.300 
balancing their game because they
haven't<00:05:22.080> rewritten<00:05:22.650> any<00:05:22.890> other<00:05:23.040> rules

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
haven't rewritten any other rules

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.340 
haven't rewritten any other rules
actually<00:05:23.840> contradicting<00:05:24.840> a<00:05:24.930> lot<00:05:25.080> of<00:05:25.200> their

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
actually contradicting a lot of their

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.320 
actually contradicting a lot of their
initial<00:05:26.070> thoughts<00:05:26.310> of<00:05:26.520> an<00:05:26.669> uber<00:05:27.060> that<00:05:27.210> they're

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
initial thoughts of an uber that they're

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.360 
initial thoughts of an uber that they're
having<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.630> like<00:05:27.780> rewrite<00:05:28.650> definitions<00:05:29.280> on

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
having to like rewrite definitions on

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.250 
having to like rewrite definitions on
the<00:05:29.460> fly<00:05:29.669> instead<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.180> just<00:05:30.330> overall<00:05:30.630> redefine

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
the fly instead of just overall redefine

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.170 
the fly instead of just overall redefine
their<00:05:31.410> meta<00:05:31.590> game<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.040> I<00:05:32.760> think<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:33.060> that's

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
their meta game and I think that that's

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.460 
their meta game and I think that that's
one<00:05:33.390> of<00:05:33.450> my<00:05:33.510> problems<00:05:33.870> as<00:05:33.960> well<00:05:34.080> that<00:05:34.290> they're

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
one of my problems as well that they're

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.320 
one of my problems as well that they're
kind<00:05:35.040> of<00:05:35.070> making<00:05:35.340> things<00:05:35.610> up<00:05:35.850> to<00:05:36.000> make<00:05:36.030> these

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
kind of making things up to make these

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.180 
kind of making things up to make these
bands<00:05:36.570> sound<00:05:36.930> useful<00:05:37.620> when<00:05:37.800> really<00:05:37.979> if<00:05:38.100> you

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
bands sound useful when really if you

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.890 
bands sound useful when really if you
will<00:05:38.310> get<00:05:38.430> old<00:05:38.640> Smaug<00:05:39.000> on<00:05:39.150> from<00:05:39.390> like<00:05:39.510> 4th<00:05:39.750> and

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
will get old Smaug on from like 4th and

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.110 
will get old Smaug on from like 4th and
5th<00:05:39.990> generation<00:05:40.229> it's<00:05:40.740> not<00:05:41.580> it's<00:05:41.790> something

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
5th generation it's not it's something

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.550 
5th generation it's not it's something
that<00:05:42.210> they<00:05:42.300> would<00:05:42.419> have<00:05:42.510> never<00:05:42.690> done<00:05:42.960> because

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
that they would have never done because

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.800 
that they would have never done because
Megas<00:05:43.890> are<00:05:43.979> just<00:05:44.160> so<00:05:44.700> new<00:05:44.910> and<00:05:45.120> so<00:05:45.300> diverse<00:05:45.479> to

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
Megas are just so new and so diverse to

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.270 
Megas are just so new and so diverse to
the<00:05:45.900> game<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.320> it's<00:05:46.500> really<00:05:46.770> not<00:05:46.919> creating

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
the game that it's really not creating

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.980 
the game that it's really not creating
anything<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:47.760> can<00:05:47.880> handle<00:05:48.030> it<00:05:48.240> so<00:05:48.870> I<00:05:48.900> think
