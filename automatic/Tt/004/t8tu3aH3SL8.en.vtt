factions<00:00:49.110> all<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.500> good<00:00:49.710> stuff<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.070> think

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
factions all that good stuff I think

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.569 
factions all that good stuff I think
over<00:00:50.430> like<00:00:50.610> 50<00:00:51.329> plugins<00:00:51.780> they<00:00:52.020> said<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:53.460> my

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
over like 50 plugins they said and to my

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.130 
over like 50 plugins they said and to my
knowledge<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.149> really<00:00:54.539> good<00:00:54.690> staff

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
knowledge they have a really good staff

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
knowledge they have a really good staff
so<00:00:55.489> that's<00:00:56.489> always<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> plus<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.360> servers

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
so that's always a plus on servers

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
so that's always a plus on servers
especially<00:00:58.320> ones<00:00:58.500> with<00:00:58.649> big<00:00:58.829> mods<00:00:59.070> cuz

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
especially ones with big mods cuz

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.939 
especially ones with big mods cuz
gets<00:01:00.359> crazy<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> don't<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> good

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
