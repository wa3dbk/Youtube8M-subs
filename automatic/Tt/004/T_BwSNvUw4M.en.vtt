 absolute you otherwise that i don't because that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.690

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.240
 debuted at the start of the season 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.979
 I see in ajax 1 and at a fast pace 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.049
 he then developed into one 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.850
 important force for the team and 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.810
 for that development he is now 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.240
 rewards you for being a1 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.479
 to have worked high in the first 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.340
 she has had opportunities and that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.170
 yes well done it is also one 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.210
 They like things that I like 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.970
 see a little feeling is a play 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.619
 make pass actions 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.479
 he just comes by and then is not 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.329
 sorry if you make a mistake once or two 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.460
 mistakes as long as you just keep your action 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.700
 do and where quality light so 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 Of course I think it is yes, I like to watch 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.220
 by player type and he has it 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.170
 linked, sometimes also returns 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 that it's finally it's a good one 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.360
 combination it went very quickly it is 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.920
 fantastic to experience all this 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 I had it from childhood on 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 dreamed and now I am finally there 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.380
 And yes now it is important to make this line 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.270
 hold and so go through the lions 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.550

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.640
 from there many goals 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.780
