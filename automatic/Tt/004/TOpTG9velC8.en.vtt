how much protection you're looking for
this<00:01:15.390> one<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> little<00:01:16.320> bit<00:01:16.530> heavier<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.490> one

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
this one is a little bit heavier the one

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.429 
this one is a little bit heavier the one
originally<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.210> looking<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.540> was<00:01:18.630> 295

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
originally I was looking at was 295

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.060 
originally I was looking at was 295
grams<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.189> 295<00:01:21.030> 315<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.960> me<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.920> weight

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
grams but 295 315 for me the weight

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980 
grams but 295 315 for me the weight
really<00:01:23.250> doesn't<00:01:23.610> matter<00:01:23.759> all<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.000> much<00:01:24.180> but

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
really doesn't matter all that much but

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.530 
really doesn't matter all that much but
what<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.259> liked<00:01:25.530> about<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.920> 315<00:01:26.580> s<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.240> got

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
what I liked about the 315 s is it's got

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
what I liked about the 315 s is it's got
a<00:01:27.570> little<00:01:28.020> bit<00:01:28.170> more<00:01:28.520> it's<00:01:29.520> got<00:01:29.700> more

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
a little bit more it's got more

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.149 
a little bit more it's got more
protection<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:30.840> along<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> sides<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
protection here along the sides and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.969 
protection here along the sides and
along<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.360> front<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> shoe<00:01:34.380> which<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.770> like

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
along the front of the shoe which I like

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.530 
along the front of the shoe which I like
because<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> nature<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> obstacle

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
because of the nature of the obstacle

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.380 
because of the nature of the obstacle
race<00:01:36.860> it<00:01:37.860> did<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> nice<00:01:38.430> job<00:01:38.460> protecting<00:01:39.270> my

was<00:01:42.439> it<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.590> enough<00:01:44.340> mesh<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.180> would

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
was it was enough mesh that it would

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.389 
was it was enough mesh that it would
dump<00:01:45.630> water<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.140> didn't<00:01:46.530> have<00:01:46.710> any<00:01:46.890> water<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.280> my

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.080 
lacing system kept the shoes on tight
enough<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.340> didn't<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.850> worry<00:01:57.000> about

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
enough that I didn't have to worry about

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.940 
enough that I didn't have to worry about
getting<00:01:57.479> my<00:01:57.600> shoes<00:01:57.840> sucked<00:01:58.200> off<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.619> my<00:01:58.710> feet

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
getting my shoes sucked off on my feet

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.120 
getting my shoes sucked off on my feet
so<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.579> worked<00:01:59.939> out<00:02:00.060> real<00:02:00.360> well<00:02:00.540> but<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so that worked out real well but as I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.700 
so that worked out real well but as I
