think this guy is this is it this is

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.920 
think this guy is this is it this is
your<00:01:06.299> flash<00:01:06.570> da-fu

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
your flash da-fu

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.429 
your flash da-fu
so<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.140> 802<00:01:11.130> megabytes<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> downloads<00:01:12.180> at

452 megabytes and when you unzip it it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
452 megabytes and when you unzip it it
goes<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> 8<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> image<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.790> you

PC so I'm gonna go ahead and choose this
we're<00:04:48.470> gonna<00:04:48.560> hit<00:04:48.830> next<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:54.669> this<00:04:55.669> here<00:04:56.000> I'm

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
we're gonna hit next and this here I'm

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.629 
we're gonna hit next and this here I'm
not<00:04:56.629> exactly<00:04:56.990> sure<00:04:57.379> how<00:04:57.409> long<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:57.919> takes<00:04:58.159> it's

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
not exactly sure how long it takes it's

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.180 
not exactly sure how long it takes it's
not<00:04:58.909> too<00:04:59.150> bad<00:04:59.360> so<00:05:01.120> I<00:05:02.120> believe<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:02.990> was<00:05:03.110> under<00:05:03.800> 10

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
not too bad so I believe it was under 10

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.390 
not too bad so I believe it was under 10
minutes<00:05:04.430> possibly<00:05:05.389> like<00:05:05.569> 6<00:05:05.930> minutes<00:05:06.349> so<00:05:07.340> I'm

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
minutes possibly like 6 minutes so I'm

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.980 
minutes possibly like 6 minutes so I'm
gonna<00:05:07.490> go<00:05:07.639> ahead<00:05:07.849> and<00:05:07.970> fast<00:05:08.240> forward<00:05:08.330> this<00:05:08.750> for

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
gonna go ahead and fast forward this for

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.290 
gonna go ahead and fast forward this for
you<00:05:09.080> guys<00:05:09.289> and<00:05:09.650> then<00:05:09.979> I<00:05:10.190> will<00:05:10.580> be<00:05:10.789> back<00:05:11.030> in<00:05:11.210> a

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
the Raspberry Pi itself back here I just

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.089 
the Raspberry Pi itself back here I just
flashed<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.389> SD<00:05:23.690> card<00:05:23.990> this<00:05:24.800> is<00:05:24.949> the

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
Wi-Fi transfer spots stuff like that so

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:14.469 
Wi-Fi transfer spots stuff like that so
and<00:06:12.199> it<00:06:12.440> only<00:06:12.680> works<00:06:13.190> well<00:06:14.180> I<00:06:14.210> have<00:06:14.449> a

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
and it only works well I have a

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:17.260 
and it only works well I have a
Microsoft<00:06:15.250> wireless<00:06:16.250> keyboard<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:16.969> it<00:06:17.060> does

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:19.699 
not work with the wireless keyboard as

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.350 
not work with the wireless keyboard as
of<00:06:19.969> yet<00:06:20.180> so<00:06:20.539> you<00:06:20.659> need<00:06:20.960> a<00:06:20.990> wired<00:06:21.289> keyboard<00:06:22.360> USB

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.409 
of yet so you need a wired keyboard USB
only<00:06:24.169> other<00:06:24.440> one<00:06:24.590> I<00:06:24.620> have<00:06:24.710> is<00:06:24.979> ps2<00:06:25.370> so<00:06:26.000> I<00:06:26.029> can't

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:26.419 
only other one I have is ps2 so I can't

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.800 
only other one I have is ps2 so I can't
really<00:06:26.719> interact<00:06:27.380> with<00:06:27.529> the<00:06:27.650> unit<00:06:28.479> but<00:06:29.479> that

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
really interact with the unit but that

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.409 
really interact with the unit but that
is<00:06:29.960> how<00:06:30.169> you<00:06:30.229> install<00:06:30.560> Windows<00:06:31.340> 10<00:06:31.370> IOT<00:06:32.000> core
