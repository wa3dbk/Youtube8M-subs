00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.730
 share a delicious recipe 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.269
 veracruzana is called des mole de pollo 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.289
 for those of us from Veracruz 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.170
 surely they are familiar with 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.970
 this test mole with this tasty stew 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.060
 look here I 'm already getting ahead 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.870
 I have my chicken cooking with a piece of 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.700
 onion here some tomatoes 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.900
 I here on this occasion the course is 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.970
 tree chili actually takes 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.710
 dried chili peppers is already called by state 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.739
 de veracruz is a chile chiquito 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.559
 same red but small but like me 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.540
 I do not get it here I put it in Chile 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.780
 tree and here I have them cooking 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.920
 I also have more sanz and I have 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.920
 of two cups 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.570
 drier and good and here they prepare it 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.570
 you with the water is enough 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.950
 Take oil and it costs them a spoonful 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.370
 of these days 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.800
 including a little salt I'm also going to 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.590
 show how the balls are made 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.399
 mass for the list with that so little 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.830
 you're doing it like that if the 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.409
 you do little ball 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.390
 okay 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.390
 this is still doing one at a time 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.990
 the size you want 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.860
 although let me finish in goal and you're 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.660
 back 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.660
 as well as 20 of the days 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.480
 and I'm taking it off already said one 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.920
 onion 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.920
 like a little money 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.780
 with regret 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.950
 while it sounds good 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.130
 to later put the broth of 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.130
 chicken that is already 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.270
 since also the pretty trans others 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.480
 I'm just removing optics or clues 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.400
 of step to explain it a little 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 to put them in the dough balls 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.190
 although I have I mystery that is 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.040
 clean washed peeled and cut from 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.939
 100 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.939
 in recipes 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.900
 in fats to be able to with a little 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.900
 faster and at that moment 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.079
 I already have here my 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.299
 already used with broth and I put broth and 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.760
 to start video and right now we're going 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.760
 to add the chayotes 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.930
 I'm going to lower the flame a little 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.239
 because we still do not have 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.989
 well here I have my little balls 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:22.489
 they left 20 balls of dough with 2 cups 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.920
 of maseca a spoonful of oil 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.960
 small teaspoon of salt 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.720
 here is already boiling minimum 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.980
 my broth 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.660
 you give me ground molÃ­ ve molÃ­ vell acosada 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.660
 then we proceed to throw gas 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.370
 sing 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.390
 This is a typical veracruz dish 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.390
 As it turns out, I was looking for it 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.610
 on the web on the internet and I did not find it 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.530
 Sincerely they go with 3 tv that several 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.530
 people were asking with this 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.310
 for this dish for this stew and then 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.860
 I gave myself the task of asking my 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.080
 mom how because she did not do it 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.390
 I did it, we sang little memories 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.490
 very well that if I did not do them and that I 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:26.530
 like a lot to me that not so much by 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.530
 balls of dough but that's why I put a 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.530
 squash 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.600
 a twig is to give it good flavor 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.710
 this gives a good flavor here 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.450
 sometimes three molds 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.090
 because now we just wait for it to 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.740
 sew the little balls and the chayotes and this 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.520
 it's going to be ready 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.830
 we come back later to show you how 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:57.440
 How is let past 10 minutes 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:01.460
 bake I call you and my balls of dough 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.420
 and I've just incorporated the 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:09.690
 chicken legs 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.690
 I bought were four pounds of chicken 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.710
 to these four pounds of chicken I put a 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:20.810
 Boil 6 tomatoes that were grandecitos 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:26.419
 with red tomato and 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.790
 tree chili as about 30 chilies we 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.920
 like picosito 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.320
 and the two houses closer to make 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.320
 my 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.590
 my little balls that came out to me 20 ok here 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.590
 we have the final result of my stew 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.100
 mole limits of the chicken because this came 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.100
 veracruz 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.260
 the dough balls 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.530
 the chayotes and 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.950
 the chicken and look how it looks like a little 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.950
 espesito
