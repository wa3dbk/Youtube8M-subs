00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
 and 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.260
 Yes 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.290
 and 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.420
 he is waiting to move you 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.140
 m 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.450
 2 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.280
 and 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.130
 I can not say that it was the most 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.360
 strong opposing teams but it was 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.680
 a very good player and I told myself 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.690
 it's an opportunity to make a good match 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.610
 and that's playing against paths that's 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.230
 always important try to adapt 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.280
 and homework and in the end you can 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.590
 to say too much about the match 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.720
 compared to the team yes there has been 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.620
 four excellent games and I'm 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.900
 completely missed 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.630
 so it's very hard I'm really going 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.000
 motorcycle creed and motorcycles criticized enough 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.030
 drastically because I could not 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.860
 adapt myself departure and I have not even been able 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.150
 develop my gaming system so in 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.190
 more in front of my audience that holds me 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.020
 really want to play my system of 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.000
 play and be able to defend my chances and 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.150
 I saw no chance so that rhymes with 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.900
 nothing so here I am very disappointed 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.550
 I hope I will have a good night 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.680
 we will see an hour more to sleep 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.200
 so that's good for you but I'm going to 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.150
 refocus and especially there were 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.190
 installed a good tactic directly 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.510
 on the left and try to adapt to the 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.220
 as soon as possible also for 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.389
 able to develop my gaming system and 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.669
 able to defend my chances it will be 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.380
 already the main thing and that's trying to 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.310
 to give everything 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.510
 try to report a point for 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.090
 europe is really important to me 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.550
 especially for me what you have 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.500
 thought of the place to play the mood 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.330
 who had all afternoon 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.789
 want to be felt good yes I 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.200
 felt good it was nice and I got 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.510
 says it's enough too not big yet 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.550
 thing for even more inflamed and 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.229
 really that performance people take 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.150
 still a doubt we are still a little 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.560
 higher but it was already very good 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.150
 after it's true it's hard to get 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.450
 put an atmosphere when we play 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.700
 like that on a game so difficult so 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.350
 here it was already at home owl is 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.700
 generally either not nice 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.390
 part in a victory or in relation to a 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.390
 good level of play
