00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 part the power or covatta you get 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.479
 only after obtaining the other 16 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.100
 powers or that are scattered around the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.590
 region of decline since pokémon centers 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 hotel and similar things so go to 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.840
 search around for others 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.030
 the other powers or but the last power or 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.390
 in addition to requesting the other sixteen 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.939
 also ask for the maximum in style 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 a lumino poli how can we get the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.159
 maximum in style there are many 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.049
 ways how to make struggles at the home exam or 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.090
 do chores for the attention of 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.479
 money but these guys is great 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.560
 long the fastest of all of us here 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.729
 we take a premiere ball at a time 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.890
 let 's say the plain and ball because it's that 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.220
 which costs nino now take an a 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.750
 time and make it like take a lot of it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.390
 expect a good many 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.720
 I said one at a time if you can see 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.120
 the ropes in the bag already 54 premier 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.640
 ball what you realize 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.200
 I taking 50 premier balls were 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.360
 managed to make my style go up 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.600
 of lamps in Naples at most but considered 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.070
 which was already quite high 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.730
 so I guess it takes more or less 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.459
 it takes a little more than ipoque bold a 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.500
 buy in order to always increase by 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.800
 more our style and consequently 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.200
 unlock the last busy shops 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.550
 this we can get in another 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.620
 place that will reach very soon 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.660
 here we are boys we are almost at mine 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.720
 left you can see the pokémon center 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.090
 of low course starting from this point 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.640
 we go to the left we also hope the 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.790
 laboratory of our professor ed 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.100
 we come into this bar that the bar 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.880
 you can know why he is the beat of 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.989
 shy timid bars like that 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.180
 you can safely even reach 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.519
 with the rates of course I have already having 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.989
 played power or no one here but 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.730
 then once you've got the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.130
 maximum style in this place 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.620
 you will find the very nice coach 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.900
 brotherhood that with its gap pop sentences 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.640
 mandi sciite will deliver you to the last 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.110
 bottega will be found exactly here where 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.720
 I'm in this right now 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.720
 corner, however, as I have already said if 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.630
 you have to do you have to have the maximum 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.630
 the truism is the best 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.500
 I hope this video is there 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.750

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.750

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.660
 very much the growth of yours 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.170
 pokémon by breeding and use of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:03.150

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.260
 power more than ruth most used anymore 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.530
 si power which will add to level 2 e 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.630
 then level 3 can also be combined with 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 magma skill shield the body of lava 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.280
