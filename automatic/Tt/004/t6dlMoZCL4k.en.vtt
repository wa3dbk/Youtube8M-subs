00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.030

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.409
 nice small cut here so me 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.330
 would be best about small little ones 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:17.300
 Cutting pieces tastes better 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:19.900
 as proved okay is a bit 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.900
 grown up 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:45.210
 the eggs become everything completely 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.649
 neat course between on so 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.340
 I certainly can with him 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.310
 included 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:02:09.319
 100 milliliters then there is no gram 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:09.319
 time for a Christmas and then well 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.340
 together 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:32.209
 actually that's the good time and the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:36.230
 candidates a bit first have 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:50.840
 I than ten milliliter think I then 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:56.959
 so break in ahead we distribute that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:59.150
 zeug the cool time of course here 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:03.860
 not quite as tasty but I say 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.160
 you taste that really cool right 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.160
 running 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.180
 a little bit more at the same time 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.180
 to press 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.480
 the construct 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:26.200
 then you have beautiful here I believe that 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:29.660
 180 calories have good fat 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.510
 good carbohydrates in the form of bananas 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:39.080
 naturally healthy oatmeal at 241 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.570
 gram protein 36 grams fat and believes 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.280
 something over 100 carbohydrates 460 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.580
 or so because they are not exactly on 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.920
 130 calories and but yourself 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.110
 Breakfast , it is really cool and really 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.260
 otherwise you can just whey 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.320
 Have protein with a routine in it 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.540
 because I wanted to give choc tomorrow, for example 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.320
 which tasted really good, of course 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.320
 turn around now 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.120
 here are the two were in the 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.280
 number I already told you so 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.860
 wants it just tastes a 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.530
 a little rating 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.030
 that tastes again so I have 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.600
 Try something different by yourself 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.240
 try out 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.150
 you definitely taste a nice 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.160
 Have a cup of tea and have a good breakfast 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.440
 It could always be the same in iron 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.720
 something 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.770
 i hope you mac that until the next one 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.770
