room of transit to build the turbine and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.830 
room of transit to build the turbine and
then<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.120> want<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> make<00:00:57.449> sure<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.719> you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.280 
exactly right you can see here i buy the
perk<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> ask<00:01:18.000> my<00:01:18.240> character<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> drinking<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
perk and ask my character is drinking it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.320 
perk and ask my character is drinking it
I<00:01:19.409> stand<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.220> behind<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.700> turbine<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I stand right behind the turbine so that

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
I stand right behind the turbine so that
I'm<00:01:21.420> ready<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.750> pick<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.200> as<00:01:22.740> soon<00:01:22.950> as<00:01:23.070> my

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
I'm ready to pick it up as soon as my

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.520 
I'm ready to pick it up as soon as my
character<00:01:23.280> throws<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> bottle<00:01:24.720> down<00:01:24.930> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
character throws the bottle down so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
character throws the bottle down so
you'll<00:01:25.710> notice<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.250> perk<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.549> nice<00:01:26.820> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you'll notice that the perk is nice and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.120 
you'll notice that the perk is nice and
shiny<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:27.990> dimmed<00:01:28.320> out<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
shiny now it's not dimmed out and it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.649 
shiny now it's not dimmed out and it
does<00:01:29.369> work<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.970> whether<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.540> an

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
does work so whether this is an

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.330 
does work so whether this is an
intentional<00:01:31.170> trick<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.590> Treyarch<00:01:31.890> included

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
intentional trick that Treyarch included

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.039 
intentional trick that Treyarch included
in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> game<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:33.000> maybe<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.509> minor<00:01:33.780> glitch

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
in the game or maybe just a minor glitch

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.260 
in the game or maybe just a minor glitch
it's<00:01:34.799> really<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.159> as<00:01:35.340> overpowered<00:01:36.030> as<00:01:36.150> you

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's really not as overpowered as you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
it's really not as overpowered as you
may<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.869> mean<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.590> an<00:01:37.680> awesome<00:01:37.770> trick

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
may think I mean it's an awesome trick

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.319 
may think I mean it's an awesome trick
at<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:38.400> but<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> turbine

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
at all but if you put the turbine

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
at all but if you put the turbine
anywhere<00:01:39.900> near<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> perk<00:01:40.409> machine<00:01:40.740> again

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
anywhere near the perk machine again

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
anywhere near the perk machine again
after<00:01:41.939> you've<00:01:42.060> done<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
after you've done this and then the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.450 
after you've done this and then the
turbine<00:01:43.140> stops<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.770> perk<00:01:43.920> machine<00:01:44.220> turns

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
turbine stops and the perk machine turns

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.609 
turbine stops and the perk machine turns
off<00:01:44.670> once<00:01:44.939> again<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.810> perk<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.200> gonna<00:01:46.439> do

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
off once again your perk is gonna do

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.560 
off once again your perk is gonna do
mount<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.220> work<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.240> means<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
mount and not work so this means that

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
mount and not work so this means that
one<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.110> gotta<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.409> careful<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> place

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
one you gotta be careful not to place

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
one you gotta be careful not to place
the<00:01:50.520> turbine<00:01:50.850> near<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> perk<00:01:51.360> machine<00:01:51.659> ever

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the turbine near the perk machine ever

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.649 
the turbine near the perk machine ever
again<00:01:52.290> until<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> turn<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> power<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
again until you turn the power on and to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
again until you turn the power on and to
a<00:01:54.689> teammate<00:01:55.170> cannot<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> same

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
a teammate cannot do this with the same

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.889 
a teammate cannot do this with the same
perk<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.030> did<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
perk that you did so it's kind of a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.420 
perk that you did so it's kind of a
balance<00:01:58.290> thing<00:01:58.530> now<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.040> most<00:01:59.219> part

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
balance thing now for the most part

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.830 
balance thing now for the most part
you're<00:01:59.520> gonna<00:01:59.579> eventually<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> turn<00:02:00.719> on

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
you're gonna eventually want to turn on

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.389 
you're gonna eventually want to turn on
the<00:02:00.930> power<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.200> transit<00:02:01.770> especially<00:02:02.009> if

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the power and transit especially if

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.039 
the power and transit especially if
you're<00:02:02.520> playing<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.790> teammates<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.750> until

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
you're playing with teammates but until

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.780 
you're playing with teammates but until
you<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.590> trick<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.430> really<00:02:05.610> gonna

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
you do this trick is really really gonna

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.730 
you do this trick is really really gonna
help<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.420> first<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.380> all<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
difficult area to get to the power

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.969 
difficult area to get to the power
station<00:02:09.300> plus<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> pretty<00:02:10.709> dangerous

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
station plus it's a pretty dangerous

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.200 
station plus it's a pretty dangerous
area<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.849> in

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
area to be in

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
so there you go activated perks without

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.550 
so there you go activated perks without
the<00:02:14.640> power<00:02:14.790> turned<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.330> hope<00:02:15.990> this<00:02:16.170> helped<00:02:16.440> out

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.140 
the power turned on hope this helped out
