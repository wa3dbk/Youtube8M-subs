now<00:00:00.149> here's<00:00:00.420> a<00:00:00.480> regular<00:00:00.750> sprayer<00:00:01.740> part<00:00:02.159> and

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
now here's a regular sprayer part and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.059 
now here's a regular sprayer part and
it's<00:00:02.639> not<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:02.850> lot<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.060> motorcycle<00:00:04.069> important

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
it's not a lot of motorcycle important

it's not a lot of motorcycle important
things<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.879> look<00:00:06.180> for<00:00:06.540> when<00:00:06.870> you're<00:00:07.620> putting

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
things to look for when you're putting

things to look for when you're putting
your<00:00:08.130> motorcycle<00:00:08.760> together<00:00:09.059> is<00:00:09.590> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
your motorcycle together is the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490 
your motorcycle together is the
suspension<00:00:11.219> geometry<00:00:11.990> now<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.349> your

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
suspension geometry now this is your

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.279 
suspension geometry now this is your

a bump this rocker is going to be is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.050 
a bump this rocker is going to be is
going<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.240> lift<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.020> back<00:00:22.369> it's<00:00:23.369> important

going to lift up and back it's important

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.240 
going to lift up and back it's important

set the exact length of this - by

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.389 
set the exact length of this - by
trimming<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.720> end<00:01:26.899> of<00:01:27.079> it<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:28.130> your

trimming the end of it so that your

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.510 
trimming the end of it so that your

individual motorcycle once you've done

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.120 
individual motorcycle once you've done
that<00:01:34.689> then<00:01:35.689> you<00:01:35.750> can<00:01:36.079> adjust<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.680> length<00:01:36.890> of

this<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.750> huge<00:01:48.439> and<00:01:48.890> very<00:01:49.250> important<00:01:49.939> thing

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
this is a huge and very important thing

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.090 
this is a huge and very important thing
on<00:01:50.299> your<00:01:50.420> spring<00:01:50.750> if<00:01:51.049> you<00:01:51.110> buy<00:01:51.470> a<00:01:51.500> springer

that's<00:02:18.980> because<00:02:19.459> first<00:02:20.390> off<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:21.019> spring<00:02:21.680> with

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
that's because first off a spring with

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.910 
that's because first off a spring with
good<00:02:22.099> geometry<00:02:23.080> will<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.230> very<00:02:24.500> compliant

good geometry will be very compliant

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.830 
good geometry will be very compliant
over<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.370> bumps<00:02:25.730> because<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.329> has<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.480> rocker

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
over the bumps because it has a rocker

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.910 
over the bumps because it has a rocker
arm<00:02:27.049> which<00:02:27.440> will<00:02:27.590> act<00:02:27.799> like<00:02:27.950> earlier

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
arm which will act like earlier

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.360 
arm which will act like earlier
second<00:02:30.910> because<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:32.130> sealed<00:02:33.130> ball

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370

and<00:02:36.970> will<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.300> very<00:02:37.630> little<00:02:37.870> stiction<00:02:38.319> if

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and will have very little stiction if

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.890 
and will have very little stiction if
you<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.550> bushings<00:02:40.120> or<00:02:40.420> if<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.720> have<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
you have bushings or if you have a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.990 
you have bushings or if you have a
conventional<00:02:41.500> board<00:02:41.800> there's<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.489> lot<00:02:42.790> of

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
conventional board there's a lot of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.720 
conventional board there's a lot of

at<00:02:45.880> the<00:02:45.970> pivot<00:02:46.270> points<00:02:46.630> there's<00:02:46.840> no<00:02:47.080> friction

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
at the pivot points there's no friction

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.780 
at the pivot points there's no friction
the<00:02:48.940> other<00:02:49.120> thing<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.810> we<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:51.430> large

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
the other thing is we have the large

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.240 
the other thing is we have the large
shock<00:02:52.239> absorber<00:02:52.930> with<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> variable<00:02:54.069> rate

spring<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.750> going<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.140> be<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> very

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
spring this is going to be a very

spring this is going to be a very
sophisticated<00:02:57.390> dampening<00:02:58.390> assembly<00:02:59.110> which

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
sophisticated dampening assembly which

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.479 
sophisticated dampening assembly which
controls<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.970> patter<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> front<00:03:01.930> wheel

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
controls the patter of the front wheel

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.120 
controls the patter of the front wheel
all<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.880> combines<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.690> give<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.319> very<00:03:05.590> good

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
all of this combines to give a very good

the<00:03:10.000> other<00:03:10.209> key<00:03:10.630> element<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.350> make<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.769> the

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the other key element to make in the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.990 
the other key element to make in the
motorcycle<00:03:12.130> were<00:03:12.760> good<00:03:13.150> stability<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
motorcycle were good stability is to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.300 
motorcycle were good stability is to
avoid<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:17.140> front<00:03:17.530> wheel<00:03:17.769> moving

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310

independently of the rest of the forks
now<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:22.540> control<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.230> by<00:03:23.739> using<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.549> large

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
now we control that by using a large

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.490 
now we control that by using a large
rigid<00:03:26.160> billet<00:03:27.160> leading<00:03:27.640> link<00:03:27.959> we<00:03:28.959> control

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
rigid billet leading link we control

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.610 
rigid billet leading link we control
that<00:03:29.799> by<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> very<00:03:30.880> stout

so that the amount of side-to-side

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.100 
so that the amount of side-to-side
flex<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:39.849> minimized<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:42.330> if<00:03:43.330> you<00:03:43.659> build<00:03:43.959> a
