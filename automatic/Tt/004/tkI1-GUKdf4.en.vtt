00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.110
 I added you a folder along with the lessons 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.099
 Appendix 2 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.940
 In this folder you will find a link to the service. 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.910
 online Photoshop 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.759
 not on the program itself not on downloading it 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.130
 but for a free service in which 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.240
 a stripped down version of photoshop right in 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.880
 online mode 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.830
 and there you can edit photos 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.500
 grind them to perfection 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 parts show how it is done and so 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.619
 the link is in this folder number 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.430
 two open and here there is a link 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.930
 on this service and then I threw you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.860
 two photos to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.739
 to train 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 one nuance in this service is possible 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.980
 process photos that are already 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.140
 pre-compressed and optimized 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.600
 great photos from the camera to 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.460
 online mode cannot be edited 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.800
 because a very very long time they will 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.350
 load and will be very long 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.170
 handled here is this service 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.930
 called he line spain i use it 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.549
 for website promotion in search engines 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.049
 systems and it helps me a lot 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.619
 and by chance I discovered that there is 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:16.290
 online Photoshop 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.439
 we go down below and here in the menu 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.840
 there is photoshop online actually 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.119
 there are a lot of such photoshop in 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.009
 on the Internet you can type photoshop online 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.979
 in the search engine and you drop us a lot 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.850
 the services that this service offers 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.130
 but on this service in my opinion 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.960
 works most stable most 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.900
 quickly so I recommend you 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.200
 use this service 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.710
 click photoshop online next i 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.210
 I press full screen mode 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.090
 full screen upload image from 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.420
 computer 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.080
 uploading a courier photo and for 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.000
 comparisons I will upload one more time 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:11.510
 same photo file open image 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.300
 image by courier and next posted 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.830
 I will process this image 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:25.050
 but it will always click on it 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:29.510
 I select by pressing the correction and choosing 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.650
 levels this is very fine tuning 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.140
 picture 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.480
 here there are three sliders adjustment 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.269
 dark tones adjustable light 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.800
 mid tones and light adjustment 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.410
 tones 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.989
 mutually moving these engines you can 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:51.510
 achieve a marked improvement in quality 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:53.450
 photos I move white color I do 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.959
 photos a little lighter 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.959
 playing a little connection with the middle tones and 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.420
 a little bit 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:10.370
 plays dark tones press ok to in 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:15.330
 In this case, I go back into the correction and 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.430
 I choose hue-saturation here 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.470
 this engine which is called 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:28.610
 add a little bit of saturation 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:34.190
 more saturation like this yes 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:38.310
 I go to the filter and clicking on the sharpness 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.720
 pay attention compare visually two 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.510
 of these photos 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.690
 the first one is on the left side of the original 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.280
 raw and right side file 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.790
 this is a file processed it looks 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:56.489
 much better and so all three settings 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.519
 which i constantly use for 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:02.360
 image enhancement on that 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.420
 level correction 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.799
 correction hue-saturation here 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:14.250
 this setting and filter sharpness all when 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.690
 Here are the help of these three options here, I'm improving 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.209
 The picture quality is quite 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.870
 enough after the image 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.870
 ready processed click file save 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.220
 and save the image in a folder 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.220
 graphics all
