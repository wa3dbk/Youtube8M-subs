00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
it comes to ice fish there's a lot of

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.050 
it comes to ice fish there's a lot of
times<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.620> always<00:04:11.010> think<00:04:11.280> finesse<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.909> the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060

times you always think finesse is the
only<00:04:12.390> way<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.629> go<00:04:12.900> well<00:04:13.319> that's<00:04:13.470> not<00:04:13.769> true

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
only way to go well that's not true

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.930 
only way to go well that's not true
sometimes<00:04:14.670> bigger<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.450> better
