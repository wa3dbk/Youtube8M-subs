00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.890
 good 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.500
 hi girls, how are you waiting? 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.470
 find very well here I bring you the 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.910
 set that previously brought the truth 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.370
 I thought about recording it when I was 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.010
 doing in my hands but I started something 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.440
 I was not helped by the light 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.620
 you can see it's already me what I retired 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.110
 but out there on facebook I commented that 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.050
 was going to upload the video of that design and what 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.989
 promised is debt here and I put a tip 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.820
 crystal and I'm making my almond in 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.309
 this cool was a glaze 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.950
 transparent I put a few drops of 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.620
 a turquoise glaze I had so that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.470
 it was made drop of art I feel that it is 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.170
 faster easier and cleaner if you 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.280
 we do so personally to me the drop 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.850
 of art is made to me 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.760
 very dirty then it made me better 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.390
 option to do so I put two layers of 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.780
 this enamel and now I'm going to put a 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.210
 line from side to side with glitter of 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.479
 turquoise and I'm going to fade very 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.570
 little bit to the bottom and I put 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.149
 some balls of the same color only 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.580
 to give you another type of view with 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.340
 an acrylic crystal dog I'm going to 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.299
 stick a silver tack on the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.299
 part of the corner 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.490
 and the next thing I'm going to do is 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 encapsulate with crystal acrylic as you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.420
 I comment when the drop of arts with the 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.730
 monomer to me personally makes me 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.720
 who becomes a cochinero 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.360
 something dirty then I feel like this is 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.340
 faster and a little cleaner and what 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.700
 The only thing I did was take the enamel 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.010
 transparent and put a few drops of 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.910
 color that I wanted and then I'm staying 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.910
 translucent 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.220
 and encapsulated wait for it to dry and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.220
 maple and now'll put a capita 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.049
 topco art this time I used tocoa 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.930
 because I really do not like to put the 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.720
 hands to the lamp I do not know why I think 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.459
 it's a mania that I have and I put it by the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440
 bottom part also to be noticed 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.950
 more the transparency of the art boot 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.659
 and that's how my design looks like 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.420
 I say is very simple but to me in what 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.310
 I really liked the staff here also 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.770
 I leave some pictures of how it was 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.990
 my set 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.030
 and it would be everything I hope you like it 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.530
 I hope I serve you and see you in the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.530
 next video see you later
