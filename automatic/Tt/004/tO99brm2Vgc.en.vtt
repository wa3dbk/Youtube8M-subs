00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.759
 hello friends with you evgeny 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.580
 last video showed how to install 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.150
 firmware oxigin about is no one plus one 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.340
 in this video I want to go because 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.090
 is this firmware like 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.910
 first glance 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.800
 I note to this video I this firmware 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.039
 did not use in eyes and in general did not see 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.130
 so first look at the oxigin firmware 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.099
 oh i guess it will be clean 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.989
 android lollipop with some 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.880
 Minimal modification I hope that 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.720
 Of course I will be wrong and everything is as if 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.280
 changed made everything very beautiful by 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.320
 a circle of guys nosachi sensible by this 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.420
 engaged remind engaged in this 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.030
 team and also dealt with firmware 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.590
 firmware paranoid android me these 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.090
 I really liked the firmware 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.510
 and generally they have their own vision of all that 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.730
 they made a lot of very interesting pieces 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.340
 for android came up with yourself 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.490
 now we will see it in general 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.119
 oxigin and with understood 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:15.249
 standard startup dialog let's 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:21.549
 it will be started that it is necessary to google nau probably 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:24.880
 I'm not on the author of the loaf with dates than 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.219
 why not i love okay right there he 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.189
 offers to set up some things and 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:33.819
 got that way what open cameras people 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:34.630
 draw circle flashlight we use 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:37.119
 control 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.909
 draw the arrow to the right or to the left 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:44.159
 general as I will be set of complex 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.740
 let's start on viruses 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.889
 ok at first glance standard android 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.159
 50 let's see what u were pushing here 

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:56.530
 Immediately I will not go into the wilds 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.630
 since u in one video in the firebox first 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.029
 video make it impossible to walk 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.920
 purely on the basic things that me 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:06.540
 personally interested well let's start along with 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.210
 troops just behind the camera 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:16.050
 I already understood this is a standard camera 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:18.540
 android nothing ingenious past 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:22.650
 I see applications there is a button to delete all 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.350
 applications it pleases from applications 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.300
 which is the only thing here 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.990
 calculator standard calendar camera 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.540
 chrome 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.430
 file file is an application that is not 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.220
 need to attend it so I understand 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.870
 files of the firmware file manager itself 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 kind of fairly standard yet 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.550
 general here i think no what else 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.450
 probably everything from the application is nothing 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.670
 there is no genius here alright 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.940
 go to quick quick settings 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.100
 the settings that we have here 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.550
 standard quick settings on top 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.230
 slider on top of an interesting button 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.570
 which allows new products to understand 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.540
 move these quick menu settings 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.420
 cool very cool reality or 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.620
 paranoid android 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.989
 here you can add and add not 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.220
 see where 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.890
 top save or return to 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.299
 previous state 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:31.160
 you can delete you can remove them from here 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.160
 pressing either to not appear again 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.780
 save let's go in the settings in 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.209
 the settings that we have here first 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.630
 buttons you can turn on the navigation 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.370
 panel on screen buttons or touch 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.130
 back gestures are what we saw before 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:54.239
 of this that added nothing here 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.540
 added so let's see how 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.939
 works 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.459
 work digest first what is ours 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.390
 there was given to get there Kulyk 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:13.379
 the Sleepy here for no vocab 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:21.250
 the camera turns on the lamp turns on 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:23.889
 on and off they are here 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.289
 turned off and and tracks okay tracks they 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.340
 will already be checked before it 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.960
 let's switch to Russian 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.669
 to make it all clear and dress 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:38.500
 wear Russian must be here and Russian 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:42.160
 has keyboard current keyboard 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.330
 pick layout and surprisingly here 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.680
 no swiftkey keyboard 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.120
 very strange they kind of signed 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.810
 contracts in theory she should he 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.820
 default 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.419
 the screen on what we stopped size 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:03.190
 the font is all very, very standard 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:07.680
 sounds and notices again nothing 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.680
 there is just a lot of interesting 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:18.580
 as well as the default interesting here 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.830
 here if the superuser on the number 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.199
 Build click 10 times there need a thing 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.570
 so and not so and not become developers 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.310
 usually everything needs fashion 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.340
 the option to enable root is options 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.530
 reboot which is generally nice 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:38.889
 update recovery one plus then 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.009
 there is Kostanay recovery will go away and fly away and 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.289
 will arrive 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.659
 natural recovery for you if ska 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.180
 we noted this is unfamiliar will celebrate 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:53.180
 root and root are not collected as well. 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.129
 root root and no root here 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.659
 as well as there are no settings for these 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:58.729
 Here are the navigation buttons, that is, press 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:01.159
 back to pull the app to heal 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:06.349
 such that prices are already being applied 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:09.710
 genie fashion animation too limited 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:13.569
 quantity smoothly what we have in fact 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.669
 in fact the firmware is the first version of the firmware 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:20.139
 oxygene c is pretty standard 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:23.149
 basic android 5.0. 2 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.180
 with a small small place on the gate 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:27.559
 big custom my which 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.649
 expressed in the closing buttons of all 

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:31.939
 recent applications and in the option to choose 

00:06:30.649 --> 00:06:33.559
 what applications will be fast 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:35.809
 settings except this is nothing here 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:37.459
 interesting, I have not yet noticed well 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:39.830
 gesture is a standard option as if 

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:43.099
 samoval plus is equivalent to choice 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.330
 and navigation panels think further one 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.189
 plus will finish this firmware 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.409
 not add and a variety of interesting 

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:52.430
 chips really do not know how much 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:55.809
 how it will be generally comparable either 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:58.519
 not comparable with the same genie scene 

00:06:55.809 --> 00:07:01.969
 the twelfth version 12.1 

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:03.469
 but as they say we will see I think 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:06.649
 I'm going to shoot a video about it too 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:12.039
 when will it all go out today 

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:12.039
 that's all for everyone until new meetings
