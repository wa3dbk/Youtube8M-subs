so<00:00:01.199> there<00:00:01.410> it<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:03.529> it<00:00:04.529> was<00:00:04.910> actually<00:00:08.780> 3.5

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
so there it is it was actually 3.5

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.720 
so there it is it was actually 3.5
decibels<00:00:10.620> higher<00:00:11.269> than<00:00:12.269> it<00:00:13.070> was<00:00:14.070> when<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.460> added

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
decibels higher than it was when I added

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.590 
decibels higher than it was when I added
the<00:00:15.830> muffler<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> lost<00:00:17.369> some<00:00:17.670> noise<00:00:18.980> as<00:00:20.600> most

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
the muffler so I lost some noise as most

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.540 
the muffler so I lost some noise as most

you may have read that a lot of these
small<00:00:24.449> engines<00:00:24.900> are<00:00:25.050> noisy<00:00:25.470> not<00:00:25.650> because<00:00:26.039> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
small engines are noisy not because of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.300 
small engines are noisy not because of
the<00:00:26.279> exhaust<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.070> internal<00:00:29.070> engine

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
the exhaust but just the internal engine

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.299 
the exhaust but just the internal engine
moving<00:00:30.179> part<00:00:30.449> noise<00:00:30.740> that<00:00:31.740> they've<00:00:31.949> been<00:00:32.099> able

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
moving part noise that they've been able

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.030 
moving part noise that they've been able
to<00:00:32.430> eliminate<00:00:33.649> on<00:00:35.600> Honda<00:00:36.600> generators<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.350> for

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
to eliminate on Honda generators now for

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.150 
to eliminate on Honda generators now for
instance<00:00:38.450> if<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.750> push<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.440> on<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.890> thing

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
instance if you push down on this thing

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.150 
instance if you push down on this thing
and<00:00:41.719> put<00:00:42.719> some<00:00:42.930> pressure<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.980> can

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and put some pressure there you can

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.670 
and put some pressure there you can
knock<00:00:44.340> off<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.910> another<00:00:45.180> two<00:00:45.420> decibels<00:00:46.020> puts

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
knock off like another two decibels puts

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
knock off like another two decibels puts
there<00:00:47.610> there's<00:00:47.940> something<00:00:48.059> rattling<00:00:48.360> around

this and what and I didn't hurt the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.580 
this and what and I didn't hurt the
generator<00:00:54.360> at<00:00:54.449> all<00:00:54.570> by<00:00:54.809> putting<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.289> muffler

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
generator at all by putting this muffler

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
put it back to stock immediately if I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
put it back to stock immediately if I
want<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.930> reason<00:01:04.170> I'm<00:01:04.260> leaving<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.769> is

want to the reason I'm leaving it on is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.700 
want to the reason I'm leaving it on is
it<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.339> sounds<00:01:05.700> nicer<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.869> other<00:01:07.159> freaking

it just sounds nicer that other freaking

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.130 
it just sounds nicer that other freaking
stock<00:01:10.710> muffler<00:01:11.189> was<00:01:11.700> annoying<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.930> that's

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
stock muffler was annoying like that's

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.810 
stock muffler was annoying like that's
why<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.320> was<00:01:13.439> looking<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.860> changing<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.729> was

I<00:01:18.960> don't<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.860> how<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.250> might<00:01:20.430> sound<00:01:20.610> loud<00:01:20.909> on

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I don't know how it might sound loud on

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.580 
I don't know how it might sound loud on
YouTube<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.720> believe<00:01:22.020> me<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.350> thing<00:01:22.560> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
YouTube but believe me this thing is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.120 
YouTube but believe me this thing is
very<00:01:23.090> better<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.570> frequency<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
very better just the frequency of the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
very better just the frequency of the
noise<00:01:26.369> has<00:01:26.700> just<00:01:26.909> changed<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> better

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
noise has just changed it's a better

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.109 
noise has just changed it's a better
sounding<00:01:28.920> unit<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.759> leave<00:01:29.909> this

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
sounding unit so I'm going to leave this

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.230 
sounding unit so I'm going to leave this
on<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.799> like<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.009> didn't<00:01:32.430> eliminate<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.210> of

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
on I like it didn't eliminate a lot of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.670 
on I like it didn't eliminate a lot of
noise<00:01:33.420> but<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.689> know<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.200> people<00:01:34.470> think

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
noise but I know a lot of people think

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.859 
noise but I know a lot of people think
that<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.490> know<00:01:35.610> cars<00:01:35.880> run<00:01:36.150> pretty<00:01:36.390> quiet<00:01:36.659> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
that you know cars run pretty quiet I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.539 
that you know cars run pretty quiet I
can't<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.470> car<00:01:37.770> muffler<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.250> stuff

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
can't just take a car muffler and stuff

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.149 
can't just take a car muffler and stuff
it<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:39.259> generator<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.470> quiet<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> hell

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
it on generator and quiet it the hell

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.179 
it on generator and quiet it the hell
down<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.850> got<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.030> space<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.750> know<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> was

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
down you got the space you know so I was

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
down you got the space you know so I was
kind<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> long<00:01:44.610> saying<00:01:44.880> think<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.659> did<00:01:45.840> some

kind of long saying think and I did some

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.980 
kind of long saying think and I did some
research<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.329> I<00:01:48.329> thought<00:01:48.479> well<00:01:48.659> what

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
research on it and I thought well what

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.010 
research on it and I thought well what
the<00:01:49.140> hell<00:01:49.320> give<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> try<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.750> out

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the hell give it a try so all of you out

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.840 
the hell give it a try so all of you out
there<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.439> want<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.640> actually

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
there that want to know if it actually

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.530 
there that want to know if it actually
works

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
works

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.770 
works
quiet<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:56.119> generator<00:01:57.119> down<00:01:57.360> by<00:01:57.479> putting<00:01:57.659> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
quiet a generator down by putting a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.280 
quiet a generator down by putting a
big-ass<00:01:58.079> muffler<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.640> helps<00:01:59.820> a<00:02:00.090> bit

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
big-ass muffler on it that helps a bit

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.580 
big-ass muffler on it that helps a bit
makes<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.619> sound<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> little<00:02:02.909> bit<00:02:03.119> more

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
makes the sound of it a little bit more

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.230
