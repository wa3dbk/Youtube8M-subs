00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.169 

okay<00:00:01.410> I'm<00:00:01.589> back<00:00:01.890> and<00:00:02.250> what<00:00:02.399> I've<00:00:02.550> actually<00:00:02.790> got

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
okay I'm back and what I've actually got

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.840 
okay I'm back and what I've actually got
here<00:00:03.449> is<00:00:03.659> there's<00:00:04.170> two<00:00:04.380> systems<00:00:04.890> I've<00:00:05.370> got<00:00:05.670> the

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
here is there's two systems I've got the

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.240 
here is there's two systems I've got the
original<00:00:06.149> although<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.750> changed<00:00:07.649> pulleys<00:00:08.069> and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
original although I changed pulleys and

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.700 
original although I changed pulleys and
rope<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.730> I've<00:00:09.390> converted<00:00:09.750> what<00:00:10.230> was<00:00:10.470> the

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
rope and I've converted what was the

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.230 
rope and I've converted what was the
original<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.280> don't<00:00:11.460> why<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.640> did<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.060> would

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
original I don't why I did this would

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.930 
original I don't why I did this would
have<00:00:12.360> been<00:00:12.480> easier<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:12.930> left<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.410> as<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> was

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
have been easier just left it as it was

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.600 
have been easier just left it as it was
to<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.300> different<00:00:16.049> type<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.260> system<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.040> I

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
to a different type of system and I

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.310 
to a different type of system and I
wanted<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.360> so<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.080> some

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
wanted to do that so we can get some

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230 
wanted to do that so we can get some
comparisons<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.400> things<00:00:20.670> as<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.060> went

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
comparisons and some things as we went

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.820 
comparisons and some things as we went
on<00:00:22.340> basically<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.700> did<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.530> I<00:00:25.530> took<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
on basically what I did is I took the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.930 
on basically what I did is I took the
pulley<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.640> brought<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.690> down<00:00:27.840> here

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
pulley and brought it down here

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.100 
pulley and brought it down here
disconnected<00:00:29.940> to<00:00:30.060> load<00:00:30.270> and<00:00:30.510> connected<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
disconnected to load and connected it to

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.820 
disconnected to load and connected it to
the<00:00:31.260> pulley

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the pulley

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.120 
the pulley
I<00:00:31.910> took<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.600> end<00:00:33.810> of<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.140> rope<00:00:34.470> that<00:00:34.710> used<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
I took the end of this rope that used to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.780 
I took the end of this rope that used to
connect<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> load<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.489> connected<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> up

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
connect to the load and connected it up

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.840 
connect to the load and connected it up
here<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> anchor<00:00:39.720> and<00:00:39.930> I've<00:00:40.920> got<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
here to the anchor and I've got just a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.090 
here to the anchor and I've got just a
safety<00:00:42.149> knot<00:00:42.420> here<00:00:42.810> so<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.560> thing<00:00:43.860> won't

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
safety knot here so this thing won't

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.180 
safety knot here so this thing won't
fall<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.760> ground<00:00:44.790> with<00:00:45.390> us<00:00:45.540> so<00:00:46.410> there<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
fall to the ground with us so there is a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.580 
fall to the ground with us so there is a
difference<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.820> these<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.300> systems<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.079> want

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
difference in these two systems I want

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
difference in these two systems I want
to<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.829> through<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.239> difference<00:00:51.239> real<00:00:51.510> quick

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
to go through that difference real quick

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.170 
to go through that difference real quick
and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.590> look<00:00:52.950> at<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.130> other<00:00:53.489> things<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and then look at some other things that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.250 
and then look at some other things that
are<00:00:54.570> involved<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.290> this<00:00:56.300> first<00:00:57.300> let's<00:00:58.020> look

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
are involved with this first let's look

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.569 
are involved with this first let's look
at<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> pulley<00:00:58.829> principle<00:00:59.989> if<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.379> have<00:01:01.980> one

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
at the pulley principle if I have one

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.929 
at the pulley principle if I have one
pound<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.030> force<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:04.489> one<00:01:05.489> pound<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
pound of force here I have one pound of

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.020 
pound of force here I have one pound of
force<00:01:06.179> here<00:01:06.539> these<00:01:07.409> two<00:01:07.799> forces<00:01:08.159> add<00:01:08.520> now

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
force here these two forces add now

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.690 
force here these two forces add now
they're<00:01:09.719> in<00:01:09.959> an<00:01:10.109> up<00:01:10.409> direction<00:01:11.039> rather<00:01:11.340> than<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
they're in an up direction rather than a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.779 
they're in an up direction rather than a
downward<00:01:12.299> but<00:01:12.899> two<00:01:13.139> plus<00:01:13.560> two<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.369> I'm<00:01:14.549> sorry

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
downward but two plus two or I'm sorry

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.559 
downward but two plus two or I'm sorry
one<00:01:15.030> plus<00:01:15.299> 1<00:01:15.630> would<00:01:16.139> be<00:01:16.200> two<00:01:16.649> again

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
one plus 1 would be two again

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:20.149 
one plus 1 would be two again
so<00:01:18.569> we<00:01:18.719> have<00:01:18.899> a<00:01:18.929> force<00:01:19.289> of<00:01:19.469> two<00:01:19.619> pounds<00:01:19.889> here

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
so we have a force of two pounds here

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.309 
so we have a force of two pounds here
now<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.579> can't<00:01:21.209> have<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.630> pounds<00:01:22.049> since<00:01:22.200> I

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319 
now I can't have two pounds since I

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.469 
now I can't have two pounds since I
don't<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.770> two<00:01:23.549> pound<00:01:23.759> weight<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.270> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
don't have a two pound weight here so

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.249 
don't have a two pound weight here so
let's<00:01:24.899> see<00:01:25.020> what<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.319> do<00:01:25.499> have<00:01:26.569> if<00:01:27.569> I<00:01:27.749> have<00:01:27.959> one

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
let's see what we do have if I have one

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.010 
let's see what we do have if I have one
pound<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:29.179> half<00:01:30.179> of<00:01:30.389> that<00:01:30.479> weight<00:01:30.779> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
pound here half of that weight is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.499 
pound here half of that weight is
supported<00:01:31.200> by<00:01:31.679> this<00:01:31.740> line<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.490> half<00:01:33.029> of<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.359> by

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
supported by this line and half of it by

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.399 
supported by this line and half of it by
this<00:01:33.569> line<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.859> half<00:01:35.609> of<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.999> pound<00:01:36.359> is<00:01:36.659> one

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this line so half of one pound is one

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.489 
this line so half of one pound is one
half<00:01:37.679> pound<00:01:38.039> and<00:01:38.369> 1/2<00:01:39.209> pound<00:01:39.779> and<00:01:40.049> notice<00:01:40.319> they

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:40.499 
half pound and 1/2 pound and notice they

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:42.889 
half pound and 1/2 pound and notice they
are<00:01:40.560> equal<00:01:41.069> one<00:01:41.520> half<00:01:41.729> pound<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.389> half<00:01:42.599> pound

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
are equal one half pound one half pound

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
are equal one half pound one half pound
of<00:01:43.020> force<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.469> each<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.859> these<00:01:44.039> but<00:01:45.029> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
of force and each one of these but the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.529 
of force and each one of these but the
difference<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.929> if<00:01:46.679> if<00:01:47.130> I'm<00:01:47.819> having<00:01:48.329> to

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
difference is this if if I'm having to

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:54.409 
difference is this if if I'm having to
support<00:01:48.749> this<00:01:49.259> load<00:01:49.649> with<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.759> own<00:01:51.029> force<00:01:53.419> how

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:54.419 
support this load with my own force how

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:58.219 
support this load with my own force how
much<00:01:54.659> force<00:01:55.020> does<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> take<00:01:55.679> to<00:01:56.340> hold<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:57.229> move

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
much force does it take to hold or move

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.909 
much force does it take to hold or move
this<00:01:58.859> load<00:01:59.189> that's<00:02:00.149> 1<00:02:00.419> pound<00:02:00.779> or<00:02:01.079> 100<00:02:01.770> pounds

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:01.919 
this load that's 1 pound or 100 pounds

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:05.989 
this load that's 1 pound or 100 pounds
for<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> matter<00:02:02.899> half<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:04.169> it<00:02:04.609> because<00:02:05.609> half

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
for that matter half of it because half

we always get a one-to-one redirect here
it<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:18.420> what's<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.600> force<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:20.020> this<00:02:20.170> line<00:02:20.850> half

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
it is what's the force in this line half

it is what's the force in this line half

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
pound what does it do it just redirects

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.650 
pound what does it do it just redirects
we<00:02:28.060> now<00:02:28.240> have<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.570> half<00:02:28.960> pound<00:02:29.320> on<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.710> load<00:02:29.920> and

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
we now have a half pound on the load and

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.750 
we now have a half pound on the load and
twice<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:32.080> four<00:02:32.320> I'm<00:02:32.530> sorry<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.250> anchor

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
twice the four I'm sorry on the anchor

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.260 
twice the four I'm sorry on the anchor
and<00:02:33.910> twice<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.140> force<00:02:35.380> on<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:36.250> load<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:37.210> I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
and twice the force on the load that I

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.170 
and twice the force on the load that I
have<00:02:37.720> here<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:39.220> where<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.850> two-two-one

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
have here that's where the two-two-one

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.110 
have here that's where the two-two-one
comes<00:02:40.690> from<00:02:40.990> so<00:02:41.530> we<00:02:41.830> see<00:02:42.100> both<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.730> one-to-one

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
comes from so we see both the one-to-one

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.910 
comes from so we see both the one-to-one
redirect<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.700> two-to-one<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.920> directed

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
redirect and the two-to-one is directed

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.340 
redirect and the two-to-one is directed
towards<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.370> load<00:02:48.610> this<00:02:48.970> time<00:02:49.270> instead<00:02:50.080> of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
towards the load this time instead of

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.230 
towards the load this time instead of
the<00:02:50.470> anchor<00:02:50.890> as<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.340> was<00:02:51.580> in<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:53.560> system<00:02:54.040> and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
the anchor as it was in this system and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.600 
the anchor as it was in this system and
basically<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:56.320> system<00:02:56.860> is<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.400> this

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
basically this system is just this

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.390 
basically this system is just this
system<00:02:58.120> turned<00:02:58.690> upside<00:02:59.200> down<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.740> the<00:03:00.190> load

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
system turned upside down and the load

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.760 
system turned upside down and the load
connected<00:03:00.790> here<00:03:01.300> instead<00:03:01.630> of<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:02.020> now

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
connected here instead of here now

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.260 
connected here instead of here now
that's<00:03:02.950> important<00:03:03.460> because<00:03:03.520> you<00:03:03.850> can<00:03:04.030> take<00:03:04.210> a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
that's important because you can take a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.330 
that's important because you can take a
block<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.750> tackle<00:03:04.810> system<00:03:05.170> that's<00:03:05.710> rated

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
block and tackle system that's rated

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.950 
block and tackle system that's rated
four<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.670> one<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.120> you're<00:03:07.210> pulling<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.720> way

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
four to one and you're pulling this way

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.410 
four to one and you're pulling this way
flip<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.830> upside<00:03:09.220> down<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.700> pull<00:03:09.880> up<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.300> you

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
flip it upside down and pull up and you

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.870 
flip it upside down and pull up and you
got<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> five<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.110> one<00:03:11.140> just<00:03:12.100> by<00:03:12.280> switching<00:03:12.580> it

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
got a five to one just by switching it

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.250 
got a five to one just by switching it
upside<00:03:13.270> down<00:03:13.300> so<00:03:15.660> one<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.840> things<00:03:17.080> we

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
upside down so one of the things we

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.800 
upside down so one of the things we
notice<00:03:17.620> then<00:03:17.830> is<00:03:18.160> whatever<00:03:18.670> force<00:03:19.300> I<00:03:19.600> apply

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
notice then is whatever force I apply

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.250 
notice then is whatever force I apply
here<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.800> doubled<00:03:21.730> toward<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.570> load<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:23.050> is

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
here is doubled toward the load it is

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.250 
here is doubled toward the load it is
not<00:03:23.470> toward<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.950> anchor<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.840> only<00:03:25.840> half<00:03:26.080> the

load is on me or my pool line now there

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.230 
load is on me or my pool line now there
are<00:03:35.530> two<00:03:35.710> other<00:03:35.740> things<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.670> happen<00:03:37.120> in

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
are two other things that happen in

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.100 
are two other things that happen in
pulley<00:03:37.480> systems<00:03:38.020> that<00:03:38.620> are<00:03:38.950> some<00:03:39.460> concern<00:03:40.110> on

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
pulley systems that are some concern on

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.190 
pulley systems that are some concern on

a one-to-one system if I pull my pull
line<00:03:44.470> one<00:03:45.010> foot<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:46.030> weight<00:03:46.270> goes<00:03:46.600> up<00:03:46.870> one

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
line one foot the weight goes up one

line one foot the weight goes up one
foot<00:03:47.380> on<00:03:47.710> a<00:03:48.390> two-to-one<00:03:49.920> if<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.250> pull<00:03:51.640> this<00:03:51.880> one

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
foot on a two-to-one if I pull this one

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.090 
foot on a two-to-one if I pull this one
foot<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.620> only<00:03:53.920> comes<00:03:54.370> up<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.910> half<00:03:55.630> a<00:03:55.780> foot<00:03:56.100> so

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
foot this only comes up a half a foot so

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.790 
foot this only comes up a half a foot so
that<00:03:57.400> two-to-one<00:03:58.300> as<00:03:58.570> far<00:03:58.990> as<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.320> distance

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
that two-to-one as far as the distance

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.610 
that two-to-one as far as the distance
of<00:03:59.950> what<00:04:00.190> load<00:04:00.490> travels<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:02.460> one<00:04:03.460> to<00:04:04.120> two<00:04:04.620> it

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
of what load travels is one to two it

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.610 
of what load travels is one to two it
travels<00:04:06.250> one<00:04:06.610> foot<00:04:06.910> for<00:04:07.240> every<00:04:07.270> two<00:04:08.020> feet<00:04:08.050> this

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
travels one foot for every two feet this

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.150 
travels one foot for every two feet this
travels<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:10.150> has<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.630> travel<00:04:11.140> twice<00:04:11.680> as

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
travels so this has to travel twice as

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.510 
travels so this has to travel twice as
far<00:04:12.459> as<00:04:12.820> we<00:04:13.390> want<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.780> load<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.170> go<00:04:14.380> so<00:04:14.920> if<00:04:15.310> we

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
far as we want the load to go so if we

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.910 
far as we want the load to go so if we
had<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.910> hooked<00:04:16.180> up<00:04:16.420> we<00:04:17.049> want<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:17.440> load<00:04:17.739> to

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
had this hooked up we want this load to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
about this is the velocity or I guess

about this is the velocity or I guess
the<00:04:46.790> speed<00:04:47.180> would<00:04:47.900> be<00:04:48.050> a<00:04:48.080> better<00:04:48.350> word<00:04:48.650> here

whatever<00:04:50.630> rate<00:04:51.290> of<00:04:51.470> speed<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:51.830> pull<00:04:52.310> this<00:04:52.490> at<00:04:52.700> if

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
system if I move this one foot per

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.950 
system if I move this one foot per
second<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:13.130> goes<00:05:13.400> up<00:05:13.760> at<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.330> same<00:05:14.570> speed

one<00:05:15.290> foot<00:05:15.560> per<00:05:15.590> second<00:05:16.190> if<00:05:16.550> I<00:05:16.670> pull<00:05:16.940> this<00:05:17.120> two

feet per second that goes up at two feet
per<00:05:20.000> second<00:05:20.630> so<00:05:21.170> the<00:05:21.530> three<00:05:21.770> things<00:05:21.980> that<00:05:22.310> are
