00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.379
 Hello today only on the motor 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.139
 life.ru first test of the 3rd generation of Czech 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.390
 flagship skoda superb but before that 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.130
 think how often this or 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.050
 another car we are trying to separate 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.760
 set of real consumer properties 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.390
 from some marketing component 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.910
 which is expressed in brand value a 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.860
 really how much is the brand 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.960
 many tried to answer this question 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.179
 groups of scientists invented a variety 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.420
 techniques but even with material 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:41.659
 the embodiment of the brand is far from being so 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.640
 just here for example the emblem of skoda exactly 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.379
 same item only from a little less 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.870
 fresh models worth the supplier 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.050
 about 330 CZK that is a little 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.269
 less than 700 rubles but if we take 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.640
 similar item from similar by 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.159
 the size of the volkswagen is even on the Internet 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.769
 sites we will not find it cheaper than 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.889
 40 euros that is almost 4 times 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.889
 expensive 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.350
 this small example is very clear 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.509
 shows a significant difference between 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.909
 two brands owned 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.340
 one concern in this case concern 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.140
 volkswagen volkswagen ovsky models more often 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.149
 others make us talk about 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.840
 marketing component in the price 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.210
 the car 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.610
 well and a champion in this discipline and 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.399
 definitely skoda superb 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.179
 we all firmly learned the formula more 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.069
 but easier 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.539
 it applies to any volkswagen of sky 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.729
 models that are in the process of changing 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.009
 generations got rid of obsolete 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.360
 highway in favor of the newest modular 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.179
 mqb platform 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.700
 It became more and skoda superb on 28 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.340
 millimeters long and 47 wide and 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.770
 of course it is larger than the eighth trade wind 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.590
 generations and by any of the measurements 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.420
 why there pasok this car just 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.789
 18 millimeters shorter 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.039
 e-class yes and the wheelbase is different 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.890
 not that much at 31 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.720
 and if you adjust the front seats 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.869
 under the driver of medium height and medium 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.120
 body then knees 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.280
 passengers will be seven hundred and ninety three 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.000
 a millimeter is more than e class 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.040
 Five BMW or Audi A6 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 and of course the skoda superb became easier in 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750
 an average of 75 kilos and 22 of 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.130
 they managed to play due to the mass 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.569
 dashboard and finishing materials 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.150
 there is no volkswagen sun instrument 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.549
 the screen on which sports 8 trade winds or 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.769
 new audi tt but there are several others 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.340
 nice things like Wi-Fi point 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.260
 access 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.049
 comfortable tablet holders to 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.239
 there was something to occupy the inhabitants of 2 rows or 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.340
 mobile phone niche which 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.030
 amplifies cellular signal by 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.829
 Skoda's external antenna was slightly cheated 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.310
 motors for example for this car can not 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.470
 to order 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.019
 flagship volkswagen ovsky desi with 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.599
 torque of 500 newton meters 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.329
 but also 280 strong two-liter 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.690
 turbo must be enough so that although 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.690
 what are the words 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.730
 2 liters turbo 280 horsepower 350 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.690
 newton meters 6-speed 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.720
 gears and where 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:26.670
 with g four -wheel drive with haldex clutch fifth 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:30.900
 generations from space to hundreds of 5.8 seconds 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.930
 maximum speed of 250 kilometers per 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.930
 hour 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.859
 I've already had a ride in a new one 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.780
 put the eighth generation and 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.780
 going here in italy for the first 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.030
 meeting again what give me a super thought about 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.889
 that group of engineers working in 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.379
 the same concern volkswagen 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.459
 actually practiced two 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.489
 opposite cases on the one hand 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.030
 prepared to launch a new passat and 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.870
 another raised a killer for him because 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.250
 that the only thing that can save 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.829
 popular volkswagen of this model from 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.409
 intracorporate cannibalism is something 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.609
 the fact that the skoda superb will be 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:14.349
 just where to go bends and a little less 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.400
 to behave decently on the bumps 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.680
 so the conclusion 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.560
 See you new skoda seemed to me 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.330
 simple enough say if you want 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.020
 just use the car will come down and 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.090
 skoda 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.870
 Well, if you want cars and more 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.960
 enjoy then just need to save for 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.660
 volkswagen first sign that this 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.660
 theory would be untenable 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.169
 the news that skoda superb as 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.659
 volkswagen passat will be equipped 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.610
 adaptive highway di ci and that means 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.340
 what to customize to your driving style 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.800
 and the setting will not 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.710
 only steering effort or feedback 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.940
 powertrain but also characteristics 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.970
 pendants 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.349
 and skoda superb is equipped 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.300
 electronic lock 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.830
 front differential and this is 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.440
 first sign of driver's car 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.050
 and you know that in tents big skoda 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.970
 Of course there is no rear wheel drive excitement 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.240
 who was so in love with myself 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.960
 this audit is not here this weighty 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.400
 thoroughness which is inherent 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.620
 volkswagen passat eighth generation then 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.660
 there is 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.699
 skoda superb are not at all like two 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.720
 other cars built on too 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.630
 modular mqb platform 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.360
 incredible inherent in the Czech car 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.720
 ease almost playfulness of which this 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.630
 the car passes corners and it is for this 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.419
 superb character will surely love 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:55.490
 not only those who value space on 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:58.940
 second row and lastly about prices 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.620
 Superba cost 2 generation of Passat 7 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.130
 differed by about 100 1000 rubles 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.050
 so that from the model of nominal generation while 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.930
 incomprehensible but I dare to assure you 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.940
 the moment you watch this story 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.150
 marketing manager 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.039
 new volkswagen of and a skeleton struggling 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.100
 creak brains and over their heads 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:22.800
 light bluish smoke rises 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.580
 dear ladies and gentlemen managers if 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.960
 you are watching this program now find out 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.960
 I do not envy you
