00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.259
 if I'm the neoliberal right 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.790
 understand it is so if we the location 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.170
 Germany wants to save now 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.809
 there we can not any longer 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.309
 chub here with feed the the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.410
 performance pressure and the expectations not 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.910
 the competition in asia has grown 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.869
 It does not sleep that either 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.949
 they only have new frankfurt 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.109
 globalization 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.660
 It used to be the pressure from Asia 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.160
 you see the library here 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.130
 if you read the newspaper correctly 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.599
 want to make a funny afternoon 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.669
 read the forecasts of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.989
 economic experts from 15 years ago 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.610
 maybe they remember that too 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.829
 At that time, the Japanese was our model 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.059
 but the Japanese know that's it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.010
 a dynamic economy looks at you 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.690
 that's the defense of the whole world 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.250
 Called when the rough go on 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.510
 we have less banner 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.730
 We have to live the Japanese work 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.650
 the japanese economy mediaplaner 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 management methods everything like the japanese 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.820
 Lucky we did not do that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.170
 have a look at a media room 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.170
 have been growing for ten years 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.480
 the Japanese economic miracle was 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.640
 a speculative bubble of pure capitalism 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.620
 they have real estate of friends 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.190
 so you can pay or see 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.610
 Review summer purchased reviewers 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.320
 to let 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.119
 on this over will have real estate 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.070
 the loans open with those have money 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.630
 the next property bought the have 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.710
 let's re- evaluate and over 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.430
 they have new loans on them 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.690
 recorded 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.070
 so have the next property 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.670
 We bought the we can overcome 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.380
 etc 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.700
 and never with this money 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.710
 the value has the whole thing 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.360
 Business boosted and at the end 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.360
 had a sell his house 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.580
 Since then, everyone is broke 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.830
 Japanese are Japanese banks 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.640
 more or less bankrupt japan one 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.240
 twice as high per capita debt 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.740
 How Germany is Japan remains 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.000
 when the ddr was ever 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.750
 economic experts find something stupid 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 you in a zoo 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.329
 People who extrapolate as the world in 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.299
 30 years looks like if everything stays that way 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.350
 as it is now 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.610
 Do you really want to know how long 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.000
 Your toenails will be if they never 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.500
 again snow which convert the here 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.660
 the rights of the ministry look like high 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.130
 the pension contribution rate in 2050 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.080
 you owe, please can not do anything 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.310
 do meaningful 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.739
 there are so many bed covered age 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.940
 have to provide 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.769
 because they can because they can in the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.599
 look forward to the future 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.849
 you know we are 45 years is know 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.430
 What she is in 20 years is 15 years 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.190
 maybe manageable period or 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.790
 15 years I guess 15 years back 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:47.250
 I would have told you 1989 in 2004 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.870
 Romania joins NATO and beats 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.310
 Germany in football with the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.310
 Reserve team 41 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.560
 I would have told you in the same 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.290
 year, hungary joins the european union 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.819
 at and suggests Germany 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:15.420
 national coach lothar matthaus with the 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.190
 second reserve team 2 0 and would have 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.220
 I then told him the same year 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.690
 triplett land at the latest therefore the 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.480
 First said because the city is now 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.459
 another new commission of 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.129
 bahlsen reza latvia also joins the eu 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:38.819
 at and in spite of latvia 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:41.069
 who would have an acclaimed 0 0 in 2004 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.030
 I use the 189 decades guys with them 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.030
 let the jacket come 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.489
 who can look into the future who knows 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.989
 What is in 15 years maybe you have 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.510
 until then a government we chose the 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:06.250
 Americans do not fit in with the junk 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.700
 even more bad luck finds the pds in the middle of 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.609
 Berlin 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.930
 but then they all look since you 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.280
 first of all they have flattened you 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.570
 do not worry so the pension then say 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.160
 I 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.870
 franz pany iraker is their biggest concern 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.870
 the pension contribution rate in 2050 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.330
 they can not do that 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.830
 so to speak, no, that's the most popular 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.970
 question from journalist lord minister 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.530
 can you rule that out? 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.900
 The minister has to say no 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.470
 excluding not equal 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.720
 More likely , that's us 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.840
 wm 2006 final 11 0 but win 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.800
 I can not rule that out 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.970
 and then theirs is next 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.000
 number of ministers closes the 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.050
 bombing berlins not like that 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.240
 work the media 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.130
 we depend on statisticians 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.210
 of these people, they are all high-level 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.340
 a statistician 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.720
 He watches her for two hours 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.880
 of whether the woman is a dish soup 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.050
 at the end of the calculated help 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.400
 soup you forget in the whole life 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.729
 that they will have gone when 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.059
 is say 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.169
 I never eat soup again. What does he get ? 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.270
 not even with the statistics 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.529
 that would not be bad just my 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.789
 Depperte government has ever 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:20.719
 the whole clan put them 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:20.719
 afterwards would be 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.399
 And then they have to do that too 

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.300
 Listen to sayings about our lives 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.769
 conditions 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.719
 that's what the welfare recipient wants 

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:37.979
 just do not realize that the over 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.330
 his circumstances are alive, that must be 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.249
 French müntefering that I finally 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.209
 explains franz müntefering the 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:47.099
 insolvency administrator of the spd of the muslim 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:48.539
 socially caught explain that the over 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.180
 his relationships live with the ackermann 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.280
 they do not need to explain that 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.009
 the ackermann does not live over his 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.550
 he tried that but it did 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.550
 it does not work 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.950
 the ackermann lives over ours 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:12.310
 conditions 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:12.310
 [Applause]
