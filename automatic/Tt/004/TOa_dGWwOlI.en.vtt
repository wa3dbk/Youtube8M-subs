much done

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.670 
much done
as<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.430> can<00:01:51.550> see<00:01:51.760> you<00:01:51.910> can<00:01:52.150> sit<00:01:52.510> on<00:01:52.720> it<00:01:52.990> so

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
as you can see you can sit on it so

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.550 
as you can see you can sit on it so
basically<00:01:54.360> how<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:55.600> works<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.200> pig<00:01:56.410> is

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
basically how this works is the pig is

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.030 
basically how this works is the pig is
basically<00:01:56.950> glitched<00:01:57.520> inside<00:01:58.260> like<00:01:59.260> half<00:01:59.710> a

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
basically glitched inside like half a

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.900 
basically glitched inside like half a
block<00:02:00.400> underneath<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.710> stair<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:03.490> looks

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
block underneath this stair and it looks

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.420 
block underneath this stair and it looks
very<00:02:04.240> good<00:02:04.500> only<00:02:05.500> problem<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.190> when<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
very good only problem is when the

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.280 
very good only problem is when the
invisibility<00:02:06.880> potion<00:02:07.510> runs<00:02:07.720> out<00:02:07.900> you'll<00:02:08.080> have

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
invisibility potion runs out you'll have
