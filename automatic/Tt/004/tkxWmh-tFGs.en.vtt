00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Maysoon Abbas Checker: Anwar Dafa-Alla 

00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:08.848
 How old is the Earth? 

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.866
 Well, by counting the number of isotopes 

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.212
 In a sample of rock 

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.320
 Which has undergone radiation decay, 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.543
 Geologists estimate Earth's birth day, 

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:18.873
 When first formed from the nebula, 

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:21.902
 To be 4.6 billion years ago. 

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:24.209
 But how long is that a fact? 

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:25.289
 Here are some measurements 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.261
 Which may help you understand. 

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:30.534
 For example, let us imagine the history of the entire Earth 

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:31.876
 To the present day 

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:33.919
 As a single calendar year. 

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:37.124
 The ground begins in Genesis on January 1. 

00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:39.459
 By March 3, there is the first evidence 

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:41.286
 For monoclonal bacteria. 

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:44.850
 Life remains surprisingly monolithic until November 11th 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.315
 When multicellular objects come first, 

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:50.146
 Known as the Diocese. 

00:00:50.146 --> 00:00:54.121
 Shortly thereafter, on November 16 at 6:08 pm 

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.409
 The &amp; quot; Cambrian Explosion &amp; quot; for life, 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:57.576
 A major milestone, 

00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:00.674
 When all the people of modern objects began to appear. 

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:03.873
 On December 10th, at 1:26 pm, 

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:05.712
 It was the first evolution of dinosaurs 

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:07.293
 But was erased by an asteroid 

00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:09.290
 Only two weeks later. 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.794
 Rise and fall the great Roman Empire, on 31 December 

00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:14.952
 In less than four seconds. 

00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:16.037
 Columbus sails 

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:17.504
 To what is believed to be India 

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:19.378
 Three minutes before midnight. 

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.071
 If you try to write earth date 

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:24.159
 Using only one page per year, 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.075
 Your book will be 145 miles thick, 

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.445
 This is more than half the distance 

00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:30.817
 To the International Space Station. 

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:33.005
 The story is 3.2 million years old 

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.701
 Australopithicine fossil known as Lucy 

00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.371
 It will be found at 144 miles, 

00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:41.294
 500 feet from the end of the book. 

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:44.872
 Will be the signing of the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America 

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:47.295
 In the last half inch. 

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:49.326
 Or if we compare geological time 

00:01:49.326 --> 00:01:50.749
 A woman stretches her arms 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.407
 For a six foot spread, 

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:54.331
 Simple act of trimming her nails 

00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.466
 Will remove all recorded human history. 

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:00.699
 Finally, let us imagine the history of the earth as your own life: 

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:01.926
 From the moment I was born 

00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:03.890
 To your first day in high school. 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.069
 The first word I have spoken, 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.190
 And for the first time, 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.652
 And the first time you walk in it 

00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:09.694
 All will take their place while life on earth 

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.760
 They were composed of single-celled organisms. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.248
 In fact, the first multicellular organisms 

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:17.156
 You did not develop until you were 12 years old 

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:18.691
 The seventh grade, 

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:19.584
 Directly close to 

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:21.276
 When your teacher of science says to the class 

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:23.385
 How fossils were formed. 

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:24.579
 Do not show dinosaurs 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.526
 Until three months after the eighth grade 

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:29.680
 It is soon erased from the spring holiday. 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.594
 Three days before the ninth grade begins, 

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:33.171
 When you realize that the summer is over 

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:34.877
 You need new school supplies, 

00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:38.636
 Lucy, Australopithecine, wandering around Africa. 

00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:39.855
 When you finish breakfast 

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:41.698
 And go outside to catch up with your vehicle 

00:02:41.698 --> 00:02:43.676
 44 minutes before school, 

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:46.927
 Primitive humans will be extinct throughout Europe. 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.190
 The latest glacial period 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.856
 Ends when your cart is gone 

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:52.822
 16 minutes before the start of the season. 

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.788
 Columbus sails before the season by 50 seconds 

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:58.705
 And you are still trying to find the right grade. 

00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:00.552
 Signed &amp; quot; Declaration of Independence &amp; quot; 

00:03:00.552 --> 00:03:02.353
 28 seconds later 

00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:04.206
 You are looking for an empty seat. 

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:08.148
 I was born 1.3 seconds before the bell. 

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.807
 So, you see the earth 

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.130
 Very incredibly old 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.592
 Compare for us humans 

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:14.854
 With a fossil record 

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:17.885
 Hiding incredible stories to tell us about the past 

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.958
 And perhaps the future as well. 

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.713
 But in the short time we were here, 

00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:23.041
 We learned a lot 

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.663
 Surely we will learn more 

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:26.563
 Over the coming decades and centuries 

00:03:26.563 --> 00:03:29.187
 It is close to moments in geological time.
