00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
know so so might win over the fight so
for<00:00:50.640> example<00:00:51.059> um<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.899> honestly<00:00:52.590> feel<00:00:52.800> like

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
for example um I honestly feel like

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.100 
for example um I honestly feel like
Sasuke<00:00:53.730> might<00:00:53.910> actually<00:00:54.059> win<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.899> it's

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
Sasuke might actually win I know it's

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
Sasuke might actually win I know it's
kind<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.320> weird<00:00:55.559> I'm<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> Dragonball<00:00:56.460> Z<00:00:56.579> channel

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
kind of weird I'm a Dragonball Z channel

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.240 
kind of weird I'm a Dragonball Z channel
i<00:00:57.090> watch<00:00:57.449> dramas<00:00:57.899> he<00:00:58.109> more<00:00:58.530> than<00:00:58.710> also<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.190> I

think<00:00:59.520> Sasuke<00:00:59.879> might<00:01:00.030> win<00:01:00.239> why<00:01:00.930> well<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.859> think

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
think Sasuke might win why well I think

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.130 
think Sasuke might win why well I think
it's<00:01:02.550> ultimately<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:03.120> come<00:01:03.300> down<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.660> Goku's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's ultimately to come down to Goku's

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
it's ultimately to come down to Goku's
weakness<00:01:04.530> being<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.979> he's<00:01:05.100> curious<00:01:05.430> Goku

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
weakness being that he's curious Goku

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.520 
weakness being that he's curious Goku

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.469 
opponents abilities and that's what's
gonna<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> ultimate<00:01:25.409> flaw<00:01:25.680> if<00:01:26.299> Sasuke<00:01:27.299> can

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
gonna be a ultimate flaw if Sasuke can

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.929 
gonna be a ultimate flaw if Sasuke can
pull<00:01:27.659> off<00:01:27.750> again<00:01:28.020> jutsu<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:29.549> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
pull off again jutsu on them that you

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.670 
pull off again jutsu on them that you
know<00:01:30.060> that'd<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.900> an<00:01:30.960> opportunity<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
know that'd be an opportunity to do a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
know that'd be an opportunity to do a
lot<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> damage<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.850> happens<00:01:33.210> there

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
lot of damage and if that happens there

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.730 
lot of damage and if that happens there
you<00:01:33.420> know<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:34.259> not<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.530> lot<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you know actually not just a lot of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.399 
you know actually not just a lot of
damage<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:35.939> lose<00:01:36.150> yes<00:01:37.020> well

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
damage but go can even lose yes well

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.359 
damage but go can even lose yes well
that's<00:01:37.470> good<00:01:37.680> that's<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:37.950> could<00:01:38.070> happen

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that's good that's what could happen

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.469 
that's good that's what could happen
whoa<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.939> happened<00:01:39.060> there

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
whoa what happened there

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.780

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
oh okay yeah Goku could actually lose if

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
oh okay yeah Goku could actually lose if
that<00:01:41.909> happens<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.720> course<00:01:43.140> makoki<00:01:43.590> deal

over<00:02:26.110> if<00:02:26.770> that<00:02:27.010> happens<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.430> literally

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
over if that happens that literally

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.730 
over if that happens that literally
there's<00:02:28.180> nothing<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.170> other<00:02:29.380> than<00:02:29.620> the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
there's nothing we can do other than the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.530 
there's nothing we can do other than the
fact<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.040> we<00:02:30.220> probably<00:02:30.459> rip<00:02:30.760> off<00:02:30.910> his<00:02:31.030> arm<00:02:31.330> or

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
fact that we probably rip off his arm or

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.210 
fact that we probably rip off his arm or
limb<00:02:31.720> or<00:02:31.900> whatever's<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.260> fire<00:02:32.560> otherwise

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
limb or whatever's on fire otherwise

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.890 
limb or whatever's on fire otherwise
it's<00:02:33.520> going<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.700> consume<00:02:34.000> there's<00:02:34.330> no<00:02:34.660> way

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
it's going to consume there's no way

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.330 
it's going to consume there's no way
that<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.380> fire<00:02:35.590> can<00:02:35.709> be<00:02:35.830> extinguished<00:02:35.860> cuz

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
that that fire can be extinguished cuz

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.940 
that that fire can be extinguished cuz
that's<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.580> rules<00:02:36.880> I'm<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> colossal<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:37.989> of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
that's the rules I'm a colossal so of

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.740 
that's the rules I'm a colossal so of
course<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.250> flaw<00:02:39.459> is<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:40.209> very<00:02:40.270> very<00:02:40.600> slow

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
course the flaw is it's very very slow

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.300 
course the flaw is it's very very slow
so<00:02:41.170> if<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.459> if<00:02:43.860> Sasuke<00:02:44.860> fires<00:02:45.130> out

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
so if I know if Sasuke fires out

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.160 
so if I know if Sasuke fires out
Amaterasu<00:02:45.940> all<00:02:46.120> Goku<00:02:46.600> has<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.810> do<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.050> either

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
Amaterasu all Goku has to do is either

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.290 
Amaterasu all Goku has to do is either
dodge<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.739> or<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:48.130> be<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.550> front<00:02:48.910> something

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
dodge it or just be in front something

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.640 
dodge it or just be in front something
if<00:02:49.570> he's<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.870> first<00:02:50.050> something<00:02:50.320> that's<00:02:50.470> gonna

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
if he's in first something that's gonna

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.560 
if he's in first something that's gonna
hit<00:02:50.860> whatever<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.790> front<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:52.030> instead<00:02:52.330> and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
hit whatever is in front of instead and

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.820 
hit whatever is in front of instead and
Goku<00:02:53.230> be<00:02:53.380> fine

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
Goku be fine

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.520 
Goku be fine
so<00:02:54.190> between<00:02:54.400> Amaterasu<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.180> genjutsu<00:02:55.530> there

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
so between Amaterasu and genjutsu there

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.430
