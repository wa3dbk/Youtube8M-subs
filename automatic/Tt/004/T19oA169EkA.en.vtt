for<00:01:51.789> a<00:01:51.819> couple<00:01:52.060> years<00:01:52.090> I<00:01:52.330> thought<00:01:52.569> I<00:01:52.630> was

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
for a couple years I thought I was

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.990 
for a couple years I thought I was
actually<00:01:53.369> empowered<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.490> solution<00:01:54.880> I've

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
actually empowered the solution I've

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.339 
actually empowered the solution I've
since<00:01:55.240> found<00:01:55.300> those<00:01:55.569> hpower<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.020> problem

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
since found those hpower the problem

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.589 
since found those hpower the problem
rather<00:01:57.280> than<00:01:57.490> running<00:01:57.819> three<00:01:58.420> or<00:01:58.479> four

00:01:58.589 --> 00:01:58.599

one of those recycle bins at the moment

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:50.870 
one of those recycle bins at the moment
it's<00:04:49.740> about<00:04:49.889> a<00:04:49.949> year's<00:04:50.220> worth<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.580> cycle

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
plastic in the recycle bin itself our

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.950 
plastic in the recycle bin itself our
our<00:04:53.310> kids<00:04:53.550> generation<00:04:53.940> gonna<00:04:54.240> have<00:04:54.389> to<00:04:54.509> create

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
our kids generation gonna have to create

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.290 
our kids generation gonna have to create
recycling<00:04:55.860> bins<00:04:56.039> big<00:04:56.340> enough<00:04:56.520> to<00:04:56.669> recycle<00:04:57.000> our

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
recycling bins big enough to recycle our

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.180 
recycling bins big enough to recycle our
bins<00:04:57.509> well<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.080> would<00:04:58.470> guess<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.949> thing

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
bins well I would guess that that thing

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.350 
bins well I would guess that that thing
in<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.430> landfill<00:04:59.820> would<00:04:59.940> probably<00:05:00.210> have<00:05:00.330> a

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
in a landfill would probably have a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.300 
in a landfill would probably have a
half-life<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:01.080> six<00:05:01.889> to<00:05:02.039> seven<00:05:02.250> hundred

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
half-life of six to seven hundred

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.719 
half-life of six to seven hundred
thousand<00:05:03.120> half<00:05:03.479> years<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.680> use<00:05:04.889> my<00:05:05.039> friend

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
thousand half years and I use my friend

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.279 
thousand half years and I use my friend
who's<00:05:06.150> gonna<00:05:06.300> who's<00:05:06.479> gonna<00:05:06.659> recite<00:05:07.080> on<00:05:07.199> the
