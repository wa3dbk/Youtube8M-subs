thousand rep points for this weapon and
there's<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:34.950> too<00:00:35.370> much<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.030> difference<00:00:36.540> in

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
there's not too much of a difference in

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.619 
there's not too much of a difference in
terms<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.140> actual<00:00:37.500> damage<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.520> stats<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
terms of actual damage and stats so the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.330 
terms of actual damage and stats so the
first<00:00:39.809> thing<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.469> base<00:00:40.770> damage<00:00:41.040> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
first thing is that the base damage is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.160 
first thing is that the base damage is
exactly<00:00:41.850> equal<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> original<00:00:42.600> they<00:00:43.020> both

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
exactly equal to the original they both

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
exactly equal to the original they both
are<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.469> 160<00:00:44.129> except<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> Baker<00:00:44.940> has<00:00:45.149> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
are at 160 except the Baker has a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.000 
are at 160 except the Baker has a
slightly<00:00:45.270> higher<00:00:45.660> impact<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.710> slightly

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
slightly higher impact the slightly

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.860 
slightly higher impact the slightly
lowered<00:00:47.550> /<00:00:47.850> writing<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.450> means<00:00:48.629> we'll<00:00:48.840> be

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
lowered / writing so this means we'll be

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.330 
lowered / writing so this means we'll be
a<00:00:48.960> little<00:00:49.230> bit<00:00:49.410> better<00:00:49.500> taking<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:49.950> shielded

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
a little bit better taking down shielded

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
a little bit better taking down shielded
targets<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> little<00:00:51.149> bit<00:00:51.270> weaker<00:00:51.629> taking

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
targets but a little bit weaker taking

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.779 
targets but a little bit weaker taking
down<00:00:52.140> infested<00:00:52.680> targets<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.250> isn't<00:00:53.610> really

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
down infested targets this isn't really

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:54.830 
down infested targets this isn't really
gonna<00:00:53.910> make<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> difference<00:00:54.270> though<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
gonna make a difference though in the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360 
gonna make a difference though in the
grand<00:00:55.020> scheme<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.320> things<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:56.129> really

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
grand scheme of things what I was really

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
grand scheme of things what I was really
looking<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> an<00:00:57.449> increase<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.870> puncture

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
looking for is an increase to puncture

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560 
looking for is an increase to puncture
damage<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.890> help<00:00:59.039> with<00:00:59.219> armored<00:00:59.640> targets<00:00:59.820> but

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
damage to help with armored targets but

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.240 
damage to help with armored targets but
we<00:01:00.719> didn't<00:01:00.930> really<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.289> however<00:01:02.010> it

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
we didn't really get that however it

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
we didn't really get that however it
still<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> decent<00:01:02.940> puncture<00:01:03.570> rating<00:01:03.989> it's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
still has a decent puncture rating it's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.710 
still has a decent puncture rating it's
not<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.890> week<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.760> would<00:01:06.119> say<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.420> take<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.600> on

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
not like week I would say it take me on

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.850 
not like week I would say it take me on
armored<00:01:06.930> targets<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.830> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
armored targets but that was one of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770 
armored targets but that was one of
things<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.430> looking<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.630> also

the innate justice effect which really

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.130 
the innate justice effect which really
is<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> selling<00:01:36.630> point<00:01:36.840> but

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
is going to be the selling point but

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
is going to be the selling point but
talking<00:01:37.350> specifically<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.220> critical

right<00:01:40.470> now<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.920> i<00:01:41.009> feel<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.520> barely<00:01:41.970> makes

chances<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.610> way<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.149> honest<00:02:06.540> thing

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
chances that way but the honest thing

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
chances that way but the honest thing
about<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.170> that<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.649> multiplier<00:02:08.340> didn't

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
about it is that the multiplier didn't

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
about it is that the multiplier didn't
get<00:02:08.700> an<00:02:08.819> increase<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.780> weapon<00:02:10.080> still<00:02:10.259> only

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
get an increase so the weapon still only

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.220 
get an increase so the weapon still only
has<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> 1.2<00:02:11.400> crit<00:02:12.209> chance<00:02:12.239> multiplier<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.770 
has a 1.2 crit chance multiplier with a
mac<00:02:13.379> so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
mac so

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.540

make a crit chance build because the way
it<00:02:23.500> sits<00:02:23.620> right<00:02:23.770> now<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.520> that<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.910> can<00:02:25.270> get

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
it sits right now is that you can get

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.180 
it sits right now is that you can get
more<00:02:25.780> damage<00:02:26.230> than<00:02:26.350> building<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.770> top<00:02:26.950> end

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
more damage than building a top end

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.280 
more damage than building a top end
damage<00:02:27.790> build<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:28.780> comparing<00:02:29.230> a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
damage build with it but comparing a

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.960 
damage build with it but comparing a
target<00:02:29.680> cracker<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.190> regular<00:02:30.580> element<00:02:30.880> like

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
target cracker to a regular element like

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.940 
target cracker to a regular element like
a<00:02:31.030> ninety<00:02:31.270> percent<00:02:31.360> element<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.260> only<00:02:32.530> going

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
a ninety percent element it's only going

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.770 
a ninety percent element it's only going
to<00:02:33.010> be<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.160> difference<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.819> couple<00:02:34.060> thousand

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
to be a difference of a couple thousand

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.809 
to be a difference of a couple thousand
damage<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:36.010> guess<00:02:36.250> what<00:02:36.370> I'm<00:02:36.459> trying<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.730> say

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
damage so I guess what I'm trying to say

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.820 
damage so I guess what I'm trying to say
is<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.420> there's<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.780> lot<00:02:37.989> of<00:02:38.050> risk<00:02:38.380> involved

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
is it there's a lot of risk involved

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.420 
is it there's a lot of risk involved
with<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.430> crit<00:02:39.640> chance<00:02:39.670> build<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.860> not<00:02:42.160> too

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
with the crit chance build with not too

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.890 
with the crit chance build with not too
much<00:02:42.580> reward<00:02:42.760> like<00:02:43.180> you're<00:02:43.330> not<00:02:43.480> going<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:43.750> see

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
much reward like you're not going to see

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.229 
much reward like you're not going to see
huge<00:02:44.380> numbers<00:02:44.830> like<00:02:45.130> 20k<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.910> stuff<00:02:46.120> like

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
huge numbers like 20k and stuff like

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.870 
huge numbers like 20k and stuff like
that<00:02:46.300> very<00:02:46.810> often<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.340> definitely<00:02:48.550> have

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
that very often and you definitely have

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.820 
that very often and you definitely have
to<00:02:48.970> always<00:02:49.150> land<00:02:49.570> your<00:02:49.690> headshots<00:02:50.140> otherwise

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
to always land your headshots otherwise

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.650 
to always land your headshots otherwise
it's<00:02:51.070> just<00:02:51.130> not<00:02:51.400> worth<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.820> at<00:02:51.910> all<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.480> you're

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
it's just not worth it at all so you're

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.479 
it's just not worth it at all so you're
really<00:02:52.959> left<00:02:53.350> with<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.590> choice<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.310> either

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
really left with a choice you can either

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.460 
really left with a choice you can either
just<00:02:54.790> go<00:02:54.970> Yolo<00:02:55.390> take<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.840> risk<00:02:56.019> try<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.350> hit

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
just go Yolo take the risk try to hit

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.259 
just go Yolo take the risk try to hit
the<00:02:56.560> high<00:02:56.680> numbers<00:02:57.130> with<00:02:57.640> the<00:02:57.700> crippled<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
the high numbers with the crippled and

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.000 
the high numbers with the crippled and
hope<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.569> get<00:02:58.780> them<00:02:58.989> when<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.319> need<00:02:59.350> them<00:02:59.590> or

tend to incorporate to duel said

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.850 
tend to incorporate to duel said
elements<00:04:34.810> with<00:04:34.900> a<00:04:34.930> regular<00:04:35.200> element<00:04:35.650> to<00:04:35.710> get

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
elements with a regular element to get

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.590 
elements with a regular element to get
more<00:04:36.040> top-end<00:04:36.490> damage<00:04:36.850> as<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.030> regular

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
more top-end damage as a regular

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.060 
more top-end damage as a regular
elements<00:04:37.990> will<00:04:38.139> give<00:04:38.290> you<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.590> full<00:04:38.740> ninety

percent opposed to the sixty percent

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.080 
percent opposed to the sixty percent
damage<00:04:41.230> so<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:41.919> is<00:04:41.950> for<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.220> grineer<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.850> just

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
damage so this is for the grineer I just

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.760 
damage so this is for the grineer I just
basically<00:04:43.360> build<00:04:43.600> radiation<00:04:44.110> toxic<00:04:44.500> against

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
basically build radiation toxic against

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.610 
basically build radiation toxic against
them<00:04:45.040> if<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:45.639> did<00:04:45.910> want<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:46.210> go<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:46.750> top

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
them if you did want to go the the top

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.350 
them if you did want to go the the top
end<00:04:47.800> damage<00:04:47.950> build<00:04:48.310> with<00:04:48.520> some<00:04:48.730> more<00:04:48.910> utility

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
end damage build with some more utility

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.300 
end damage build with some more utility
I<00:04:49.540> tend<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.139> use<00:04:50.200> ice<00:04:50.590> storm<00:04:50.919> as<00:04:51.040> this<00:04:51.130> will

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
I tend to use ice storm as this will

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.300 
I tend to use ice storm as this will
bump<00:04:51.580> my<00:04:51.750> magazine<00:04:52.750> capacity<00:04:52.900> up<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.380> 14<00:04:54.040> and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
bump my magazine capacity up to 14 and

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.120 
bump my magazine capacity up to 14 and
then<00:04:54.730> I<00:04:54.760> basically<00:04:55.060> just<00:04:55.270> use<00:04:55.919> expel<00:04:56.919> mod

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
then I basically just use expel mod

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.860 
then I basically just use expel mod
basically<00:04:57.639> except<00:04:57.970> i<00:04:58.060> need<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.419> expel

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
basically except i need the expel

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.990 
basically except i need the expel
grineer<00:04:59.230> this<00:04:59.830> is<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.010> really<00:05:00.220> solid<00:05:00.430> build<00:05:00.729> and

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
grineer this is a really solid build and

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.990 
grineer this is a really solid build and
i<00:05:01.060> really<00:05:01.900> just<00:05:02.229> use<00:05:02.500> this<00:05:02.740> usually<00:05:03.550> for

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
i really just use this usually for

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.340 
i really just use this usually for
anything<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:04.540> is<00:05:04.780> just<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.139> regular

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350

exterminating mission if i'm going into

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.850 
exterminating mission if i'm going into
like<00:05:07.330> really<00:05:07.630> high<00:05:07.810> survival<00:05:08.260> missions<00:05:08.740> are

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
like really high survival missions are

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.920 
like really high survival missions are
really<00:05:08.889> high<00:05:09.250> scaling<00:05:09.820> then<00:05:10.210> i'll<00:05:10.330> switch<00:05:10.780> to

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
really high scaling then i'll switch to

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.210 
really high scaling then i'll switch to
the<00:05:11.020> crip<00:05:11.229> build<00:05:11.470> but<00:05:11.680> this<00:05:11.830> will<00:05:12.010> definitely

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
the crip build but this will definitely

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.330 
the crip build but this will definitely
work<00:05:12.460> very<00:05:12.880> well<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:14.110> corpus<00:05:14.560> i'm<00:05:14.770> the

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
work very well for the corpus i'm the

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.530 
work very well for the corpus i'm the
same<00:05:15.490> kind<00:05:15.669> of<00:05:15.790> thing<00:05:16.000> we're<00:05:16.240> just<00:05:16.389> going<00:05:16.510> to

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
same kind of thing we're just going to

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.650 
same kind of thing we're just going to
be<00:05:16.630> using<00:05:17.220> basically<00:05:18.220> magnetic<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.090> toxic

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
be using basically magnetic and toxic

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.020 
be using basically magnetic and toxic
though<00:05:19.840> in<00:05:19.990> this<00:05:20.139> instance<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:20.919> then<00:05:21.490> for<00:05:21.820> the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
though in this instance and then for the

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.450 
though in this instance and then for the
infested<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.780> could<00:05:22.930> definitely<00:05:23.229> do<00:05:23.590> a<00:05:23.800> blast

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
infested you could definitely do a blast

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.820 
infested you could definitely do a blast
kind<00:05:24.790> of<00:05:24.880> thing<00:05:25.090> where<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.139> incorporate<00:05:26.680> like

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
kind of thing where you incorporate like

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.100 
kind of thing where you incorporate like
a<00:05:26.860> firearm<00:05:27.250> odd<00:05:27.370> but<00:05:27.639> for<00:05:28.389> the<00:05:28.479> infested<00:05:28.930> I

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
a firearm odd but for the infested I

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.230 
a firearm odd but for the infested I
tend<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.620> like<00:05:29.680> running<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.250> crib<00:05:30.490> because<00:05:30.700> I

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
tend to like running the crib because I

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.330 
tend to like running the crib because I
just<00:05:31.720> really<00:05:32.020> want<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.289> take<00:05:32.410> the<00:05:32.620> Hyrule<00:05:33.130> to

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
just really want to take the Hyrule to

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.490 
just really want to take the Hyrule to
kill<00:05:33.580> those<00:05:33.729> ancients<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.419> those<00:05:34.660> swarm

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
kill those ancients and those swarm

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.020 
kill those ancients and those swarm
walls<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.890> stuff<00:05:36.010> as<00:05:36.190> quickly<00:05:36.430> as<00:05:36.610> possible

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
walls and stuff as quickly as possible

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.490 
walls and stuff as quickly as possible
so<00:05:37.210> I<00:05:37.240> generally<00:05:37.690> just<00:05:37.750> run<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.110> crib<00:05:38.320> build

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
so I generally just run the crib build

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.830 
so I generally just run the crib build
for<00:05:38.740> them<00:05:38.890> so<00:05:39.310> i<00:05:39.340> put<00:05:39.669> in<00:05:39.789> pistol<00:05:40.510> gambit<00:05:40.810> and

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
for them so i put in pistol gambit and

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.480 
for them so i put in pistol gambit and
tart<00:05:41.050> cracker<00:05:41.320> again<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:41.919> i'm<00:05:42.220> just<00:05:42.310> running

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
tart cracker again and i'm just running

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.640 
tart cracker again and i'm just running
pure<00:05:42.880> corrosive<00:05:43.450> damage<00:05:43.810> to<00:05:44.200> just<00:05:44.380> really

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
pure corrosive damage to just really

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.400 
pure corrosive damage to just really
take<00:05:44.890> out<00:05:45.100> those<00:05:45.580> specific<00:05:46.510> infested<00:05:47.080> targets

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
take out those specific infested targets

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.290 
take out those specific infested targets
and<00:05:47.530> for<00:05:47.650> the<00:05:47.740> voids<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.070> same<00:05:48.310> thing<00:05:48.610> I<00:05:48.820> tend

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
and for the voids the same thing I tend

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.150 
and for the voids the same thing I tend
to<00:05:49.390> just<00:05:49.600> take<00:05:49.780> the<00:05:49.930> risk<00:05:50.169> with<00:05:50.380> the<00:05:50.560> crib

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
to just take the risk with the crib

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.130 
to just take the risk with the crib
build<00:05:51.370> as<00:05:51.550> well<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:52.210> get<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.450> high<00:05:52.570> rules<00:05:52.840> on

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
build as well to get the high rules on

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.350 
build as well to get the high rules on
the<00:05:53.320> heavy<00:05:53.560> gunners<00:05:54.010> so<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:54.760> config<00:05:55.030> c<00:05:55.180> is

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
the heavy gunners so the config c is

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.150 
the heavy gunners so the config c is
going<00:05:55.479> to<00:05:55.539> be<00:05:55.660> both<00:05:55.930> are<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.710> same<00:05:56.740> for<00:05:57.100> both

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
going to be both are the same for both

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.129 
going to be both are the same for both
factions<00:05:57.490> i'm<00:05:58.090> already<00:05:58.300> just<00:05:58.539> imagining<00:05:59.050> the

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139
