more 50s let's go to sit in of the video
so<00:04:13.349> here<00:04:13.709> start<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.639> be<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:15.139> more<00:04:16.139> confusion

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
so here start to be like more confusion

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.529 
so here start to be like more confusion

here so if you want to record the full
size<00:04:21.780> of<00:04:22.049> your<00:04:22.229> gaming<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:22.919> we<00:04:23.070> can<00:04:23.280> just<00:04:23.729> use

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
size of your gaming so we can just use

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.440 
size of your gaming so we can just use
full<00:04:24.300> size<00:04:24.510> and<00:04:24.780> if

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
full size and if

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.280 
full size and if
want<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.870> choose<00:04:26.770> like<00:04:27.300> 720p<00:04:28.300> here<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.080> can

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
want to choose like 720p here you can

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.460 
want to choose like 720p here you can
choose<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:29.850> depends<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.420> resolution<00:04:31.990> that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
choose it depends on the resolution that

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.890 
choose it depends on the resolution that
you<00:04:32.770> want<00:04:33.010> to<00:04:33.220> record<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:35.620> usually<00:04:36.900> record

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
you want to record and I usually record

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.160 
you want to record and I usually record
in<00:04:38.260> 720p<00:04:38.710> because<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.880> don't<00:04:40.420> have<00:04:40.600> like<00:04:40.690> good

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
in 720p because I don't have like good

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.030 
in 720p because I don't have like good
connection<00:04:41.710> to<00:04:41.860> upload<00:04:42.450> videos<00:04:43.450> so<00:04:44.040> this

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
connection to upload videos so this

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.210 
connection to upload videos so this
depends<00:04:45.490> on<00:04:45.760> your<00:04:46.090> connection<00:04:46.980> because<00:04:47.980> the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
depends on your connection because the

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.350 
depends on your connection because the
more<00:04:49.770> resolution<00:04:50.770> you<00:04:51.070> record<00:04:51.520> with<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:52.090> more

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
more resolution you record with the more

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.570 
more resolution you record with the more
space<00:04:52.780> you<00:04:52.810> need<00:04:53.700> so<00:04:54.700> here<00:04:55.150> I<00:04:55.330> advise<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.840> to

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
space you need so here I advise you to

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.170 
space you need so here I advise you to
put<00:04:57.750> 120<00:04:58.750> fps<00:04:59.230> because<00:04:59.650> you<00:05:00.580> all<00:05:00.760> want<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.030> have

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
put 120 fps because you all want to have

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.110 
put 120 fps because you all want to have
like<00:05:01.420> any<00:05:01.720> drop<00:05:02.050> FPS<00:05:02.590> if<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:03.040> choose<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.700> one

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
like any drop FPS if you choose this one

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.780 
like any drop FPS if you choose this one
the<00:05:04.210> futures<00:05:04.600> like<00:05:04.780> less<00:05:05.080> you<00:05:05.530> will<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:06.370> FPS

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
the futures like less you will the FPS

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:10.530 
the futures like less you will the FPS
will<00:05:07.000> drop<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.590> here<00:05:08.980> is<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.550> most<00:05:09.820> important

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
will drop so here is the most important

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.270 
will drop so here is the most important
thing<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.430> if<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.390> have<00:05:13.600> an<00:05:13.840> Nvidia<00:05:14.680> graphic

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
thing so if you have an Nvidia graphic

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.470 
thing so if you have an Nvidia graphic
card<00:05:15.610> edge<00:05:15.730> GTX<00:05:16.690> so<00:05:17.620> you<00:05:18.400> need<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.700> choose<00:05:18.970> this

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
card edge GTX so you need to choose this

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.500 
card edge GTX so you need to choose this
option<00:05:19.980> because<00:05:20.980> it's<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.430> more<00:05:21.700> accurate

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
option because it's the more accurate

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.840 
option because it's the more accurate
and<00:05:22.900> you<00:05:23.620> can<00:05:23.860> record<00:05:24.190> without<00:05:25.500> losing<00:05:26.500> any

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
and you can record without losing any

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.630 
and you can record without losing any
fps<00:05:27.850> and<00:05:28.560> it's<00:05:29.560> special<00:05:29.980> just<00:05:30.190> for<00:05:30.280> GTX<00:05:31.170> a

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
fps and it's special just for GTX a

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.400 
fps and it's special just for GTX a
