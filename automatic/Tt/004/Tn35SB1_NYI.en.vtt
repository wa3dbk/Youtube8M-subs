be oh he's the Doppler effect yes it's
the<00:01:04.199> apparent<00:01:04.559> change<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> frequency<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the apparent change in the frequency of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.039 
the apparent change in the frequency of
a<00:01:05.670> wave<00:01:05.700> caused<00:01:06.060> by<00:01:06.210> relative<00:01:06.630> motion<00:01:06.930> between

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
a wave caused by relative motion between

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.370 
a wave caused by relative motion between
the<00:01:07.200> source<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> wave<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.040> observer

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.039 

now<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.439> Doppler<00:01:14.070> effect<00:01:14.600> all<00:01:15.600> right<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.780> got<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
now the Doppler effect all right I got a

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.350 
now the Doppler effect all right I got a
shower<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.590> guys<00:01:17.090> make<00:01:18.090> yourselves

the<00:01:45.610> brain<00:01:45.850> date<00:01:46.060> miss<00:01:46.240> Chu<00:01:46.479> Chu<00:01:46.689> train<00:01:49.469> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the brain date miss Chu Chu train I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.100 
the brain date miss Chu Chu train I
still<00:01:52.479> don't<00:01:52.630> get<00:01:52.750> it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110

still don't get it
I'm<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.890> Doppler<00:01:54.310> effect<00:01:54.719> okay<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.929> is<00:01:56.020> some

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
I'm the Doppler effect okay that is some

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.990 
I'm the Doppler effect okay that is some
sort<00:01:56.439> of<00:01:56.530> learning<00:01:56.860> disability<00:01:57.610> I<00:01:57.640> think<00:01:57.729> it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
sort of learning disability I think it's

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.490 
sort of learning disability I think it's
very<00:01:58.270> insensitive<00:02:00.659> why<00:02:01.659> don't<00:02:01.899> you<00:02:02.020> just<00:02:02.259> tell

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
very insensitive why don't you just tell

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.550 
very insensitive why don't you just tell
people<00:02:02.860> you're<00:02:03.039> a<00:02:03.069> zebra<00:02:04.140> why<00:02:05.140> don't<00:02:05.319> you<00:02:05.409> just

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
people you're a zebra why don't you just

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.990 
people you're a zebra why don't you just
tell<00:02:05.740> people<00:02:05.770> you're<00:02:06.280> in<00:02:06.369> one<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.700> Seven
