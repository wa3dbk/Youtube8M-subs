here or another thing that you can do

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.369 
here or another thing that you can do
which<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.250> interesting<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.390> use<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
which is interesting is actually use the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.740 
which is interesting is actually use the
color<00:00:55.590> sensor<00:00:55.920> that's<00:00:56.699> built<00:00:57.059> onto<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.570> front

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
color sensor that's built onto the front

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.529 
color sensor that's built onto the front
of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> device<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:59.070> got<00:00:59.820> my<00:00:59.969> Hilton<00:01:00.329> key

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
of the device so I'm got my Hilton key

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.610 
of the device so I'm got my Hilton key
card<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:00.840> I'm<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> hold<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.289> over

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
card here I'm going to hold that over

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.049 
card here I'm going to hold that over
the<00:01:01.859> color<00:01:02.039> sensor<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> on<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.850> left

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the color sensor which is on the left

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.789 
the color sensor which is on the left
and<00:01:03.350> i'm<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.650> capture<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.799> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
and i'm going to do capture and it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.450 
and i'm going to do capture and it
picked<00:01:08.159> well<00:01:09.710> maybe<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.040> close<00:01:11.250> but

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
picked well maybe not so close but

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.330 
picked well maybe not so close but
anyway<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:12.479> can<00:01:12.689> select<00:01:13.260> color<00:01:13.680> based<00:01:14.130> on

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
anyway you can select color based on

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.770 
anyway you can select color based on
this<00:01:14.549> sensor<00:01:14.820> which<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> also<00:01:15.180> proximity

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this sensor which is also proximity

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
this sensor which is also proximity
sensor<00:01:16.049> built<00:01:16.500> down<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> lower<00:01:17.400> left

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
sensor built down into the lower left

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.289 
sensor built down into the lower left
and<00:01:18.500> it's<00:01:19.500> got<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.920> variety<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.700> sensors<00:01:21.119> built

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and it's got a variety of sensors built

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
and it's got a variety of sensors built
in<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:21.900> toggle<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> display<00:01:22.619> using

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
in here if we toggle the display using

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
in here if we toggle the display using
the<00:01:23.310> touch<00:01:23.520> panel<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> right<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.509> I've

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
the touch panel on the right here I've

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
the touch panel on the right here I've
got<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> set<00:01:25.619> into<00:01:25.799> accelerometer<00:01:26.430> mode<00:01:26.580> now

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
got to set into accelerometer mode now

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
got to set into accelerometer mode now
so<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.180> move<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.509> around<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.320> see

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so if I move this around you can see

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.160 
so if I move this around you can see
it's<00:01:28.680> detecting<00:01:29.450> acceleration<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.990> also

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it's detecting acceleration it's also

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.469 
it's detecting acceleration it's also

funky looking LED animation now there's
a<00:01:48.000> couple<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> things<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.840> do

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
a couple of the things that you can do

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.450 
a couple of the things that you can do
in<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.259> well<00:01:49.590> through<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.860> phone<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.399> we

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
in here is well through the phone but we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.429 
in here is well through the phone but we
want<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.670> take<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> look<00:01:51.119> at<00:01:51.299> what's<00:01:51.990> inside<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
want to take a look at what's inside and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.749 
want to take a look at what's inside and
thankfully<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.399> very<00:01:53.460> easily

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
thankfully you can do that very easily

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.340 
thankfully you can do that very easily
because<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.360> thing<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.110> held

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
because this thing is actually just held

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.429 
because this thing is actually just held
together<00:01:55.470> by<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.610> series<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.060> magnets<00:01:57.439> now

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
together by a series of magnets now

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.660 
together by a series of magnets now
nobody<00:01:58.560> knows<00:01:58.799> exactly<00:01:58.920> how<00:01:59.219> magnets<00:01:59.549> work

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
nobody knows exactly how magnets work

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.700 
nobody knows exactly how magnets work
but<00:02:00.090> ultimately<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.689> work<00:02:01.020> they<00:02:01.530> hold

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
but ultimately they do work they hold

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.870 
but ultimately they do work they hold
this<00:02:01.770> device<00:02:02.040> together<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.490> you<00:02:02.549> can<00:02:02.670> pry

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
this device together and you can pry

this open and see all the goodies inside
the<00:02:05.430> idea<00:02:05.640> basically<00:02:05.790> again<00:02:06.360> is<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.780> is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the idea basically again is that this is

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.990 
the idea basically again is that this is
for<00:02:07.409> accessory<00:02:08.039> developers<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.640> take<00:02:08.819> this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
for accessory developers to take this

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.150 
for accessory developers to take this
and<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.330> kind<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.629> does<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:10.200> little<00:02:10.890> bit<00:02:11.039> of

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
and it kind of does a little bit of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.460 
and it kind of does a little bit of
everything<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:12.090> designed<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.780> hacking

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
everything it's designed for hacking

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.950 
everything it's designed for hacking
and<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:13.860> this<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.040> can<00:02:14.450> get<00:02:15.450> started<00:02:15.870> on

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
and with this you can get started on

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.990 
and with this you can get started on
making<00:02:16.140> your<00:02:16.440> own<00:02:16.470> accessories<00:02:16.920> now<00:02:17.790> as<00:02:17.910> we

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
basically the let accessory developers

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.530 
basically the let accessory developers
play<00:02:44.460> around<00:02:44.700> with<00:02:44.910> all<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.270> different

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
play around with all the different

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.970 
play around with all the different
things<00:02:45.570> that<00:02:45.810> Android<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.410> do<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.709> come<00:02:46.830> up

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
things that Android can do and come up

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.270 
things that Android can do and come up
with<00:02:47.130> some<00:02:47.310> great<00:02:47.430> ideas<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:49.230> course<00:02:49.650> it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
with some great ideas and of course it

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.920 
with some great ideas and of course it
comes<00:02:50.490> in<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.670> very<00:02:50.820> cool<00:02:51.000> package<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.720> again

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
comes in a very cool package so again
