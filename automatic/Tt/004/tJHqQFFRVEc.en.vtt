00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
with drainage issues especially in your

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
with drainage issues especially in your
dugout<00:00:36.510> where<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.170> lot<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.440> loose<00:00:37.649> material<00:00:38.160> can

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
dugout where a lot of loose material can

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.250 
dugout where a lot of loose material can
stop<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:39.000> drains<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.480> know<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.809> things

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
stop up your drains you know just things

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.209 
stop up your drains you know just things
that<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.590> people<00:00:40.680> might<00:00:41.040> not<00:00:41.160> think

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that a lot of people might not think

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.010 
that a lot of people might not think
about<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:41.820> our<00:00:41.910> kids<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.239> excited<00:00:42.510> about<00:00:42.690> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
about but our kids are excited about it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.619 
about but our kids are excited about it
I<00:00:43.680> think<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.340> allows<00:00:44.640> us<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.420> bit

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
I think it allows us to be a little bit

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
I think it allows us to be a little bit
more<00:00:45.780> athletic<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.559> running<00:00:46.829> lanes<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
more athletic in the running lanes and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.700 
more athletic in the running lanes and
you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.570> i<00:00:48.629> think<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> bunny<00:00:49.230> game<00:00:49.320> all

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
you know i think the bunny game all

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.650 
you know i think the bunny game all
kinds<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.370> small<00:00:50.489> things<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:51.329> coming

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
kinds of some small things really coming

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.119 
kinds of some small things really coming
to<00:00:51.719> play<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.110> again<00:00:52.590> i<00:00:52.620> don't<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:53.010> we've

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
to play but again i don't think we've

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.040 
to play but again i don't think we've
changed<00:00:53.489> our<00:00:53.969> ballpark<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.510> whole<00:00:54.629> lot<00:00:54.750> i<00:00:54.780> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
changed our ballpark a whole lot i think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
changed our ballpark a whole lot i think
what<00:00:55.140> we've<00:00:55.260> done<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.559> enhance<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.360> modernize

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
what we've done is enhance it modernize

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.470 
what we've done is enhance it modernize
it<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:57.809> bit<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.260> certainly<00:00:59.480> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it just a little bit and certainly you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
it just a little bit and certainly you
know<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.780> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.140> some<00:01:01.170> little

so we got speed in the drainage and in

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.650
