00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.419
 what band transacts like being here that 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.329
 is bringing them a trick for the game 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:09.520
 turner of arms and infinite ammunition but 

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:12.250
 first of all I recommend you go this 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.780
 this game map and create a mini 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.610
 basis to be disconnected and 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.859
 connecting to things like this already 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.829
 when you want and can save 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.869
 good things since you see if you already have this 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:24.999
 we just started it seems trick should of 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.249
 come to the military base of our field 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.579
 yes and I do not know where exactly it is here 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:33.370
 there is on the map ok to do this I have 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:38.670
 with 170 strong ulna and with a 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.670
 gun against shots 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.490
 but this mind to the food well come 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.450
 everyone 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.830
 I'm going to meet 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.200
 to see if you do not come by so fast 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.270
 You can come 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.400
 without counting here 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.950
 of an ideology applying 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.800
 they come together they come together and to all 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.540
 those who were saved us a problem 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.170
 they come together 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.620
 as it goes out x in the head and what 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.620
 we kill everyone 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.660
 and then because there are always things here and 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.520
 also to see a zombies that 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.850
 they drag and that waters 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.039
 soldiers ok since they did this all 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.820
 they must win everything that is military 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:40.710
 now they will know how about 15 zombies 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.710
 I will do everything super fast 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.090
 Y 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.100
 i 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.110
 and 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.999
 such 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 and me 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.970
 Y 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.780
 although since they do that all this where 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.319
 is to apply here I'm going to open this 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.360
 of jumping up here and here they can 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.980
 disconnect without cause omitted go to 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.110
 kill when I'm going to park I know 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.970
 ok to talk on this map they keep 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.290
 everything that has gathered all that 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.660
 tell them if you have a week if 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.300
 they were injured because they covered 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.910
 let's see save everything 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.580
 that's 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.580
 although we can already see doing this what 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.250
 know want on such a sword a 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.240
 gun and food and water that when 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.510
 we have the value part of the map 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.950
 until they get here they must post 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.560
 we can stay a car and one is achieved 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.880
 what they pay for almost to that they are new 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.520
 since they have here at the door 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.930
 weapons certification we follow chiles 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.350
 because we are going to use all things 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.350
 military weapons 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.210
 civilian mediating the military and widgets 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.800
 civilian I'm going to tell you everything here and good 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.800
