pretty<00:02:43.810> light<00:02:44.050> on<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.320> first<00:02:44.650> step<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.840> I

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
pretty light on this first step but I

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.580 
pretty light on this first step but I
increase<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> weight<00:02:47.800> each<00:02:48.280> set<00:02:49.290> until<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.319> can

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
increase the weight each set until I can

00:02:50.590 --> 00:04:07.020 
increase the weight each set until I can
only<00:02:50.739> manage<00:02:51.130> probably<00:02:51.489> around<00:02:52.230> 8<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.560> 10<00:02:53.800> reps

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
so on term machine pulls I lean quite

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.490 
so on term machine pulls I lean quite
forward<00:04:13.060> right<00:04:14.060> onto<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.450> pad<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:15.230> just

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500
