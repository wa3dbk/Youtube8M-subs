the leader I think but if I did get the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.100 
the leader I think but if I did get the
leader<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:38.850> haven't<00:02:39.420> picked<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.750> though<00:02:39.930> I

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
somewhere a good price but if I do pick

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.670
