 Matt black and delicate curves make a pleasant feel to the touch, 

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.926
 and they are also pleasing to the eye. 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.920
 The back of the tablet is equipped with a webcam and a flash 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.453
 - both elements are located in a standard place. 

00:00:46.773 --> 00:00:50.680
 On the left side you can see a small hole covering the microphone. 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.953
 On the bottom edge, looking from the left, we find three elements 

00:00:54.953 --> 00:01:00.686
 reset button, ThinkPad Tablet Dock connector and HDMI mini connector. 

00:01:00.886 --> 00:01:06.173
 ThinkPad Tablet Dock is of course used to connect optional accessories 

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:08.173
 such as a docking station. 

00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:13.880
 On the right side of the device there is a secure USB port

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:41.833
 secured slots for SIM and microSD card, and finally a switch. 

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:45.280
 The most important part of the tablet - its front 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.646
 - of course, it's a multi-touch IPS screen with a diagonal of 10.1 inches 

00:01:50.646 --> 00:01:55.886
 and 1366x768 pixels resolution. 

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:58.173
 The screen is protected by Dragontrail Glass, 

00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:01.146
 which is the equivalent of the more popular Gorilla glass. 

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:05.366
 Directly below the screen is a Windows button, 

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:09.733
 above it - the eye of the webcam, and on the right - a light sensor.
