00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
year old now and I've been thinking

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.250 
year old now and I've been thinking
about<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.920> aftermarket<00:00:47.760> screens<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.750> ages

about these aftermarket screens for ages

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.549 
about these aftermarket screens for ages
didn't<00:00:49.739> know<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> TV<00:00:51.030> tall<00:00:51.480> screen<00:00:51.870> or

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
didn't know to get a TV tall screen or

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
didn't know to get a TV tall screen or
get<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.039> MRA<00:00:54.379> variable<00:00:55.410> adjustable<00:00:56.250> ones<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
get this MRA variable adjustable ones so

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.470 
get this MRA variable adjustable ones so
in<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> end<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:58.020> went<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.550> slightly

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
in the end I went for these slightly

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
in the end I went for these slightly
more<00:01:00.660> expensive<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.469> was<00:01:01.590> hoping<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> better

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
more expensive I was hoping for a better

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.319 
more expensive I was hoping for a better
performance

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
performance

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.760 
performance
and<00:01:03.739> it<00:01:04.739> does<00:01:04.949> look<00:01:04.979> rather<00:01:05.700> nice<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> bike

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
and it does look rather nice on the bike

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.750 
and it does look rather nice on the bike
so<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.979> walk<00:01:08.100> around<00:01:08.310> aids<00:01:09.150> them<00:01:09.950> a<00:01:10.950> dark

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so if I walk around aids them a dark

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.249 
so if I walk around aids them a dark
tint<00:01:12.170> which<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.710> think<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.760> order<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.509> clear

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
tint which I think you can order a clear

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.710 
tint which I think you can order a clear
one<00:01:16.680> or<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.250> even<00:01:17.610> order<00:01:17.909> darker<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.600> I'm

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
one or you can even order darker one I'm

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
one or you can even order darker one I'm
not<00:01:18.869> quite<00:01:19.110> sure<00:01:19.189> but<00:01:20.189> okay<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.759> that's<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
not quite sure but okay so that's the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.550 
not quite sure but okay so that's the
screen<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> put<00:01:22.380> on

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
screen that I put on

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
screen that I put on
I'll<00:01:22.890> talk<00:01:23.070> about<00:01:23.100> how<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> fit<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.180> how

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.800 
now I've just put two standard nut onto
the<00:02:50.330> bottom<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.959> hoping<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:51.920> will<00:02:52.160> be

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the bottom and hoping that will be

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.539 
the bottom and hoping that will be
enough<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.840> hold<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.410> position<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:55.340> get<00:02:55.519> a

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
enough to hold it in position you get a

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.199 
enough to hold it in position you get a
couple<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.940> spacers<00:02:56.450> there<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:58.030> I'm<00:02:59.030> not

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
couple of the spacers there and I'm not

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.850 
couple of the spacers there and I'm not
saying<00:02:59.450> is<00:02:59.569> flimsy<00:02:59.900> anything<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:00.680> is

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
saying is flimsy anything but is

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.729 
saying is flimsy anything but is
certainly<00:03:01.400> more<00:03:01.730> movement<00:03:02.330> in<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.170> screen<00:03:03.470> in

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
certainly more movement in the screen in

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.920 
certainly more movement in the screen in
spirit<00:03:04.160> are<00:03:04.310> speed<00:03:04.670> compared<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:05.569> the<00:03:05.750> Honda

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
spirit are speed compared to the Honda

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.180 
spirit are speed compared to the Honda
one

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.369 

so<00:03:10.190> this<00:03:10.340> position<00:03:10.849> now<00:03:11.030> is<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.569> highest<00:03:12.049> of

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
so this position now is the highest of

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.180 
so this position now is the highest of
the<00:03:13.280> seven<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.200> adjustable<00:03:15.200> positions<00:03:15.950> of

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
the seven and adjustable positions of

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.170 
the seven and adjustable positions of
the<00:03:16.879> spoiler<00:03:17.599> and<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.470> do<00:03:18.530> feel<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.190> air<00:03:19.760> coming

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
the spoiler and I do feel the air coming

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.600 
the spoiler and I do feel the air coming
straight<00:03:20.690> out<00:03:21.019> of<00:03:21.080> my<00:03:21.230> face

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
straight out of my face

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.380 
straight out of my face
so<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.660> have<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.590> close<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:25.010> visor<00:03:25.220> even<00:03:26.090> thirty

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
so I have to close the visor even thirty

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.100 
so I have to close the visor even thirty
miles<00:03:26.660> an<00:03:26.780> hour

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
miles an hour

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.930 
miles an hour
if<00:03:27.769> I<00:03:27.950> didn't<00:03:28.190> run<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.370> air<00:03:28.610> on<00:03:28.879> my<00:03:29.150> face<00:03:29.390> a

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
if I didn't run the air on my face a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.410 
if I didn't run the air on my face a
higher<00:03:31.940> speed<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:33.970> directing<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.090> wind<00:03:35.299> the

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
higher speed is directing the wind the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.930 
higher speed is directing the wind the
slightly<00:03:35.750> above<00:03:36.200> my<00:03:36.230> shoulders<00:03:36.920> I<00:03:37.040> did<00:03:37.610> feel

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
slightly above my shoulders I did feel

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.479 
slightly above my shoulders I did feel
the<00:03:38.120> wind<00:03:38.329> on<00:03:38.540> my<00:03:38.690> neck<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.140> chin<00:03:39.920> area<00:03:40.129> and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
the wind on my neck and chin area and

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.850 
the wind on my neck and chin area and
now<00:03:40.700> it's<00:03:40.910> on<00:03:41.150> my<00:03:41.209> face<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:42.110> it's<00:03:42.260> lifted<00:03:42.739> that

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
now it's on my face so it's lifted that

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.849 
now it's on my face so it's lifted that
by<00:03:43.640> about<00:03:43.970> a<00:03:44.030> couple<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.390> inches<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:45.530> adjust

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
by about a couple of inches to adjust

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.559 
by about a couple of inches to adjust
this<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.220> do<00:03:46.370> need<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.640> use<00:03:46.760> two<00:03:47.000> hands<00:03:47.239> so

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
this you do need to use two hands so

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.750 
this you do need to use two hands so
it's<00:03:48.140> not<00:03:48.379> something<00:03:48.829> you<00:03:48.920> can<00:03:49.069> do<00:03:49.220> on<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.549> fly

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
it's not something you can do on the fly

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.780 
it's not something you can do on the fly
on<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.209> go<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.500> it's<00:03:51.709> got<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:51.980> kind<00:03:52.640> of

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
on the go and it's got the kind of

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.479 
on the go and it's got the kind of
plastic<00:03:53.269> ratchet<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:54.440> that's<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:55.040> down<00:03:55.160> by

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
plastic ratchet so that's going down by

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.500 
plastic ratchet so that's going down by
one

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.860 

to

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.089 

we<00:04:02.530> okay<00:04:03.459> as<00:04:03.730> three<00:04:04.000> clicks<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.530> it's<00:04:05.860> the

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
we okay as three clicks so is it's the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.589 
we okay as three clicks so is it's the
spoilers<00:04:06.550> come<00:04:06.760> down<00:04:07.000> a<00:04:07.030> bit<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.360> what<00:04:07.510> I'm

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.650 
with the cover screws cover washers and
same<00:05:11.650> over<00:05:11.770> here<00:05:12.190> there's<00:05:12.760> a<00:05:12.880> lot<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.090> foam<00:05:13.330> one

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.629 
same over here there's a lot of foam one
that<00:05:13.870> would<00:05:14.050> probably<00:05:14.080> take<00:05:14.740> some<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.580> the

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
that would probably take some of the

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.589 
that would probably take some of the
vibration<00:05:16.150> away<00:05:16.389> and<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.979> feels<00:05:18.370> sturdy<00:05:18.669> and

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
vibration away and the feels sturdy and

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.900 
vibration away and the feels sturdy and
it<00:05:19.900> covers<00:05:20.229> quite<00:05:20.500> large<00:05:20.710> area<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.669> hand

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910
