00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
up to a board a power supply and

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.600 
up to a board a power supply and
everything<00:00:12.929> outside<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.349> cabinet<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.860> it's

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
quiet as can be then I thought it was a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.439 
quiet as can be then I thought it was a
speaker<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.220> i<00:00:17.250> took<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.460> speakers<00:00:17.880> apart<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
speaker so i took the speakers apart and

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.179 
speaker so i took the speakers apart and
realized<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> wasn't<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.560> speaker<00:00:19.890> so

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
realized that it wasn't the speaker so

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250 
realized that it wasn't the speaker so

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
but inside your cabinet is your power

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.319 
but inside your cabinet is your power
supply<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> just<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:35.850> standard<00:00:36.030> one

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
so anyways this is a power supply and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.280 
so anyways this is a power supply and
there<00:02:48.870> was<00:02:48.960> another<00:02:48.990> question<00:02:49.620> about<00:02:51.290> this

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
there was another question about this

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.160 
there was another question about this
black<00:02:53.060> bezel<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.090> goes<00:02:54.360> around<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.840> screen

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
black bezel that goes around the screen

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.460 
black bezel that goes around the screen
I<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.000> all<00:02:57.150> know<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.540> black<00:02:57.960> bezel<00:02:58.380> it

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
I think you all know this black bezel it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.730 
I think you all know this black bezel it
goes<00:02:58.620> around<00:02:58.800> here<00:03:00.290> goes<00:03:01.290> all<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.500> way<00:03:01.650> around

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
goes around here goes all the way around

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.550 
goes around here goes all the way around
it's<00:03:02.100> exactly<00:03:02.700> 25<00:03:03.300> inches<00:03:03.630> across<00:03:03.900> now<00:03:04.380> I'd

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
it's exactly 25 inches across now I'd

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.430 
it's exactly 25 inches across now I'd
have<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.800> take<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> glass<00:03:05.310> out<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.820> measure<00:03:06.030> it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
have to take the glass out to measure it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.680 
have to take the glass out to measure it
but<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.650> think<00:03:07.830> pretty<00:03:07.950> sure<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:08.280> 27<00:03:08.970> from<00:03:09.330> top

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
but I think pretty sure it's 27 from top

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.260 
but I think pretty sure it's 27 from top
to<00:03:09.720> bottom<00:03:09.870> but<00:03:10.200> i<00:03:10.970> don't<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.030> know<00:03:12.180> I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
to bottom but i don't really know I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
to bottom but i don't really know I
don't<00:03:12.330> really<00:03:12.480> feel<00:03:12.660> like<00:03:12.750> taking<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.080> glass

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
don't really feel like taking the glass

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.290 
don't really feel like taking the glass
out<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.370> kind<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.610> panty<00:03:14.940> asked<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.210> do

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
out and it's kind of panty asked to do

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.420 
out and it's kind of panty asked to do
that<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.750> then<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.290> cards<00:03:16.709> sometimes<00:03:17.250> they

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
that and then the cards sometimes they

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.770 
that and then the cards sometimes they
get<00:03:17.580> kind<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.000> screwed<00:03:18.270> up<00:03:18.390> when<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.570> put<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
get kind of screwed up when I put the

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.360 
get kind of screwed up when I put the
glass<00:03:18.989> on<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.290> don't<00:03:19.470> get<00:03:19.680> fingerprints<00:03:20.160> all<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
glass on I don't get fingerprints all of

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.550 
glass on I don't get fingerprints all of
a<00:03:20.430> glass<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.360> a<00:03:21.510> dire<00:03:21.930> need<00:03:22.290> to

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
a glass so if it's it's a dire need to

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.640 
a glass so if it's it's a dire need to
put<00:03:23.280> whereas<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.790> I<00:03:23.820> mean<00:03:24.060> I'll<00:03:24.180> do<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.650> but

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
put whereas that I mean I'll do it but

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.110 
put whereas that I mean I'll do it but
i'm<00:03:25.800> pretty<00:03:26.010> sure<00:03:26.280> it's<00:03:26.459> 25<00:03:26.940> across<00:03:27.360> by<00:03:27.959> 27<00:03:28.709> hi

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
i'm pretty sure it's 25 across by 27 hi

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.430 
i'm pretty sure it's 25 across by 27 hi
and<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.270> gap<00:03:30.570> right<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:30.840> i<00:03:31.050> could<00:03:31.140> measure

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
and this gap right here i could measure

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.280 
and this gap right here i could measure
for<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:31.860> if<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.040> need<00:03:32.070> here<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.989> here<00:03:33.989> and
