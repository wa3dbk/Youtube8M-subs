we're<00:00:05.550> going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.760> talk<00:00:05.880> about<00:00:06.090> veneer<00:00:06.840> softer

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
we're going to talk about veneer softer

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.289 
we're going to talk about veneer softer
how<00:00:07.830> it's<00:00:08.010> used<00:00:08.219> and<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.639> its<00:00:08.760> benefits<00:00:09.180> are

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:09.299 
how it's used and what its benefits are

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.570 
how it's used and what its benefits are
today<00:00:09.650> but<00:00:10.650> airsofters<00:00:11.219> designed

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
today but airsofters designed

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.730 
today but airsofters designed
particularly<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.480> take<00:00:12.719> difficult<00:00:13.110> veneers

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
particularly to take difficult veneers

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.580 
particularly to take difficult veneers
that<00:00:13.830> are<00:00:14.070> warped<00:00:14.340> buckled<00:00:15.170> extremely<00:00:16.170> flat

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
that are warped buckled extremely flat

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.920 
that are warped buckled extremely flat
with<00:00:16.860> extremely<00:00:17.220> fragile<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.090> hard<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.900> work

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
with extremely fragile and hard to work

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.190 
with extremely fragile and hard to work
with<00:00:19.259> and<00:00:19.529> make<00:00:20.160> them<00:00:20.369> pliable<00:00:21.119> bendable<00:00:22.079> and

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
with and make them pliable bendable and

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.069 
with and make them pliable bendable and
much<00:00:22.829> easier<00:00:22.860> to<00:00:23.340> work<00:00:23.610> with<00:00:23.750> first<00:00:24.750> thing<00:00:24.960> we

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
much easier to work with first thing we

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.720 
much easier to work with first thing we
want<00:00:25.259> to<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.710> want<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.980> saturate<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
want to do is we want to saturate the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.560 
want to do is we want to saturate the
veneer<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.180> both<00:00:27.840> sides<00:00:29.059> and<00:00:30.059> we<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.360> both

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
veneer on both sides and we do both

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.260 
veneer on both sides and we do both
sides<00:00:30.809> because<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:31.739> wood<00:00:31.950> tends<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.940> absorb

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
sides because the wood tends to absorb

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.410 
sides because the wood tends to absorb
too<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> softener<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:36.150> we<00:00:36.240> don't

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
too much of the softener and if we don't

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.380 
too much of the softener and if we don't
get<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.200> fibers<00:00:37.620> in<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> wood<00:00:38.040> wet<00:00:38.520> then

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
get all the fibers in the wood wet then

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.810 
get all the fibers in the wood wet then
we've<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.900> not<00:00:40.220> succeeded<00:00:41.220> in<00:00:41.370> doing<00:00:41.640> what

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
we've really not succeeded in doing what

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
we've really not succeeded in doing what
we<00:00:41.910> set<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.290> next<00:00:43.470> thing<00:00:43.560> we<00:00:43.740> want

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
we set out to do the next thing we want

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.550 
we set out to do the next thing we want
to<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.130> is<00:00:44.310> we'll<00:00:44.490> take<00:00:46.580> paper<00:00:47.580> towels<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:49.320> lay

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
to do is we'll take paper towels and lay

to do is we'll take paper towels and lay
the<00:00:49.740> paper<00:00:49.950> towels<00:00:50.310> down<00:00:51.680> on<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> flat<00:00:53.010> surface

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.210 

place<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.370> veneer<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.700> top<00:01:00.060> of<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:01.220> place

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
place the veneer on top of that place

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.250 
place the veneer on top of that place
some<00:01:02.430> paper<00:01:02.610> towels<00:01:02.970> to<00:01:03.240> absorb<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.810> excess

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
some paper towels to absorb the excess

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.750

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
material on top of the veneer and then

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.400 
material on top of the veneer and then
we're<00:01:08.850> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.000> put<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> platen<00:01:09.690> on<00:01:09.930> top<00:01:10.230> of

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
we're going to put a platen on top of

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.760 
we're going to put a platen on top of
that<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:11.190> press<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:12.080> now<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.200> platen<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.650> be

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that to press it now that platen can be

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.210 
that to press it now that platen can be
anything<00:01:14.070> that's<00:01:14.430> stiff<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.030> rigid<00:01:15.950> on<00:01:16.950> top

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
anything that's stiff and rigid on top

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.410 
anything that's stiff and rigid on top
of<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.520> we're<00:01:17.730> going<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.910> place<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.720> weight

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
of that we're going to place some weight

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.290 
of that we're going to place some weight
this<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> simple<00:01:22.170> concrete<00:01:22.860> block<00:01:23.400> weighs

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
this is a simple concrete block weighs

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.290 
this is a simple concrete block weighs
about<00:01:24.540> 35<00:01:25.200> 40<00:01:25.620> pounds<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.190> it's<00:01:26.820> absolutely

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
about 35 40 pounds and it's absolutely

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.450 
about 35 40 pounds and it's absolutely
perfect<00:01:27.480> for<00:01:27.840> doing<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.710> sheet<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.160> veneer

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
perfect for doing one sheet of veneer

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.430 
perfect for doing one sheet of veneer
and<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:30.060> recommend<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.840> only<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.200> one

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
and we recommend that you only do one

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.980 
and we recommend that you only do one
sheet<00:01:31.800> at<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.040> time<00:01:32.070> because<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.390> add<00:01:33.570> three

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
sheet at a time because if you add three

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.410 
sheet at a time because if you add three
or<00:01:34.110> four<00:01:34.350> sheets<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.310> difficult<00:01:35.910> for<00:01:36.090> any

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
or four sheets it's difficult for any

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.000 
or four sheets it's difficult for any
kind<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.900> weight<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.470> able<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.770> flatten

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
kind of weight to be able to flatten

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.500 
kind of weight to be able to flatten
them<00:01:38.310> all<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:41.160> can<00:01:41.310> also<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.940> step<00:01:42.240> in

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
them all you can also do this step in

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.630 
them all you can also do this step in

a<00:01:44.670> platen<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:45.330> call<00:01:45.570> inside<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.290> bag<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.830> top

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
a platen or call inside the bag on top

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.010 
a platen or call inside the bag on top
of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.400> veneer

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.170 

last<00:01:52.020> night<00:01:52.260> we<00:01:52.979> put<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.430> veneer<00:01:53.729> after<00:01:54.120> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
last night we put the veneer after it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
last night we put the veneer after it
been<00:01:54.300> softened<00:01:54.690> underneath<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.440> platen<00:01:55.830> and

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
been softened underneath the platen and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.280 
been softened underneath the platen and
then<00:01:56.520> put<00:01:56.729> our<00:01:56.909> concrete<00:01:57.540> block<00:01:57.780> weight<00:01:58.080> on

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
then put our concrete block weight on

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:08.790 
then put our concrete block weight on
top<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.950> let's<00:01:59.550> see<00:01:59.760> how<00:01:59.910> it<00:02:00.030> turned<00:02:00.300> out

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.460 

you<00:02:09.800> can<00:02:09.979> see<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.340> absorption<00:02:10.600> of<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:12.110> veneer

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
you can see the absorption of the veneer

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.410 
you can see the absorption of the veneer
and<00:02:12.740> it's<00:02:13.250> taken<00:02:13.520> off<00:02:13.670> some<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.030> color<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
and it's taken off some of the color the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.730 
and it's taken off some of the color the
tannins<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.830> wood<00:02:16.010> itself<00:02:16.430> oh<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:18.500> looks

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
tannins in the wood itself oh this looks

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.210 
tannins in the wood itself oh this looks
great<00:02:19.030> see<00:02:20.030> how<00:02:20.120> flexible<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.690> is<00:02:23.890> really<00:02:24.890> flat

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
great see how flexible it is really flat

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.970 
great see how flexible it is really flat
this<00:02:25.970> would<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.270> perfect<00:02:26.780> perfect<00:02:27.739> thing<00:02:27.950> to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
this would be a perfect perfect thing to
