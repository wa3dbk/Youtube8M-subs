lot<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.170> everything<00:01:22.530> i<00:01:22.740> got<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:24.380> um

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
lot and everything i got this one for um

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.429 
lot and everything i got this one for um
actually<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.670> hundred<00:01:27.090> dollars<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
actually a hundred dollars which is a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.620 
actually a hundred dollars which is a
lot<00:01:29.310> more<00:01:29.430> which<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.180> twice<00:01:30.420> as

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
lot more which is like twice as

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.920 
lot more which is like twice as
expensive<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:31.259> other<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.009> got<00:01:32.630> but<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> think

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
expensive as other one I got but I think

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.780 
expensive as other one I got but I think

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
this is definitely worth it because it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.469

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
um I thought it was very awesome because

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.660 
um I thought it was very awesome because
it<00:01:41.939> looks<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.600> sophisticated<00:01:43.439> than<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.430> lot

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
