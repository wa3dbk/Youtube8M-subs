house<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.489> guess<00:00:37.129> but<00:00:38.129> anyway<00:00:38.460> he's<00:00:38.719> basically

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
house I guess but anyway he's basically

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
house I guess but anyway he's basically
just<00:00:40.070> filled<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.370> house<00:00:41.550> with<00:00:41.730> whatever

just filled up this house with whatever

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
just filled up this house with whatever
looked<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.629> Minecraft<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.469> was

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
looked good in Minecraft and what was

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.889 
looked good in Minecraft and what was
that<00:00:44.280> possible<00:00:44.789> with<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> outside<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
that possible with what the outside of

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.180 
that possible with what the outside of
the<00:00:45.960> house<00:00:46.140> looked<00:00:46.410> like<00:00:46.649> from<00:00:46.829> what<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> could

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the house looked like from what I could

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.400 
the house looked like from what I could
see<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> show<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.989> thought<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> looked

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
see in the show so I thought it looked

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.920 
see in the show so I thought it looked
pretty<00:00:49.559> nice<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.190> Minecraft<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.969> once<00:00:51.149> most

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
pretty nice in Minecraft for once most

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.049 
pretty nice in Minecraft for once most
of<00:00:52.020> these<00:00:52.140> houses<00:00:52.350> look<00:00:52.829> pretty<00:00:53.610> weird<00:00:53.820> in

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
of these houses look pretty weird in

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.880 
of these houses look pretty weird in
Minecraft<00:00:54.449> because<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.960> lot<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> things<00:00:55.739> I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
Minecraft because a lot of the things I

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.799 
Minecraft because a lot of the things I
wanted<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.820> copy<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.239> show<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
wanted to do to copy the show just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.209 
wanted to do to copy the show just
doesn't<00:00:58.140> look<00:00:58.379> like<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.940> minecraft

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
doesn't look like right and minecraft

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.039 
doesn't look like right and minecraft
but<00:01:02.219> yeah<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.460> got<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> lot<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> lot

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
but yeah I got to do a lot I was a lot

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
but yeah I got to do a lot I was a lot
more<00:01:04.080> free<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.339> house<00:01:05.610> in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
more free with this house in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
more free with this house in
particularly<00:01:06.150> because<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.750> could<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.710> make

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
particularly because I could just make

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.789 
particularly because I could just make
it<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.180> looked<00:01:09.420> nice<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.590> game

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
it so it looked nice and the game

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.179 
it so it looked nice and the game
instead<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> show<00:01:12.680> so<00:01:13.680> there's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.920> jukebox

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
instead of the show so there's a jukebox

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.890 
instead of the show so there's a jukebox
just<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> only<00:01:15.030> checkbox<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.720> map

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
just like the only checkbox on the map

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
just like the only checkbox on the map
except<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.290> think<00:01:16.320> about<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.950> Eddie's<00:01:17.280> room

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
except I think about one in Eddie's room

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.380 
except I think about one in Eddie's room
to<00:01:17.759> make<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.310> CD<00:01:20.310> player<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:21.060> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
to make it like the CD player that I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
to make it like the CD player that I
don't<00:01:21.960> know<00:01:22.020> what<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.200> call<00:01:22.320> him<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.490> use

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
don't know what to call him but I use

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060
