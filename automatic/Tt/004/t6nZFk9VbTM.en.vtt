00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.600
 there is a phrase that says I am human and 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.180
 I'm wrong this is understandable and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.580
 understandable however when the 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.580
 person himself in desert is a doctor 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.330
 this becomes extremely scary and 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.610
 even disturbing 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.970
 I do not have to roll around a lot in the 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.570
 Doctors theme so easy our 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.789
 health is more our life depends on 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.130
 they 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.320
 get ready because I'm sure that 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.239
 after this video more than one is 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.910
 will become paranoid with this issue of the 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.860
 doctors, I invite you to take a seat 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.660
 its base the volume and have up to the hand 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.780
 the number of some life insurance 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.420
 because today I present the 10 errors 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.240
 most stupid and frightening doctors 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.880
 number 10 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.760
 the mistake with which we open this top 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.890
 literally it seems to be the biggest mistake 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.110
 common that doctors commit at the time 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.570
 of a surgery possibly sometime 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.100
 you either online or on TV you 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.230
 you found out about this scissors in the stomach 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.210
 well it's doctors that after doing some 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.000
 operation they leave on the scissors in the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.940
 stomach to the patient an error that 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.010
 could cost life to the subject itself what 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.170
 more frightening is that several people at 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.450
 year fall in this list of errors 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.960
 doctors so apart from being 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.250
 stupid is extremely disturbing number 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.880
 10 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.130
 number 9 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 of medical errors or celebrities 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.659
 are exempt from this position 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.899
 we will see specific cases of errors 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.360
 doctors to prove it give carmen 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.909
 a comedian who needed a bypass 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.280
 to save his life like this so he 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.679
 He submitted to the operation but had 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.329
 the bad luck that your doctors or 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.700
 they were very stupid or they were 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.140
 they were very confused because the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.259
 Doctors did in the artery 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.030
 Incorrect another operation is required 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.490
 emergency to open the blockade that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.140
 was killing the 45-year-old comedian 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.539
 of age lucky for the man he managed 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.230
 rid of this error which almost 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.580
 it would cost life number 9 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.320
 number 8 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.300
 I'm sure the vast majority 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.240
 agreed with me that one of the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.010
 most terrifying things about a surgery 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.080
 apart from death is that they leave you something 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.580
 inside by mistake besides the scissors 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.220
 there have been cases where they have been forgotten 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.190
 in patients other objects like 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.820
 cell phones and surgical objects 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.800
 however in the 2000 donald short had 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.320
 surgery to remove a tumor that 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.300
 had in the abdomen after long 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.460
 months of recovery discovered that the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.220
 doctors had left him a retraction of 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.750
 metal 30 centimeters long by 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 lucky for man this does not 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.820
 life cost but surely to 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.070
 hospital several thousand dollars without 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.650
 have the bad reputation that this news 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:07.040
 it would generate the hospital number 8 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.170
 number 7 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.290
 this position is very stupid and at the same time 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.840
 morbid dave cox died in hospital on 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.060
 day they were going to register him 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.670
 sitting in a fully vertical position 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.700
 when a nurse removed him he was 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.409
 thoracic and covered his chest with gauze what 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.420
 that maybe the nurse I do not know is that 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.519
 the patient had an air bubble in 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.280
 the blood which are extremely 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.769
 deadly if a person has a tube 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.920
 Thoracic should be placed in a certain way 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.139
 when I'm going to extract it, the air came in 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.840
 the life of the patient forming bubbles 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.769
 in his blood obstructing the flow to his 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.420
 organs 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.010
 folch must have been lying down and the 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.620
 nurse must have closed the 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.549
 wound properly but this was not 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.600
 A) Yes 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:58.180
 an error that would cost a life number 7 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.430
 number 6 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.430
 this position happens in the state of 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.260
 minnesota in usa some surgeons 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.269
 removed the wrong kidney from a 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.859
 cancer patient realized 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.739
 until they did tests on the kidney 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.989
 that they took out and discovered that I was 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.269
 healthy what was not something because of 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.430
 death is worth having an error but not 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.930
 when you're going to get something that could 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.930
 cost the life of another person 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.400
 number 5 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:32.009
 surely you have ever heard 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.110
 that joke that says someone goes to 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.960
 doctor for a cough and he returns operated or 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.879
 with another medical procedure this 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.189
 almost almost happened this in 1995 the 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:47.189
 surgeons amputated the wrong leg 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:49.710
 of wikileaks and when they realized 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:52.199
 of what happened the procedure was already 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.470
 very advanced and loss of the leg 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.169
 it was inevitable 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:01.430
 without medical words 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.720
 number 5 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.330
 number 4 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.490
 this position may sound funny or for 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.320
 the least curious 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.410
 benjamin button 'war veteran 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.320
 47 years old he underwent surgery to 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.020
 to have the left testicle removed 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.540
 this for the risk of cancer if they think 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.940
 that by mistake they cut off your penis 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.300
 wrong they just took away the 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.090
 testicle that was not the hospital lost 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:38.070
 a million dollar claim and the man then 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:41.270
 well this already knows number 4 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.340
 number 3 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.600
 remember what I told you in the post 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.690
 number 5 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.250
 a lady of 50 years of age with a 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.250
 hospital so they would do a 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.590
 angiography while she was being prepared for 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.800
 start the procedure she stayed 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.180
 alone with another patient which 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.850
 would receive major surgery in the 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.580
 brain if at this point you think that 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.800
 they got confused of patients are you in what 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.930
 true nurses by telling you that 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.640
 it was time for his procedure to be 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.460
 They took to the wrong bed 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.550
 do not think anymore they did the surgery to 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.870
 she in place of the other patient 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.730
 after cutting the skull of the 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.500
 patient of the doctors simply not 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.390
 They could believe what they had done 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.520
 fortunately well for the procedure to 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.380
 time and this was simply as a 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.720
 funny anecdote but pretty 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:34.920
 stupid number 3 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.710
 number 2 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.620
 this position is quite morbid and already 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.140
 You'll see why the German Minister earthquakes 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.330
 he underwent exploratory surgery in 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.240
 the year of 2006 in order to discover 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.010
 the cause of your abdominal pain to the 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.140
 half of the surgery had an awakening of 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.540
 the anesthesia in which I had consciousness 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:57.900
 and I could feel pain but I could not 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.820
 move or communicate as a result of 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.870
 this terrible experience the minister 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:06.770
 time later he committed suicide 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:09.960
 one of those things that make you say there 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.860
 number 2 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:15.349
 number 1 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.060
 this post shows as such an error 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:18.390
 basic ends with the life of a 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.510
 person 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.420
 jessica santillán from only 17 years of 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.280
 old and originally from mexico died two 

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.920
 weeks after I received a 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.050
 heart and lung transplant the reason 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.690
 was that the transplanted organs were 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.160
 the wrong ones the blood type of 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.140
 these was not compatible with that of 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.980
 jessica the pretext that the doctors 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.750
 they put was that we all make mistakes 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.480
 this comment for some was taken 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.880
 as cynicism but let's hope that those 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.830
 young people who decide to study this 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.950
 career or how well they are studying 

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.560
 at this moment learn from this video 

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:58.190
 to avoid that in the future follow 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:01.590
 having more medical errors like these 

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:03.780
 number 1 follow me on twitter and in 

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.570
 facebook and if the video you liked dale 

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.540
 like share it and subscribe remember 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.710
 that this is my bizarre world and as I would say 

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:13.140
 a friend of mine 

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:15.650
 the patient rejected the autopsy I'm re
