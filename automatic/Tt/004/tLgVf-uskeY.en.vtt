00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 hi to all the boys if not z willy 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.730
 that today I find digital here where 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.670
 shine how to level quickly afterwards 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.820
 I do 1.08 easily you will make a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.559
 RP casino for every game 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.369
 to make this glitch you will need two 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.980
 requirements a friend and the captur the dl yes 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.050
 which you can download from the 1.08 range 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.900
 for free from the store and weighs 3 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.439
 megabyte something let's start right away with 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.000
 video 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.820
 first you have to take and go 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.550
 su gta a bookmaker start online business 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.469
 hosts activities created by rockstar 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.020
 catches and then laughs said and baggage 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.600
 so once done this you have to 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.309
 imitate your friend with stops 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.379
 settings immediately because 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.079
 that doesn't matter and you ask for it to close 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 immediately put the room immediately 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.230
 closed because otherwise they will enter 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.360
 English, etc., etc. because this 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.730
 click you can only do with two 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.660
 people no more than two people and not from 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.100
 only 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 so once you have invited the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.440
 your friend start the session e 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.879
 follow the path where I go with the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 video through the truck 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.140
 of the Rome airport from what they are called 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.420
 these vehicles however the ricotti 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.939
 there they are in the middle of the map and col 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.640
 Sniper will show you where are the other 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.350
 two helicopter locations in addition to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.780
 the position of the helicopter which 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.159
 I'll take it as you see in the video one 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.750
 time you are above the helicopter 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.720
 you must drive into the enemy base 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.600
 take the briefcase then strisali 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.250
 in the helicopter and drive the lowest 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.210
 possible as well as the lowest 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.430
 possible 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.320
 you must also try not to slam 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.240
 nons contrary because otherwise the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.759
 briefcase will be lost you will have to go back 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.170
 to the enemy base and redo the step of 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.899
 drive a helicopter then once 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.500
 that you have the briefcase go to the 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.470
 your base 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.990
 you will notice a blue circle with 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.610
 within this circle a drawing 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.189
 of a cause and therefore you owe us 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.100
 stand over with the helicopter flying 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.670
 low bass and so you will gain one 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.439
 rp casino at the second or 25 rp al 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.850

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.219
 difference but I assure you that at the end 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.290
 game 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.910
 the difference the note des do not believe me 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.580

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.690

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.120
 collide with the helicopter 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.070

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.870
