00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
the wire wheel I'm a bench grinder and I

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.620 
the wire wheel I'm a bench grinder and I
got<00:00:13.500> anti-seize<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.040> everything<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:15.450> more

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
got anti-seize on everything one more

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.060 
got anti-seize on everything one more
thing<00:00:15.660> I'm<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> show<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.410> here<00:00:16.859> on

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
thing I'm going to show you here on

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.109 
thing I'm going to show you here on
these<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.699> these<00:00:17.820> rubber<00:00:18.119> bushings<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:20.119> hold

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
these on these rubber bushings that hold

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.259 
these on these rubber bushings that hold
your<00:00:21.890> torsion<00:00:22.890> bar<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.490> everything<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.060> place

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
your torsion bar and everything in place

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.320 
your torsion bar and everything in place
I<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.810> put<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> thin<00:00:25.470> coat<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:26.060> anti-seize<00:00:27.060> on

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I just put a thin coat of anti-seize on

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.470 
I just put a thin coat of anti-seize on
that<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:28.619> reason<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.369> it's<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
that the reason is they it's it's a

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.209 
that the reason is they it's it's a
constant<00:00:30.990> grinding<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.949> know<00:00:32.070> when

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
constant grinding in there you know when

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.490 
constant grinding in there you know when
you<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.329> constantly<00:00:33.899> turning<00:00:34.200> like

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you it's it's constantly turning like

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.830 
you it's it's constantly turning like
this<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.610> grinding<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.300> bushing<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
this so it's grinding on that bushing I

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.479 
this so it's grinding on that bushing I
just<00:00:37.050> lubricated<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.739> with<00:00:37.860> some<00:00:38.040> anti-seize

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
just lubricated it with some anti-seize

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.580 
just lubricated it with some anti-seize
I<00:00:38.730> wouldn't<00:00:39.210> recommend<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.719> use<00:00:39.960> grease<00:00:40.350> or

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
I wouldn't recommend the use grease or

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.530 
I wouldn't recommend the use grease or
any<00:00:40.710> kind<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.010> petroleum<00:00:41.670> type<00:00:41.940> thing<00:00:42.270> because

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
any kind of petroleum type thing because

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.970 
any kind of petroleum type thing because
it's<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.809> designed<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.469> come<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.770> contact

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it's not designed to come in contact

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.930 
it's not designed to come in contact
with<00:00:44.430> all<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:46.260> may<00:00:46.410> eat<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.730> think

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
with all it may eat it up I don't think

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.260 
with all it may eat it up I don't think
that<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.800> do<00:00:49.800> very<00:00:50.010> well<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.610> having

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that that would do very well with having

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.990 
that that would do very well with having
a<00:00:51.390> petroleum-based<00:00:52.489> lubricant<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:53.940> I

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
a petroleum-based lubricant on it so I

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.740 
a petroleum-based lubricant on it so I
use<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> antis<00:00:54.690> ease<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.230> it's<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:57.030> keeps<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
use the antis ease and it's it keeps it

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.959 
use the antis ease and it's it keeps it
from<00:00:57.899> grinding<00:00:58.350> against<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.370> bushing<00:00:59.789> but

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
from grinding against the bushing but

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.650 
from grinding against the bushing but
also<00:01:01.039> it's<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> keep<00:01:03.059> your<00:01:03.180> squeaking

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
also it's going to keep your squeaking

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.920 
also it's going to keep your squeaking
keeping<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.589> squeaking<00:01:04.890> from<00:01:05.129> happening<00:01:05.519> if

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
keeping it squeaking from happening if

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
keeping it squeaking from happening if
you<00:01:06.930> look<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.680> didn't<00:01:07.950> show<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.189> when<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.490> took

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
you look I didn't show you when I took

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.590 
you look I didn't show you when I took
mine<00:01:08.939> apart<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.979> there<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.280> there<00:01:12.240> was<00:01:12.390> just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
mine apart but there are there was just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.820 
mine apart but there are there was just
a<00:01:12.689> small<00:01:13.080> amount<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:15.080> small<00:01:16.080> amount<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.619> bits

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
a small amount of small amount of bits

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
a small amount of small amount of bits
of<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.880> material<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.780> there<00:01:18.990> do<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> know

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
of of this material in there do you know

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.140 
of of this material in there do you know
just<00:01:19.590> where<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.860> been<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.549> constantly

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
just where it been like I see constantly

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.719 
just where it been like I see constantly
constantly<00:01:21.960> working<00:01:22.530> against<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.369> they

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
constantly working against it so they

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.249 
constantly working against it so they
weren't<00:01:23.909> worn<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.420> or<00:01:24.720> anything<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

and I made one under it okay I've turned

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.420 
and I made one under it okay I've turned
this<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.930> two<00:01:45.930> teeth<00:01:46.259> going<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> rule<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
this down two teeth going by the rule of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.130 
this down two teeth going by the rule of
thumb<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:49.040> one<00:01:50.040> tooth<00:01:50.340> equals<00:01:50.759> an<00:01:50.880> inch<00:01:51.090> okay

thumb that one tooth equals an inch okay
and<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:53.189> took<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.750> degree<00:01:54.750> finder<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.600> just

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
and I took my degree finder and I just

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.990 
and I took my degree finder and I just
confirmed<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.530> yes<00:01:58.740> I'd<00:01:58.979> gone<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> nut<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
confirmed it yes I'd gone the nut the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.690 
confirmed it yes I'd gone the nut the
right<00:02:00.180> amount<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.810> degrees<00:02:01.770> everything's

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
right amount of degrees everything's

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.520 
right amount of degrees everything's
matching<00:02:02.909> up<00:02:03.329> okay<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:05.280> took<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.780> made<00:02:07.170> another

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
matching up okay I took and made another

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.400 
matching up okay I took and made another
mark<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.789> is<00:02:08.970> at<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.270> first<00:02:09.599> attempt<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.170> get

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
bushing there what I did I just took the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.140 
bushing there what I did I just took the
I<00:02:23.230> forgot<00:02:23.560> everything<00:02:23.680> lubricated<00:02:24.400> made<00:02:24.970> sure

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
I forgot everything lubricated made sure

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.430 
I forgot everything lubricated made sure
everything<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.570> right<00:02:25.720> where<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.960> needed<00:02:26.140> it<00:02:26.320> to

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
everything is right where I needed it to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.290 
everything is right where I needed it to
be<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.920> took<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:29.710> cover<00:02:29.920> plate<00:02:30.220> put<00:02:30.850> it<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:31.120> it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
be I took the cover plate put it on it

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.060 
be I took the cover plate put it on it
and<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.990> started<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.440> boat<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.830> you<00:02:32.920> don't

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
and just started the boat that you don't

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.140 
and just started the boat that you don't
want<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.220> crank<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.580> down<00:02:33.610> because<00:02:34.060> you're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
want to crank it down because you're

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.140 
want to crank it down because you're
going<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.330> pinch<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.459> got<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.970> to

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
going to pinch it but I got this to

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.910 
going to pinch it but I got this to
where<00:02:37.330> it's<00:02:37.480> got<00:02:37.600> everything<00:02:37.930> started<00:02:38.709> and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
where it's got everything started and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.790 
where it's got everything started and
getting<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:40.000> place<00:02:40.030> okay<00:02:40.840> now<00:02:41.560> I'm<00:02:41.680> going

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
getting it in place okay now I'm going

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.130 
getting it in place okay now I'm going
to<00:02:41.890> start<00:02:42.070> taking<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.430> pressure<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:43.209> this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
to start taking the pressure up on this

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.110 
to start taking the pressure up on this
getting<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:44.830> loaded<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.280> once<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:45.790> bolt

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
getting it loaded and once this bolt

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.690 
getting it loaded and once this bolt
hole<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.510> clear<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.080> can<00:02:47.680> put<00:02:47.860> my<00:02:47.980> last<00:02:48.160> bolt<00:02:48.489> in

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
hole is clear I can put my last bolt in

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.660 
hole is clear I can put my last bolt in
here<00:02:48.910> what<00:02:49.690> I've<00:02:49.840> been<00:02:49.989> doing<00:02:50.440> is<00:02:50.650> after<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.459> got

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
here what I've been doing is after I got

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.600 
here what I've been doing is after I got
it<00:02:51.880> pulled<00:02:52.600> up<00:02:53.160> using<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.430> jack<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
it pulled up using the jack and the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.420 
it pulled up using the jack and the
torsion<00:02:57.610> tool<00:02:57.850> here

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
torsion tool here

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.130 
torsion tool here
alternating<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.670> like<00:03:00.820> I<00:03:00.970> did<00:03:01.180> when<00:03:01.810> I<00:03:01.840> took

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
alternating just like I did when I took

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.650 
alternating just like I did when I took
it<00:03:02.290> off<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:02.890> now<00:03:03.160> I'm<00:03:04.060> just<00:03:04.300> putting<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
it off but now I'm just putting the

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.050 
it off but now I'm just putting the
pressure<00:03:04.840> on<00:03:05.050> it<00:03:05.440> loading<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.280> torsion<00:03:06.880> how

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
pressure on it loading the torsion how

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.140 
pressure on it loading the torsion how
loading<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.780> torsion<00:03:08.200> bar<00:03:08.410> if<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.770> will<00:03:09.150> just

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
loading the torsion bar if you will just

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.449 
loading the torsion bar if you will just
going<00:03:10.510> back<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.720> forth<00:03:10.930> with<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.290> got<00:03:12.130> it<00:03:12.340> up

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
going back and forth with that got it up

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.660 
going back and forth with that got it up
high<00:03:12.670> enough<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.180> where<00:03:13.350> I've<00:03:14.489> cleared<00:03:15.489> my

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
high enough to where I've cleared my

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.729 
high enough to where I've cleared my
stop<00:03:15.970> now<00:03:16.600> I<00:03:16.630> started<00:03:17.080> tightening<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.680> down

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
stop now I started tightening this down

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.550 
stop now I started tightening this down
this<00:03:18.190> cap<00:03:18.489> just<00:03:19.299> rotating<00:03:19.959> back<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.380> forth

back<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:20.890> forth<00:03:21.130> until<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.880> pull<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.630> back

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
back and forth until I pull that back

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.330 
back and forth until I pull that back
this<00:03:23.980> torsion<00:03:24.670> plate<00:03:24.910> back<00:03:25.299> far<00:03:26.170> enough<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
this torsion plate back far enough to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.990 
this torsion plate back far enough to
where<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.519> can<00:03:28.709> rest<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:29.920> arm<00:03:30.100> on<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.430> stop<00:03:30.670> now

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
where I can rest the arm on the stop now

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.060 
where I can rest the arm on the stop now
after<00:03:31.750> I've<00:03:31.870> finished<00:03:31.900> tightening<00:03:32.739> all<00:03:32.860> these

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
after I've finished tightening all these

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.710 
after I've finished tightening all these
boats<00:03:33.310> where<00:03:33.580> I<00:03:33.610> want<00:03:33.940> them<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.150> so<00:03:34.330> on<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.570> so

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.560 
boats where I want them and so on and so
forth<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.340> can<00:03:36.670> release<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.239> pressure

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
forth then I can release the pressure

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.660 
forth then I can release the pressure
and<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.900> stop<00:03:38.140> is<00:03:38.260> going<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.500> hold<00:03:38.650> it<00:03:38.799> then

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
and the stop is going to hold it then

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and the stop is going to hold it then
I'm<00:03:39.790> going<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:39.970> put<00:03:40.120> everything<00:03:40.360> back

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
I'm going to put everything back

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.530 
I'm going to put everything back
together<00:03:40.930> put<00:03:41.920> it<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.280> ground<00:03:42.459> look<00:03:43.269> at<00:03:43.420> my

together put it on the ground look at my
work<00:03:43.750> before<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.170> do<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.530> other<00:03:44.560> side<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:44.980> want

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
work before I do the other side I want

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.000 
work before I do the other side I want
to<00:03:45.430> make<00:03:45.579> sure<00:03:45.610> I<00:03:45.820> haven't<00:03:46.239> gone<00:03:46.450> too<00:03:46.750> far<00:03:47.049> or

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
to make sure I haven't gone too far or

to make sure I haven't gone too far or
whatever<00:03:48.459> like<00:03:48.700> that<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:49.150> can't<00:03:49.420> go<00:03:49.570> too<00:03:49.630> far

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
whatever like that you can't go too far

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.289 
whatever like that you can't go too far
I've<00:03:50.170> heard<00:03:50.350> actually<00:03:51.160> read<00:03:51.610> on<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.910> internet

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
I've heard actually read on the internet

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.140 
I've heard actually read on the internet
a<00:03:52.329> guy<00:03:52.570> did<00:03:52.900> this<00:03:53.140> and<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.790> know<00:03:54.880> his<00:03:55.000> first

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
a guy did this and you know his first

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.410 
a guy did this and you know his first
time<00:03:55.450> out<00:03:55.720> he<00:03:55.989> got<00:03:56.170> so<00:03:56.560> much<00:03:57.090> torsion<00:03:58.090> on<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.329> he

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
time out he got so much torsion on it he

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.569 
time out he got so much torsion on it he
couldn't<00:03:58.630> see<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.780> was<00:03:59.019> bad<00:03:59.230> glass<00:03:59.560> so<00:03:59.980> you

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
couldn't see I was bad glass so you

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.039 
couldn't see I was bad glass so you
don't<00:04:00.790> want<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.120> that<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:01.660> we're<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
don't want to do that so we're going to

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.390 
don't want to do that so we're going to
check<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.410> out<00:04:02.590> and<00:04:02.769> then<00:04:02.860> we'll<00:04:03.040> do<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.250> other

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
check it out and then we'll do the other

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
check it out and then we'll do the other
side<00:04:04.290> okay<00:04:05.290> guys<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.769> I<00:04:06.280> backed<00:04:06.790> up<00:04:07.030> here<00:04:07.390> a

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
side okay guys I I backed up here a

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.650 
side okay guys I I backed up here a
little<00:04:07.600> bit<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:08.079> decided<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.920> just<00:04:09.190> go<00:04:09.660> one

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
little bit I decided to just go one

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.860 
little bit I decided to just go one
tooth<00:04:11.019> when<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:11.980> was<00:04:12.250> used<00:04:12.549> to<00:04:12.670> doing<00:04:12.730> two<00:04:13.570> teeth

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
tooth when I was used to doing two teeth

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.650 
tooth when I was used to doing two teeth
on<00:04:14.430> that<00:04:15.430> oh<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:16.269> know<00:04:16.979> increasing<00:04:17.979> the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
on that oh you know increasing the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.200 
on that oh you know increasing the
amount<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:19.750> tension<00:04:20.700> there's<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.789> little<00:04:22.090> more

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
amount of tension there's a little more

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.300 
amount of tension there's a little more
left<00:04:22.450> in<00:04:22.630> these<00:04:22.810> torsion<00:04:23.770> bars<00:04:23.950> than<00:04:24.130> what<00:04:24.280> I

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
left in these torsion bars than what I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.760 
left in these torsion bars than what I
thought<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:24.970> it<00:04:25.419> was<00:04:25.570> way<00:04:25.930> way<00:04:26.289> too<00:04:26.349> much

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
thought that it was way way too much

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.390 
thought that it was way way too much
tension

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
tension

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.700 
tension
to<00:04:28.120> get<00:04:28.300> everything<00:04:28.630> up<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.139> in<00:04:29.229> place<00:04:29.470> so<00:04:29.500> I'm

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
to get everything up and in place so I'm

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.689 
to get everything up and in place so I'm
going<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:29.949> try<00:04:30.160> one<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.990> see<00:04:31.990> how<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.199> works

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
going to try one and see how that works

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.540 
going to try one and see how that works
I'm<00:04:33.699> not<00:04:33.759> sure<00:04:34.270> if<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.509> will<00:04:34.630> give<00:04:34.810> me<00:04:34.930> enough

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
I'm not sure if it will give me enough

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.159 
I'm not sure if it will give me enough
if<00:04:36.550> it<00:04:36.759> lifts<00:04:37.000> up<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.240> rear<00:04:37.509> end<00:04:37.720> enough<00:04:37.990> or

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
if it lifts up the rear end enough or

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.450 
if it lifts up the rear end enough or
not<00:04:38.229> but<00:04:38.560> we're<00:04:38.710> going<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:38.889> try<00:04:39.100> it<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.370> see

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
not but we're going to try it and see

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.290 
not but we're going to try it and see
just<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.419> little<00:04:40.570> tip<00:04:40.840> here<00:04:42.060> while<00:04:43.060> you're

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
just a little tip here while you're

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.700 
just a little tip here while you're
while<00:04:43.630> you're<00:04:43.810> raising<00:04:44.080> your<00:04:45.419> torsion<00:04:46.419> plate

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
while you're raising your torsion plate

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.790 
while you're raising your torsion plate
with<00:04:47.710> your<00:04:47.740> jack<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.220> your<00:04:48.580> torsion<00:04:49.030> tool

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
with your jack and your torsion tool

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.409 
with your jack and your torsion tool
you'll<00:04:50.800> notice<00:04:51.009> I've<00:04:51.370> got<00:04:51.580> just<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.030> little<00:04:52.060> I

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
you'll notice I've got just a little I

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.540 
you'll notice I've got just a little I
want<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.780> throw<00:04:52.900> this<00:04:53.020> in<00:04:53.259> I<00:04:53.289> put<00:04:53.560> this<00:04:53.800> the

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
want to throw this in I put this the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.700 
want to throw this in I put this the
vise<00:04:55.360> grips<00:04:55.720> that<00:04:55.870> just<00:04:56.139> keeps<00:04:56.350> that<00:04:56.530> from

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
vise grips that just keeps that from

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.620 
vise grips that just keeps that from
sliding<00:04:57.009> up<00:04:57.280> because<00:04:57.910> there's<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.150> bit<00:04:58.419> of<00:04:58.539> an

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
sliding up because there's a bit of an

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.439 
sliding up because there's a bit of an
angle<00:04:59.020> on<00:04:59.169> it<00:04:59.199> when<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.500> first<00:04:59.680> start<00:05:00.449> as

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
angle on it when you first start as

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.450 
angle on it when you first start as
you're<00:05:01.960> raising<00:05:02.320> that<00:05:02.440> up<00:05:02.680> keep<00:05:03.160> tightening

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
you're raising that up keep tightening

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.879 
you're raising that up keep tightening
these<00:05:03.789> bolts<00:05:04.270> okay<00:05:04.960> that's<00:05:05.530> going<00:05:05.680> to<00:05:05.770> let

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
these bolts okay that's going to let

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.330 
these bolts okay that's going to let
that<00:05:05.919> slip<00:05:06.310> in<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.580> where<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:07.000> can<00:05:07.180> go<00:05:07.389> up

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
that slip in to where you can go up

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.070 
that slip in to where you can go up
under<00:05:09.340> your<00:05:09.460> stop<00:05:09.760> here<00:05:10.060> also<00:05:10.270> put<00:05:10.660> this<00:05:10.780> clamp

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
under your stop here also put this clamp

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.730 
under your stop here also put this clamp
on<00:05:11.380> here<00:05:11.910> just<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.120> give<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.330> to<00:05:14.050> help<00:05:14.320> it<00:05:14.440> ease

on here just to give it to help it ease
that<00:05:14.979> that<00:05:15.490> torsion<00:05:16.030> plate<00:05:16.990> back<00:05:17.380> on<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:18.220> the

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
that that torsion plate back on to the

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.379 
that that torsion plate back on to the
bar<00:05:18.580> as<00:05:18.789> you<00:05:18.849> go<00:05:19.120> up

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
bar as you go up

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.920 
bar as you go up
so<00:05:19.720> anyway<00:05:20.620> I'm<00:05:20.770> ready<00:05:20.979> to<00:05:21.250> got<00:05:21.940> all<00:05:22.060> my<00:05:22.210> bolts

so anyway I'm ready to got all my bolts
final<00:05:23.410> you<00:05:23.800> know<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.039> final<00:05:24.370> torque<00:05:25.150> on<00:05:25.419> these

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
final you know the final torque on these

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.170 
final you know the final torque on these
didn't<00:05:26.770> use<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:26.949> torque<00:05:27.220> spec<00:05:27.460> just<00:05:27.729> common

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
didn't use a torque spec just common
