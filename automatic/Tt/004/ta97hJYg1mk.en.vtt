they're<00:00:26.460> huge<00:00:27.060> leaps<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.539> bounds<00:00:27.900> of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
example is a lot lighter better battery

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.950 
example is a lot lighter better battery
faster<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.420> something<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.809> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
faster and it's something that I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.510 
faster and it's something that I
expected<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.829> does<00:00:37.980> make<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.280> big

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
expected but it does make a big

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.850 
expected but it does make a big
difference<00:00:38.640> if<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.450> pick<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> iPad<00:00:40.170> 2<00:00:40.649> now

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

compared<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.399> an<00:00:41.670> iPad<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.750> generation<00:00:43.350> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
compared to an iPad first generation it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
compared to an iPad first generation it
seems<00:00:43.890> really<00:00:44.430> happy<00:00:44.579> image<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> just

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
seems really happy image and it just

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
seems really happy image and it just
gets<00:00:45.960> outdated<00:00:46.500> very<00:00:46.770> quickly<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.550> also<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
gets outdated very quickly and also the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.639 
gets outdated very quickly and also the
first<00:00:48.300> generation<00:00:48.719> models<00:00:49.079> there's<00:00:49.289> tend<00:00:49.559> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
first generation models there's tend to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
first generation models there's tend to
be<00:00:49.739> some<00:00:49.980> bugs<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.399> kinks<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.910> typically<00:00:51.420> do

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
be some bugs and kinks that typically do

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.209 
be some bugs and kinks that typically do
get<00:00:51.750> worked<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.079> compared<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> when<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.100> go

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
get worked out compared to when you go

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.310 
get worked out compared to when you go
on<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> next<00:00:53.760> generation<00:00:54.420> reason<00:00:55.199> number

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
on to the next generation reason number

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.920 
on to the next generation reason number
two<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.129> only<00:00:56.309> works<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:56.760> iPhone<00:00:57.180> devices<00:00:57.510> so

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
two it only works for iPhone devices so

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.939 
two it only works for iPhone devices so
that<00:00:58.050> means<00:00:58.230> you're<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.379> gonna<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.649> able<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that means you're not gonna be able to

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.889 
that means you're not gonna be able to
use<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.460> Apple<00:00:59.820> watch<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.390> Android

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
use your Apple watch with Android

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.080 
use your Apple watch with Android
devices<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.070> huge<00:01:02.280> reason<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.789> me

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
devices that's a huge reason for me

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.729 
devices that's a huge reason for me
I<00:01:03.120> typically<00:01:03.750> switch<00:01:03.989> phones<00:01:04.229> pretty<00:01:04.530> often

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
I typically switch phones pretty often

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
I typically switch phones pretty often
and<00:01:05.220> it's<00:01:05.790> thinks<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.330> only<00:01:06.420> use<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and it's thinks that I can only use this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.170 
and it's thinks that I can only use this
with<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.200> iPhone<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.490> Android<00:01:08.909> wearables

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
with my iPhone with Android wearables

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.330 
with my iPhone with Android wearables
you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.840> wear<00:01:09.960> those<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.290> iPhone<00:01:10.890> or<00:01:11.100> Android

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you can wear those for iPhone or Android

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.550 
you can wear those for iPhone or Android
it<00:01:11.700> doesn't<00:01:12.000> matter<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> think<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.290> Apple

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
it doesn't matter so I think the Apple

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
it doesn't matter so I think the Apple
watch<00:01:13.830> should<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.130> versatile<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
watch should be versatile like that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.840 
watch should be versatile like that
we're<00:01:15.659> gonna<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> for<00:01:16.290> both<00:01:16.500> devices

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
we're gonna use it for both devices

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.130 
we're gonna use it for both devices
reason<00:01:17.850> number<00:01:17.970> three<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.600> battery<00:01:18.900> life

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
reason number three the battery life

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.960 
reason number three the battery life
apple<00:01:19.740> claims<00:01:19.860> did<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.490> day<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.670> use

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
apple claims did you get one day of use

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
apple claims did you get one day of use
out<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.450> Apple<00:01:21.810> watch<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.170> found<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:22.530> to

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
out of your Apple watch I found that to

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
out of your Apple watch I found that to
be<00:01:22.710> relatively<00:01:23.159> true<00:01:23.580> depending<00:01:24.119> on<00:01:24.210> how<00:01:24.330> much

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
be relatively true depending on how much

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
be relatively true depending on how much
you<00:01:24.630> use<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.229> your<00:01:25.439> phone<00:01:25.590> use<00:01:25.890> it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you use it just like your phone use it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010 
you use it just like your phone use it
more<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.280> course<00:01:26.520> gonna<00:01:26.759> go<00:01:26.850> down<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.689> another

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
more of course gonna go down but another

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.319 
more of course gonna go down but another
note<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.259> battery<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.729> slicing<00:01:30.150> on

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
note on battery is this slicing on

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
note on battery is this slicing on
something<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.630> last<00:01:30.840> 5-10<00:01:31.229> years<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.220> you're

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
something can last 5-10 years and you're

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.100 
something can last 5-10 years and you're
spending<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:33.180> good<00:01:33.329> amount<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.600> money<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
spending a good amount of money for it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.620 
spending a good amount of money for it
so<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.159> buy<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> watch<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.119> typically<00:01:36.450> have

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so if you buy a watch you typically have

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.999 
so if you buy a watch you typically have
that<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:36.930> generations<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.590> they<00:01:37.680> last<00:01:37.890> a

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that for generations and they last a

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.770 
that for generations and they last a
very<00:01:38.040> long<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.270> only<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
very long time so that only is the

number three apps you could get a good
amount<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.150> apps<00:03:49.329> for<00:03:49.569> your<00:03:49.720> Apple<00:03:49.989> watch

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
especially compared to other wearables

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.580 
especially compared to other wearables
for<00:03:52.419> example<00:03:52.780> it's<00:03:52.959> pretty<00:03:53.169> cool<00:03:53.260> they<00:03:53.440> can

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
for example it's pretty cool they can

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.289 
for example it's pretty cool they can
request<00:03:53.919> it<00:03:54.099> you<00:03:54.609> don't<00:03:54.760> have<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.879> plot<00:03:55.090> your

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
request it you don't have to plot your

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.550 
request it you don't have to plot your
phone<00:03:55.479> or<00:03:55.750> if<00:03:55.870> you're<00:03:55.989> someone<00:03:56.229> that<00:03:56.379> doesn't

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
phone or if you're someone that doesn't

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.229 
phone or if you're someone that doesn't
really<00:03:56.680> have<00:03:57.250> your<00:03:57.370> phone<00:03:57.639> near<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.090> your

really have your phone near you your

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.330 
really have your phone near you your

pocket or maybe just puts it in your bag
I<00:04:00.370> think<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.060> Apple<00:04:01.629> watch<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> great

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:02.229 
I think the Apple watch is a great

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:03.390 
I think the Apple watch is a great
alternative<00:04:02.409> because<00:04:03.040> you're<00:04:03.159> not<00:04:03.250> gonna

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
alternative because you're not gonna

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.890 
alternative because you're not gonna
digging<00:04:03.699> them<00:04:03.790> there<00:04:03.939> and<00:04:04.299> hold<00:04:04.569> on<00:04:04.659> to<00:04:04.780> your

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
digging them there and hold on to your

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.240 
digging them there and hold on to your
phone<00:04:05.109> if<00:04:05.349> you<00:04:05.470> don't<00:04:05.500> have<00:04:05.709> pockets<00:04:05.919> or

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
phone if you don't have pockets or

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.399 
phone if you don't have pockets or
whatever<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:07.239> can<00:04:07.359> do<00:04:07.479> simple<00:04:07.720> stuff<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.229> here

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
whatever you can do simple stuff on here

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.960 
whatever you can do simple stuff on here
Apple<00:04:08.889> knows<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:09.430> is<00:04:09.609> not<00:04:09.729> something

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
Apple knows that this is not something

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.280 
Apple knows that this is not something
you<00:04:10.150> know<00:04:10.269> you're<00:04:10.389> gonna<00:04:10.479> write<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.750> novel<00:04:11.019> on

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
so they make it simple so apps are very

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.409 
so they make it simple so apps are very
simple<00:04:14.859> to<00:04:14.979> use<00:04:15.009> and<00:04:15.489> they<00:04:15.729> just<00:04:16.000> quicken<00:04:16.389> to

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
simple to use and they just quicken to

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.449 
simple to use and they just quicken to
the<00:04:16.599> point<00:04:16.870> number<00:04:17.470> four<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.009> this<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.280> more

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
the point number four and this is more

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.129 
the point number four and this is more
of<00:04:18.489> an<00:04:18.579> opinion<00:04:18.849> but<00:04:19.389> it's<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.659> latest<00:04:19.780> tech

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
of an opinion but it's the latest tech

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.719 
of an opinion but it's the latest tech
out<00:04:20.289> there<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:20.889> know<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.070> sounds<00:04:21.370> kind<00:04:21.669> of
