00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.760
 If there is a lack of guarantees provided by each child, he had not many 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.159
 works of art as you would expect 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:15.259
 He pointed out that it is very valid there, for that we are going badly to the lighthouse 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.269
 takes us to meet the school that is inside the museum 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.499

 the miami children's museum is full of color 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.600
 its exhibits includes a music pavilion, art workshops, 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.050
 exhibitions of traditional paintings and also spaces similar to a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.650
 supermarket and even a bank what many do not know is that it also has 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.200
 a public school 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.740

 we have from kindergarten to fifth grade 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.160
 down end two groups for each level inc 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.550
 and so the children grow with us they can develop and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
 grow academically which is very stimulating for all 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.070
 the museum is one of two in the united states as schools within its 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.069
 facilities 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.649
 and it turns out to be like an extension of the classroom the general location of 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.650
 museums our workspace 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.700
 we do not limit ourselves to the four walls of a work our children have and if 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.890
 we have near museums area

 Ishida and math lessons 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.369

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.490
 as to what can 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.900
 they advanced 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.510
 hot 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.750

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.250
 combine it the third of the engine room can learn from money 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 as the interpreter of the genre of the whole world 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.710

 Spanish that we use performing arts as a methodology for 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.180
 motivate students 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.720

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.429
 They are learning 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.169
