00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.730
 hi all the guys are andry of the 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.560
 stable schifa www.lexbook.it wind up 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 to facebook infection and I'm worse than that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 the help sofiane feghouli sif the exterior 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.840
 Now the valencia that made 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.750
 mad the defense of the newspaper arm 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.490
 come back 3 to 2 to cannes or and then you are 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.000
 deserved this card sif 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.350
 which shows an 80 of google 86 entries 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 from 89 76 to teo 83 of passage plus 6 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.480
 compared to the sound in the form of 60 head and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.679
 53 defense before talking too much 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360
 and he too saw some of his 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.910
 in game statistics where we can see 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.800
 a 90 of how much from the ball 88 rick ross 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:46.050
 92 76 finalization 78 and two punishments 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.120
 80 cash over more than 82 long shot 85 91 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.230
 of boosted true 90 in acceleration e 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.480
 in agility 84 and quick jerk sentence 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.079
 the triplication 61 famous in physics that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.250
 however in deep it will simulate much more 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:03.300
 talking about the top of this player 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.510
 to me as before I first thing that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 I believe it is fundamental in Friuli there is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.650
 no doubt the cross that is the cross is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.270
 the weapon more than him subject per click 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.070
 and inspiration and play on the right wing 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.549
 then ascertain if it is not pulling 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 the maximum 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.150
 but when he goes to cross his own 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.259
 cross 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
 brushstrokes always come out 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.130
 fantastic that the attackers you 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.030
 they simply have to put in 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.470
 that much cross with that beautiful foot 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.220
 that a nice effect also comes back 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.650
 that is among the top of its cost I do n't know well 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.450
 how to explain it is really clean and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.619
 very often as in this 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.350
 opportunity to score easily then 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.329
 in addition to gross another bit is definitely 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 its big but triple because 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.310
 what nightmare they want at 92 90 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.689
 control dance the 90 nagila but then 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.220
 click because of the stars skill but of 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.470
 this we will talk about later 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.049
 in practice lu with him choirs on the band 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.729
 and if an opponent shows up against it 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.189
 you can safely dodge either 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.840
 his great dreaming because the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.990
 ball is always glued to its feet is 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.259
 very agile indeed very agile e 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.670
 at the end 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.579
 always manages to skip the Russian that 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.640
 but he can not know but if the skins 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.840
 why three stars on the tram but of 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.590
 we'll talk about this later because this 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.569
 meeting 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.750
 now we're a bit of a throw and 82 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.450
 and 91 within the finalization 76 e 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.950
 only 62 to react 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.450
 then held a tour I then some of 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.489
 sometimes honestly it's not like they have me 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.129
 disappointed constant so I don't consider them 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.720
 one against his from a shot and side 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.340
 cosentino are really good also a 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.430
 end of session the problem is when you 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.769
 turn on you are always on the left 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.599
 so you try to do it with col 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.120
 right despite the exit on the left 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.590
 and then maybe some art because 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.700
 that point he shoots one of those lines 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.480
 to be his initiative really 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.950
 high that another is really nice 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.590
 colossus nor on the passages not intended as 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.659
 what passes because 85 passages cooked and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.609
 so many long roses where one tools 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.319
 better than the other than their method of 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.409
 to do both of throws it is if not 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:11.579
 just pull at that point 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:16.000
 it becomes easy to mark in the sense if 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.560
 not to draw a vague ssis and to the point 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.579
 it becomes easy to take mates score 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:24.280
 this is data from the launcher 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.199
 then we talked and now I add 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.849
 also physical strength but that he at 61 the 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:31.030
 your physicist said we went 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.079
 those stars of the cd no maybe i don't know 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.579
 well because why doesn't it either 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.319
 so high balance 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.030
 but he seems much stronger 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.319
 physically and therefore this is one 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.510
 procedure while it seems kind 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.120
 farfan therefore a musical prose on the 80s 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.859
 so this is what I should be 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.690
 see review the double flop the flop 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.129
 are three-star skeletons and not witches 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.750
 allow you the real art center 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.930
 maximum or to do my stability 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.220
 and so okay it's not that he did n't 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.760
 instead closed so that he would come 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.319
 per flop 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.669
 I hope it builds liked both power over 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.629
 I like written analysis does not exist 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.629
 it can be me bike
