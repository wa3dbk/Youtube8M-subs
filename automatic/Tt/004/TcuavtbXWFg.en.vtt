00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.299
 in this video we see how we can 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.160
 create a glass wall from scratch e 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.519
 taking precisely as a reference 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 this is this curved wall therefore 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.359
 let's transform this full wall into one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.039
 glass wall we saw in the video 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.650
 previous how we can create one 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.880
 glass wall we already say more or more 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.010
 less set by rapid so we have 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.750
 since you just need to select the wall 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.250
 go into a base wall then into 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 property panel and change 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.739
 then the wall in question with one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 then a curtain wall continues 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.210
 window already set so for example 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.079
 we can use glass panel 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.550
 colorful vertical division 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.050
 ok so here you see we have 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 already replaced our in our wall 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 with a glazed failure, however, in this 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.109
 case we don't want to exploit the models 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.600
 pre-set that it would give us then 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.290
 we do against z we want to create 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:18.810
 us a pre-set solution 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:24.060
 defined then click on type 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.720
 of generic glass wall here is what 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.320
 It happens 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.220
 I have to see then we ignore again 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.530
 this message 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.509
 how can we see the wall now 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.990
 glass inserted even if we say created 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.270
 on the trace of the curved wall that was there 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.060
 previously the glass wall like 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.490
 you see it's completely straight and this one 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.880
 part you see here let's see if 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.680
 therefore we can make it more evident 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.079
 let's make 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.909
 select with tab and take the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.689
 panel this here that you see precisely 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.680
 the panel is instead of using 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.479
 glazed system panel we use 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.390
 blue glass panel 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.160
 ok so you can see it a little bit better 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.640
 here's how you see this wall 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.069
 glazed now 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.930
 while recognizing the trace of the wall 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.180
 underlying curve is a glass wall 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.750
 straight because it is a glass wall 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.790
 direct for a simple reason 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.370
 let's put on the right view can be 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.030
 a prospectus or your view 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.420
 right of 3d and how we see precisely 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.330
 this glass wall remains in a hurry 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.280
 because it has no grid lines then 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.660
 we must insert some lines of 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.730
 grid 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.010
 otherwise this wall will never be 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.670
 a curved wall so what 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.450
 let's make 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.150
 we put ourselves in isolation mode 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.370
 then bend the goggles playfully 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.370
 here below 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.400
 we make island element ok 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.400
 and in this list we begin a 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 position
