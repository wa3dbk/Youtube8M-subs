00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.400
 this year 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.180
 Y 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.620
 hello how welcome are you to reaction 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.340
 number 20 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.409
 although there are many with the last choice 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.200
 for example with your blogs already go 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.439
 grabbing 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.230
 If so, then we continue with that 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.060
 choice 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.820
 after the previous election to the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.300
 hammer diput lesson because I need 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.460
 that all these heights already have more 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.050
 how fast what you need is agility 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.350
 it is strength and agility the speed is 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.299
 something very relative and is 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.640
 some fast for others I'm very 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.729
 slow that's a totally issue 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.790
 inconsequential what I need is 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.860
 strength and a little bit of agility the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.069
 agility to move from string to 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.680
 ropes without spoiling the jump the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.239
 agility to be able to create mental for 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.590
 be able to locate the correct scales in the 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.400
 right moment 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.799
 ok today we're going to make you 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.480
 one of the most beautiful scales that 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.220
 exist on my favorite scale indeed 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.129
 it is a variation of the scale 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.020
 pentatonic in fact is identical tonic 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.020
 it's called blues scale 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.720
 it differs from the pentatonic scale 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.630
 in that you have an additional note this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.280
 additional note we call it the fifth 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.280
 diminished 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.500
 how the hell is that 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.080
 too easy 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.620
 if we are going to play a pentatonic scale 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.420
 for example those five patterns of the 25 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.290
 you can more of me I started this clip 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.670
 playing the blues scale in the 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.670
 patterns of my minor 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 here we have pentatonic scale 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.099
 ok now what we're going to do is touch 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.930
 this scale with an additional note which 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.970
 the non-traditional that we are going to touch is 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.020
 the fifth diminished what is that fifth 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.570
 diminished very simple 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.210
 we are playing in the fifth of my so 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.580
 of simple 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.620
 very simple is that way we go find it 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.130
 on the first fret of the fifth string 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.130
 the scales correspond 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.269
 and they have it there is an octave in this 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.250
 format where is let's say this 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.519
 pattern of the scale that we 're going to 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.470
 find on the third fret in the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.470
 third string also us B-flat 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.030
 how it would sound the whole full scale in 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.030
 that you come two notes would be like that 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.590
 its octave 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.060
 so 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.000
 you can see that it has a very high cadence 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.750
 special 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.390
 s chromatism that goes from the fourth note to 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.320
 the fifth is what makes you listen 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.540
 really only scale can see that if 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.770
 is the same pentatonic scale that we have 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.280
 been playing and with which we have been 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.210
 working 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.130
 the difference is that note that note the 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.610
 that there is to attack there are thousands of the ix 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.000
 around this this note in 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.890
 our scale 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.290
 you who are touching something so 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.500
 they want it to look like jazz or jazz 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.180
 I edit very simple everything in that note if 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.750
 you want to play super blues be that 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.640
 listen if car does not touch you that 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.550
 note if you want to see 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.900
 interesting handsome and generous touch in 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.150
 that note 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.009
 there is one of the examples of this 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.420
 note throughout our positions 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.820
 the number one position 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.100
 what do you think if we change the tone for 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.820
 to make it clearer, let's play the 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.820
 greater the minor 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.960
 first position would be this pentatonic 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.990
 the first position blues scale or 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.990
 you think of league with diminished fifth 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:02.719
 same touch slower 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.139
 all right 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.720
 and 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:22.780
 no no 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.780
 what we are going to the second position
