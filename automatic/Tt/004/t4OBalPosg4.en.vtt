00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.340
 it's not something he is doing on purpose 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.680
 because you're recovering, I'll do it 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.470

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.200

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.139

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:09.659

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:12.090

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:15.370
 if you put the band together well 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.070
 I practically paused it 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.930

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:35.990
