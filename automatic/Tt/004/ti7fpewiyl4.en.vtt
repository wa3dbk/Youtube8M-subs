00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
afraid of guessing because I when I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.929 
afraid of guessing because I when I
approach<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> shot<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> 5s<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.610> find

how much of this we got the center of

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.740 
how much of this we got the center of
interest<00:02:40.730> that's<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.120> main<00:02:41.300> thing<00:02:41.510> we<00:02:41.720> want

it's a whole car now over here we got to
put<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.200> mud<00:02:48.500> puddle<00:02:48.680> okay<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.640> we<00:02:49.910> include<00:02:50.180> all

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
put a mud puddle okay so we include all

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.390 
put a mud puddle okay so we include all
the<00:02:50.390> mud<00:02:50.750> puddle<00:02:51.020> of<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.170> whole<00:02:51.350> car<00:02:51.710> that

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
the mud puddle of the whole car that

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.130 
the mud puddle of the whole car that
makes<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.910> center<00:02:53.150> of<00:02:53.270> interest<00:02:53.630> too<00:02:53.780> small

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
makes the center of interest too small

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.080 
makes the center of interest too small
now<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.010> make<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.400> center<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:55.820> interest

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
now to make the center of interest

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.120 
now to make the center of interest
closer<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.990> get<00:02:57.140> closer<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.740> center<00:02:57.890> of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
closer to get closer to the center of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.400 
closer to get closer to the center of
interest<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.610> make<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.880> larger<00:02:59.450> we<00:03:00.080> can<00:03:00.260> do

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
interest and make it larger we can do

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.020 
interest and make it larger we can do
that<00:03:00.590> if<00:03:00.740> we<00:03:00.770> cut<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.220> mud<00:03:01.400> puddle<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.820> half

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
that if we cut the mud puddle in half

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.840 
that if we cut the mud puddle in half
and<00:03:02.240> we<00:03:02.600> cut<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.990> car<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.260> half<00:03:03.459> that's<00:03:04.459> fine

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
and we cut the car in half that's fine

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.310 
and we cut the car in half that's fine
because<00:03:05.090> now<00:03:05.360> we<00:03:05.420> still<00:03:05.750> got<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.930> mud<00:03:06.140> puddle

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
because now we still got a mud puddle

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.110 
because now we still got a mud puddle
the<00:03:06.590> viewer<00:03:06.950> will<00:03:07.220> see<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.730> is<00:03:07.820> a<00:03:07.850> mud

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
the viewer will see that it is a mud

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.210 
the viewer will see that it is a mud
puddle<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:08.540> we<00:03:08.900> still<00:03:09.140> got<00:03:09.290> half<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:09.709> car<00:03:09.890> so

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
puddle and we still got half the car so

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.010 
puddle and we still got half the car so
the<00:03:10.340> viewer<00:03:10.580> will<00:03:10.850> identify<00:03:11.090> that<00:03:11.540> as<00:03:11.690> a<00:03:11.720> car

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
the viewer will identify that as a car

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.449 
the viewer will identify that as a car
if<00:03:12.140> that's<00:03:12.350> what<00:03:12.500> we<00:03:12.620> feel<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:12.950> important<00:03:13.400> in

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
if that's what we feel is important in

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.490 
if that's what we feel is important in
the<00:03:13.550> shot<00:03:13.760> but<00:03:14.450> we've<00:03:14.720> made<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.080> center<00:03:15.380> of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
the shot but we've made the center of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.979 
the shot but we've made the center of
interest<00:03:15.830> bigger<00:03:16.160> see<00:03:16.730> by<00:03:16.910> getting<00:03:17.209> closer<00:03:17.510> by

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
interest bigger see by getting closer by

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.199

one shot that I can use in a show out of

guy<00:05:02.840> coming<00:05:03.169> in<00:05:03.349> from<00:05:03.560> behind<00:05:03.710> from<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.280> door

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
guy coming in from behind from the door

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.580 
guy coming in from behind from the door
I<00:05:04.729> think<00:05:05.240> he<00:05:05.330> took<00:05:05.479> about<00:05:05.750> seven<00:05:06.110> shots<00:05:06.380> of

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
I think he took about seven shots of

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.879 
I think he took about seven shots of
that<00:05:06.710> picked<00:05:07.070> one<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.430> them<00:05:07.520> that's<00:05:08.180> fine<00:05:08.889> my

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
that picked one of them that's fine my

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:12.190 
that picked one of them that's fine my
idea<00:05:10.310> is<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.610> get<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.120> on<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.450> first<00:05:11.660> shot<00:05:11.840> of

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
idea is to get it on the first shot of

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.710 
idea is to get it on the first shot of
course<00:05:12.500> everybody's<00:05:13.039> idea<00:05:13.430> is<00:05:13.520> that<00:05:13.700> but<00:05:14.599> you

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720

importantly<00:06:41.100> you're<00:06:41.250> wasting<00:06:41.700> time<00:06:41.910> you<00:06:42.510> take

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 
importantly you're wasting time you take

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.320 
importantly you're wasting time you take
five<00:06:43.020> shots<00:06:43.410> and<00:06:43.710> my<00:06:43.830> nightmare<00:06:44.310> is<00:06:44.520> that<00:06:44.820> if<00:06:45.210> I

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
five shots and my nightmare is that if I

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.660 
five shots and my nightmare is that if I
took<00:06:45.570> five<00:06:45.780> quick<00:06:46.140> shots<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.920> real<00:06:47.160> shot<00:06:47.460> was

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
took five quick shots the real shot was

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.220 
took five quick shots the real shot was
in<00:06:47.820> between<00:06:48.150> number<00:06:48.510> two<00:06:48.720> or<00:06:48.870> number<00:06:48.900> three

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:49.230 
in between number two or number three

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.290 
in between number two or number three
and<00:06:49.710> I<00:06:50.100> missed<00:06:50.430> it<00:06:50.580> because<00:06:50.670> I<00:06:50.940> was<00:06:50.970> too<00:06:51.270> busy

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
and I missed it because I was too busy

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.620 
and I missed it because I was too busy
taking<00:06:51.780> shots<00:06:52.200> no<00:06:52.920> motor<00:06:53.310> drives<00:06:53.700> I've<00:06:54.360> never

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:54.630 
taking shots no motor drives I've never

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.360 
taking shots no motor drives I've never
had<00:06:54.870> a<00:06:54.900> motor<00:06:55.200> drive<00:06:55.380> I<00:06:55.620> never<00:06:55.830> want<00:06:56.100> a<00:06:56.160> motor

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
had a motor drive I never want a motor

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.970 
had a motor drive I never want a motor
drive<00:06:56.610> because<00:06:57.540> each<00:06:57.750> shot<00:06:58.080> with<00:06:58.320> me<00:06:58.500> counts

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
drive because each shot with me counts

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.360 
drive because each shot with me counts
and<00:06:59.160> each<00:06:59.430> shot<00:06:59.790> I<00:07:00.000> sweat<00:07:00.750> out<00:07:01.220> and<00:07:02.220> I<00:07:02.310> don't

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
and each shot I sweat out and I don't

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.480 
and each shot I sweat out and I don't
get<00:07:02.670> very<00:07:02.730> many<00:07:03.090> good<00:07:03.360> shots<00:07:03.630> sorry<00:07:04.490> anyway

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
get very many good shots sorry anyway

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.620 
get very many good shots sorry anyway
this<00:07:05.790> is<00:07:05.970> my<00:07:06.090> opinion

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
this is my opinion

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.070 
this is my opinion
think<00:07:07.380> about<00:07:07.650> it<00:07:07.860> won't<00:07:08.610> work<00:07:08.910> and<00:07:09.120> think

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
think about it won't work and think

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.370 
think about it won't work and think
about<00:07:10.290> frequency<00:07:10.950> of<00:07:11.520> shots

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 
about frequency of shots

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.400 
about frequency of shots
that's<00:07:13.920> all<00:07:14.100> I<00:07:14.130> can<00:07:14.250> say
