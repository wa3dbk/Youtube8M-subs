type<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:13.810> case<00:03:14.079> now<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.890> kind<00:03:15.100> of

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
type of case now this is the kind of

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.690 
type of case now this is the kind of
case<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.400> has<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.470> cutout<00:03:17.470> on<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.459> side

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
case that has the cutout on the side

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.849 
case that has the cutout on the side
