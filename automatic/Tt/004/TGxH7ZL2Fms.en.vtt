00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.300 
I'm proud on this thing I see a really
weird<00:02:44.270> little<00:02:44.570> screw<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.110> here<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:46.010> one

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
weird little screw in here and it's one

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.250 
weird little screw in here and it's one
of<00:02:46.370> those<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:48.220> think<00:02:49.220> it's<00:02:49.519> a<00:02:49.640> lock<00:02:49.880> nut<00:02:50.110> for<00:02:51.110> one

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
of those I think it's a lock nut for one

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.580 
of those I think it's a lock nut for one
of<00:02:51.320> those<00:02:51.440> tamper-proof<00:02:52.190> bits<00:02:52.730> those

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
of those tamper-proof bits those

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.800 
of those tamper-proof bits those
tamper-proof<00:02:54.590> bastards<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:58.450> big<00:02:59.450> stamper

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
tamper-proof bastards this big stamper

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:07.830 
tamper-proof bastards this big stamper
proof<00:03:00.049> nothing<00:03:04.269> better<00:03:05.269> open

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:16.460 

ah<00:03:13.590> look<00:03:14.590> at<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.769> gold<00:03:15.129> plating<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.670> there

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
ah look at that gold plating in there

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.890 
ah look at that gold plating in there
it's<00:03:17.470> like<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.650> phone<00:03:17.980> board<00:03:18.660> contacts<00:03:19.660> gold

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
it's like a phone board contacts gold

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:31.050 
it's like a phone board contacts gold
plated<00:03:21.450> seems<00:03:22.450> under<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.750> screen<00:03:22.989> here<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
plated seems under the screen here the

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.580 
plated seems under the screen here the
way<00:03:31.180> you've<00:03:31.209> got<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.480> screen<00:03:34.049> as<00:03:35.049> you<00:03:35.110> see<00:03:35.349> that

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
way you've got a screen as you see that

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.030 
way you've got a screen as you see that
there<00:03:35.709> was<00:03:35.830> a<00:03:35.860> screen<00:03:36.190> in<00:03:36.370> there<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.890> there's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
there was a screen in there and there's

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.699 
there was a screen in there and there's
this<00:03:39.099> whole<00:03:39.959> green<00:03:40.959> board<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.410> like<00:03:41.470> what's

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
this whole green board just like what's

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.370 
this whole green board just like what's
in<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.890> telephone<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:43.480> say<00:03:43.660> some<00:03:43.810> gold<00:03:44.019> plating

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
in a telephone you say some gold plating

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.750 
in a telephone you say some gold plating
here<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.799> guess<00:03:45.069> if<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.310> get<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> bunch<00:03:45.610> of

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
here I guess if you get a bunch of

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.240 
here I guess if you get a bunch of
people<00:03:46.090> throwing<00:03:46.299> their<00:03:46.420> XM<00:03:46.690> Radio's<00:03:46.989> away

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
people throwing their XM Radio's away

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.940 
people throwing their XM Radio's away
they<00:03:48.250> may<00:03:48.400> be<00:03:48.459> worth<00:03:48.640> heaven<00:03:49.440> but<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.560> probably

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
they may be worth heaven but it probably

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.930 
they may be worth heaven but it probably
going<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.280> take<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.430> lot<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.640> make<00:03:51.849> it

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
going to take a lot to make it

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.819 
going to take a lot to make it
worthwhile<00:03:54.989> unless<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.140> get<00:03:56.349> some<00:03:56.379> more<00:03:56.650> I'm

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
worthwhile unless I get some more I'm

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.970 
worthwhile unless I get some more I'm

these get they have got no other street

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.100 
these get they have got no other street
there's<00:04:29.120> gold<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.570> these<00:04:34.600> I'm<00:04:35.600> probably

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
there's gold in these I'm probably

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.270 
there's gold in these I'm probably
another<00:04:36.380> one<00:04:36.560> in<00:04:36.650> here<00:04:36.680> as<00:04:37.580> well<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.090> jet<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:39.850> see

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.050 

so<00:04:46.280> much<00:04:46.400> for<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.639> world<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:49.160> there's

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
so much for the world and there's

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.060 
so much for the world and there's
coupler<00:04:50.419> mystery<00:04:51.169> to<00:04:51.800> chips<00:04:52.070> in<00:04:52.220> there<00:04:54.070> I've

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
coupler mystery to chips in there I've

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.710 
coupler mystery to chips in there I've
noticed<00:04:55.340> there's<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.580> lot<00:04:55.760> of<00:04:55.789> tantalum

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
noticed there's a lot of tantalum

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.090 
noticed there's a lot of tantalum
capacitors<00:04:57.289> only<00:04:57.530> have<00:04:57.620> these<00:04:57.710> little<00:04:57.860> black

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
capacitors only have these little black

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.540 
capacitors only have these little black
boxes<00:04:59.260> with<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.410> minus<00:05:00.770> on<00:05:00.919> one<00:05:01.130> side<00:05:01.370> that's

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
boxes with the minus on one side that's

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.760 
boxes with the minus on one side that's
10<00:05:01.820> of<00:05:01.940> them<00:05:02.229> you're<00:05:03.229> going<00:05:03.320> to<00:05:03.410> find<00:05:03.530> tell

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
10 of them you're going to find tell

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.080 
10 of them you're going to find tell
them<00:05:03.949> anywhere<00:05:04.220> that<00:05:04.370> there's<00:05:04.760> going<00:05:05.000> to<00:05:05.060> be

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
them anywhere that there's going to be

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.950 
them anywhere that there's going to be
heat<00:05:06.430> because<00:05:07.430> take<00:05:07.910> 6000<00:05:08.419> degrees<00:05:08.539> to<00:05:08.780> melt

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
heat because take 6000 degrees to melt

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.110 
heat because take 6000 degrees to melt
down<00:05:08.990> on<00:05:09.199> them<00:05:09.289> so<00:05:09.500> don't<00:05:10.310> worry<00:05:10.610> about<00:05:10.789> you<00:05:10.880> XM

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
down on them so don't worry about you XM

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.730 
down on them so don't worry about you XM
radio<00:05:11.330> get<00:05:11.510> too<00:05:11.630> hot<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.169> doesn't<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.530> your

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
radio get too hot and doesn't it your

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.960 
radio get too hot and doesn't it your
transistors<00:05:15.220> so<00:05:16.220> that's<00:05:16.370> what's<00:05:16.520> at<00:05:16.610> an<00:05:16.699> XM

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
transistors so that's what's at an XM

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.800 
transistors so that's what's at an XM
radio<00:05:18.160> some<00:05:19.160> decent<00:05:19.460> gold<00:05:19.550> plating<00:05:19.940> here<00:05:20.180> from

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
radio some decent gold plating here from

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.900 
radio some decent gold plating here from
the<00:05:20.900> context<00:05:21.320> but<00:05:21.560> don't<00:05:22.340> take<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.520> lot<00:05:22.639> to<00:05:22.699> make

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
the context but don't take a lot to make

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:29.500 
the context but don't take a lot to make
a<00:05:22.940> difference<00:05:26.349> so<00:05:27.349> yeah
