00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.400
 we have about the number of cylinders 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:24.779
 spoken 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.779
 1 to 12 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.500
 In the workshop, it is important for me 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.239
 knows when take four cylinders or 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.930
 six cylinder which is the first 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.420
 cylinder and there is our good old 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.720
 Serve around German industry norm like 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.879
 for German vehicles says about the 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.769
 to identify the first cylinder 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.660
 determine 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.239
 I look at the side of the mode like 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.120
 the craft levy is opposite the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.120
 force side is the side where the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.530
 flywheel sets and gears and it 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.379
 goes into the force flow 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.510
 the opposite side is the one 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.979
 side where we usually our air 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.290
 sitting in the cooler also across 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.869
 motors then i watch ah there it is 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.020
 gearbox on the right and the cooler on the left and 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.850
 then that is also valid there and the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.369
 side of the power delivery opposite 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.860
 is there is the first cylinder the 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.369
 follow cylinder with the series engine 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.020
 then from the opposite of the 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.729
 craft donation opposite side 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.000
 numbered to the force delivery side 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.820
 123 many what do I do when I enter 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.799
 I have the same picture I watch again from 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.649
 the side of the power delivery 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.960
 is opposite and take only the left 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.520
 Bank if I stand in front of it left 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.869
 cylinder bank 1 2 3g to the right bank 456 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.390
 and the topic is already done 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:57.100
 the boxer engine will probably be similar 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.259
 But be careful Japanese manufacturers 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.630
 what the clubs numbering came white 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.990
 Not me because they are German 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.240
 industry namely committed and the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.550
 legendary beetle motor with that I have 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.100
 Learned more than three years ago 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.410
 this engine had a completely different one 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.300
 naming but today they assume 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.390
 in german vehicles like me 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.160
 just described the power levy 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.200
 opposite there is the first one 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 cylinder and then back through the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.030
 v motor is the left side then the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.780
 right side and the boxer motors in the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.780
 principle as well 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.800
 our motto 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.070
 can turn right or turn left 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.690
 Turn the crankshaft in relation to the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.490
 Does not she or I know the light? 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.400
 the designer firmly and it also no 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.870
 Criterion for the quality of a motor 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.450
 that is why he has no more or less 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.710
 power 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.510
 But I also have to go to the workshop 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.160
 we know about the engine and the engine 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.620
 is set in engineering right 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.420
 turning is a fixed concept 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.650
 if you look at your work as possible 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.660
 you have an analog watch with an indicator 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.200
 one direction of rotation and that's right 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.000
 definitely turn in engineering if you 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.410
 Now go to her engine 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.870
 again similar to the linden tree 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.990
 numbering on the side of the force 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.010
 Discharge opposite is where the fan 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:31.090
 is now watching the crankshafts 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:35.830
 disc crankshafts wheel and see there 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.390
 aha the wheel turns like my watch in the 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.580
 Regel also turned the air in the direction 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.610
 but that does not have to be that way 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.540
 that turns in that direction then that is 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.280
 turn the engine right 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.390
 in the opposite direction looks 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.970
 turn and it's that easy for both 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.700
 Regulations engine cylinder numbering 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.650
 and direction of rotation always the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.140
 side of the power delivery opposite 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.490
 light you are still there 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.280
 maybe it's helpful 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.760
 to take some explanations on the way 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.200
 in the everyday or in the exam ok 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.440
 stay tuned and I'll do it 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.450
 He also courage to criticize criticism 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.310
 But that means that must be constructive 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:23.170
 if one writes okay maike 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.240
 that is okay if 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.520
 I am pleased to write you a comment 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.020
 me about any comment if you like 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.310
 but do not like something 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.390
 in the way I explain what 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.860
 acceptable is from my side 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.140
 then I would be happy if you 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.600
 express constructive criticism 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.449
 that is more helpful than anywhere in life 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.240
 just do bobo 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.129
 constructive means that the 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.259
 explanation I do not like it that way or 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.120
 I do not understand that 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.189
 represent myself a little differently and 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.960
 I will in my future actions 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:57.210
 try to record that but without 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.830
 Warranty because after my experience 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.580
 comes criticism from very different 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.349
 corners of very different 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.240
 positions and directions and there 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.189
 you can not follow everyone you have to go there 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.180
 a straight towards the follow 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.919
 I want anyway 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.960
 Therefore, they are not offended 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.560
 if your criticism is not implemented immediately 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.560
 but I will listen to it 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.430
 watch and that's not why 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.430
 make courage
