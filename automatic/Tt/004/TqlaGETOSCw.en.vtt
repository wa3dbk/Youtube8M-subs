if<00:05:19.440> I<00:05:19.560> bend<00:05:19.770> them<00:05:20.010> it<00:05:20.310> doesn't<00:05:20.610> move<00:05:20.670> out<00:05:20.820> of

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
if I bend them it doesn't move out of

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.120 
if I bend them it doesn't move out of
place<00:05:21.090> it's<00:05:21.480> nice<00:05:21.690> and<00:05:21.930> sturdy<00:05:22.320> it's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
place it's nice and sturdy it's

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.710 
place it's nice and sturdy it's
lightweight<00:05:23.430> it's<00:05:23.820> made<00:05:23.970> from<00:05:24.120> carbon<00:05:24.480> fiber

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
lightweight it's made from carbon fiber

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.850 
lightweight it's made from carbon fiber
so<00:05:25.640> when<00:05:26.640> it's<00:05:26.940> like<00:05:27.360> it<00:05:28.140> doesn't<00:05:28.530> slide<00:05:28.800> down

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
so when it's like it doesn't slide down

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.800 
so when it's like it doesn't slide down
your<00:05:29.040> nose<00:05:29.280> they're<00:05:29.460> not<00:05:29.610> heavy<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.660> can

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
run with them do anything the actual

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.300 
run with them do anything the actual
lens<00:05:35.430> is<00:05:35.820> really<00:05:36.420> nice<00:05:36.600> on<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.050> camera<00:05:37.500> if<00:05:37.980> it

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
lens is really nice on the camera if it

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.270 
lens is really nice on the camera if it
hopefully<00:05:38.910> is<00:05:39.180> HD<00:05:39.840> enough<00:05:40.140> you<00:05:40.830> can<00:05:40.980> see<00:05:41.130> that

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
hopefully is HD enough you can see that

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.700 
hopefully is HD enough you can see that
it's<00:05:41.430> really<00:05:41.760> dark<00:05:41.970> up<00:05:42.240> top<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:42.750> then<00:05:42.930> it<00:05:43.440> kind

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
it's really dark up top and then it kind

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.960 
it's really dark up top and then it kind
of<00:05:44.780> goes<00:05:45.780> into<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.140> clear<00:05:46.500> gray<00:05:46.980> it's<00:05:47.280> a<00:05:47.430> fades

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
of goes into a clear gray it's a fades

into<00:05:48.150> a<00:05:48.270> clear<00:05:48.540> grey<00:05:48.840> because<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.440> don't<00:05:49.650> need

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
into a clear grey because you don't need

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.340 
into a clear grey because you don't need
shading<00:05:50.460> down<00:05:50.640> at<00:05:50.790> the<00:05:50.880> bottom<00:05:51.060> because<00:05:51.450> when

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
shading down at the bottom because when

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.050 
shading down at the bottom because when
you<00:05:52.440> look<00:05:52.620> down<00:05:52.800> some<00:05:53.220> can't<00:05:53.580> go<00:05:53.730> into<00:05:53.880> your

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
then has a verification number here and

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.279 
then has a verification number here and
a<00:06:46.729> series<00:06:47.479> number<00:06:47.810> because<00:06:48.050> they<00:06:48.169> have

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
a series number because they have

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:49.240 
a series number because they have
different<00:06:48.680> series

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
different series
