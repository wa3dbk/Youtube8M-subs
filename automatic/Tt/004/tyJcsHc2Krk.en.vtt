more<00:00:52.040> toward<00:00:52.280> collection<00:00:52.820> so<00:00:53.540> it's<00:00:54.019> actually

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
more toward collection so it's actually

comfy Weymouth it hasn't got a high pour
nothing<00:01:00.739> is<00:01:00.860> going<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.129> interfere<00:01:01.610> with<00:01:01.909> the

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:02.119 
nothing is going to interfere with the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.910 
nothing is going to interfere with the
upper<00:01:02.420> palate<00:01:03.309> but<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.430> hasn't<00:01:04.909> got<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:06.470> very

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
upper palate but it hasn't got a very

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.300 
upper palate but it hasn't got a very
thick<00:01:07.310> mouthpiece<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:08.299> that<00:01:08.450> isn't<00:01:08.630> such<00:01:09.310> a

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
thick mouthpiece so that isn't such a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.810 
thick mouthpiece so that isn't such a
weight<00:01:11.180> loading<00:01:11.750> surface<00:01:12.439> however<00:01:13.280> it<00:01:13.580> is

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
weight loading surface however it is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.899 
weight loading surface however it is
very<00:01:14.090> ergonomically<00:01:14.750> designed<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:16.640> will

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
very ergonomically designed it will

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.170 
very ergonomically designed it will
bridge<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.990> tongue<00:01:18.290> without<00:01:19.190> actually

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
bridge the tongue without actually

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.590 
bridge the tongue without actually
coming<00:01:21.140> down<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.880> causing<00:01:22.880> undue<00:01:23.150> pressure

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
coming down and causing undue pressure

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.660 
coming down and causing undue pressure
over<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.290> tongue<00:01:24.590> very<00:01:24.800> sensitive<00:01:25.490> outer

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
over the tongue very sensitive outer

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.540 
over the tongue very sensitive outer
edges<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.080> very<00:01:27.380> clever<00:01:27.680> curvature

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
edges so it is a very clever curvature

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.280 
edges so it is a very clever curvature
it's<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.820> tongue<00:01:29.060> bridge<00:01:29.390> it's<00:01:29.600> it's<00:01:29.930> not<00:01:30.230> a

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
it's a tongue bridge it's it's not a

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.670 
it's a tongue bridge it's it's not a
port<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.760> it<00:01:31.880> still<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.240> very<00:01:32.300> comfortable<00:01:32.930> but

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
port so it still is very comfortable but

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.680 
port so it still is very comfortable but
it<00:01:33.830> isn't<00:01:34.340> very<00:01:34.370> comfortable<00:01:34.610> if<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.450> horse

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
it isn't very comfortable if the horse

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.840 
it isn't very comfortable if the horse
tries<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.260> take<00:01:36.470> too<00:01:36.710> much<00:01:36.830> weight<00:01:37.250> actually

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
tries to take too much weight actually

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.780 
tries to take too much weight actually
through<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.930> rain<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.890> if<00:01:40.159> you<00:01:40.340> need<00:01:40.520> more

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
through the rain so if you need more

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.600 
through the rain so if you need more
lift<00:01:41.120> or<00:01:41.450> if<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.170> just<00:01:42.200> need<00:01:42.530> more<00:01:42.800> control<00:01:43.280> in

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
lift or if you just need more control in

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.660 
lift or if you just need more control in
general<00:01:43.960> then<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.290> simmer<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:45.950> actually<00:01:46.640> a

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
general then the simmer is actually a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.800 
general then the simmer is actually a
very<00:01:47.300> very<00:01:47.450> good<00:01:47.960> Weymouth<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.530> consider<00:01:49.810> we

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
very very good Weymouth to consider we

if<00:01:53.630> we<00:01:53.870> want<00:01:54.140> more<00:01:54.350> lifting<00:01:54.710> we<00:01:54.800> want<00:01:54.979> more

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
if we want more lifting we want more
