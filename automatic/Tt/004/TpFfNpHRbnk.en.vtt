00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.389
 welcome to this tutorial course 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:14.139
 histology we intend with this brief 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:17.560
 video illustrate some very concepts 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.750
 big ones that somehow allow 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.820
 facilitate the observation of 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.279
 nervous system preparations / 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.870
 colored with the matuk technique if 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.570
 lina kitchen 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:34.060
 and when you observe a material 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.190
 like the one we just described 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.170
 the cellular components of the tissue 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.750
 neurons and the loyal cells do not 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.360
 they can observe in their entirety but 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.100
 As the picture shows you can see from 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.280
 the neurons basically the body 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.800
 cellular and the loyal cells 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.309
 exclusively the core 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.309
 Y 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:02.350
 seen to minor the medium increase 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.740
 then we see here an accumulation group of 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.840
 neurons and among them several cells 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.259
 glial 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.130
 let's see right away how you can 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.990
 observe these cells at higher magnification 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.840
 we can already see with this increase a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.649
 medium that these neuronal bodies are 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.920
 they are characterized by being good sharp vessels 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.229
 basophils this clear space that we see 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.049
 in the rounded medium is actually the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.969
 nucleus that you see - basophils that the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.979
 own cytoplasm because it's a micro with 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.039
 very scattered chromatin very the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.750
 chromatic and that blue dot and what 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.429
 we see this increase corresponds to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.760
 nuclei what is very obvious and very 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:48.430
 marked 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.430
 a greater increase as we said 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.590
 we see then his cytoplasm abbasov and 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.890
 what you see the emergence of a great 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.620
 prolongation can be a blessed 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.720
 I need plasma present plus lumps 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.720
 basophils that are the lumps of anise he 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.520
 they are accumulations of endoplasmic reticulum 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 rugose free ribosomes that with the 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.180
 resolution of the optical microscope are 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.390
 like these basophilic packages of 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.100
 material is a very chromatic core like 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.280
 we said and a very large core and 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.150
 evident 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.030
 of the glial cells we observe 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.590
 exclusively the nuclei 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.170
 we're going to move on this other 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.970
 microscopic field by the preparation 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.830
 looking for more neurons 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.040
 see here for example 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.960
 there is a neuron where we see the 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.300
 emergency a blessed here also 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.980
 we see another big dendritic this 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.080
 neuron was cut so that the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.970
 core was not left in the section are 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.910
 very large cells and it is possible that the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.040
 section does not include the core 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.910
 and in this other the nucleus of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:02.220
 cytoplasm but not seen in these 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.140
 they are glial cells 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:09.450
 these large nuclei of circles with the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.570
 scattered chromatin and some group 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:17.000
 associated with the membrane correspond to 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.000
 star cells and tasks 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.920
 if we keep moving through the 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.920
 preparation 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.739
 we'll see 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.739
 other similar cell elements 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.360
 Neurons and more legal cells 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.330
 see this cell the little flag 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.630
 pericardium in which we see the nucleus 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.850
 core what we see here a cell the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.640
 core of a delial cell that is not 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.370
 like these astrocytes we were 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.040
 describing but that is a core more 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.720
 elongated that surely corresponds to the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.470
 nucleus of oligodendrocytes just like 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.240
 this is not seen in this field clearly 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.070
 nuclei of microglial cells the 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.740
 description of the cores is in 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.380
 rise of the pilot 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.880
 these accumulation of neurons and we go back to 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.750
 previous increase in the middle of the 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.660
 increases this group of neurons is not 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:22.270
 finds itself arranged homogeneously in the 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.610
 central nervous system you see 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.259
 If you use two if the increase 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.840
 topographic it looks like there have been waves 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:31.389
 are arranged in the form of groups of 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.940
 accumulations here there is one here there are others 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.330
 surrounded by white substance these are 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.120
 they know as nuclei of gray matter 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.220
 the presence of neuronal bodies 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.080
 defines what is called gray matter and 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.960
 the rest where there is absence of the body 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.330
 neuronal in white substance 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.670
 and this one can not neurons then form 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.070
 one last this is another 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.770
 here there seems to be another and if we move 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.510
 by preparing little more like that in the 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.390
 surfaces come here all this is a 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.030
 nucleus 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.800
 We will find 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.800
 more structures and millions 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.509
 more to use in the preparation 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.789
 here we have another nucleus here another 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:16.169
 nucleus core of substance 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.020
 different substance another way to 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.509
 be arranged that is on the surface of 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.520
 the organs not of all true of the 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:28.110
 central nervous system like in this 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.759
 case for example forming a crust or 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.800
 be that the gray substance then 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.139
 be arranged in the form of nuclei or bark 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.270
 the crusts are superficial layers in 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.289
 this case is very folded 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.270
 because it corresponds 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:45.930
 characteristically to the cortex of 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:50.150
 cerebellum that acquires that structure 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:53.980
 well we hope that this one 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.980
 million is the result
