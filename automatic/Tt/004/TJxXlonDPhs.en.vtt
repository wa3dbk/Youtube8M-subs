wrong girl and rampage

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.550 
wrong girl and rampage
although<00:01:16.470> transforms<00:01:18.330> almost<00:01:19.330> exactly<00:01:19.930> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
although transforms almost exactly the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:30.389 
although transforms almost exactly the
same<00:01:24.030> like<00:01:25.030> so<00:01:26.759> rampage<00:01:28.259> well<00:01:29.259> if<00:01:29.710> you've<00:01:30.130> seen

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399

my<00:01:30.610> videos<00:01:30.969> of<00:01:31.329> Devastator<00:01:32.289> he<00:01:33.159> doesn't<00:01:33.460> do

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
my videos of Devastator he doesn't do

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.330 
my videos of Devastator he doesn't do
anything<00:01:34.840> at<00:01:35.229> all<00:01:35.320> for<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.710> transformation

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
anything at all for the transformation

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.859 
anything at all for the transformation
so<00:01:36.719> this<00:01:37.719> is<00:01:37.869> him<00:01:38.880> scrapper<00:01:39.880> he's<00:01:40.509> a<00:01:40.539> bit

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
so this is him scrapper he's a bit

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.810 
so this is him scrapper he's a bit
different

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.179 
it's a bit different how that whole
system<00:01:54.490> works<00:01:54.969> then<00:01:55.869> just<00:01:56.170> rotate<00:01:57.159> that

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
system works then just rotate that

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.779 
system works then just rotate that

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
yellow but looking at the picture I also

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.270 
yellow but looking at the picture I also
saw<00:02:29.500> that

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.840 

scrapper<00:02:33.280> here<00:02:33.580> had<00:02:34.030> wheels<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.810> some<00:02:34.990> shreds

scrapper here had wheels and some shreds

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.810 
scrapper here had wheels and some shreds
I<00:02:36.900> also<00:02:37.900> fixed<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:40.260> bucket<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.430> so<00:02:42.700> it

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
I also fixed the bucket like that so it

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.850 
I also fixed the bucket like that so it
looks<00:02:43.030> a<00:02:44.070> way<00:02:45.070> better<00:02:45.310> way<00:02:46.470> which<00:02:47.470> were<00:02:47.650> like

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
looks a way better way which were like

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.770 
looks a way better way which were like
the<00:02:48.870> toy<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.790> actual<00:02:52.120> bottle<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.720> you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
can see actually now where they did

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.010 
can see actually now where they did
scrapper<00:02:57.250> are<00:02:57.580> actually<00:02:58.330> about<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.780> same

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020
