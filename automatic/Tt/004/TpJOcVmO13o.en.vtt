00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390
 I'm back to hunting or rather to 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.759
 trap and we cut two partridges 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.079
 who is pointing and there is one that comes from 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.380
 direction but it's still 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:34.260
 almost fifty meters from 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.390
 we and it's a little rat versa how 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.260
 Can we take it to what 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 place is what we will try to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.690
 shoot 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.579
 then the technique for a big plateau 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.470
 she's exactly the same as on a 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.170
 very short plateau 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.870
 we go through his bird so the bird 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.120
 so in this case left fist 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.750
 at the right point we will take it the most 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.969
 quickly possible 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.609
 we will take his speed by following him 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.379
 and this speed is going to force us 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.510
 to spend 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.510
 that's it, we'll try it's gone 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.970
 so what happened was I took 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.380
 the time to follow him and his speed 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.689
 because because he embarked my 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.340
 rifle his life his speed pushed my 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.229
 son 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.920
 So be it a small or there 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.909
 obviously the distance before that m is 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.070
 much smaller 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.640
 wherever it's a long one it's following 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.770
 its plateau that it allows us to pass 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.420
 front of a meter two meters from 10 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.960
 meters in the occurrence on that one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.540
 a lot of chords so now we 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.070
 maybe going to see a thing we break a 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.450
 it's very good what happens 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.130
 when there are two 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.079
 one behind the other then what is it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610
 which will happen the rifle will be forced 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.799
 he is adroit 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.380
 the plateau is left finally the plateau 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.960
 in this case the partridge there on 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.670
 makes a negative move we go from we go 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.459
 to the partridge while the partridge 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.039
 comes to us so in this case we 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.110
 rowing and cooking we take the time 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.560
 to follow him and we follow him much more 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.280
 to take more insurance do not 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.840
 be 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.180
 overwhelmed by the plateau by losing him 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.489
 at the word we can do it there with a 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.810
 plateau without shooting twice in a row 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.379
 in order to see that at the hotel it is this 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.810
 what are you going to do 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.110
 ok so we start again I love me rocket 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.019
 in the same place paul I see him out 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.910
 I take it good it's dead I come back 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.860
 right here 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.239
 hop I see him go out and I got one 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.620
 little more to break it a little further 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:51.160
 okay it will allow me the insured ok 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:54.510
 in there in action the real is more 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.510
 easy to say that to secede 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.750
 luckily I broke you
