game<00:00:36.239> lagged<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.630> me<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:38.090> like<00:00:39.090> right<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
game lagged on me so like right when I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.350 
game lagged on me so like right when I
like<00:00:39.899> are<00:00:40.260> right<00:00:40.500> when<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> game<00:00:41.280> closed<00:00:41.610> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
like are right when the game closed and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
like are right when the game closed and
I<00:00:42.480> logged<00:00:42.690> back<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.079> already<00:00:43.559> showed<00:00:43.860> me<00:00:44.789> at

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I logged back in already showed me at

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.350 
I logged back in already showed me at
zero<00:00:45.180> percent<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.710> didn't<00:00:47.039> show<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.090> level

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
zero percent so it didn't show the level

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.200 
zero percent so it didn't show the level
up<00:00:48.480> thing<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.460> then<00:00:50.760> yeah

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
up thing so if you see that then yeah

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.360 
up thing so if you see that then yeah
you<00:00:51.239> know<00:00:51.510> why<00:00:54.170> for<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> skills<00:00:55.620> right<00:00:55.949> now<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you know why for the skills right now I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
you know why for the skills right now I
don't<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.699> where<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> set<00:00:57.899> them<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
don't know where to set them because I

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.080 
don't know where to set them because I
can't<00:00:59.960> really<00:01:00.960> find<00:01:01.260> any<00:01:01.469> skill<00:01:01.980> books<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.520> if

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
can't really find any skill books as if

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.649 
can't really find any skill books as if
for<00:01:03.449> now<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.589> whichever<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> find<00:01:06.090> first<00:01:06.330> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
for now but whichever one I find first I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
for now but whichever one I find first I
guess<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.220> max<00:01:08.549> out

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
guess that's what I'm going to max out

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.410 
guess that's what I'm going to max out
and

doing it but I think I'll level a little
more<00:01:48.660> slower<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.620> I<00:01:49.950> boss<00:01:50.160> but<00:01:50.780> i'll<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:52.020> i'll

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
more slower if I boss but i'll go i'll

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.830 
more slower if I boss but i'll go i'll
try<00:01:52.620> it<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.070> guess<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:55.910> recently<00:01:56.910> I<00:01:57.030> just

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.990 
hoping that the more they patch it the
more<00:02:31.890> better<00:02:32.239> servers<00:02:33.239> are<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.840> lag<00:02:34.080> less

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
more better servers are so we lag less

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.810 
more better servers are so we lag less
just<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.150> last<00:02:36.330> patch<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.110> had<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.820> could

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
just the last patch that we had I could

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.140 
just the last patch that we had I could
play<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> higher<00:02:39.890> graphics<00:02:40.890> but<00:02:41.820> i<00:02:41.880> still

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
play on a higher graphics but i still

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.420 
play on a higher graphics but i still
can't<00:02:42.390> record<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.840> as<00:02:43.080> good<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:44.250> now

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.100 

I'm<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.580> going<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.850> stick<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.180> maple<00:02:48.750> parts

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
I'm just going to stick to maple parts

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.490 
I'm just going to stick to maple parts
and<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:50.220> call<00:02:51.030> duty<00:02:51.270> montages<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.410> get

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
and I call duty montages if I can get

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.590 
and I call duty montages if I can get
them<00:02:52.620> up<00:02:52.880> because<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:54.090> haven't<00:02:54.240> really<00:02:54.420> been

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
them up because I haven't really been

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.980 
them up because I haven't really been
playing<00:02:54.870> call<00:02:55.170> duty<00:02:55.380> as<00:02:55.530> much<00:02:55.710> either<00:02:56.990> mostly

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
playing call duty as much either mostly

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.440 
playing call duty as much either mostly
playing<00:02:58.230> diablo<00:02:58.770> right<00:02:58.950> now<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.460> beaten<00:03:00.330> the

playing diablo right now I beaten the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.470 
playing diablo right now I beaten the
game<00:03:00.600> in<00:03:00.810> about<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:01.230> four<00:03:01.890> days<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:03.270> I'm

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480 
game in about like four days and I'm
coming<00:03:04.110> out<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> hardest<00:03:04.650> level<00:03:04.800> right<00:03:05.070> now<00:03:05.100> i

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
coming out the hardest level right now i

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.210 
coming out the hardest level right now i
think<00:03:06.120> i<00:03:06.420> have<00:03:06.450> about<00:03:06.840> 60<00:03:07.350> hours<00:03:07.680> on<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.100> my

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
think i have about 60 hours on to my

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.900 
think i have about 60 hours on to my
character<00:03:10.130> but<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.490> know<00:03:11.610> i'm<00:03:11.730> still

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
character but you know i'm still

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.460 
character but you know i'm still
alternating<00:03:12.450> back<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.630> forth<00:03:13.020> with<00:03:13.230> this

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
alternating back and forth with this

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.040 
alternating back and forth with this
game<00:03:13.770> call<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.670> duty<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.270> diablo<00:03:15.720> all<00:03:15.900> at

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
game call of duty and the diablo all at

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.040 
game call of duty and the diablo all at
the<00:03:16.140> same<00:03:16.290> time<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.950> it's<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.370> hassle<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:19.020> know

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
the same time so it's a hassle you know

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.680 
the same time so it's a hassle you know
each<00:03:19.440> day<00:03:19.710> I'm<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.190> okay<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.390> want<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.630> play

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
each day I'm like okay you want to play

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.810 
each day I'm like okay you want to play
this<00:03:21.960> I<00:03:22.350> look<00:03:22.680> like<00:03:22.800> that<00:03:23.090> so<00:03:25.280> yes<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.460> lot<00:03:26.670> of

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
this I look like that so yes a lot of

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.310 
this I look like that so yes a lot of
games<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:29.630> hopefully<00:03:30.630> I<00:03:30.660> can<00:03:30.750> finish<00:03:30.990> this

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
games but hopefully I can finish this

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.410 
games but hopefully I can finish this
road<00:03:31.650> by<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.490> end<00:03:32.730> of<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.000> summer<00:03:33.270> actually

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
road by the end of this summer actually

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.440 
road by the end of this summer actually
only<00:03:36.420> need<00:03:36.630> about<00:03:36.930> 60<00:03:37.620> more<00:03:37.740> levels<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.280> go

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
only need about 60 more levels to go

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.190 
only need about 60 more levels to go
hopefully<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:40.020> about<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.590> think<00:03:40.800> two<00:03:41.010> months

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
hopefully and about I think two months

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.120 
hopefully and about I think two months
if<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.350> play<00:03:43.590> every<00:03:43.620> day<00:03:43.860> that<00:03:44.580> is<00:03:46.130> hopefully

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
if I play every day that is hopefully

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.830 
if I play every day that is hopefully
hopefully<00:03:47.850> I'll<00:03:48.090> reach<00:03:48.240> it<00:03:48.420> by<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.600> end<00:03:48.690> of

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
hopefully I'll reach it by the end of

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.160 
hopefully I'll reach it by the end of
summer<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:49.140> then<00:03:49.910> I'm<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.420> last<00:03:51.570> part<00:03:51.930> as

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
summer and then I'm the last part as

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.330 
summer and then I'm the last part as
usual<00:03:52.740> I<00:03:53.070> will<00:03:53.220> ask<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:53.850> guys<00:03:54.030> what<00:03:54.780> class<00:03:55.340> do

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
usual I will ask you guys what class do

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.070 
usual I will ask you guys what class do
you<00:03:56.370> want<00:03:56.580> me<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.760> do<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> road<00:03:57.180> on<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.750> then

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
you want me to do a road on and then

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.170 
you want me to do a road on and then
I'll<00:03:58.290> do<00:03:58.740> it<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:59.100> course<00:04:01.520> I'll<00:04:02.520> try<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.790> do<00:04:03.000> as

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
I'll do it of course I'll try to do as

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.970 
I'll do it of course I'll try to do as
many<00:04:03.360> as<00:04:03.600> possible<00:04:03.840> i<00:04:04.170> don't<00:04:04.350> think<00:04:04.590> i<00:04:04.740> will<00:04:04.800> be

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
many as possible i don't think i will be

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.070 
many as possible i don't think i will be
able<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.400> do<00:04:05.550> all<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.760> them

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.810 

well<00:04:10.240> one<00:04:11.240> I<00:04:11.540> think<00:04:12.170> these<00:04:13.040> new<00:04:13.280> classes<00:04:13.760> are

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
well one I think these new classes are

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.690 
well one I think these new classes are
going<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:14.000> be<00:04:14.060> coming<00:04:14.210> out<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.690> don't<00:04:15.080> know

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
going to be coming out I don't know

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.990 
going to be coming out I don't know
but<00:04:16.600> if<00:04:16.900> it's<00:04:17.079> soon<00:04:17.380> I'll<00:04:17.709> probably<00:04:17.950> do<00:04:18.370> one<00:04:18.940> of

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
but if it's soon I'll probably do one of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.300 
but if it's soon I'll probably do one of
those<00:04:19.269> instead<00:04:19.840> of<00:04:19.989> just<00:04:20.470> another<00:04:20.739> class<00:04:20.980> I

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
those instead of just another class I

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.330 
those instead of just another class I
think<00:04:21.519> they're<00:04:21.639> called<00:04:21.790> like<00:04:23.340> something

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
think they're called like something

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.740 
think they're called like something
already<00:04:24.580> thing<00:04:25.060> i<00:04:25.210> forgot<00:04:25.389> what<00:04:25.540> they're

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
already thing i forgot what they're

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.440 
already thing i forgot what they're
called<00:04:25.990> it's<00:04:26.470> like<00:04:26.620> two<00:04:26.800> new<00:04:26.950> classes<00:04:27.360> if<00:04:28.360> you

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
called it's like two new classes if you

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.960 
called it's like two new classes if you
guys<00:04:28.600> can<00:04:28.780> comment<00:04:29.050> that<00:04:29.350> in<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.970> comments

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
guys can comment that in the comments

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.610 
guys can comment that in the comments
just<00:04:31.389> tell<00:04:31.660> me<00:04:31.750> what<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.050> two<00:04:32.229> new<00:04:32.350> classes

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
just tell me what the two new classes

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.640 
just tell me what the two new classes
are<00:04:32.979> because<00:04:33.790> I<00:04:33.970> forgot<00:04:34.300> what<00:04:34.419> they<00:04:34.540> were<00:04:34.690> but

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
are because I forgot what they were but

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.890 
are because I forgot what they were but
if<00:04:35.919> they<00:04:36.100> are<00:04:36.250> coming<00:04:36.580> out<00:04:36.700> soon<00:04:36.940> then<00:04:37.479> I'll

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
if they are coming out soon then I'll

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.960 
if they are coming out soon then I'll
probably<00:04:38.229> do<00:04:38.500> one<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.740> those<00:04:38.979> instead<00:04:40.229> so<00:04:41.970> this

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
probably do one of those instead so this

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.800 
probably do one of those instead so this
video<00:04:43.300> is<00:04:43.330> about<00:04:44.169> to<00:04:44.680> be<00:04:44.770> over<00:04:44.800> right<00:04:45.400> now<00:04:45.810> so
