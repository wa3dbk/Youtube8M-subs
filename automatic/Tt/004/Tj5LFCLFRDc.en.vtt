00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 the rebound effect you start that diet with 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.250
 all the illusion of the world that is 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.150
 feel good you want to get close to your 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.059
 ideal weight that is to vibrate of energy and to 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.970
 principle everything is very nice they sell you 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.119
 that magical diet you start doing what 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.539
 is supposed to be done and one of two 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:28.019
 or you leave the diet or when you finish 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.050
 that diet occurs what is known 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.260
 as a rebound effect and that is your body you 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.450
 behavior that does is recover you 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.510
 makes it recover even more 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.649
 fast and sometimes more weight than you have 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.180
 lost how can we prevent this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.110
 rebound effect as we can 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.160
 make the diet that we choose 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.160
 it is easy to follow 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.280
 The first thing you have to be clear about is 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:05.199
 that diets are useless 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.470
 that is known by diets as something that 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.210
 you do to lose weight and then 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 where to your normal life and stay with 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.580
 that ideal weight is an absolute 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.700
 bullshit and forgive me to talk so 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.580
 clearly but that reality what of 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.650
 it really works is to choose a style of 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.270
 life why I for example when you 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.640
 I'm talking about the paleolithic diet of the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.160
 Paleolithic diet adapted to your world 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.780
 real and mine I 'm not talking about 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.560
 a diet I'm talking about a style 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.420
 of life so the first thing is not to choose 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.850
 a diet the first thing that you have to 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.670
 to do is to choose a lifestyle that 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.700
 it seems healthy and you find it 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.330
 sustainable for the rest of you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.830
 existence rule number one no more 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.950
 lifestyle diets 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.960
 rule number 2 the problem that you can 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.580
 experience when you start this path 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:06.490
 it's good you do it but 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.160
 At any given moment your will begins to 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.040
 give in suddenly it breaks and you have to 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.460
 abandon that new lifestyle that 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.910
 is what is happening here 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.830
 good to avoid this the second 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.620
 advice is that you live the present 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 forget about the future and give yourself tomorrow 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.610
 you have to go to a camp as it is 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.490
 to solve because clear and the food is 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.190
 different forget about yourself when you come back 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.190
 to work forget about when I invite you 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.470
 at a party think only about the 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.940
 next meal think about the next 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.480
 food think about how you're going to make a 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.910
 food that you find physically 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.590
 enhancer to optimize your health that 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.380
 get closer to what we know as health 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.780
 extreme and let tomorrow worry 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.540
 of himself 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.150
 obviously in some 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.560
 circumstances you are going to have to 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.859
 plan your meals so that 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.140
 transport easier to follow 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.420
 but 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.150
 that has nothing to do with being 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.010
 worrying about things that have not 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.240
 past yet they have to arrive in the 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.880
 future and that we are emotionally saturated 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.220
 it is acting is being spent will 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.990
 thinking about how you are going to be able to maintain 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.050
 this diet in the future in a future that 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.970
 has not yet happened and that will of 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.920
 someone much better using it in the 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.720
 present living the present thinking 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.880
 in the next meal thinking about how 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.770
 you're going to do your body a favor 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.319
 you are going to encourage your body how you are going to 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.170
 love your body rule number 3 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.349
 understands 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.720
 what do you have to want you have to 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.680
 have a little compassion with yourself 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.380
 you have to be a little condescending 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.599
 you have to give yourself love you have to kiss you 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.760
 from time to time and you have to understand 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.980
 that the action always exceeds the 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.600
 perfection the biggest enemy when it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.250
 start to start a lifestyle 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.860
 healthy is that many times we can not 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.330
 do it perfect and that can not do it 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.000
 perfect already demoralizes us and good as 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.680
 I can not eat organic because it's worth 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.480
 pasta or the home is super away or what 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.550
 that is because it automatically stopped 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.010
 eat healthy that is one of the greatest 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.989
 mistakes because they always eat better is 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.680
 better than eating worse another one of the mistakes 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.220
 typical related to that need 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.810
 of perfection is when we skip the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.020
 diet when we skip that style of 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.570
 life that we have chosen suddenly because 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.750
 I do not know one night you can not anymore and you 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.160
 You find yourself assaulting McDonald's 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.390
 ordering pizzas and stuffing you 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.270
 You are ivens and jerry's good 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.300
 it's okay if you understand 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.760
 same date love gas of love with 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.320
 it descends a little and understands that it is 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.030
 part of your evolution that is part of your 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.100
 progress that you sometimes make in 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.280
 instead of scourging you instead of hating you 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.820
 Instead of leaving this lifestyle 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.340
 you have chosen instead to simply 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.680
 ask yourself this is interesting what I 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.030
 what has happened to me may have happened 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.130
 led to temptation what things 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.890
 I may have reached a bit 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.410
 behave in a way that is not the 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.060
 that I have chosen and analyzes analyzes that 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.130
 day you realize you've been thinking about 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.350
 analyze the stress that has suffered and you 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.030
 you will realize that many times 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.970
 better that day your will was 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.280
 overloaded and you've had to 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.660
 understand what does this mean he wants to 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.460
 say that instead of using those 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.810
 small those little relapses like 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.430
 argument to defend your failure and 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.810
 to say I'm a failure I do not have 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.590
 nothing to do with this diet because 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.290
 look what I 've done 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.330
 instead used as a source of 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:53.270
 learning 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.789
 and finally the last rule is let 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.400
 little by little cale in your identity because 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.800
 If you follow these steps at the end of what 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.400
 it's about you becoming 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.949
 that person who do not directly eat 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.039
 processed foods for example or that 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.590
 do not eat sugar for example a times that 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:14.240
 person will be much easier for you 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.099
 do not eat sugar because it is that way 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.509
 part of your identity you will not need 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:22.639
 invest will emotional energy in 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:27.199
 preserve that habit because you're going to have 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:30.409
 emotional inertia and especially your mind 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:32.990
 subconscious is going to start being of 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.639
 I agree with you that you are really 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.370
 that kind of person that is your 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.949
 identity so you work on your 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.440
 identity works day by day and does those 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.490
 things that make you feel that you are that 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.110
 person 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.110
 do it progressively do it as you give 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.479
 he wins but the goal is that you 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.419
 make you see that you 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.590
 feel that you believe that person that you 

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:57.710
 identity starts right 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:07:00.170
 because when you actually get it you go 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.690
 to have a lot of free emotional energy 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.550
 for what you really want to do 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.920
 and not simply to preserve a 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.410
 habit of healthy life that in your case 

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.540
 it's going to be a mere matter of inertia 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:14.000
 I hope I helped you with this video if 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:17.300
 you want to continue learning to pursue 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.570
 with me this winning body full of 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.820
 extreme health energy subscribe dale 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:25.120
 I like to take care a lot and see you 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.120
 soon
