00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hello YouTube home this is jh4 dream and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.499 
hello YouTube home this is jh4 dream and
right<00:00:05.040> now<00:00:05.160> I'm<00:00:05.279> gonna<00:00:05.430> be<00:00:05.609> doing<00:00:06.180> an<00:00:06.299> unboxing

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
right now I'm gonna be doing an unboxing

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.560 
right now I'm gonna be doing an unboxing
and<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:08.069> guess<00:00:08.940> some<00:00:09.179> specifications<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.349> this

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
and I guess some specifications of this

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.910 
and I guess some specifications of this
gigabyte<00:00:12.570> Radeon<00:00:13.530> r9<00:00:13.830> 270x<00:00:14.759> graphics<00:00:15.450> card

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
gigabyte Radeon r9 270x graphics card

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.859 
gigabyte Radeon r9 270x graphics card
okay<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.010> before<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.550> open<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.090> just<00:00:18.480> want<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
okay so before I open it I just want to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.630 
okay so before I open it I just want to
show<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.260> what's<00:00:19.590> different<00:00:20.160> about<00:00:20.369> this

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
show you what's different about this

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.480 
show you what's different about this
gigabyte<00:00:21.060> model<00:00:21.180> oh<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.050> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.710> four

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
gigabyte model oh and this is the four

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.310 
gigabyte model oh and this is the four
gigabyte<00:00:23.970> version<00:00:25.039> so<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.369> gigabyte<00:00:26.760> bottle

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
gigabyte version so the gigabyte bottle

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.630 
gigabyte version so the gigabyte bottle
what's<00:00:28.320> different<00:00:28.619> about<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.580> just

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
what's different about it is it's just

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.209 
what's different about it is it's just
not<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.359> stock<00:00:30.720> design<00:00:31.040> they<00:00:32.040> have

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
not it's not the stock design they have

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.510 
not it's not the stock design they have
their<00:00:32.369> own<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.790> they<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.300> their<00:00:33.480> wind<00:00:33.690> force

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
their own and they have their wind force

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.540 
their own and they have their wind force
which<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.730> they<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.649> 380<00:00:37.649> millimeter<00:00:38.250> fans

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
which is they have 380 millimeter fans

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.830 
which is they have 380 millimeter fans
and<00:00:39.410> they<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> triangle<00:00:41.460> cool<00:00:42.270> technology

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and they have a triangle cool technology

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.470 
and they have a triangle cool technology
and<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.530> um<00:00:43.770> shapes<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.730> fins<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and this um shapes the fins of the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
and this um shapes the fins of the
heatsink<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.770> triangular<00:00:47.250> shape<00:00:47.280> to

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
heatsink in a triangular shape to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.569 
heatsink in a triangular shape to
dissipate<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> heat<00:00:48.300> more<00:00:48.809> effectively<00:00:49.020> and

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
dissipate the heat more effectively and

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.760 
dissipate the heat more effectively and
it<00:00:50.579> has<00:00:50.730> eight<00:00:51.210> millimeter<00:00:51.719> copper<00:00:52.590> heat

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it has eight millimeter copper heat

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
it has eight millimeter copper heat
pipes<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:54.059> all<00:00:54.270> helps<00:00:54.600> with<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
pipes and this all helps with the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.500 
pipes and this all helps with the
cooling<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:56.250> overclocking<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:57.360> they

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
cooling and the overclocking that they

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.060 
cooling and the overclocking that they
give<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.340> still<00:00:59.609> perform<00:00:59.850> well

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
give it so that can still perform well

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.820 
give it so that can still perform well
even<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.550> heat<00:01:02.910> or<00:01:03.359> less<00:01:04.049> heat<00:01:04.290> sorry

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
even with heat or less heat sorry

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.950 
even with heat or less heat sorry
okay<00:01:05.760> so<00:01:06.140> opening<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.380> I'll<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.960> like

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
okay so opening it up I'll just like

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.910 
okay so opening it up I'll just like
this<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:12.180> first<00:01:12.659> thing<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.439> black

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this so first thing you get this black

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.969 
this so first thing you get this black
box<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.700> gigabyte<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.590> open

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
box this is gigabyte and then you open

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.910 
box this is gigabyte and then you open
that<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.869> actual<00:01:19.290> graphics

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that and there is the actual graphics

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.899 
that and there is the actual graphics
card<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:21.600> I'll<00:01:21.900> set<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.439> aside<00:01:22.920> for<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
card so I'll set this aside for just a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.050 
card so I'll set this aside for just a
second<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:26.490> under<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> graphics

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
second and so right under the graphics

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.800 
second and so right under the graphics
card<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.409> just<00:01:28.560> get<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.950> little<00:01:29.600> spacer<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
card you just get this little spacer and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
card you just get this little spacer and
underneath<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.479> get<00:01:33.560> a<00:01:34.560> quick<00:01:35.369> guide<00:01:35.610> a

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
underneath that you get a quick guide a

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
underneath that you get a quick guide a
driver<00:01:36.360> disk<00:01:38.540> you<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.750> two<00:01:40.020> molex<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.979> 6-pin

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
driver disk you get two molex to 6-pin

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.190 
driver disk you get two molex to 6-pin
power<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.470> PCI<00:01:44.009> power<00:01:44.820> adapters<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:46.049> get

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
power or PCI power adapters and you get

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.679 
power or PCI power adapters and you get
a<00:01:46.229> crossfire<00:01:46.590> cable<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.880> that's<00:01:48.299> pretty<00:01:48.600> much

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
a crossfire cable so that's pretty much

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.330 
a crossfire cable so that's pretty much
it<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.380> what's<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> box

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it for what's in the box

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.920 
it for what's in the box
and<00:01:51.350> I'll<00:01:52.350> show<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.860> graphics<00:01:53.250> card<00:01:53.490> now

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
and I'll show you the graphics card now

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.710 
and I'll show you the graphics card now
so<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.680> get<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
so you get it in

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:12.350 
so you get it in
anti-static<00:01:58.720> bag<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.670> let's<00:02:03.700> take<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.510> out

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.980 

okay<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:15.460> actual<00:02:15.880> graphics<00:02:16.690> card

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
okay so here is the actual graphics card

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.190 
okay so here is the actual graphics card
and<00:02:17.370> first<00:02:18.370> thing<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:18.820> see<00:02:18.880> these<00:02:19.210> nice

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
and first thing you can see these nice

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.550 
and first thing you can see these nice
um<00:02:20.590> 380<00:02:21.460> millimeter<00:02:21.970> fans<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:23.260> has<00:02:23.440> this

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
um 380 millimeter fans and it has this

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.060 
um 380 millimeter fans and it has this
nice<00:02:23.830> um<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:25.510> guess<00:02:26.080> it's<00:02:26.290> plastic<00:02:26.800> you<00:02:26.980> know

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
nice um I guess it's plastic you know

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.640 
nice um I guess it's plastic you know
it's<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.370> black<00:02:27.670> plastic<00:02:27.940> shroud<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:29.470> goes

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
it's a black plastic shroud and it goes

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.560 
it's a black plastic shroud and it goes
well<00:02:29.860> with<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.400> inside<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.790> black<00:02:30.940> cases<00:02:31.360> and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
well with the inside of black cases and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.960 
well with the inside of black cases and
it<00:02:31.960> also<00:02:32.110> has<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.380> black<00:02:32.680> board<00:02:33.460> so<00:02:33.850> that's

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
it also has that black board so that's

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.320 
it also has that black board so that's
really<00:02:34.300> nice<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:36.490> this<00:02:36.610> card<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.150> gonna

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
really nice and so this card it's gonna

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.900 
really nice and so this card it's gonna
require<00:02:38.370> two<00:02:39.370> 75<00:02:40.360> watt<00:02:40.980> power<00:02:41.980> adapters<00:02:42.580> our

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
require two 75 watt power adapters our

have the cooler master 1/2 912 and it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.780 
have the cooler master 1/2 912 and it
fits<00:03:42.459> perfectly<00:03:42.910> if<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.300> just<00:03:43.570> take<00:03:43.780> out<00:03:43.959> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
fits perfectly if I just take out the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.270 
fits perfectly if I just take out the
drive<00:03:45.790> bays<00:03:46.090> so<00:03:46.480> just<00:03:47.050> make<00:03:47.200> sure<00:03:47.320> your<00:03:47.770> case

drive bays so just make sure your case
is<00:03:48.489> big<00:03:48.640> enough<00:03:48.790> for<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.209> think<00:03:49.270> it's<00:03:49.570> 11

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
is big enough for this I think it's 11

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.540 
is big enough for this I think it's 11
and<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.110> half<00:03:50.170> inches<00:03:50.470> long<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.220> it's<00:03:51.370> pretty

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
and a half inches long so it's pretty

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.380 
and a half inches long so it's pretty
big<00:03:53.190> that's<00:03:54.190> pretty<00:03:54.430> much<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.700> thanks<00:03:55.360> for
