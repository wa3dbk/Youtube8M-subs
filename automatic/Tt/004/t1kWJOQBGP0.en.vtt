00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
look hi Sheila it's a upper-mid shoe so

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.410 
look hi Sheila it's a upper-mid shoe so
it<00:00:19.980> may<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:20.189> better<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.580> ankle<00:00:20.939> protecting

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
it may be better for ankle protecting

and it's on a vulcanized sole this is a
leather<00:00:24.570> material<00:00:25.170> which<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.859> good<00:00:26.039> for

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
leather material which is good for

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.160 
leather material which is good for
skating<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.000> cost<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> select<00:00:27.810> which<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
skating it's a cost and select which is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.250 
skating it's a cost and select which is
also<00:00:28.349> vulcanized<00:00:29.420> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> Manchester

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
also vulcanized this is the Manchester

select which is a suede material which

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.030 
select which is a suede material which
is<00:00:33.329> what<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> prefer<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:34.290> skateboarding<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
is what I prefer for skateboarding and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.830 
is what I prefer for skateboarding and
it's<00:00:35.520> also<00:00:35.670> vulcanized<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> America

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it's also vulcanized this is the America

it's also vulcanized this is the America
a<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:40.170> slim<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.129> 2<00:00:41.700> cup<00:00:41.940> sole<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
a are slim and it's a 2 cup sole the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.270 
a are slim and it's a 2 cup sole the
soles<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:43.440> sew<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.710> onto<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.070> shoe

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
soles actually sew it onto the shoe

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.150 
soles actually sew it onto the shoe
rather<00:00:45.000> than<00:00:45.120> vulcanized<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:46.039> this<00:00:47.039> is

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
rather than vulcanized and this is

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.260 
rather than vulcanized and this is
probably<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> most<00:00:47.579> advanced<00:00:47.969> shoe<00:00:48.180> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
probably the most advanced shoe in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.860 
probably the most advanced shoe in
skateboarding

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
skateboarding

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.760 
skateboarding
it's<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.860> Zoom<00:00:50.250> tray<00:00:50.640> there's<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.530> hard<00:00:52.530> rubber

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it's the Zoom tray there's a hard rubber

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.529 
it's the Zoom tray there's a hard rubber
on<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> toe<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.460> which<00:00:53.610> prevents<00:00:54.000> ripping<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
on the toe so which prevents ripping and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.290 
on the toe so which prevents ripping and
in<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.039> sole<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.550> shoe<00:00:56.579> there's<00:00:57.030> active

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
in the sole of the shoe there's active

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
in the sole of the shoe there's active
titanium<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> land<00:00:59.010> primo<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.640> won't

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
titanium so if you land primo you won't

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.549 
titanium so if you land primo you won't
get<00:01:00.000> bruised<00:01:00.239> heels<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.809> bruised<00:01:01.140> arch<00:01:01.350> your

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
get bruised heels or bruised arch your

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
get bruised heels or bruised arch your
foot<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> pretty<00:01:03.059> much<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.449> advanced

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
foot so this is pretty much as advanced

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.320 
foot so this is pretty much as advanced
as<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> gets<00:01:04.409> right<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.880> I'm<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:06.030> active

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
as it gets right now I'm an active

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
as it gets right now I'm an active
shooter<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.560> tell<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> about

shooter I'm here to tell you about

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.980 
shooter I'm here to tell you about
differences<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> between<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.600> bulk<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.930> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
differences in between the bulk and I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.950 
differences in between the bulk and I
shoe<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:11.580> cup<00:01:11.790> sole<00:01:12.000> shoe<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> vulcanized

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
shoe and a cup sole shoe on a vulcanized

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.010 
shoe and a cup sole shoe on a vulcanized
shoe<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.189> glute<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.640> sole<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.780> can<00:01:15.900> see

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
shoe it's a glute on sole as you can see

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.120 
shoe it's a glute on sole as you can see
the<00:01:16.110> difference<00:01:16.409> between<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.799> two<00:01:17.100> this

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the difference between these two this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.310 
the difference between these two this
one<00:01:17.490> has<00:01:17.700> actual<00:01:18.270> stitches<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
one has actual stitches and it's a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.320 
one has actual stitches and it's a
thicker<00:01:19.560> rubber<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.880> vulcanized

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
thicker rubber this one is a vulcanized

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.149 
thicker rubber this one is a vulcanized
rubber<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> lot<00:01:22.439> softer<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.979> flexible

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
rubber so it's a lot softer and flexible

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.429 
rubber so it's a lot softer and flexible
as<00:01:24.060> compared<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.689> cuff<00:01:24.930> sole<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
as compared to this cuff sole which is

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.080 
as compared to this cuff sole which is
and<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.920> has<00:01:26.070> flex<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.549> toe<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:26.939> not

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and it has flex in the toe but not

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.080 
and it has flex in the toe but not
really<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.479> arch<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.759> difference

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
really in the arch the difference

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
really in the arch the difference
between<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.509> two<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.930> vulcanized<00:01:31.500> shoe

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
between the two is the vulcanized shoe

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.050 
between the two is the vulcanized shoe
is<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> lot<00:01:32.220> better<00:01:32.430> board<00:01:32.790> feel

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is gonna have a lot better board feel

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.149 
is gonna have a lot better board feel
and<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:33.840> gonna<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.110> more<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:35.100> gonna

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and you're gonna have more it's gonna

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.120 
and you're gonna have more it's gonna
feel<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.490> bit<00:01:35.610> comfortable<00:01:36.380> it's<00:01:37.380> gonna<00:01:37.560> wear

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
feel a bit comfortable it's gonna wear

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890 
feel a bit comfortable it's gonna wear
down<00:01:38.369> quicker<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.390> such<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> thinner

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
down quicker because it's such a thinner

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.740 
down quicker because it's such a thinner
