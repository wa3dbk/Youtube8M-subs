 the crisis make a wish make up of where you are 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:17.630
 calabria has no favorite product 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:23.189
 corrector mascara favorite color less 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.199
 pink companies of something if you fancy it 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.660
 what the seed proposes will go to 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.660
 playing with I'm proud 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 let's start by applying lumbetto that clear 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.170
 inside our eye and below 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170
 the eyebrow arch 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.530
 now we use the bronze color and the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.740
 we apply a half eyelid 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.170
 up to the outside from how you can see i 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.300
 brushes are not included in this make 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 up so we have to use our fingers and 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.750
 so each finger will be like using a 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.750
 brush from different sizes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 now we all'ombretto darker and 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.670
 obviously this is the most part 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.110
 difficult of all the mica we have to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.540
 make small pct cones says e 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.690
 then we have to fade out why 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.390
 standing on our eyelid we must 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.400
 make very light moments and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.510
 delicate so that the eyeshadow 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.490
 can form the best I have decided to 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.530
 leave you inside I almost envy you 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.920
 the whole passage cutting little 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.140
 just to let you see that it is possible 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.920
 if we commit ourselves to fade even without 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.920
 the help of pens 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.160
 so if I love then we can 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:51.840

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:53.580

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.030

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.030
