00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
any other 720p daytime shot so i just

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.870 
any other 720p daytime shot so i just
thought<00:00:46.880> i<00:00:46.910> would<00:00:47.059> do<00:00:47.450> it<00:00:47.750> out<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.110> window<00:00:48.410> now

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:48.880 
thought i would do it out the window now

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.790 
thought i would do it out the window now
yes<00:00:49.880> as<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.600> can<00:00:50.720> see<00:00:50.989> we<00:00:51.230> still<00:00:51.500> have<00:00:51.650> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
yes as you can see we still have the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.340 
yes as you can see we still have the
snow<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:52.400> it<00:00:52.489> is<00:00:52.610> thawing<00:00:52.910> out<00:00:53.320> which<00:00:54.320> is

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
snow but it is thawing out which is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.920 
snow but it is thawing out which is
quite<00:00:54.769> groovy<00:00:56.379> now<00:00:57.379> I<00:00:58.150> think<00:00:59.150> the<00:00:59.420> Panasonic

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
quite groovy now I think the Panasonic

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.680 
quite groovy now I think the Panasonic
is<00:01:00.080> actually<00:01:00.470> doing<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.800> better<00:01:00.949> job<00:01:01.269> as<00:01:02.269> far<00:01:02.480> as

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
is actually doing a better job as far as

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.149 
is actually doing a better job as far as
colors<00:01:03.050> are<00:01:03.170> concerned<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:05.980> people<00:01:06.980> have

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
colors are concerned and people have

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.750 
colors are concerned and people have
been<00:01:07.310> telling<00:01:07.520> me<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.950> indoor<00:01:10.550> low

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
been telling me that the indoor low

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.850 
been telling me that the indoor low
light<00:01:11.030> on<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.630> last<00:01:11.810> video<00:01:12.020> that<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.409> did<00:01:12.440> was

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
light on the last video that I did was

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.890 
light on the last video that I did was
better<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.310> Panasonic<00:01:13.909> which<00:01:14.150> i<00:01:14.390> think<00:01:14.450> i

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
better on the Panasonic which i think i

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.260
