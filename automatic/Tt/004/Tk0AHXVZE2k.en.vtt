lymphocyte cells helper T cells and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.709 
lymphocyte cells helper T cells and
macrophages<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:44.040> also<00:00:44.480> involved<00:00:45.480> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
macrophages are also involved this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.330

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
helper T cells are really really

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.709 
helper T cells are really really
important<00:00:47.640> here<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.940> said<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> previous

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
important here I said in the previous

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.310 
important here I said in the previous
video<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.680> gets<00:00:50.340> targeted<00:00:50.700> by<00:00:51.090> HIV<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
video these gets targeted by HIV and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
video these gets targeted by HIV and
after<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> understand<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> role<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> helper

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
after you understand the role of helper

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.189 
after you understand the role of helper
t-cells<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> start<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.070> why

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
t-cells you can start to see why

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.959 
t-cells you can start to see why
destroying<00:00:58.199> these<00:00:58.469> Y<00:00:58.739> HIV<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.460> scary<00:00:59.789> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
destroying these Y HIV is so scary and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
destroying these Y HIV is so scary and
why<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.329> rat<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.750> actually<00:01:01.109> reduces<00:01:01.559> your

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
why that rat it actually reduces your

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.609 
why that rat it actually reduces your
immune<00:01:01.980> system<00:01:02.430> pretty<00:01:02.879> badly<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:04.049> then<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
immune system pretty badly and then you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.429 
immune system pretty badly and then you
can<00:01:04.769> develop<00:01:04.949> AIDS<00:01:05.659> okay<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.960> said<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
can develop AIDS okay I said in the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080 
can develop AIDS okay I said in the
video<00:01:07.500> macrophages<00:01:08.130> basically<00:01:08.490> take<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
video macrophages basically take in the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.810 
video macrophages basically take in the
antigens<00:01:09.630> by<00:01:09.810> endocytosis<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:11.340> process

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
antigens by endocytosis they process

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.370 
antigens by endocytosis they process
them<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.240> they're<00:01:12.390> gonna<00:01:12.510> present<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:13.110> like

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
them and they're gonna present them like

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.649 
them and they're gonna present them like
trophies<00:01:14.570> on<00:01:15.570> an<00:01:16.430> MHC<00:01:17.430> protein<00:01:18.150> stands<00:01:18.450> for

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
trophies on an MHC protein stands for

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.590 
trophies on an MHC protein stands for
major<00:01:18.930> histocompatibility<00:01:20.270> complex<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> at

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
major histocompatibility complex and at

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.999 
major histocompatibility complex and at
ad<00:01:21.750> they<00:01:21.900> attach<00:01:22.170> them<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.500> these<00:01:22.619> proteins

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
ad they attach them to these proteins

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.880 
ad they attach them to these proteins
the<00:01:23.909> MHC<00:01:24.659> protein<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.290> antigen<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.710> then

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the MHC protein with the antigen is then

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.679 
the MHC protein with the antigen is then
moved<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> plasma<00:01:26.820> membrane<00:01:27.060> by

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
moved to the plasma membrane by

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.620 
moved to the plasma membrane by
exocytosis<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.250> displayed<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.240> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
exocytosis and is displayed on the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410 
exocytosis and is displayed on the
surface<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.259> macrophage<00:01:31.939> helper<00:01:32.939> T<00:01:33.150> cells

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
surface of the macrophage helper T cells

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
surface of the macrophage helper T cells
have<00:01:33.659> receptors<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.409> can<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:35.100> bind<00:01:35.340> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
have receptors that can actually bind to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
have receptors that can actually bind to
those<00:01:35.610> antigens<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> helper<00:01:37.110> T

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
those antigens and then the helper T

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.219 
those antigens and then the helper T
cells<00:01:37.500> themselves<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:38.250> actually<00:01:38.640> become

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
cells themselves can actually become

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.840 
cells themselves can actually become
activated<00:01:40.229> as<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.770> result<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.310> some<00:01:41.460> signal

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
T cell that's first step or actually if

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.780 
T cell that's first step or actually if
you<00:01:46.470> want<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> separate<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> into<00:01:47.310> two<00:01:47.579> steps

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you want to separate this into two steps

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.060 
you want to separate this into two steps
it<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.390> go<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.399> okay<00:01:51.259> now<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.530> at

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it can go like that okay now you have at

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.789 
it can go like that okay now you have at
you<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.640> activated<00:01:54.259> helper<00:01:55.259> T<00:01:55.409> cells<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
you have activated helper T cells that

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.649 
you have activated helper T cells that
are<00:01:55.950> flowing<00:01:56.130> around<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.880> macrophages

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
are flowing around there and macrophages

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.060 
are flowing around there and macrophages
that<00:01:57.990> are<00:01:58.200> holding<00:01:58.500> their<00:01:58.619> trophies<00:01:58.950> I'm

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
that are holding their trophies I'm

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.319 
that are holding their trophies I'm
going<00:01:59.310> through<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.490> really<00:01:59.640> really<00:01:59.850> fast<00:02:00.149> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
going through this really really fast so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.819 
going through this really really fast so
post<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.659> question<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.049> definitely<00:02:01.380> watch<00:02:01.500> the

post a question but definitely watch the
the<00:02:02.460> cartoon<00:02:02.939> version<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> it

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the cartoon version of it

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.990 
the cartoon version of it
hopefully<00:02:04.740> doesn't<00:02:05.009> confuse<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.460> anymore

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
hopefully doesn't confuse you anymore

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.199 
hopefully doesn't confuse you anymore
inactive<00:02:06.840> B<00:02:06.990> cells<00:02:07.489> B<00:02:08.489> cells<00:02:08.519> or<00:02:09.030> just

meanwhile these B cells are flowing

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.080 
meanwhile these B cells are flowing
around<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.250> there's<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> lot<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.670> different<00:02:11.970> B

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.210 
around and there's a lot of different B
cells<00:02:12.360> they're<00:02:12.660> all<00:02:12.810> specific<00:02:13.560> they<00:02:14.129> have

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
cells they're all specific they have

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.729 
cells they're all specific they have
different<00:02:14.580> types<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:15.000> antibodies<00:02:15.739> you're

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
different types of antibodies you're

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.710 
different types of antibodies you're
hoping<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.970> an<00:02:18.090> antibody<00:02:18.480> that

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
hoping to be have an antibody that

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.449 
hoping to be have an antibody that
actually<00:02:19.080> matches<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.530> antigen<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
actually matches the antigen of the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.100 
actually matches the antigen of the
current<00:02:21.209> invader

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
current invader

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.080 
current invader
all<00:02:22.470> right<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:22.920> inactive<00:02:23.430> B<00:02:23.610> cells<00:02:23.910> have

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
all right so inactive B cells have

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.660 
all right so inactive B cells have
antibodies<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:25.200> their<00:02:25.709> plasma<00:02:26.099> membrane

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
antibodies in their plasma membrane

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.880 
antibodies in their plasma membrane
if<00:02:26.879> these<00:02:27.450> antibodies<00:02:28.080> actually<00:02:28.260> match<00:02:28.620> an

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
if these antibodies actually match an

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.530 
if these antibodies actually match an
antigen<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> antigen<00:02:30.090> will<00:02:30.239> actually

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
antigen then the antigen will actually

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.530 
antigen then the antigen will actually
bind<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.319> antibody<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:32.450> what<00:02:33.450> will

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
bind to the antibody and what will

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
bind to the antibody and what will
happen<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.459> that's<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.700> special<00:02:36.360> B<00:02:37.290> so

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
happen is that that's your special B so

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680 
happen is that that's your special B so
that's<00:02:38.099> your<00:02:38.340> special<00:02:38.819> B<00:02:38.970> cell<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.390> has<00:02:39.569> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
that's your special B cell that has the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.110 
that's your special B cell that has the
correct<00:02:40.079> antibody<00:02:40.860> out<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.549> millions<00:02:41.970> of

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
variations that you have that has the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.009 
variations that you have that has the

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
correct antibody to actually bind with

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.100 
correct antibody to actually bind with

the current bad pathogen that is

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.229 
the current bad pathogen that is
invading<00:02:49.530> your<00:02:49.650> body<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.280> rest<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.940> the

rest of the B cells that have different

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.039 
rest of the B cells that have different
antibodies<00:02:53.130> don't<00:02:53.970> count

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
antibodies don't count

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.360 
antibodies don't count
they<00:02:55.200> can't<00:02:55.440> bind<00:02:55.680> they<00:02:55.920> can't<00:02:56.099> do<00:02:56.220> anything

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
they can't bind they can't do anything

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.809 
they can't bind they can't do anything
to<00:02:56.489> help<00:02:56.700> out<00:02:56.849> okay<00:02:58.310> yeah<00:02:59.310> there's<00:02:59.459> all<00:02:59.579> kinds

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
to help out okay yeah there's all kinds

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.819 
to help out okay yeah there's all kinds
of<00:02:59.849> analogies<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.599> use<00:03:00.780> for<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.560> so

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
of analogies you can use for this so

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.770 
of analogies you can use for this so
let's<00:03:02.220> just<00:03:02.430> move<00:03:02.549> on<00:03:02.670> with<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.000> inactivated

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
let's just move on with this inactivated

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.199 
let's just move on with this inactivated
helper<00:03:04.230> T<00:03:04.379> so<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.769> receptors<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.910> with

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
helper T so with receptors then can with

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.140 
helper T so with receptors then can with
the<00:03:06.329> same<00:03:06.769> with<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.860> same<00:03:08.130> antigen<00:03:08.400> receptor

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the same with the same antigen receptor

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.000 
the same with the same antigen receptor
to<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.359> same<00:03:09.540> antigen<00:03:09.720> binds<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> B<00:03:10.709> cell

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
to the same antigen binds to the B cell

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.129 
to the same antigen binds to the B cell
T<00:03:11.819> cell<00:03:12.030> then<00:03:12.209> sends<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> signal<00:03:12.630> over<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.019> B

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
T cell then sends a signal over to the B

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.379 
T cell then sends a signal over to the B
cell<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.680> B<00:03:13.799> cell<00:03:14.010> becomes<00:03:14.280> activated<00:03:14.760> so

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
cell and the B cell becomes activated so

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.309 
cell and the B cell becomes activated so
it's<00:03:15.600> almost<00:03:15.959> like<00:03:16.260> saying<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.790> need<00:03:18.319> several

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
it's almost like saying you need several

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.800 
it's almost like saying you need several
sources<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.920> verification<00:03:20.880> before<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.600> can

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
sources of verification before you can

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.220 
sources of verification before you can
allow<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:23.280> next<00:03:23.609> stage<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.540> happen<00:03:24.900> because

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
allow the next stage to happen because

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.990 
allow the next stage to happen because
what<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:25.530> want<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.859> do<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.250> because<00:03:26.609> we<00:03:26.760> found

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
what we want to do is because we found

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.539 
what we want to do is because we found
the<00:03:27.239> right<00:03:27.650> P<00:03:28.650> cell<00:03:28.920> that's<00:03:29.190> pretty<00:03:29.430> that's

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
the right P cell that's pretty that's

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.430 
the right P cell that's pretty that's
producing<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.239> correct<00:03:30.600> antibody<00:03:31.200> that

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
producing the correct antibody that

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.839 
producing the correct antibody that
matches<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:33.349> specific<00:03:34.349> antigen<00:03:34.859> we<00:03:35.519> want<00:03:35.760> to

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
matches the specific antigen we want to

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.809 
matches the specific antigen we want to
actually<00:03:36.269> make<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.810> make<00:03:37.620> tons<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.160> copies<00:03:38.400> of

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
actually make a make tons of copies of

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.819 
actually make a make tons of copies of
this<00:03:39.060> particular<00:03:39.599> antibody<00:03:40.049> but<00:03:40.560> we<00:03:40.650> don't

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
this particular antibody but we don't

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.099 
this particular antibody but we don't
want<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.040> waste<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.400> lot<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.700> body<00:03:42.019> resources<00:03:43.019> to

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
want to waste a lot of body resources to

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.379 
want to waste a lot of body resources to
do<00:03:43.319> that<00:03:43.500> unless<00:03:43.739> we're<00:03:44.160> totally<00:03:44.609> sure<00:03:44.880> that's

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
do that unless we're totally sure that's

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.330 
do that unless we're totally sure that's
why<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.599> helper<00:03:45.989> T<00:03:46.019> cell<00:03:46.349> actually<00:03:46.650> comes<00:03:47.130> in

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
why the helper T cell actually comes in

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.990 
why the helper T cell actually comes in
so<00:03:47.730> even<00:03:48.419> if<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> antibody<00:03:49.410> has<00:03:49.680> has<00:03:50.310> AZ<00:03:50.669> bound

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
so even if the antibody has has AZ bound

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.699 
so even if the antibody has has AZ bound
to<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.299> antigen<00:03:51.599> if<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.380> don't<00:03:52.560> have<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
to the antigen if you don't have a

actually picked up the same signal then

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.300 
actually picked up the same signal then
you're<00:03:58.349> not<00:03:58.470> going<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.709> be<00:03:58.799> able<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:59.069> produce

here I start to divide by mitosis and

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.629 
here I start to divide by mitosis and

form a clone of cells we call this
clonal<00:04:22.240> selection<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:23.350> cells<00:04:23.620> get<00:04:23.830> bigger

of these well why do we want all these
extra<00:05:03.130> antibodies<00:05:03.610> well<00:05:04.060> if<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.210> have<00:05:04.330> a

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
extra antibodies well if you have a

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.730 
extra antibodies well if you have a
whole<00:05:04.539> bunch<00:05:04.720> of<00:05:04.750> these<00:05:04.870> antibodies<00:05:05.440> since

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
whole bunch of these antibodies since

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.920 
whole bunch of these antibodies since
they<00:05:05.919> bind<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.520> the<00:05:06.610> antigen<00:05:06.729> they'll<00:05:07.599> just

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
they bind to the antigen they'll just

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.790 
they bind to the antigen they'll just
spread<00:05:08.860> through<00:05:09.340> your<00:05:10.210> blood<00:05:11.199> system<00:05:11.650> and

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
spread through your blood system and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.800 
spread through your blood system and
bind<00:05:12.310> to<00:05:12.759> the<00:05:12.910> antigen<00:05:13.030> of<00:05:13.389> all<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:13.599> bad<00:05:13.780> guys

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
bind to the antigen of all the bad guys

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.899 
bind to the antigen of all the bad guys
it's<00:05:14.349> like<00:05:16.110> sending<00:05:17.110> out<00:05:17.440> all<00:05:17.710> what<00:05:18.669> is<00:05:18.759> it

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
it's like sending out all what is it

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:20.670 
it's like sending out all what is it
it's<00:05:19.060> like<00:05:19.210> tagging<00:05:19.630> a<00:05:19.690> bad<00:05:19.870> guy<00:05:20.050> with<00:05:20.110> arrows

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
it's like tagging a bad guy with arrows

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.700 
it's like tagging a bad guy with arrows
so<00:05:21.159> you<00:05:21.220> have<00:05:21.639> these<00:05:21.789> big<00:05:22.060> clumsy<00:05:22.710> trolls

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
so you have these big clumsy trolls

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.800 
so you have these big clumsy trolls
going<00:05:24.130> around<00:05:24.400> who<00:05:24.699> are<00:05:24.789> just<00:05:25.000> big<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.300> smash

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
going around who are just big and smash

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.129 
going around who are just big and smash
everything<00:05:26.050> smash<00:05:26.800> smash<00:05:27.490> but<00:05:28.270> they<00:05:28.870> smash

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
everything smash smash but they smash

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.330 
everything smash smash but they smash
everything<00:05:29.590> but<00:05:29.770> you<00:05:29.919> want<00:05:30.070> to<00:05:30.130> make<00:05:30.220> it

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
everything but you want to make it

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.999 
everything but you want to make it
easier<00:05:30.669> for<00:05:30.699> them<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.030> know<00:05:31.990> what<00:05:32.199> to<00:05:32.349> smash<00:05:32.650> so

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
easier for them to know what to smash so

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.450 
easier for them to know what to smash so
the<00:05:33.099> antibodies<00:05:33.729> are<00:05:33.909> like<00:05:34.120> little<00:05:35.460> sticky

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
the antibodies are like little sticky

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.879 
the antibodies are like little sticky
notes<00:05:36.669> or<00:05:37.000> arrows<00:05:37.599> or<00:05:37.960> arrows<00:05:38.289> with<00:05:38.560> sticky

notes that say attack me and the arrows

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.290 
notes that say attack me and the arrows
stick<00:05:41.620> into<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.860> bad<00:05:42.099> guys<00:05:42.340> and<00:05:42.610> then<00:05:43.060> if

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
stick into the bad guys and then if

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.930 
stick into the bad guys and then if
you're<00:05:43.810> a<00:05:43.840> big<00:05:44.080> troll<00:05:44.349> going<00:05:45.039> around<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:45.729> you

you're a big troll going around and you

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.779 
you're a big troll going around and you
see<00:05:46.180> a<00:05:46.930> bunch<00:05:47.680> of<00:05:47.800> things<00:05:48.070> with<00:05:48.370> arrows<00:05:48.759> and

see a bunch of things with arrows and

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.420 
see a bunch of things with arrows and
sticky<00:05:49.389> notes<00:05:49.599> you<00:05:50.380> can't<00:05:50.590> read<00:05:50.860> but<00:05:51.130> you<00:05:51.159> see

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
sticky notes you can't read but you see

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.339 
sticky notes you can't read but you see
arrows<00:05:51.759> and<00:05:51.909> sticky<00:05:52.210> notes<00:05:52.419> and<00:05:52.750> for<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.139> that

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
arrows and sticky notes and for you that

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.170 
arrows and sticky notes and for you that
means<00:05:53.530> Hulk<00:05:54.460> smash

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
means Hulk smash

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.300 
means Hulk smash
and<00:05:55.300> so<00:05:55.690> these<00:05:55.840> trolls<00:05:56.110> go<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.650> identify<00:05:56.830> so

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
and so these trolls go and identify so

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.550 
and so these trolls go and identify so
the<00:05:57.490> antibodies<00:05:57.969> help<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.330> identify<00:05:58.690> and

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
the antibodies help to identify and

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.300 
the antibodies help to identify and
target<00:05:59.919> what<00:06:00.669> it<00:06:00.789> is<00:06:00.909> that<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:02.310> phagocytes

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.310 
target what it is that the phagocytes

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.189 
target what it is that the phagocytes
and<00:06:03.610> macrophages<00:06:04.090> have<00:06:04.599> to<00:06:04.719> go<00:06:04.870> and<00:06:05.050> actually

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
and macrophages have to go and actually

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:09.450 
and macrophages have to go and actually
attack<00:06:06.190> I<00:06:07.199> hope<00:06:08.199> that<00:06:08.349> made<00:06:08.500> sense<00:06:08.530> I<00:06:08.979> should

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
attack I hope that made sense I should

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.570 
attack I hope that made sense I should
do<00:06:09.699> another<00:06:10.380> cartoon<00:06:11.380> I<00:06:11.680> wasn't<00:06:12.490> really

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
do another cartoon I wasn't really

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.070 
do another cartoon I wasn't really
cartoon<00:06:12.969> I<00:06:13.060> should<00:06:13.270> do<00:06:13.360> another<00:06:13.570> one<00:06:13.840> with<00:06:13.960> the

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
cartoon I should do another one with the

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.720 
cartoon I should do another one with the
whole

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
whole

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.080 
whole
okay<00:06:15.090> let<00:06:15.240> me<00:06:15.330> write<00:06:15.420> that<00:06:15.480> down<00:06:16.520> okay<00:06:17.520> I<00:06:17.730> think

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
okay let me write that down okay I think

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.720 
okay let me write that down okay I think
that<00:06:18.810> is<00:06:19.110> pretty<00:06:19.590> good<00:06:19.800> a<00:06:19.860> few<00:06:20.190> last<00:06:20.430> steps

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
that is pretty good a few last steps

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.000 
that is pretty good a few last steps
here<00:06:21.000> in<00:06:21.150> the<00:06:21.270> end<00:06:21.420> we<00:06:21.600> have<00:06:21.780> memory<00:06:22.230> cells

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
here in the end we have memory cells

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.210 
here in the end we have memory cells
some<00:06:23.460> of<00:06:23.550> those<00:06:23.670> B<00:06:23.940> cells<00:06:23.970> get<00:06:24.480> leftover<00:06:25.220> B

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
some of those B cells get leftover B

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.410 
some of those B cells get leftover B
cells<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:26.520> T<00:06:26.640> cells<00:06:26.760> and<00:06:27.090> they're<00:06:27.240> called

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.420 
cells and T cells and they're called

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.980 
cells and T cells and they're called
memory<00:06:27.690> cells<00:06:27.960> this<00:06:28.560> is<00:06:28.740> the<00:06:28.860> basis<00:06:29.220> of<00:06:29.370> how

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
memory cells this is the basis of how

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.170 
memory cells this is the basis of how
immunity<00:06:30.990> works<00:06:31.200> so<00:06:31.650> once<00:06:31.980> you<00:06:32.430> have<00:06:32.670> actually

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
immunity works so once you have actually

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.960 
immunity works so once you have actually
spent<00:06:33.420> all<00:06:33.600> this<00:06:33.720> energy<00:06:34.190> making<00:06:35.190> a<00:06:35.280> clone<00:06:35.580> of

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
spent all this energy making a clone of

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.330 
spent all this energy making a clone of
the<00:06:36.600> correct<00:06:36.900> B<00:06:37.110> cells<00:06:37.410> containing<00:06:38.010> the

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
the correct B cells containing the

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.430 
the correct B cells containing the
correct<00:06:39.060> antibodies<00:06:39.660> for<00:06:39.810> that<00:06:39.960> particular

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
correct antibodies for that particular

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.320 
correct antibodies for that particular
invader<00:06:40.980> maybe<00:06:41.340> with<00:06:41.520> chickenpox

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
invader maybe with chickenpox

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.750 
invader maybe with chickenpox
well<00:06:42.600> they<00:06:42.810> stick<00:06:43.410> around<00:06:43.530> a<00:06:43.980> few<00:06:44.520> of<00:06:44.640> them

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
well they stick around a few of them

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.610 
well they stick around a few of them
stick<00:06:45.030> around<00:06:45.150> well<00:06:45.450> enough<00:06:45.480> so<00:06:46.260> the<00:06:46.380> next

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
stick around well enough so the next

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.380 
stick around well enough so the next
type<00:06:46.800> of<00:06:46.830> chickenpox<00:06:47.250> shows<00:06:48.000> up<00:06:48.240> the

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:48.390 
type of chickenpox shows up the

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.830 
type of chickenpox shows up the
chickenpox<00:06:48.690> virus<00:06:49.020> shows<00:06:49.380> up<00:06:49.850> you<00:06:50.850> can<00:06:51.150> launch

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
chickenpox virus shows up you can launch

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.020 
chickenpox virus shows up you can launch
an<00:06:52.320> immune<00:06:52.740> response<00:06:52.890> really<00:06:53.460> really<00:06:53.760> fast

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
an immune response really really fast

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.220 
an immune response really really fast
because<00:06:54.360> you<00:06:54.480> already<00:06:54.600> have<00:06:54.870> a<00:06:54.900> high

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
because you already have a high

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:56.870 
because you already have a high
concentration<00:06:55.620> of<00:06:55.980> the<00:06:56.100> correct<00:06:56.340> antibody

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
concentration of the correct antibody

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.700 
concentration of the correct antibody
that's<00:06:57.300> how<00:06:57.540> it<00:06:57.660> works<00:06:57.870> it's<00:06:58.320> really<00:06:58.530> really

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
that's how it works it's really really

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.530 
that's how it works it's really really
interesting<00:06:58.820> and<00:06:59.820> it<00:06:59.940> makes<00:07:00.060> a<00:07:00.120> lot<00:07:00.270> of<00:07:00.300> sense

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
interesting and it makes a lot of sense

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.050 
interesting and it makes a lot of sense
so<00:07:01.230> these<00:07:01.410> memory<00:07:01.710> cells<00:07:01.740> to<00:07:02.190> ground<00:07:02.550> allow

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
so these memory cells to ground allow

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.260 
so these memory cells to ground allow
for<00:07:03.300> rapid<00:07:03.660> response<00:07:04.080> they<00:07:04.410> give<00:07:04.620> long<00:07:04.860> term

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 
for rapid response they give long term

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.290 
for rapid response they give long term
immunity<00:07:06.270> to<00:07:06.690> these<00:07:07.560> diseases<00:07:08.030> okay<00:07:09.030> it

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 
immunity to these diseases okay it

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.790 
immunity to these diseases okay it
should<00:07:09.360> all<00:07:09.690> make<00:07:09.870> sense<00:07:10.110> it's<00:07:10.380> really<00:07:10.590> really

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
should all make sense it's really really

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.470 
should all make sense it's really really
interesting<00:07:11.190> it's<00:07:11.820> actually<00:07:12.060> a<00:07:12.270> lot<00:07:12.450> more

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
interesting it's actually a lot more

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.840 
interesting it's actually a lot more
complex<00:07:13.110> than<00:07:13.440> this<00:07:13.620> but<00:07:13.950> so<00:07:14.400> is<00:07:14.580> everything

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:14.850 
complex than this but so is everything

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.370 
complex than this but so is everything
else<00:07:15.030> we<00:07:15.270> learned<00:07:15.450> in<00:07:15.600> biology<00:07:15.780> when<00:07:16.260> you

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 
else we learned in biology when you

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.930 
else we learned in biology when you
learn<00:07:16.590> it<00:07:16.710> at<00:07:17.070> different<00:07:17.250> levels<00:07:17.670> and<00:07:17.790> people

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
learn it at different levels and people

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.870 
learn it at different levels and people
are<00:07:18.210> doing<00:07:18.420> more<00:07:18.600> more<00:07:18.990> research<00:07:19.440> this<00:07:20.250> what

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 
are doing more more research this what

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.400 
are doing more more research this what
we've<00:07:21.000> gone<00:07:21.180> through<00:07:21.240> today<00:07:21.630> is<00:07:21.660> sufficient

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
we've gone through today is sufficient

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.140 
we've gone through today is sufficient
