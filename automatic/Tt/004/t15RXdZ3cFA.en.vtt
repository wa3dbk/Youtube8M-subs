00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.339
 hi i am done this is a caring 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.079
 Today's huge oscar sculptor 12 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:22.109
 on the cloud only the comic lines 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.970
 I think it's good to know who the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.369
 sport in the canopy a cloud is one of the largest 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.400
 defenders of the comic as art 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.439
 and literary form by only the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.590
 funny thing is that he never did much 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.150
 His comic copyright or worked for 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.150
 no major publishing house of his 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.240
 I imagined none of it as I know it 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.010
 only produced the series just ti and he is 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.810
 famous even by technology is still 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.230
 No encomex that already left here in Brazil. 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.170
 how to let comics reinvent the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.990
 Comics of the American edition and my 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.480
 Preferred to draw comics that 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.670
 2006 that for me is the best by far and 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.650
 sac are for me the best books 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.190
 theorists comics market 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 and or interesting of them is that they do not 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.700
 are books written not only a format 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.790
 stoned are in the meta format 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.400
 even if it is designed by explaining what 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.409
 he means at the moment it is for more than 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.510
 the second horrible volume on the hip 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.580
 similar for updated shadows because 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.409
 was made in the internet boom 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.229
 at the end of the 1990s and in the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.510
 beginning of the 2000s is Volume 1 and Volume 3 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.520
 so she considers very very good 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.350
 especially if you ever 3 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.760
 you intended to write mark or intend to 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.340
 understand more about the graphic narrative 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.200
 and if the book were a drawing in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.080
 comics who cares more I 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.580
 I leave the link for you to read to you is 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.229
 a work that has them here in Brazil 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.700
 because I think it's worth a lot 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.010
 mainly volume December 3 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.890
 comic already has realized that 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.020
 central theme of the video I did not even know 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.790
 it that this year the newspaper was 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.830
 producing the one who sent the link was a 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.860
 My friend and I woke up on a Saturday 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.600
 night and I would not be that the 40 had 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.970
 left an autoral comic discounted 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.950
 This is the teacher's clause and I had 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.899
 what to buy at the time I bought in amazon 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.090
 even arrived very fast with full 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.160
 Saturday morning arrived on Tuesday and 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.750
 it was not the guaratinguetÃ¡ it was not cheap 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.890
 Yes, but I honestly think it's worth it. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.390
 price I paid because it has more 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.170
 500 pages is the hard cover has the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.020
 cover that I'm even going to take 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.540
 here to make this video and the story 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.680
 his is basically the following a guy 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.180
 here about 25 years 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.290
 called 2020 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.940
 he is a failed sculptor and begins to 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.610
 with him in a diner and 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.610
 depressed the birthday and to 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.770
 Harry appears and he starts beating a 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.940
 chat and also the baby time to time 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.620
 to start there 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.110
 The last time I had I 'm the love. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.390
 You're dead and his uncle talks to 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.620
 he what if he wants 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.170
 at dawn he will have the gift and if he 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.520
 want to use this gift it will have 200 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.220
 days to enjoy it after that 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.640
 He's going to die and he understands the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 Team them some they aimÃ©e my peak 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.220
 jaca still had some some some 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.370
 working meetings of a meeting with 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.800
 a woman who was the one to see the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.580
 sculptures of him but nothing more 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.620
 and in the way of that it is approached by 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.850
 a crowd that everyone was 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.890
 looking at him so saying that much 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:35.610
 weird and weaves a girl is with wings 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.990
 with the lights of the show as well as 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.940
 give a kiss to him, say everything will stay 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.250
 well and he already starts to think he's crazy 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.640
 he imagined it all still here 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:47.220
 it's crazier in his head and when 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.540
 dawn he discovers that he has the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.850
 power to manipulate any material 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.720
 be sugar myth with your hands as if 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.209
 it was gila consumption so and he has 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.520
 another point with his uncle that harry and him 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.870
 ask what you are useless needed 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.970
 and he said that he will actually use 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.260
 this gift is going to take 200 days to 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.270
 take advantage of this 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.480
 before him die clear way knows 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:19.470
 a girl is changing the perspective 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.940
 He will pass on until he will discover the 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.580
 that he can do with his hands power and 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.440
 is it going to stay there and really 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.490
 I find a very original story very 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.680
 very captivating left I'm afraid of them 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.210
 and all in one day and it looks like I had to 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.620
 do a lot here at the bank had in 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.720
 college did not have it all at once 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.479
 It was only very good to read. 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.699
 first because his narrative is very 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:42.250
 very fluid and even interesting 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.110
 for those who read the day walking in the design 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.360
 comics before everything that you 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.060
 learned about native you will see in 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:55.000
 practice here the pressures the framework 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:57.940
 is the beginning of the comic showing the o 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.069
 scenery before for environmental reader everything 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.830
 that you will you you will be able to see 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:06.030
 here using it and really use a 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.770
 very good way this American edition 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.009
 left this year, including 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.370
 to my best new playlist that 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.750
 every time there is more and only by force 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.539
 it is a story that our lot 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.750
 good there was his dysfunction etc 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:25.030
 and I do not see a near future where 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.470
 Brazil is in want is wrong 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.539
 really think it would be amazing that 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.070
 go out by comic strip 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:36.550
 and if you are seeing here in the company 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.729
 of the lyrics of the audio format because 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.139
 I think it would be a way frame 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.000
 To launch in Brazil this does not want 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.479
 wait to see if maybe the skirt 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.310
 Brazil has the discretion to amazon arrives 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.969
 I quickly think I only have three top runners 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.409
 over there 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.000
 well worth it was one of the best 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.949
 with the best pictures that this year 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.659
 I think this is what you read. 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.490
 only in the cloud do you want to read if 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.050
 this is April is a month that I still 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.550
 I did not find anyone who has read 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.979
 discount I want to talk to someone about 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.340
 This I will let the comments knock. 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:08.610
 a conversation in the brain and that the next 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.610
 turn
