delay pedal how you get something like a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.720 
delay pedal how you get something like a
1960s<00:01:00.090> Johnny<00:01:00.420> Cash<00:01:00.690> sound<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.829> I'll<00:01:02.460> start

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
1960s Johnny Cash sound so I'll start

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:24.970 
1960s Johnny Cash sound so I'll start
off<00:01:02.820> dry

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.650 

real<00:01:25.640> quick<00:01:25.790> let's<00:01:25.970> take<00:01:26.120> a<00:01:26.150> look<00:01:26.330> at<00:01:26.450> delay

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
real quick let's take a look at delay

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.900 
real quick let's take a look at delay
number<00:01:26.930> one<00:01:27.080> using<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.650> tube<00:01:28.250> screamer<00:01:28.550> and<00:01:28.790> a

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
number one using a tube screamer and a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.250 
number one using a tube screamer and a
phaser<00:01:29.150> and<00:01:29.420> we'll<00:01:29.510> do<00:01:29.600> some<00:01:29.750> tapping<00:01:29.990> and

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
phaser and we'll do some tapping and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.620 
phaser and we'll do some tapping and
showing<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:30.590> how<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.890> adds<00:01:31.300> depth<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.420> your

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
showing you how that adds depth to your

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:51.110 
showing you how that adds depth to your
tapping<00:01:33.260> sound

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.640 

okay<00:01:52.120> let's<00:01:52.300> take<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.479> look<00:01:52.720> at<00:01:52.840> delay<00:01:53.380> number

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
okay let's take a look at delay number

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.890 
okay let's take a look at delay number
two<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:53.950> middle<00:01:54.190> delay<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:55.479> use<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> tube

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
two the middle delay we use a tube

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.660 
two the middle delay we use a tube
screamer<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.530> then<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.740> will<00:01:57.070> start<00:01:57.490> with<00:01:57.610> a

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
screamer and then I will start with a

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.250 
screamer and then I will start with a
dry<00:01:57.940> signal<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.450> then<00:01:58.540> kick<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> delay<00:01:59.110> in

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
dry signal and then kick the delay in

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:26.490 
dry signal and then kick the delay in
for<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.500> effect<00:01:59.740> so<00:02:00.250> let's<00:02:00.280> have<00:02:00.729> a<00:02:00.790> listen

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.050 

taking<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.560> look<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.950> third<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.670> longest

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
taking a look at the third and longest

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.240 
taking a look at the third and longest
delay<00:02:29.210> I've<00:02:29.750> got<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.050> set<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.319> two<00:02:30.500> seconds<00:02:31.010> and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
delay I've got to set to two seconds and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.309 
delay I've got to set to two seconds and
a<00:02:31.280> feedback<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.270> set<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.600> almost<00:02:32.870> infinite

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
a feedback is set to almost infinite

00:02:33.319 --> 00:03:23.000 
a feedback is set to almost infinite
repeats<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.000> little<00:02:35.270> ditty<00:02:35.420> Angie

the<00:03:24.010> rv3<00:03:24.340> has<00:03:24.850> digital<00:03:25.300> reverb<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.930> addition

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
the rv3 has digital reverb in addition

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.890 
the rv3 has digital reverb in addition
to<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.100> delay<00:03:27.370> I'm<00:03:28.150> going<00:03:28.390> to<00:03:28.480> show<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.630> all
