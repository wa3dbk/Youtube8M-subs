worked out perfectly with this
particular<00:01:11.360> flavor<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> has<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
particular flavor because it has a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
particular flavor because it has a
little<00:01:13.049> clicky<00:01:13.320> pieces<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> bottom<00:01:14.010> and

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
protein powder it's gonna be a little

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.570 
protein powder it's gonna be a little
bit<00:02:28.680> thicker<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.130> you're<00:02:29.220> gonna<00:02:29.310> have<00:02:29.460> to

bit thicker and you're gonna have to
work<00:02:29.790> with<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.330> little<00:02:30.360> bit<00:02:30.720> longer<00:02:31.880> but<00:02:32.880> you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
work with it a little bit longer but you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.580 
work with it a little bit longer but you
can<00:02:33.120> make<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.480> exact<00:02:33.780> same<00:02:33.810> way<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.350> add

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
can make it the exact same way just add

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.690 
can make it the exact same way just add
you<00:02:34.800> know<00:02:34.920> one<00:02:35.100> or<00:02:35.220> two<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.400> good<00:02:35.520> for<00:02:35.640> your

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
you know one or two is good for your

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.970 
you know one or two is good for your
protein<00:02:35.910> powder<00:02:36.920> okay<00:02:37.920> now<00:02:38.220> I'm<00:02:38.520> going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.150> add

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
protein powder okay now I'm going to add

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
protein powder okay now I'm going to add
my<00:02:40.980> milk<00:02:41.040> my<00:02:41.700> almond<00:02:42.120> milk<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:44.340> my<00:02:44.520> glass<00:02:45.330> my

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
my milk my almond milk to to my glass my

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.920 
my milk my almond milk to to my glass my
mom<00:02:46.050> got<00:02:46.410> there<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:46.890> background<00:02:47.780> okay

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
mom got there in the background okay

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.930 
mom got there in the background okay
I'm<00:02:49.050> only<00:02:49.260> adding<00:02:49.530> half<00:02:49.920> I'm<00:02:50.370> filling<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:50.880> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
I'm only adding half I'm filling in a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.090 
I'm only adding half I'm filling in a
pathway<00:02:51.209> with<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> almond<00:02:52.200> milk<00:02:52.350> it<00:02:52.650> comes<00:02:52.980> up

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
pathway with the almond milk it comes up

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.350 
pathway with the almond milk it comes up
a<00:02:53.190> little<00:02:53.340> bit<00:02:53.490> be<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> little<00:02:53.940> bit<00:02:54.090> more<00:02:54.209> than

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
a little bit be a little bit more than

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.880 
a little bit be a little bit more than
half<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.140> protein<00:02:55.590> ought<00:02:55.800> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
half because the protein ought to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.320 
half because the protein ought to
protein<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.459> form<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.760> one<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
protein but the form the one is on the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.500 
protein but the form the one is on the
bottom<00:02:57.780> I'm<00:02:58.680> gonna<00:02:58.830> add<00:02:59.070> half<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> milk

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
bottom I'm gonna add half of the milk

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.199 
bottom I'm gonna add half of the milk
any<00:03:01.500> type<00:03:01.860> of<00:03:01.890> milk<00:03:02.220> into<00:03:02.370> your<00:03:02.520> skim<00:03:02.820> milk<00:03:03.060> or

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
any type of milk into your skim milk or

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.730 
any type of milk into your skim milk or
you<00:03:03.330> can<00:03:03.420> do<00:03:03.510> almond<00:03:03.870> milk<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.350> then<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:04.620> just

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
you can do almond milk and then I'm just

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.470 
you can do almond milk and then I'm just
gonna<00:03:04.950> make<00:03:05.220> sure<00:03:05.280> my<00:03:05.490> top<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.180> really

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
gonna make sure my top is on really

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.220 
gonna make sure my top is on really
really<00:03:06.810> nice<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.020> secure<00:03:07.590> really<00:03:07.860> tight<00:03:09.230> and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
really nice and secure really tight and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.170 
really nice and secure really tight and
then<00:03:10.440> I'm<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.740> going<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.040> shake<00:03:13.220> I'm<00:03:14.220> shaking

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
then I'm just going to shake I'm shaking

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.440 
then I'm just going to shake I'm shaking
up<00:03:15.390> my<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:17.370> know<00:03:17.489> my<00:03:17.519> sugar<00:03:17.910> cover<00:03:18.180> really

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
up my you know my sugar cover really

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.360 
up my you know my sugar cover really
really<00:03:18.840> well<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.440> it<00:03:19.769> gets<00:03:19.920> really<00:03:20.100> nice<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
really well so it gets really nice and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.160 
really well so it gets really nice and
it<00:03:20.640> makes<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.940> doesn't<00:03:21.239> take<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:21.660> long<00:03:21.720> like

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
it makes it doesn't take that long like

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.780 
it makes it doesn't take that long like
literally<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.590> takes<00:03:22.830> maybe<00:03:23.100> about<00:03:23.430> 30

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
literally it takes maybe about 30

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.449 
literally it takes maybe about 30
seconds<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.540> shaking<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:26.220> get<00:03:26.370> the
