00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:06.249
 hello very good everyone here I am from 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.629
 young thousand on my server on my own 

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:09.040
 server yes sir 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.230
 and is that I have ridden has served the 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.150
 hardware a jalisco server I hope that 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.219
 it seems like it's hardcore that if you die 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.590
 dies and that this server that is 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.320
 skill officially on Saturday 21 of 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.109
 June the first season and we're going 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.840
 there are two weeks so there are 15 days left 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.240
 there is very little time left 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.369
 didactic basically the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.110
 characteristics base of the tau premium is 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.610
 say while the pirates though 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.460
 Latin America buying account 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.379
 anyone happens to go into 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.379
 same is more resists and a password and 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.610
 again then password we go for 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:52.180
 register again and it is worth the following 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.770
 who alternated prize does not mean that if 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.680
 you can enter with another account 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.449
 because it does not configure in such a way that 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.879
 you can only enter with an account 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.390
 with the computer or that cheating but 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.230
 also says that for 1.7 points and that 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.510
 the wait you have the description 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.140
 over here in the video down here 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.950
 surely right here down below 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 There is a lot of description on my feet 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.570
 Now I will explain how to go out into the world 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.210
 normal then well you appear here 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.520
 for the first time in space can see 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.920
 the rules that are quite short do not 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.920
 you can do nothing here but only 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.660
 some coordinates tool 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 authority 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.659
 we also can not have here 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.850
 totally random his opinion and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.369
 extension in the world 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.950
 they do not appear too far with apparent 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.000
 It is advisable to take wood for 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.149
 do the work of ice and I'm also going to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.780
 completing a series is measured to win 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.209
 this hardcore season if you die I'll 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.250
 I'm going to try to die as obviously 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:12.390
 is hardcore when I die because JCE 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.950
 you will die is automatically dead that 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.920
 will pull from the server 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.299
 that you can enter after one hour 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.540
 have died as he did here now 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.980
 there are 59 minutes left but after a 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.620
 time that passed the death you can already 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.110
 enter orange time don giovanni goes to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.120
 dying is pretty little because two 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 servers are a day or two days or by 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.590
 there and this server is only one 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.660
 time for another very important thing is 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.569
 that I put the plugins that do not 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.000
 allow hurts do not allow anti-extract 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.370
 and nothing, so you always choose or 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.400
 any way it is to do 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.400
 traps that you know not to leave 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.840
 I also put a command that 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.780
 it remains undeformed if a player 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.650
 hit and after hitting t 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:07.470
 put 40 37 40 for the tactic that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.720
 the maternal mountain lands your things if 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.360
 do you do that since there are 40 then 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.550
 it happened so for now guayas and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.610
 you die that is also not 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:23.220
 allowed is worth the achievements and for that if 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.739
 we complete 16 by any site by 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.160
 twitter skype by the server or by 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:34.130
 youtube that you can perform and it was a 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.130
 photo with a video to show on this 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.920
 between the four diamonds 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.940
 the circus get it is interprofessional 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.050
 and memory is this getting five 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.000
 emeralds 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.440
 then number seven to get a stack 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.730
 of carrot 64 and the number 81 advanced 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.730
 of blocks is here 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.060
 It is worth mentioning and he is the one who wins the 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:20.100
 this season that has calculated the 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.170
 foolish your best and the server and that 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.880
 let's go the thing is simple to speak now the 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.190
 table on the right of the screen a 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.020
 score word and I have two players left 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.090
 more people have killed for one each 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.310
 season the player who more people are 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.480
 call everyone to fire who wins and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:41.110
 good he did is not premium 1.7 points 2 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.960
 the hyena had under my feet and he 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.540
 opens on June 21 on Saturday we 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.540
