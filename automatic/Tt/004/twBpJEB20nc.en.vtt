00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:10.389
 explain about the classic ninja about 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.690
 the formations and all the basics that 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.610
 they should learn about this game 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.050
 here you have for the messages that 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.660
 they will always be always receiving 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.160
 check the ones that are going to receive here 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.010
 all the prizes and all always 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.600
 select everything to receive so that 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.030
 have all the prizes that always 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.200
 send anything and everything 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.719
 that is finally we are going to start them from 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.890
 the novices so they know what 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.600
 They have to do 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.280
 To begin with, I'm going to explain a 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.200
 little bit about the formations here 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.620
 they will always have the ninjas who will 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.449
 have to play go always go 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.489
 choosing your team well and all that 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.489
 according to the effects or fourth any 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.260
 thing they need to play here 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.320
 they have all the items I have the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.110
 xolos and tend on youtube 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.790
 also so much of the threads that the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.860
 character that he had chosen there is not much 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.120
 difference between them sectors like 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.310
 way that they throw the powers is 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.190
 different but almost always the effects 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.040
 to the same or mostly the majority of 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.230
 the initial effects 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 here they have the vanguard to this one always 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.780
 they are going to always put him is the one 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.700
 will receive all the principal damages or 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.360
 the basic damage there are effects too 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.090
 that go directly towards him in order to him 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.400
 they will always have it always going to be 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.430
 so unfair that means that being or 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.150
 in illustrated using once all those who 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.610
 use kubrick and ok unÃ¡is always go to 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.290
 do on youtube 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.110
 forced the options that are going to have going to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.880
 have are for I know that that is the attack 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.040
 main so they know what point 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.650
 have to put him in the options by 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.280
 example here I already took that is my 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.930
 vanguard has power and docter blocking 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.369
 usually for those who go Vanguard 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.670
 they have to always put those options 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.700
 so that endurance have life write in 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.450
 finish 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.599
 what are the children or also equal 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.910
 options are always going to be for being according to 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.769
 whatever you put your character for 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.440
 example mine I put it critique choose 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.370
 together with force the not to have for not 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.370
 fail and paste more 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.650
 another option would be those of 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.230
 yosu that are those of supports are those that 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.550
 they almost always go back that's all the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.560
 James character that you are going to have 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.760
 he is the only one who will be in line 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.280
 assault for which he would use the option 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.290
 all farm using scroll is 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.780
 they always have to put the option of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.870
 chakra attack and there they go combining 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.019
 with what they need 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.569
 here I put mine the options 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.040
 power chacra reviews in the options in 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.780
 every part of the armor is always going to 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.780
 vary because they are not all the same 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.420
 the training are going to be always going to 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.500
 act assault and support 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.350
 what are the help 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.170
 I already explained how or what options 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.490
 they have to put the vanguard at 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.800
 days something that always almost always 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.000
 put any much back cylinder head that 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.250
 critical is because they are the best 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.510
 options to paste those of those 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.490
 ports always have to put you 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.620
 agility so that it will always be the 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.050
 first in making their movements their 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.350
 attack since they only defect about 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.120
 all that are of cures as with a 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.160
 that the evils that for you already 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.160
 unlock or level 90 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.380
 this was an explanation of the 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.070
 ninja formations that are going to have 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.070
 during the game
