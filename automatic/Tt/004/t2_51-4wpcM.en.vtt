 hi girls as they are today we are going to knit 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.250
 dot network this is the right side of the 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.710
 woven the wrong side 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.260
 the traffic along with the explanation how 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.260
 you have to knit it I'll leave it posted 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.540
 on my page in my blog lincoln 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.240
 find down this video in the box 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.570
 of information 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.500
 this is the graphic the motive has 4 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.480
 points that is multiple to 4 we weave the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 first round 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 we weave these points before the motive 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.100
 we weave the motive we repeat the motive 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.350
 as many times as necessary and the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.990
 back with these points after the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.050
 motive in all the laps are woven 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.000
 and like the number 1 return in the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.450
 even twists we weave how are we 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.330
 present the knitted stitches we weave with 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.350
 the point backwards here are also 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.500
 indicated the points of the edge 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.229
 well let's weave a sample to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.700
 this we assemble 13 points I'm going to weave a 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 sample alone we assembled 13 points back 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.760
 number 1 we passed a point is to integrate from 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.200
 one needle to the other 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.060
 the hoe 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.610
 we passed two points without knitting 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.610
 we weave a point to the right 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.180
 and now we slide the two points that do not 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.560
 we wove 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.560
 over the knitting 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.710
 the fairies 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.870
 next to the right 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.460
 the hoe 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:55.580
 again we passed two points without knitting 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.730
 we weave a point to the right 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.200
 we slide the colon 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.590
 that we have not 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.659
 over the knitting 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.100
 in this way we weave three points' 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:13.310
 together 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:17.520
 thrown next to the right the hoe 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.050
 we passed two points without knitting 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.050
 one point to the right 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.340
 we slip the two points that we do not weave 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.910
 over the knitting 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.420
 lassad to last point of the edge what 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.760
 we weave aggressions 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.670
 turn number 2 is weaved as we are 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.250
 present the points 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.190
 first point we had it without knitting this 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.390
 is the point of the laced edge we weave with 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.390
 the air point once 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.750
 together upside down we weave it upside down 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.810
 loop with the added point or the 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.500
 even twists all the points are us 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.500
 present 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.640
 as the points upside down so 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.640
 we knit all the stitches upside down 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.450
 Loop also upside down 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.019
 return number 3 return number 5 7 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.890
 etc. is woven the same as the 1 or the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:35.090
 return number 3 we weave the same as the 1 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:39.860
 we passed a point without knitting lazada 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:43.280
 we passed two points without knitting 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.340
 next to the right we slide the two 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.970
 points we said about the point 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.840
 tissue 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.550
 pass 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.300
 next to the right the hoe 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:59.010
 we passed two stitches without knitting 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.440
 straight 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.400
 we slip the two points that we do not weave 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.400
 over the knitting 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:13.790
 next to the right the hoe 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.870
 We spent two points without knitting to 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.579
 straight 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.419
 we slip the two points that we do not weave 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.780
 over knitted stitch lacing point at 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:27.669
 reverse row number four is woven with 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.250
 all points upside down return number 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:34.660
 five knits just as we chose freshly 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:37.050
 1 and 3 at the end is this reason 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.050
 A) Yes 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.280
