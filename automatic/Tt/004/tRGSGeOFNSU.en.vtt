00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
some ways and then its base sets are bad

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.729 
some ways and then its base sets are bad
at<00:00:35.940> all<00:00:36.120> especially<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.809> special<00:00:37.170> next<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.620> is

150<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.360> its<00:00:39.510> speed<00:00:39.899> stat<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.590> terrible<00:00:41.219> this

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
150 but its speed stat is terrible this

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.299 
150 but its speed stat is terrible this
thing<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.879> extremely<00:00:42.570> slow<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.129> move

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
thing is extremely slow so this the move

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979 
thing is extremely slow so this the move
said<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.700> gave<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.300> thing<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
said I gave for this thing because I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.270 
said I gave for this thing because I
thought<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.739> wasn't<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> be

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
thought that it wasn't going to be

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.549 
thought that it wasn't going to be
usable<00:00:47.789> if<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.600> really<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.020> not<00:00:49.469> going

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
usable if it was really just not going

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.750 
usable if it was really just not going
to<00:00:49.649> have<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> toy<00:00:49.920> scarf<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.399> thought<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.670> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
to have a toy scarf I thought it was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.900 
to have a toy scarf I thought it was
just<00:00:50.940> gonna<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.149> too<00:00:51.390> slow<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.620> um<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> gave

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
just gonna be too slow so um what I gave

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.520 
just gonna be too slow so um what I gave
this<00:00:54.180> thing<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.020> give<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.320> thing<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this thing was I give this thing a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
this thing was I give this thing a
choice<00:00:55.770> car<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> pick<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.610> speak<00:00:56.879> due<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
choice car to pick you to speak due to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.260 
choice car to pick you to speak due to
special<00:00:57.600> tech<00:00:58.160> that<00:00:59.160> way<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> believe<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.090> gets

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
special tech that way I believe it gets

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
special tech that way I believe it gets
around<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.550> 393<00:01:02.570> speed<00:01:03.570> if<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.960> not

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
around to like 393 speed if I'm not

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.140 
around to like 393 speed if I'm not
correct<00:01:04.619> by<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.860> way<00:01:05.040> those<00:01:05.220> those<00:01:05.610> speed

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
correct by the way those those speed

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.670 
correct by the way those those speed
stats<00:01:06.450> I<00:01:06.600> show<00:01:06.750> before<00:01:06.930> those<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.320> based<00:01:07.470> sets

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
stats I show before those are based sets

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.590 
stats I show before those are based sets
talking<00:01:08.010> about<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> actual<00:01:08.520> stat<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.000> think

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
talking about the actual stat I think

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.920 
talking about the actual stat I think
with<00:01:09.720> Troy<00:01:09.930> scarf<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.380> gets<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.770> around<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.250> 393

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
with Troy scarf it gets it around to 393

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.060 
with Troy scarf it gets it around to 393
which<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> pretty<00:01:13.890> good

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
which would you know be a pretty good

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.640 
which would you know be a pretty good
regular<00:01:14.460> stat<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:16.020> chose<00:01:16.200> like

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
regular stat and then I just chose like

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.230 
regular stat and then I just chose like
three<00:01:16.950> moves<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> filler<00:01:17.759> move<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.180> the

filler move can be on HP really be

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.080 
filler move can be on HP really be

know<00:01:40.259> low<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> lot<00:01:40.920> more<00:01:41.130> information<00:01:41.960> but<00:01:42.960> this

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
know low a lot more information but this

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.630 
know low a lot more information but this
is<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> move<00:01:43.799> said<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.159> would<00:01:44.310> give<00:01:44.430> him

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
is the move said I would give him

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.639 
is the move said I would give him
because<00:01:44.970> hyperspace<00:01:45.570> hole<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.560> good

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
because hyperspace hole is a very good

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.039 
because hyperspace hole is a very good
move<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.700> psychic<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.750> especially

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
move it is psychic it especially

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
offensive it goes through a lot of

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.649 
offensive it goes through a lot of
things<00:01:51.780> including<00:01:52.110> protect<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.159> detect<00:01:53.670> so

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
if you're trying to protect it goes

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.870 
if you're trying to protect it goes

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
ghost move why not go for that Focus

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.219 
ghost move why not go for that Focus
Blast<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.540> know<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:03.899> just

just helpful and then like I said the
filler<00:02:10.679> move<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.069> really<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.430> anything<00:02:11.700> just

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
filler move can really be anything just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.750 
filler move can really be anything just
like<00:02:12.660> upon<00:02:13.050> your<00:02:13.230> choosing<00:02:13.470> right<00:02:14.100> now<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> see

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
like upon your choosing right now I see

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.580 
like upon your choosing right now I see
really<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.420> only<00:02:15.540> useful<00:02:15.780> filling<00:02:16.410> roofs

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
really the only useful filling roofs

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.640 
really the only useful filling roofs
could<00:02:16.800> be<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.160> hidden<00:02:17.489> power<00:02:17.730> or<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.900> thunderbolt

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
could be a hidden power or a thunderbolt

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.350 
could be a hidden power or a thunderbolt
or<00:02:19.800> an<00:02:19.950> engine<00:02:20.220> energy<00:02:20.850> ball<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.239> that's

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
or an engine energy ball and that's

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.570 
or an engine energy ball and that's
really<00:02:21.540> about<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.860> other<00:02:23.040> move<00:02:23.280> said<00:02:23.489> I

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
really about it the other move said I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.280 
really about it the other move said I
thought<00:02:23.730> about<00:02:23.880> giving<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.270> thing<00:02:24.330> was

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
thought about giving this thing was

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.890 
thought about giving this thing was
maybe<00:02:25.500> just<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:25.950> call<00:02:26.220> mindset<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.060> mean<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.720> know

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
maybe just a call mindset I mean I know

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.170 
maybe just a call mindset I mean I know
the<00:02:28.290> thing<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.590> slow<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.459> might<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.850> want<00:02:30.120> to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
the thing is slow you might not want to

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.000 
the thing is slow you might not want to
do<00:02:30.360> for<00:02:30.630> HP<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.290> might<00:02:31.500> want<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.770> go<00:02:31.860> with

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
do for HP you might want to go with

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.290 
do for HP you might want to go with
something<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.459> bit<00:02:32.640> more<00:02:32.790> bulkier<00:02:33.270> than

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
something a little bit more bulkier than

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.520 
something a little bit more bulkier than
that<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.750> you're<00:02:33.810> gonna<00:02:33.930> do<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> coma

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
that if you're gonna do for a coma

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.260 
that if you're gonna do for a coma
because<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.280> said<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.670> thing<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:35.970> slow

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
because like I said this thing is slow

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.509 
because like I said this thing is slow
it<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.690> not<00:02:36.900> very<00:02:36.959> fast<00:02:37.319> at<00:02:37.530> all<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.340> lot<00:02:38.489> of

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
it is not very fast at all and a lot of

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.400 
it is not very fast at all and a lot of
things<00:02:38.850> are<00:02:39.150> going<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.450> up<00:02:39.569> speeding<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.140> so

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
things are going to be up speeding it so

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.979 
things are going to be up speeding it so
um<00:02:41.190> that's<00:02:41.700> just<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.060> sudden<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.480> thought<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.870> I

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
um that's just a sudden I thought of I

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.270 
um that's just a sudden I thought of I
couldn't<00:02:43.230> really<00:02:43.350> think<00:02:43.470> of<00:02:43.680> anything<00:02:44.040> else

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
couldn't really think of anything else

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.130 
couldn't really think of anything else
that<00:02:44.550> was<00:02:44.760> really<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.630> be<00:02:45.720> usable

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that was really going to be usable

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.590 
that was really going to be usable
except<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.590> choice<00:02:46.800> car<00:02:47.040> set<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.940> um<00:02:48.300> yeah

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
except for the choice car set so um yeah

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.640 
except for the choice car set so um yeah
we<00:02:48.720> don't<00:02:48.840> know<00:02:48.959> what<00:02:49.110> hoop<00:02:49.230> is<00:02:49.350> gonna<00:02:49.500> come

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
we don't know what hoop is gonna come

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.690 
we don't know what hoop is gonna come
out<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.860> all<00:02:49.950> they<00:02:50.130> have<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.370> said<00:02:50.580> anything

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
out and all they have not said anything

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.660 
out and all they have not said anything
about<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.360> aureus<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:51.989> only<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:53.130> three

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
about it and aureus is only like three

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.300 
about it and aureus is only like three
or<00:02:54.030> four<00:02:54.060> months<00:02:54.390> away<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:55.050> they<00:02:55.980> better<00:02:56.160> get

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
or four months away so they better get

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.030 
or four months away so they better get
on<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.459> quickly<00:02:57.260> because<00:02:58.260> obviously<00:02:58.440> Hoopa

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
on that quickly because obviously Hoopa
