00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello I am creative virginia of the 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.090
 brand of Corsican wedding dresses and 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.679
 dael today we'll see 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.080
 how to choose her wedding dress 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.540
 function of its silhouette in the spotlight 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
 big and small 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.830
 ladies you measure 1m 80 and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.010
 more for you no contraindications 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.359
 you can wear very dresses 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.060
 long as close-fitting dresses 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:33.329
 however I would like to avoid the dresses 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.309
 of empire style cutting under the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.079
 chest will lengthen your legs and create 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.180
 unsymmetrical asymmetry 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 in addition if you have a stature 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
 androgynous 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.750
 this will create a cylinders effect so 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.550
 for you no contraindications you 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 can wear almost all the dresses 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 try to wear dresses 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.379
 with cutouts at the hips 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.149
 this will harmonize your stature and for 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.329
 the damsels of small size like 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.750
 me one meter sixty barely especially the 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.920
 avoid dresses too wide they go 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.010
 you shrink the skirt too many years 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.479
 create a small imbalance 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.390
 you can play the trompe l'oeil in 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.200
 choosing an empire style dress that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 will lengthen your legs but you can 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.930
 also choose a dress more fluid see 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 a sheath dress attention in this case 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.850
 the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 be careful that your 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 dress flares out at the bottom and that this 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.400
 event starts above the knee this 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.369
 are just small tips but who 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.420
 to render you great services 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.119
 that was how to choose her dress from 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.680
 married according to his stature if you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.630
 are big or small 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.640
 but do not forget that the choice of dresses 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.880
 bridal is above all a choice shot 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880
 of heart
