pounds<00:00:25.939> current<00:00:26.939> weight<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.529> 91.4<00:00:28.529> kilos<00:00:28.949> and

pounds current weight is 91.4 kilos and

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640 
pounds current weight is 91.4 kilos and
that's<00:00:29.820> around<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.720> hundred<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> half

pounds so everything's on track and
doing<00:00:34.559> well<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.980> mentioned<00:00:35.520> well<00:00:36.149> I've

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
doing well I mentioned well I've

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
doing well I mentioned well I've
actually<00:00:36.420> mentioned<00:00:36.809> quite<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> few<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.410> a

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
actually mentioned quite a few in a

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.319 
actually mentioned quite a few in a
quite<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> few<00:00:38.010> previous<00:00:38.489> videos<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.149> I'm

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
quite a few previous videos that I'm

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
quite a few previous videos that I'm
looking<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.660> transitioning<00:00:40.290> off<00:00:40.530> than<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
looking at transitioning off than what I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.340 
looking at transitioning off than what I
need<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> do<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.600> interesting<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:43.110> spent

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
need to do and it's interesting I spent

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.670 
need to do and it's interesting I spent
some<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.559> yesterday<00:00:43.920> researching<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.850> end

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
some time yesterday researching this end

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.959 
some time yesterday researching this end
it<00:00:46.680> seems<00:00:47.010> pretty<00:00:47.219> well<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.489> worst<00:00:47.520> thing<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
it seems pretty well the worst thing you

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.340 
it seems pretty well the worst thing you
could<00:00:48.149> do<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.390> you've<00:00:48.510> been<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> long<00:00:49.050> juice

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
could do if you've been on a long juice

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
could do if you've been on a long juice
fast<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:50.789> start<00:00:51.090> eating<00:00:51.210> normally

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
fast is to just start eating normally

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.369 
fast is to just start eating normally
because<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.850> gather<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.449> actual

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
because what I can gather the actual

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.520 
because what I can gather the actual
stomach<00:00:55.770> quotes<00:00:56.730> or<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:57.149> digestive<00:00:57.989> fluids

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
stomach quotes or these digestive fluids

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
stomach quotes or these digestive fluids
wanted<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> better<00:00:59.070> term<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.640> know<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> thing

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
wanted a better term you know the thing

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.720 
wanted a better term you know the thing
that<00:01:00.059> actually<00:01:00.270> helps<00:01:00.660> helps<00:01:01.079> with<00:01:01.260> digestion

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
that actually helps helps with digestion

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.709 
that actually helps helps with digestion
because<00:01:02.730> you've<00:01:02.850> been<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> juice<00:01:03.270> fast<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
because you've been on a juice fast it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
because you've been on a juice fast it
hasn't<00:01:03.989> had<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> lot<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.040> last<00:01:05.250> one<00:01:05.519> what

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
hasn't had a lot to do the last one what

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.730 
hasn't had a lot to do the last one what
case<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> last<00:01:06.390> 49<00:01:06.720> days<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.439> course

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
case the last 49 days because of course

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.230 
case the last 49 days because of course
the<00:01:07.950> juice<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.220> pretty<00:01:08.580> more<00:01:08.729> ready<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.150> and

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the juice is pretty more ready to go and

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420 
the juice is pretty more ready to go and
ready<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.600> absorbed<00:01:09.930> by<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> body<00:01:10.430> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
ready to be absorbed by the body it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.530 
ready to be absorbed by the body it
hasn't<00:01:11.700> had<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.030> much<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.420> way<00:01:12.450> of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
hasn't had to do much in the way of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
hasn't had to do much in the way of
digestion<00:01:12.930> at<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.799> body<00:01:14.220> actually

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
digestion at all so the body actually

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.520 
digestion at all so the body actually
apparently<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:15.119> backs<00:01:15.810> off<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.229> terms<00:01:16.409> of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
apparently back backs off in terms of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.740 
apparently back backs off in terms of
production<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.070> these<00:01:17.189> digestive<00:01:17.909> um<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.450> think

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
production of these digestive um I think

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.850 
production of these digestive um I think
it's<00:01:18.840> enzymes<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.470> sure<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
it's enzymes I'm not sure that's the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.050 
it's enzymes I'm not sure that's the
correct<00:01:20.040> wording<00:01:20.400> I'm<00:01:20.640> certainly<00:01:20.880> not<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
correct wording I'm certainly not a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.200 
correct wording I'm certainly not a
doctor<00:01:21.270> but<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.680> anyway<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.580> buses<00:01:24.119> say

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
doctor but but anyway the the buses say

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
doctor but but anyway the the buses say
the<00:01:24.299> body<00:01:24.479> does<00:01:24.689> back<00:01:24.930> off<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the body does back off on that and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.969 
the body does back off on that and
doesn't<00:01:26.400> produce<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.850> many<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.979> consequently

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
doesn't produce as many so consequently

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
doesn't produce as many so consequently
from<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.490> get<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.790> layer<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.540> your

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
from what I can get the layer on your

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.980 
from what I can get the layer on your
stomach<00:01:31.140> isn't<00:01:32.180> sort<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> coated<00:01:33.720> with<00:01:33.810> these

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
stomach isn't sort of coated with these

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.980 
stomach isn't sort of coated with these
digested<00:01:34.560> from<00:01:35.030> fluids<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.659> just<00:01:36.750> put

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
digested from fluids so if you just put

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.090 
digested from fluids so if you just put
normal<00:01:37.290> food<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.650> then<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.920> back<00:01:37.950> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
normal food and then you go back to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
normal food and then you go back to
eating<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.790> normal<00:01:39.030> diet<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.689> full<00:01:40.439> on

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
digestive function that's probably one

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.240 
digestive function that's probably one
of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> better<00:01:54.420> term<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.619> do<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.890> gently

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
so what for I can read it some some

so what for I can read it some some
small<00:02:00.000> amounts<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.450> fruits<00:02:00.659> some<00:02:01.500> vegetable

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
couple of days and just to gradually get

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.760 
couple of days and just to gradually get
back<00:02:05.850> into<00:02:06.030> our<00:02:06.479> normal<00:02:06.840> eating<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.590> going

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
back into our normal eating so I'm going

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.869 
back into our normal eating so I'm going
to<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.920> doing<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.550> from<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:08.759> I've

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
to be doing that I think from what I've

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.650 
to be doing that I think from what I've
read<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.390> going<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.599> be

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
read now it's going to be

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.970 
read now it's going to be
vegetable<00:02:11.660> smoothies<00:02:12.080> now<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.650> course<00:02:12.680> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
vegetable smoothies now of course the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.260 
vegetable smoothies now of course the
difference<00:02:13.280> between<00:02:13.370> smoothies<00:02:14.090> and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
difference between smoothies and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.450 
difference between smoothies and
deducing<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> juicing<00:02:15.620> removes<00:02:15.950> pretty<00:02:16.310> well

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
deducing the juicing removes pretty well

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.360 
deducing the juicing removes pretty well
Oh<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> lot<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.750> bulk<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:18.200> fiber<00:02:18.470> there

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
Oh a lot of the the bulk of fiber there

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.040 
Oh a lot of the the bulk of fiber there
are<00:02:19.460> is<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.760> smoothie<00:02:20.240> you<00:02:20.300> put<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.600> too<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.020> a

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
are is a smoothie you put that too in a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.290 
are is a smoothie you put that too in a
blender<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.620> you're<00:02:22.490> just<00:02:22.610> blending<00:02:23.030> up<00:02:23.150> the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
blender and you're just blending up the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.390 
blender and you're just blending up the
entire<00:02:23.540> fruit<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:24.170> berries<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.770> water<00:02:25.130> and

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
entire fruit and berries of water and

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.950 
entire fruit and berries of water and
perhaps<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.820> ice<00:02:26.000> cubes<00:02:26.330> or<00:02:26.450> whatever<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:26.810> is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
perhaps the ice cubes or whatever it is

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.780 
perhaps the ice cubes or whatever it is
so<00:02:27.650> you're<00:02:27.800> actually<00:02:27.920> getting<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.430> volcker

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
so you're actually getting the volcker

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.970 
so you're actually getting the volcker
it<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.000> it's<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.210> lot<00:02:29.330> thicker<00:02:29.600> but<00:02:30.350> because

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
it so it's a lot thicker but because

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.830 
it so it's a lot thicker but because
it's<00:02:31.130> sort<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.400> partially<00:02:32.030> digested<00:02:32.150> already

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
it's sort of partially digested already

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.630 
it's sort of partially digested already
or<00:02:33.050> not<00:02:33.200> not<00:02:33.440> digested<00:02:33.980> partially<00:02:34.490> broken

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
or not not digested partially broken

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.820 
or not not digested partially broken
down<00:02:35.000> i<00:02:35.030> should<00:02:35.300> say<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:36.140> not<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.380> much<00:02:36.530> work

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
down i should say it's not as much work

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.730 
down i should say it's not as much work
for<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.160> body<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:38.200> actually<00:02:39.200> break<00:02:39.380> it<00:02:39.560> down

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
for the body to actually break it down

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.920 
for the body to actually break it down
and<00:02:40.040> then<00:02:40.550> going<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.820> do<00:02:40.970> have<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.450> bit<00:02:41.630> of<00:02:41.690> light

little bit weird and you have to

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.060 
little bit weird and you have to
question<00:03:59.900> why<00:04:00.080> other<00:04:00.350> animals<00:04:00.709> aren't<00:04:00.920> doing

that<00:04:01.190> so<00:04:01.850> I'm<00:04:02.180> going<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.480> ignore<00:04:02.660> um<00:04:03.730> dairy<00:04:04.730> and

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
that so I'm going to ignore um dairy and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:05.949 
that so I'm going to ignore um dairy and
I<00:04:05.030> wouldn't<00:04:05.209> have<00:04:05.300> been<00:04:05.390> able<00:04:05.480> to<00:04:05.630> do<00:04:05.750> that<00:04:05.780> if

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
I wouldn't have been able to do that if

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.470 
I wouldn't have been able to do that if
I<00:04:06.020> hadn't<00:04:06.260> started<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.620> juice<00:04:06.800> fast<00:04:07.040> because

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480

mentioned this in an earlier video that

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.440 
mentioned this in an earlier video that
some<00:05:19.040> of<00:05:19.160> those<00:05:19.250> areas<00:05:19.670> were<00:05:20.120> a<00:05:20.150> cause<00:05:20.420> for

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
some of those areas were a cause for

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.390 
some of those areas were a cause for
concern<00:05:20.810> when<00:05:21.350> I<00:05:21.380> first<00:05:21.650> did<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:21.950> blood<00:05:22.190> test

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
concern when I first did this blood test

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.190 
concern when I first did this blood test
which<00:05:22.550> was<00:05:22.700> before<00:05:23.090> I<00:05:23.390> start<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:23.990> juice

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
which was before I start of the juice

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.220 
which was before I start of the juice
fast<00:05:24.440> so<00:05:25.130> I'm<00:05:25.190> very<00:05:25.280> very<00:05:25.700> very<00:05:25.820> pumped<00:05:26.810> up<00:05:27.050> to

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230
