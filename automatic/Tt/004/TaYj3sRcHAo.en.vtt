00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 the good urban transport alternative 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.710
 solution for health and the environment 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.750
 environment if the old bike already 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.019
 offered all this but with the effort 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.570
 imagine the bike itself 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.500
 the vehicle has been regulated 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
 on the other hand 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.910
 the national transit council in 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.420
 London has become an object of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.240
 desire of many drivers in the streets. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.340
 traffic is chaotic and tends to worsen 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.059
 according to data from the London detran 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.190
 today has almost 350 thousand vehicles 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.860
 It takes a lot of patience to face 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.160
 the traffic jams to try to reverse 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.170
 this scenario so they to escape the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 stress, many people are opting for 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.079
 electric bikes that fell in grace and 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.420
 They only come looking very 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.820
 all interested there are more workers and 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.610
 in more people too to do right 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.010
 but the national council of 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.260
 transit the counter produced a 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.899
 resolution and now these bikes 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.330
 can only be sold with 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.630
 some adaptations like these here look 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.470
 with mirrors 11 on each side of this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.590
 siren 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.590
 the speedometer and flags that are 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.930
 ahead in another here behind and also 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.790
 a relief on the side 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.090
 on the wheels and of course the helmet all this 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.270
 to ensure the safety of the rider. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.579
 350 watt motor makes this bike here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 reach 25 kilometers per hour 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.200
 but still in accordance with the resolution 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.210
 this electric bicycle can not have a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.140
 accelerator in the hand as it happened 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 previously 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.659
 that's where the so-called pedal 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.329
 watch and it means that her engine alone 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.100
 turns on after the drive through the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.140
 cyclist's pedals 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.689
 You started pedaling. He has a sensor. 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
 that goes in the pedals that gave touch that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.729
 help you bike drive you 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.360
 help human strength and the issue of 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.479
 motor 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.210
 the battery is recharged in the outlet it has 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.520
 autonomy of up to 60 kilometers is not 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.310
 I need a driver's license for 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.190
 pedaling even with the electric motor 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 and this new generation of bikes influences 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.209
 directly on health and the environment 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.120
 the consequence and then the question of 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.920
 pollution is that one is it 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.769
 totally out of the question of position 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.930
 electrical energy and it 's just the 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.560
 only benefits the future of the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.870
 children and is helping nature 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.700
 in londrina the simplest models of the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.849
 motorized bicycle can be 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.790
 found for about two thousand reais 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:48.360
 the national transit council have 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.269
 have sought alternatives so that this 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.620
 chaotic traffic that we have in our 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:59.540
 large cities has minimized this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.250
 stress that is you are driving a vehicle 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.190
 automotive 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.190
 but what is missing is respect for 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.250
 legislation and traffic education 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.060
 why do you ride your bike today? 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.609
 between the cars and the bike she has 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.320
 that circulate in the bearing 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.780
 the Brazilian traffic code where 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.250
 despite the Brazilian traffic code 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.720
 down there he says that the bicycle 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.329
 she has to be respected by the 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:36.000
 driver as well as respecting the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:39.269
 pedestrian because because in the spirit of the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.690
 law when the elevator built this 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.760
 this legislation he understood and so 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.889
 has to be that the weaker part in the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:53.310
 process is the pedestrian is the cyclist and a 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.329
 motorcycle in relation to the vehicle in 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.440
 relation to the car 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:01.920
 so imagine the way our 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.900
 driver is an offender and the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.400
 numbers are there for anyone to see the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.380
 Brazilian driver does not like to be 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.440
 fined he commits traffic violation 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.139
 the fine we do not commit 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.019
 irregularity in transit and yields 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.650
 filmed and recorded and then he blames himself 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.289
 from whom 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.330
 the military police who mutated put the blame 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.190
 in the traffic agent very of course not 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.139
 I'm talking about the exception that have 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.509
 pilasters too 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.419
 based of we have the bastards 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:33.900
 fantasies of police officers and that 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.120
 they mess with 11 driver they mess with 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.659
 drivers hiding that whole thing 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.180
 without making the role the role of 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:45.389
 one of the public servant who is 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.550
 the agent of transit but of rule commits 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:50.669
 violation and then attempts to 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.499
 justification for not paying as 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.759
 Unfortunately, he is a Brazilian driver. 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:55.979
 has this culture 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:05:00.719
 we would have to first go through 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:02.669
 throughout the recycling process create a 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:06.900
 different awareness that DERSA 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:09.689
 exists and then create the bicycle paths 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.000
 In London we have very few 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.159
 that they have are limited and so we 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.419
 we might have a little traffic 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.419
 better than this
