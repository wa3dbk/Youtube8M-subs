00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.590
The Earth and its movements.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.930
The Earth is the third planet from the Sun,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.500
and it has a unique characteristic that no

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.489
other planet we know has: 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.460
it’s the only one that has life on it

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Life of all types,

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.380
plants and animals...

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.330
Its average temperature is 15 degrees Celcius,
and because our planet also has water and

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.510
an atmosphere... it is the perfect place for
life.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.000
Like other planets of the solar system, the
Earth moves in two different ways: one is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.940
called rotation... and the other is called
revolution.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.840
Rotation is the movement of the Earth on its
own axis. Rotate means to turn. So, the Earth

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.440
turns around a slightly-inclined imaginary
line that joins the two poles, called the axis.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.240
Do you know how long it takes to make
a complete turn?.. It takes 24 hours to make

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.840
one rotation... Think about it for a second:..

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.700
One day, day and night

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.700
together, lasts 24 hours too. So the movement
of rotation causes day and night. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
Interesting, right?

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.120
Now let's see the movement of revolution...

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.550
As you can see in the pictures, the Earth
goes around the Sun in an elliptical orbit.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.770
That might sounds a little strange... but
if you look... you’ll see it is simply the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.960
journey that the Earth makes around the Sun...
Do you know how long it takes the Earth to

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.980
make a complete revolution around the sun?
Well, it takes... 365 days... Exactly – one year!..

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.400
This revolution movement is what makes the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:28.380
spring, with its colorful flowers... the hot
summer, full of fun... the autumn, when leaves

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.530
fall from the trees to the ground... and the
cold and frosty winter.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.700
So let’s remember the 2 kinds of movement
that the Earth makes.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.120
There is rotation, which is the Earth turning
around itself... causing day and night...

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.640
which lasts exactly 24 hours, the same as
a whole day.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.240
And there is revolution, which is the earth
travelling around the sun... which takes 365

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.299
days and causes the seasons.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.720
So, now you know the movements of the Earth.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.260
