00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 On the most remote island of Korea 

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.001
 There are men who should prepare their own meals. 

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:18.002
 An island in which every kind of food can be seen. 

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.003
 Here, all the dreams of a housewife can be fulfilled. 

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.004
 Clean sea water with soaking pails. 

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.005
 Without going to town. 

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.006
 All we need is a fishing net. 

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:48.007
 Oh you want to eat me? 

00:00:51.008 --> 00:00:54.008
 Even food can be found on the floor. 

00:00:55.009 --> 00:01:02.009
 If it snows in heaven ... 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 it will be ... 

00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.011
 What the hell is that... 

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:13.012
 wow !! 

00:01:13.013 --> 00:01:18.013
 The wind can fly off the ground. 

00:01:19.014 --> 00:01:21.014
 How was today... 

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:25.015
 Prince of Asia under attack ... 

00:01:26.016 --> 00:01:29.016
 I'm afraid he's a clue about my future. 

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:31.017
 Oh no! 

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:32.018
 What will we eat? 

00:01:35.019 --> 00:01:37.019
 Sweet potato ... 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.020
 Let us use the supplies that we have kept to connect us in this famine. 

00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:43.021
 Wasn't it supposed to be fish to catch in the ocean? 

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:45.022
 Why the Great Oceans? 

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:46.023
 Why are the great oceans so comprehensive? 

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:49.024
 At least one or two of them. 

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:54.025
 What's the reason for the fire's burning? 

00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:59.026
 Satisfied swine or unsatisfied Socrates is good? 

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:02.027
 Pig ... who's satisfied? 

00:02:02.528 --> 00:02:03.028
 You? 

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:06.029
 I ... satisfied ... pig 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 What, you want to try hunger? 

00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:10.031
 I'm Dom-rates. 

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:22.032
 I can't do without a pig. 

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:27.033
 and also without Socrates! 

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:31.034
 Coming, coming! Fishing rod twisted! 

00:02:31.035 --> 00:02:32.035
 Winter ... be self-sufficient on the island! 

00:02:32.036 --> 00:02:34.036
 What? is this eel (eel)? 

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:35.237
 Eel? The eel? 

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:48.238
 Could they be a full Socrates?
