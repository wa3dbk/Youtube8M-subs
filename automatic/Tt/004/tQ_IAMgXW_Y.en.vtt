00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.830
 after four wins and 18 0 points 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.650
 the foxes have a draw 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.359
 which satisfy the opinions and the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.919
 first point of the season 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.329
 while she managed in the 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.250
 Cover as we do 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.750
 we have long presented them 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.180
 then have driven before us 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.970
 still another gate was cashed 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.730
 not was not smart enough 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.900
 I also believe in the gates over the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.489
 counter-attack that is ours 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.470
 Retreat behavior was not the best 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.280
 we get some goals by rebounding 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.859
 that means we have the ball 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.820
 supposedly already won and start 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.750
 then either too early partly 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.070
 dimensions the necessary luck and that in 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.829
 The sum is just too much left 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.899
 a few hundred percent off and then 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.100
 The Berliners started in time 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.890
 better into the game 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.490
 sven sÃ¶ren christophersen with the 5 to 2 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.679
 after just under six minutes the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.050
 guests from messages could always 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.140
 again shorten alexandros vasilakis 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.850
 with the 10 to 9 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.649
 but the foxes always had first 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.530
 An answer ready and built the 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.259
 distance again on three goals from romero 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.549
 14 to 11 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.530
 sneaking towards the end of the first half 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.500
 However, some unfocused 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.259
 plays in the berliner and the mt used 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.180
 this xbox jonathans up the way 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.770
 christian hildebrandt 14 14 and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.990
 melsungen put it on top 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.250
 The half-time whistle meets NENAD 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.469
 vuckovic to 15 was break was to 16 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.390
 the decisive phase was the first half 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.070
 very clear 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.800
 come forward 5 2 led 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.090
 Actually I think we have everything in it 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.670
 handle and on 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.220
 then we think okay how can it work? 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 Take our automatic pilot home 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.869
 the two points 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.310
 So the sad thing goes in half two were 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.119
 it now the guests from the hessen the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.459
 vorlegten 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.590
 the landlords were able to join their 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.750
 keeper silvio heinevetter thank you 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.560
 here you with some strong parades 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.959
 in the game 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.239
 but not much wanted to succeed in the front 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.130
 and even the simple gates did not fall 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.600
 Well, of course, if we get away from that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.739
 our plays then takes it counts 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.320
 also not good and I think so too 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.530
 wars many counter attacks to 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.290
 easy witnesses nevertheless fought for us 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.340
 the foxes return the lead 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.489
 Christoffers are with another 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.860
 his ten goals for 22 to 21 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.750
 but Berlin did not let melsungen 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.130
 pulling away played his attacks 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.930
 patiently and went back in front 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.550
 it was again the kristofferson 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.480
 about a minute before closing for the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.040
 The final score was 27:27 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.360
 Result 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.280
 we also have to oppose doping here too 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.049
 home shown when we are not so present 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.400
 then fight then we are behind and 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.110
 against what four goals today knows 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.760
 actually only two gates 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.260
 but then sometimes that happens 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.810
 be fast out then you will not come 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.610
 back and then I think so yes 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.200
 we have lost a point but has 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.819
 also 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.020
 a little undeservedly a point 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.849
 brought on today I believe 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.730
 Acting actually has better 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.010
 We played that small high again 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.629
 fight ran with us and where it actually 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.310
 looks pretty good too but how is it ? 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.500
 quickly the steam out again and the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.360
 message then again supposedly 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.400
 easy goal and that is easy for us 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.090
 do not happen that are partial 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.650
 partial concentration partially 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.849
 voting problems that's easy then 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.130
 annoying and then always brings 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.870
 back out next to the ninth 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.360
 game day game of foxes 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.580
 found on Wednesday also parts of the 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.349
 fourth matchday place 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.079
 At the same time, Kiel won clearly against Minden 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:54.530
 while in the north derby between hamburg 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.420
 and flensburg gave the points 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.340
 foxes remain table leader before the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.870
 rhine-neckar lions and kiel have, however 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.079
 also one or two games 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.040
 more on the account 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.590
 melsungen remains after the point win 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.540
 continue on rank 11 on the 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.420
 relegation places next to 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.260
 GroÃŸwallstadt still the two newcomers 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.260
 Neuhausen and food
