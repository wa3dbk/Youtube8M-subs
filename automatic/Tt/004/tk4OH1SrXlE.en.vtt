you<00:01:59.580> middle<00:01:59.880> click<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.299> actually<00:02:00.869> gives<00:02:01.080> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you middle click it actually gives you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.100 
you middle click it actually gives you
60<00:02:01.799> four<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.159> these<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.400> that<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.780> called

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
60 four of these so that is called

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.840 
60 four of these so that is called
effort<00:02:04.710> what's<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.070> called<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> pic<00:02:05.580> block

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
effort what's that called the pic block

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.149 
effort what's that called the pic block
I<00:02:06.060> think<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:06.659> if<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.840> pick<00:02:07.020> block<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.560> 64

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:08.159 
I think I so if you pick block it's 64

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.300 
I think I so if you pick block it's 64
that's<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.450> does<00:02:09.689> so<00:02:10.099> she's<00:02:11.099> click

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
that's what that does so she's click

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.339 
that's what that does so she's click
that<00:02:11.519> away<00:02:11.760> so<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:12.269> this<00:02:12.390> where<00:02:12.720> does<00:02:12.840> right

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
that away so for this where does right

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.110 
that away so for this where does right
clicking<00:02:13.680> left<00:02:14.069> clicking<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:14.939> two

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
clicking left clicking we have two

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.940 
clicking left clicking we have two
diamonds<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.810> obviously<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:16.529> want<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.829> get

guess<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.489> tested

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
guess I tested

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030 
guess I tested
creative<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:22.200> survival<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:22.890> works

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
create it was because every time I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.220 
create it was because every time I
didn't<00:02:29.970> get<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.240> glitch<00:02:30.450> right<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.750> had<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.110> go
