00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.890
 we all know that the sun produces heat and 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.799
 light 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.200
 but it can also produce electricity 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.600
 using panel technology 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.600
 solar photovoltaic that surely 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.789
 you have already seen around you if you 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.520
 put panels on 1% of the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.980
 surface of the country there would be enough 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.880
 energy to meet the needs 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.880
 the entire population 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.990
 sunlight is formed by small 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.090
 energy particles called photons 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.720
 which they are captured by the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.720
 solar panels 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.590
 the eco housing panels are composed 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.590
 by solar cells that are made up of 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.050
 positive and negative layers these 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.570
 they work like a similar electric field 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.800
 to a battery creating a current 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.350
 electrical continuous 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.690
 the electricity produced by the system 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.760
 has great advantages occurs from 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.920
 clean way with zero emissions 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.110
 Pollutants does not contain parts 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.290
 movable so it does not cause noise and 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.720
 it only requires a minimum of maintenance 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.759
 besides, it does not consume water or fuels and 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.759
 It can be placed in your own home 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:20.370
 the system also produces electricity 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.370
 on cold cloudy days or in low light 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.509
 let's see what happens in your house at 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.100
 install solar panels eco housing 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.500
 the electricity that is produced in the 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.930
 panels is known as current 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.680
 direct that is equal to the one used by 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.270
 the batteries of your electronic equipment 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.759
 this current is sent to a device 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.039
 called an investor that makes it 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.929
 alternating current which is what you use 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.390
 daily in all your contacts and 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.970
 appliances 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.550
 when the night comes its panels no longer 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.380
 they will produce electricity but how are you 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.270
 connected to the public network 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.840
 you will continue using the one that sends you the 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.299
 cf 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.579
 it often happens that during the day 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.829
 the panels produce more electricity 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.689
 that the one that is being used by 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.979
 example when there are no appliances 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.379
 lit at home 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.750
 said surplus electricity is 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.519
 returns to the cee efe through the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.370
 power lines so it can be 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.349
 used by other users 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.930
 your meter will record how much 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.269
 electricity you have returned to the water and this 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.850
 uat banguat will be credited to you so that 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.010
 can be used after 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.410
 it's like making a deposit 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.480
 electricity to your doctor and money to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.970
 your light receipt achieved in this way 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.940
 considerable reductions in your payment of 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.770
 electricity for many years besides 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.610
 help conserve the environment 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.370
 using clean energy 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.050
 we make budgets for you only 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.890
 You have to send us your electricity bill 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.530
 to understand your electricity consumption 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.600
 with eco housing you can support the 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.600
 ecology and economics in your home 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.190
 i 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.190
 ah
