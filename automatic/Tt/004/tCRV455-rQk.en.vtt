I'm proud of I can't fly up which sucks

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.980 
I'm proud of I can't fly up which sucks
bit<00:02:03.929> here<00:02:04.640> eight<00:02:05.640> clocks<00:02:06.240> they're<00:02:06.749> all<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
bit here eight clocks they're all the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.960 
bit here eight clocks they're all the
exact<00:02:07.350> same<00:02:07.469> they're<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:08.070> powered<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:08.670> right

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
exact same they're all powered off right

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.740 
exact same they're all powered off right
now<00:02:09.619> they're<00:02:10.619> all<00:02:10.649> hooked<00:02:10.979> up<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.610> people<00:02:12.570> who

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
now they're all hooked up for people who

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.690 
now they're all hooked up for people who
aren't<00:02:12.930> very<00:02:13.020> good<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.770> or<00:02:14.160> familiar<00:02:14.580> with

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
aren't very good with or familiar with

aren't very good with or familiar with
redstone<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.690> may<00:02:15.959> seem<00:02:16.019> like<00:02:17.120> like<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> huge

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
redstone this may seem like like a huge

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
redstone this may seem like like a huge
circuit<00:02:19.349> it's<00:02:19.560> not<00:02:19.800> really<00:02:20.159> it's

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
circuit it's not really it's

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.979 
circuit it's not really it's
the<00:02:20.489> same<00:02:20.730> circuit<00:02:21.030> I've<00:02:21.390> repeated<00:02:21.840> eight

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
the same circuit I've repeated eight

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.710 
the same circuit I've repeated eight
times<00:02:22.319> like<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.129> one<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.090> exact<00:02:24.360> same<00:02:24.510> as

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
times like that one is the exact same as

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.509 
times like that one is the exact same as
that<00:02:24.870> one<00:02:25.110> she's<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.739> exact<00:02:26.010> same<00:02:26.190> as<00:02:26.340> that

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
that one she's the exact same as that

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.410 
that one she's the exact same as that
one<00:02:27.950> well<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.040> works<00:02:29.250> if<00:02:29.700> we've<00:02:29.849> got<00:02:30.060> my<00:02:30.180> clock

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
one well it works if we've got my clock

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.320 
one well it works if we've got my clock
here<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.890> didn't<00:02:32.489> invent<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.879> one<00:02:33.060> either

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
here I didn't invent this one either

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.440 
here I didn't invent this one either
this<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.480> based<00:02:33.780> off<00:02:34.019> Minecraft<00:02:34.530> addicts<00:02:35.450> one

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
this is based off Minecraft addicts one

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.509 
this is based off Minecraft addicts one
of<00:02:36.569> his<00:02:36.690> designs<00:02:36.959> much<00:02:37.560> even<00:02:37.950> sure<00:02:38.069> if<00:02:38.190> he<00:02:38.310> made

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
of his designs much even sure if he made

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.280 
of his designs much even sure if he made
it<00:02:38.549> up<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:39.420> where<00:02:39.569> I<00:02:39.629> got<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.900> from

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
it up that's where I got it from

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.350 
it up that's where I got it from
I<00:02:40.319> am<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.890> defined<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.400> bit<00:02:41.790> how<00:02:42.060> did<00:02:42.269> this

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
I am I defined it a bit how did this

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.899 
I am I defined it a bit how did this
switch<00:02:42.659> here<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.620> enable<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.280> disable<00:02:44.879> it

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
switch here to enable it and disable it

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.270 
switch here to enable it and disable it
as<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.299> can<00:02:45.450> see<00:02:45.599> it's<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.870> right<00:02:46.079> now<00:02:46.159> but<00:02:47.159> the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
as you can see it's on right now but the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.890 
as you can see it's on right now but the
circuit<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.760> locked<00:02:48.030> I'll<00:02:48.209> explain<00:02:48.569> how<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:48.720> did

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
circuit is locked I'll explain how I did

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.860 
circuit is locked I'll explain how I did
that<00:02:48.989> in<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.200> second<00:02:50.360> each<00:02:51.360> one<00:02:51.629> of<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:51.840> you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
that in a second each one of them you

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.110 
that in a second each one of them you
can<00:02:52.140> customize<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.099> can<00:02:53.340> control<00:02:53.700> how

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
can customize so you can control how

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.330 
can customize so you can control how
many<00:02:54.180> chickens<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.750> want<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.019> come<00:02:55.230> out<00:02:55.379> so<00:02:56.220> if

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
many chickens you want to come out so if

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.890 
many chickens you want to come out so if
you<00:02:56.459> only<00:02:56.579> want<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:57.209> come<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.569> you<00:02:57.750> can

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
you only want one to come out you can

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.589 
you only want one to come out you can
have<00:02:58.109> that<00:02:58.379> if<00:02:59.069> you<00:02:59.220> want<00:02:59.489> all<00:02:59.700> eight<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.329> work

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
have that if you want all eight to work

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.180 
have that if you want all eight to work
you<00:03:00.959> can<00:03:01.140> do<00:03:01.290> that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
you can do that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.479 
you can do that
so<00:03:02.489> I'll<00:03:02.579> just<00:03:02.760> enable<00:03:03.209> them<00:03:03.359> all<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:04.489> it's

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
so I'll just enable them all now it's

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.729 
so I'll just enable them all now it's
actually<00:03:05.819> good<00:03:05.970> for<00:03:06.480> people<00:03:06.989> who<00:03:07.170> have<00:03:07.560> like

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
actually good for people who have like

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.190 
actually good for people who have like
low<00:03:08.010> performance<00:03:08.700> computers<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:10.019> they<00:03:10.049> can

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
low performance computers so they can

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.250 
low performance computers so they can
still<00:03:10.530> use<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.970> because<00:03:11.970> when<00:03:12.810> there's<00:03:13.109> all

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
still use this because when there's all

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.229 
still use this because when there's all
these<00:03:13.440> dispensers<00:03:14.099> going<00:03:14.459> here<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.030> can

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
these dispensers going here it can

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.240 
these dispensers going here it can
really<00:03:15.950> hit<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.099> PC<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:19.680> there<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.040> are<00:03:20.159> all

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
really hit the PC but there is are all

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.559 
really hit the PC but there is are all
disabled<00:03:20.700> right<00:03:20.819> now<00:03:20.970> if<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.209> flick<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> switch

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
disabled right now if I flick a switch

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.930 
disabled right now if I flick a switch
it'll<00:03:22.019> disable<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.560> these<00:03:22.739> torches<00:03:23.099> which

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
it'll disable all these torches which

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.440 
it'll disable all these torches which
all<00:03:24.150> enable<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.660> circuit<00:03:25.139> because<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:26.450> break

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
all enable the circuit because I break

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.729 
all enable the circuit because I break
it<00:03:27.569> is<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.930> show<00:03:28.109> you<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.959> circuit<00:03:31.560> just

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
it is I can show you the circuit just

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.940 
it is I can show you the circuit just
goes<00:03:31.919> off<00:03:32.069> like<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:33.440> yes<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:34.769> most

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
goes off like that yes so as most

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.890 
goes off like that yes so as most
redstone<00:03:35.370> people<00:03:35.639> know<00:03:35.760> torches<00:03:36.690> will

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
redstone people know torches will

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.349 
redstone people know torches will
disabled<00:03:37.560> circuits<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:38.819> disabled<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
disabled circuits so I just disabled the

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.110 
disabled circuits so I just disabled the
torches<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.930> enable<00:03:40.290> them<00:03:40.470> as<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.709> need<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.120> so

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
torches and enable them as I need to so

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.250 
torches and enable them as I need to so
I'll<00:03:42.180> just<00:03:42.299> go<00:03:42.389> ahead<00:03:42.419> and<00:03:42.690> flick<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:42.989> switch

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
I'll just go ahead and flick the switch

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.659 
I'll just go ahead and flick the switch
now<00:03:43.530> I'm<00:03:43.799> not<00:03:44.010> sure<00:03:44.040> how<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:44.459> going<00:03:44.579> to

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
now I'm not sure how it's going to

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.180 
now I'm not sure how it's going to
