we're<00:00:01.230> now<00:00:01.350> going<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.560> start<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.860> drafting

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
we're now going to start the drafting

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.670 
we're now going to start the drafting
portion<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.270> this<00:00:03.419> tutorial<00:00:03.600> series<00:00:04.110> so<00:00:04.500> now

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
portion of this tutorial series so now

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.300 
portion of this tutorial series so now
we'll<00:00:04.799> show<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:04.890> how<00:00:04.950> to<00:00:05.009> make<00:00:05.190> the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
we'll show you how to make the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.010 
we'll show you how to make the
engineering<00:00:05.850> drawings<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.569> lay<00:00:06.870> out<00:00:06.990> your

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
engineering drawings and lay out your

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.900 
engineering drawings and lay out your
your<00:00:07.649> parts<00:00:08.040> in<00:00:08.309> different<00:00:08.730> views

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
your parts in different views

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.509 
your parts in different views
dimensioned<00:00:09.750> etc<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.559> can<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:11.340> could

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
dimensioned etc so you can it could

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.910 
dimensioned etc so you can it could
present<00:00:11.670> them<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.690> an<00:00:13.170> engineering<00:00:13.710> drawing

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
present them in an engineering drawing

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.250 
present them in an engineering drawing
format<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:15.089> before<00:00:15.389> we<00:00:15.480> begin<00:00:15.599> one<00:00:15.960> thing<00:00:16.109> I

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
format but before we begin one thing I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.040 
format but before we begin one thing I
should<00:00:16.440> mention<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.480> in<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.570> model<00:00:18.779> tree

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
should mention is that in the model tree

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.099 
should mention is that in the model tree
here<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.650> these<00:00:20.130> operations<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.820> we<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.180> we

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
here all these operations that we do we

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.090 
here all these operations that we do we
can<00:00:22.140> name<00:00:22.439> them

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
can name them

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.620 
can name them
so<00:00:23.400> there<00:00:23.519> ought<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.699> be<00:00:23.820> extrusion<00:00:24.420> one

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
so there ought to be extrusion one

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990 
so there ought to be extrusion one
extrusion<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.380> fill<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.070> one<00:00:26.279> like<00:00:26.699> I've<00:00:26.849> been

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
extrusion to fill it one like I've been

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.259 
extrusion to fill it one like I've been
doing<00:00:27.180> before<00:00:27.710> for<00:00:28.710> complex<00:00:29.550> pieces<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.090> may

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
doing before for complex pieces you may

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.610 
doing before for complex pieces you may
want<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.539> have<00:00:30.980> named<00:00:31.980> operations<00:00:33.020> it's<00:00:34.020> just

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
want to have named operations it's just

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.049 
want to have named operations it's just
good<00:00:34.829> practice<00:00:34.860> because<00:00:35.460> then<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.820> can<00:00:35.940> look

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
good practice because then you can look

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
good practice because then you can look
down<00:00:36.210> if<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.450> want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.690> modify<00:00:36.960> let's<00:00:37.739> say<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
down if you want to modify let's say you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.340 
down if you want to modify let's say you
want<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> modify<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.510> this<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:40.170> don't<00:00:40.260> have

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
want to modify the this you don't have

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
want to modify the this you don't have
to<00:00:40.440> figure<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:40.829> okay<00:00:41.129> which<00:00:41.340> operation<00:00:42.030> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
to figure out okay which operation is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.639 
to figure out okay which operation is
that<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.570> sort<00:00:42.780> say<00:00:42.960> oh<00:00:42.989> top<00:00:43.350> knobs

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that you can just sort say oh top knobs

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.660 
that you can just sort say oh top knobs
that's<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.180> modify<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
that's what that is so we can modify it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.229 
that's what that is so we can modify it
for<00:00:47.670> multiple<00:00:48.980> process<00:00:49.980> pieces<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:51.030> might

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
for multiple process pieces you might

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.729 
for multiple process pieces you might
want<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> might<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.350> through<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.590> name

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
want to might want to go through a name

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.410 
want to might want to go through a name
them<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.010> name<00:00:53.160> them<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.550> same<00:00:54.180> as<00:00:54.270> in

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
them to name them you just same as in

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
them to name them you just same as in
Windows<00:00:54.570> if<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.809> want<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> rename<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> folder

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
Windows if you want to rename a folder

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.959 
Windows if you want to rename a folder
or<00:00:55.710> files<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.129> mean<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.309> click<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.579> once<00:00:56.760> then

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
or files I mean you click it once then

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
or files I mean you click it once then
click<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.270> again<00:00:57.360> then<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> gives<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
click it again then it gives you a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.510 
click it again then it gives you a
allows<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> rename<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.949> anyways<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.160> let's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
allows you to rename it anyways so let's

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.119 
allows you to rename it anyways so let's
go<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.110> drafting<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.860> we're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.070> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
go on to drafting so we're going to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.200 
go on to drafting so we're going to
create<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> new<00:01:05.519> drawing<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.570> new<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:09.150> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
create a new drawing so new this is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.280 
create a new drawing so new this is
where<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.390> made<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:09.570> parts<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.049> but<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.200> already

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
where we made our parts in but I already

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.550 
where we made our parts in but I already
like<00:01:10.500> go<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.790> DWG<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.150> our<00:01:12.360> papers<00:01:13.260> that's

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
like go to DWG to make our papers that's

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
like go to DWG to make our papers that's
sort<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.860> our<00:01:13.979> paper<00:01:14.159> space<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:14.970> hit<00:01:15.060> OK

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
sort of our paper space so if we hit OK

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.210 
sort of our paper space so if we hit OK
it's<00:01:15.630> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> open<00:01:15.990> up<00:01:17.570> page<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.220> now

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it's going to open up page like this now

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's going to open up page like this now
this<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.700> paper<00:01:20.939> space<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:23.250> sheet

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
this is our paper space so this sheet

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.870 
this is our paper space so this sheet
sheet<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.470> edit<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.700> right

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
sheet one we can edit it so if we right

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.660 
sheet one we can edit it so if we right
click<00:01:26.960> edit<00:01:27.960> sheet<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:28.920> pick<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> size<00:01:29.400> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
click edit sheet we can pick the size so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.010 
click edit sheet we can pick the size so
if<00:01:29.729> we<00:01:29.820> don't<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.630> wanted<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
if we don't want to see if we wanted a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.390 
if we don't want to see if we wanted a
you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.200> make<00:01:34.470> custom<00:01:34.680> size<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you can make custom size you want to

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
you can make custom size you want to
enter<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> height<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> width<00:01:36.350> let's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
enter the height in the width let's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.100 
enter the height in the width let's
let's<00:01:38.130> keep<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.689> can<00:01:39.869> enter<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
let's keep it as see you can enter the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.690 
let's keep it as see you can enter the
sheet<00:01:40.140> name<00:01:40.590> which<00:01:40.890> we'll<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.189> rename<00:01:41.549> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
sheet name which we'll just rename it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.109 
sheet name which we'll just rename it
here<00:01:41.729> enter<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> revision<00:01:43.079> number<00:01:43.939> and<00:01:44.939> then<00:01:45.060> we

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
here enter a revision number and then we

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.429 
here enter a revision number and then we
can<00:01:45.240> also<00:01:45.360> change<00:01:45.540> orientation<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.350> can

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
can also change orientation so we can

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
can also change orientation so we can
say<00:01:46.530> portrait<00:01:47.280> landscape<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.030> choose<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
say portrait landscape we can choose the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.960 
say portrait landscape we can choose the
location<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:48.960> title<00:01:49.259> block<00:01:49.820> exclude<00:01:50.820> from

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
location of the title block exclude from

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.510 
location of the title block exclude from
counts<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.720> add<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.229> numbered<00:01:52.770> set<00:01:53.280> you

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
counts so if you add a numbered set you

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
counts so if you add a numbered set you
could<00:01:53.670> exclude<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.210> from<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.720> sheet<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
could exclude it from the sheet one of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
could exclude it from the sheet one of
one<00:01:55.500> down<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.759> also<00:01:56.880> exclude<00:01:57.060> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
one down there you can also exclude it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.969 
one down there you can also exclude it
from<00:01:57.270> printing<00:01:59.509> so<00:02:00.710> now<00:02:01.710> we've<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:01.950> our

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
from printing so now we've got our

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.609 
from printing so now we've got our
default<00:02:02.399> border<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.090> NSI<00:02:03.780> large<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
default border and a NSI large to the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.560 
default border and a NSI large to the
block<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:05.100> wanted<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> change<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:06.060> we've

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
block we wanted to change these we've

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
block we wanted to change these we've
got<00:02:06.780> drawing<00:02:07.439> resources<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.369> may

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
got drawing resources up here you may

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.820 
got drawing resources up here you may
have<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> open<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.000> expand<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.709> we've

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
have to open this expand it up so we've

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.509 
have to open this expand it up so we've
got<00:02:10.979> sheet<00:02:11.340> formats

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
got sheet formats

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.640 
got sheet formats
standard<00:02:13.480> sheet<00:02:13.689> form<00:02:13.930> attitude<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.409> want<00:02:14.439> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
standard sheet form attitude I want to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.619 
standard sheet form attitude I want to
use<00:02:14.829> we've<00:02:15.099> got<00:02:15.280> standard<00:02:15.760> borders<00:02:16.150> title

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
use we've got standard borders title

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:19.860 
use we've got standard borders title
blocks<00:02:17.159> symbols<00:02:18.159> AutoCAD<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.329> just<00:02:19.569> standard

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
blocks symbols AutoCAD and just standard

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.380 
blocks symbols AutoCAD and just standard
AutoCAD<00:02:20.260> blocks<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.189> we<00:02:21.400> want<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.640> get<00:02:22.239> rid<00:02:22.359> of

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
AutoCAD blocks so we want to get rid of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390 
AutoCAD blocks so we want to get rid of
this<00:02:22.480> title<00:02:22.689> block<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.709> don't<00:02:23.859> like<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.250> one

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
this title block we don't like this one

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.270 
this title block we don't like this one
so<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:25.329> can<00:02:25.420> delete<00:02:25.719> it<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.500> then<00:02:26.829> we<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.040> add

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
so you can delete it and then we can add

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.599 
so you can delete it and then we can add
a<00:02:27.609> si8<00:02:28.239> by<00:02:28.780> double-clicking<00:02:29.469> it<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.549> a

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
a si8 by double-clicking it so it's a

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.589 
a si8 by double-clicking it so it's a
different<00:02:30.879> type<00:02:30.969> of<00:02:31.000> block<00:02:31.209> but<00:02:31.359> if<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.480> want

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
different type of block but if you want

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.729 
different type of block but if you want
to<00:02:31.659> make<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> custom<00:02:32.200> title<00:02:32.439> block<00:02:32.560> which<00:02:32.709> you

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
to make a custom title block which you

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.179 
to make a custom title block which you
probably<00:02:33.099> will<00:02:34.079> we<00:02:35.079> can<00:02:35.170> go<00:02:35.290> over<00:02:35.439> to<00:02:35.739> manage

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
probably will we can go over to manage

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:37.920 
probably will we can go over to manage
and<00:02:36.430> then<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:36.819> define<00:02:37.239> we<00:02:37.510> could<00:02:37.629> define<00:02:37.900> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
and then in define we could define a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.690 
and then in define we could define a
title<00:02:38.230> block<00:02:38.319> so<00:02:38.799> let's<00:02:38.980> make<00:02:39.159> a<00:02:39.189> title<00:02:39.549> block

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
title block so let's make a title block

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.129 
title block so let's make a title block
it's<00:02:39.969> going<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.150> be<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> rectangle<00:02:42.989> then<00:02:43.989> it

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.139 
it's going to be a rectangle then it

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.569 
it's going to be a rectangle then it
will<00:02:44.230> be<00:02:44.349> filled<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:44.709> some<00:02:45.250> lines

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
will be filled with some lines

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.610 
will be filled with some lines
presumably<00:02:46.419> you<00:02:46.720> can<00:02:46.870> spend<00:02:47.109> a<00:02:47.169> lot<00:02:47.349> of<00:02:47.379> time

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
presumably you can spend a lot of time

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.679 
presumably you can spend a lot of time
making<00:02:47.829> a<00:02:47.950> title<00:02:48.220> block<00:02:48.359> but<00:02:49.359> I'll<00:02:49.419> just<00:02:49.480> show

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
making a title block but I'll just show

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.699 
making a title block but I'll just show
you<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.989> process<00:02:50.260> real<00:02:50.799> quick<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:53.590> all

lines even better anyways you might want

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.129 
lines even better anyways you might want
another<00:03:00.700> rectangle<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.629> here<00:03:01.780> for<00:03:01.989> some

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
finished sketch then we're going to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.390 
finished sketch then we're going to
define<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.859> with<00:03:05.919> a<00:03:05.980> name<00:03:07.859> so<00:03:08.859> now<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.010> see<00:03:09.310> it

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
define it with a name so now you see it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.920 
define it with a name so now you see it
here<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:09.760> title<00:03:10.120> block<00:03:10.299> so<00:03:10.480> if<00:03:10.540> we<00:03:10.599> want<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.780> get

once again manage border

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.690 
once again manage border
there's<00:04:18.959> our<00:04:19.320> border<00:04:20.060> let's<00:04:21.060> make<00:04:21.239> it<00:04:21.470> let's

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
sort of make it noticeably different so

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.460 
sort of make it noticeably different so
I'll<00:04:26.640> offset<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:29.100> now<00:04:29.280> we<00:04:29.340> get<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.520> border

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.250

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
border and there you go you see on

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.120 
border and there you go you see on
realistically<00:04:41.520> we<00:04:41.640> make<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.880> border<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.890> C<00:04:43.890> size

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
realistically we make a border a C size

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.850 
realistically we make a border a C size
border<00:04:44.700> but<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:46.020> is<00:04:46.140> just<00:04:46.290> just<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.620> show<00:04:46.800> you

want all these fields you can just sort
of<00:05:39.530> modify<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.590> instead<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.070> creating<00:05:41.400> your

right so that's that's all covered for

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.500 
right so that's that's all covered for
borders<00:05:46.740> and<00:05:46.950> title<00:05:47.190> blocks<00:05:47.430> next<00:05:48.300> we'll<00:05:48.390> go

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
borders and title blocks next we'll go

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.750 
borders and title blocks next we'll go
we'll<00:05:48.720> place<00:05:48.930> our<00:05:49.080> views<00:05:49.410> and<00:05:49.760> start

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
we'll place our views and start

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.580 
we'll place our views and start
dimensioning<00:05:51.270> them<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.510> stuff<00:05:51.690> so<00:05:52.530> stay
