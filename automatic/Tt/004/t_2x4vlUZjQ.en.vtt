places of all is the beach itself I've
chosen<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.450> beautiful<00:00:32.169> composition<00:00:32.559> with<00:00:33.370> the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
chosen a beautiful composition with the

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.190 
chosen a beautiful composition with the
beach<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.090> the<00:00:34.330> ocean<00:00:34.360> in<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.020> background

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
beach and the ocean in the background

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.229 
beach and the ocean in the background
we're<00:00:36.130> going<00:00:36.250> to<00:00:36.309> have<00:00:36.400> a<00:00:36.430> little<00:00:36.910> bit<00:00:37.120> of

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
we're going to have a little bit of

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.990 
we're going to have a little bit of
water<00:00:37.390> mostly<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.800> these<00:00:39.070> wonderful<00:00:39.670> dunes

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
water mostly the these wonderful dunes

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.740 
water mostly the these wonderful dunes
so<00:00:40.750> what<00:00:40.870> I'm<00:00:40.989> going<00:00:41.140> to<00:00:41.170> do<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.559> very<00:00:42.040> broadly

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
so what I'm going to do is very broadly

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.500 
so what I'm going to do is very broadly
place<00:00:43.750> in<00:00:43.989> a<00:00:44.110> sketch<00:00:44.610> I'm<00:00:45.610> going<00:00:46.059> to<00:00:46.269> paint

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
place in a sketch I'm going to paint

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.009 
place in a sketch I'm going to paint
these<00:00:47.019> cliffs<00:00:48.180> partly<00:00:49.180> sketch<00:00:49.480> them<00:00:49.750> in<00:00:49.900> at

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
these cliffs partly sketch them in at

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.729 
these cliffs partly sketch them in at
first<00:00:50.820> we'd<00:00:51.820> go<00:00:51.970> back<00:00:52.090> and<00:00:52.330> paint<00:00:52.540> these<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
first we'd go back and paint these the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.560 
first we'd go back and paint these the
proper<00:00:54.160> color<00:00:54.430> but<00:00:54.699> what<00:00:54.790> I'm<00:00:54.910> doing<00:00:54.940> is<00:00:55.269> very

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
proper color but what I'm doing is very

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.430 
proper color but what I'm doing is very
loosely<00:00:56.050> sketching<00:00:56.739> as<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:58.570> progress<00:00:58.840> with

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
loosely sketching as we progress with

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.590 
loosely sketching as we progress with
our<00:00:59.620> sketch<00:00:59.920> it's<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.280> key<00:01:00.489> point<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:01.030> also<00:01:01.420> pay

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
our sketch it's a key point to also pay

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.200 
our sketch it's a key point to also pay
attention<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:02.559> the<00:01:02.710> darks<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.160> lights<00:01:03.250> as<00:01:03.730> the

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
attention to the darks and lights as the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.359 
attention to the darks and lights as the
day<00:01:04.360> progresses<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.619> lights<00:01:06.040> going<00:01:06.310> to

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
day progresses the lights going to

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.010 
day progresses the lights going to
change<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.880> little<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.300> I<00:01:07.570> want<00:01:07.750> to<00:01:07.810> try<00:01:07.960> to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
change a little and I want to try to

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.170 
change a little and I want to try to
capture<00:01:08.500> this<00:01:08.619> morning<00:01:09.100> light<00:01:09.340> towards<00:01:10.119> the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
capture this morning light towards the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.630 
capture this morning light towards the
afternoon<00:01:10.360> when<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:10.930> Sun<00:01:11.050> is<00:01:11.440> high<00:01:11.710> all<00:01:12.250> these

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
afternoon when the Sun is high all these

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.520 
afternoon when the Sun is high all these
shadows<00:01:13.090> are<00:01:13.119> going<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.390> be<00:01:13.509> gone<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.320> want

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
shadows are going to be gone and I want

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.380 
shadows are going to be gone and I want
to<00:01:14.590> make<00:01:14.740> little<00:01:15.130> quick<00:01:15.490> footnotes<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.330> do

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
to make little quick footnotes and I do

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.719 
to make little quick footnotes and I do
this<00:01:16.660> in<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.930> sketch<00:01:17.200> process<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:18.130> remind<00:01:18.550> me

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
this in the sketch process to remind me

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.670 
this in the sketch process to remind me
of<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.970> lighting<00:01:19.390> that's<00:01:19.810> happening<00:01:20.380> at<00:01:20.500> this

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
of the lighting that's happening at this

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.310 
of the lighting that's happening at this
very<00:01:20.800> moment<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.670> I'm<00:01:22.210> going<00:01:22.539> to<00:01:22.750> add<00:01:22.930> more

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
very moment and I'm going to add more

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.450 
very moment and I'm going to add more
burnt<00:01:23.590> sienna<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.190> my<00:01:24.340> verticals<00:01:26.460> just

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
burnt sienna to my verticals just

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.000 
burnt sienna to my verticals just
because<00:01:27.760> I<00:01:27.790> want<00:01:28.090> them<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.570> have<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.200> nice<00:01:29.409> brown

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
because I want them to have a nice brown

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.460 
because I want them to have a nice brown
undertone<00:01:33.390> I'm<00:01:34.390> going<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.900> take<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.110> little<00:01:35.320> bit

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
undertone I'm going to take a little bit

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.410 
undertone I'm going to take a little bit
of<00:01:35.590> turpentine<00:01:35.799> and<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:38.880> pull<00:01:39.880> off<00:01:39.909> some

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
of turpentine and actually pull off some

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.030 
of turpentine and actually pull off some
of<00:01:40.450> my<00:01:40.570> sketch<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.259> get<00:01:41.409> a<00:01:41.439> little<00:01:41.650> highlight

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
of my sketch to get a little highlight

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.820 
of my sketch to get a little highlight
on<00:01:42.340> my<00:01:42.640> rocks<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.619> a<00:01:44.680> little

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
on my rocks this is just a little

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.020 
on my rocks this is just a little
footnote<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:48.280> very<00:01:48.549> little<00:01:48.700> water

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
footnote there's very little water

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.330 
footnote there's very little water
showing<00:01:49.450> in<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.720> composition<00:01:50.229> and<00:01:51.220> I'm

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
showing in this composition and I'm

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.999 
showing in this composition and I'm
making<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.759> foreground<00:01:52.360> much<00:01:53.200> darker<00:01:53.770> I<00:01:53.799> want

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
making the foreground much darker I want

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.550 
making the foreground much darker I want
to<00:01:54.070> get<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.340> values<00:01:54.820> in<00:01:55.090> look<00:01:56.020> at<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:56.259> energy

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
to get the values in look at this energy

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.300 
to get the values in look at this energy
that<00:01:56.829> I'm<00:01:57.130> capturing<00:01:57.729> in<00:01:58.119> my<00:01:58.240> painting<00:01:59.310> also

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
that I'm capturing in my painting also

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.710 
that I'm capturing in my painting also
it's<00:02:01.030> important<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.799> realize<00:02:02.799> that<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:04.119> is<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
it's important to realize that it is the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.380 
it's important to realize that it is the
gesture<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.770> brushstroke<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:07.000> will

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
gesture of the brushstroke that will

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.660 
gesture of the brushstroke that will
count<00:02:07.840> at<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.140> very<00:02:08.530> end<00:02:08.739> of<00:02:08.829> the<00:02:08.950> painting<00:02:09.369> if

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
count at the very end of the painting if

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.910 
count at the very end of the painting if
you<00:02:09.820> bring<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.269> lot<00:02:10.540> of<00:02:10.600> energy<00:02:11.350> into<00:02:11.739> your

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
you bring a lot of energy into your

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.670 
you bring a lot of energy into your
sketch<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.940> will<00:02:13.180> play<00:02:13.690> forth<00:02:14.230> throughout

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
sketch that will play forth throughout

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.009 
sketch that will play forth throughout

and<00:02:17.049> you<00:02:17.380> can<00:02:17.530> always<00:02:17.650> wipe<00:02:17.920> off<00:02:18.190> areas<00:02:18.610> where

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
and you can always wipe off areas where

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.300 
and you can always wipe off areas where
you<00:02:18.850> want<00:02:19.030> light<00:02:19.709> say<00:02:20.709> I'm<00:02:20.799> thinking<00:02:20.980> about

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
you want light say I'm thinking about

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.600 
you want light say I'm thinking about
the<00:02:21.430> whole<00:02:21.730> painting<00:02:22.090> now

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610

suddenly my main focal point in this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.760 
suddenly my main focal point in this
area<00:02:25.310> I<00:02:25.550> want<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.450> concentrate<00:02:27.080> most<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.620> my

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
area I want to concentrate most of my

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.600 
area I want to concentrate most of my
lighting<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.940> main<00:02:29.120> focal<00:02:29.570> point<00:02:29.600> area<00:02:30.610> so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
lighting in the main focal point area so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.070 
lighting in the main focal point area so
I'm<00:02:31.700> gonna<00:02:31.880> wipe<00:02:32.090> some<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.510> off<00:02:32.630> I'm

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
I'm gonna wipe some of that off I'm

I'm gonna wipe some of that off I'm
gonna<00:02:33.200> take<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.560> little<00:02:33.770> bit<00:02:33.860> of<00:02:34.450> turpentine

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
gonna take a little bit of turpentine

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.810

I'm<00:02:37.490> also<00:02:37.850> paying<00:02:38.210> attention<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.870> angles<00:02:39.820> it's

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
I'm also paying attention to angles it's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.600 
I'm also paying attention to angles it's
a<00:02:40.910> 45<00:02:41.390> degree<00:02:41.570> angle<00:02:41.840> this<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.190> straight

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
a 45 degree angle this is a straight

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.520 
a 45 degree angle this is a straight
angle<00:02:43.820> that<00:02:44.150> goes<00:02:44.300> across<00:02:44.510> with<00:02:45.020> these<00:02:45.200> rocks

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
angle that goes across with these rocks

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.410 
angle that goes across with these rocks
and<00:02:45.830> they<00:02:46.580> have<00:02:46.760> these<00:02:46.880> wonderful<00:02:46.940> little

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
and they have these wonderful little

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.680 
and they have these wonderful little
green<00:02:48.080> highlights<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.250> top<00:02:49.490> of<00:02:49.670> them<00:02:49.820> also

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
green highlights on the top of them also

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.960 
green highlights on the top of them also
we<00:02:51.050> have<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.380> remember<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.830> it<00:02:52.430> seems<00:02:52.790> like

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
we have to remember to it seems like

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.750 
we have to remember to it seems like
this<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.330> high<00:02:53.510> tide<00:02:53.870> right<00:02:54.170> now<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.520> the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
this is high tide right now so if the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.580 
this is high tide right now so if the
tide<00:02:56.000> goes<00:02:56.300> out<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:56.690> could<00:02:56.870> end<00:02:57.020> up<00:02:57.140> with<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.320> lot

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
tide goes out we could end up with a lot

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.490 
tide goes out we could end up with a lot
more<00:02:57.620> Beach<00:02:58.100> I<00:02:58.480> like<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.690> way<00:02:59.810> it<00:02:59.840> is<00:03:00.020> right

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
experiment around because if you put a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.900 
experiment around because if you put a
line<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.690> you<00:03:05.780> say<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.050> don't<00:03:06.140> like<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.910> you
