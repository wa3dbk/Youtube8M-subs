00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.809
 this is called a new small dvb t 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.420
 receiver of elgato where I say 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 that would not mean it but 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.600
 tiny because he is really damned 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 I am so small then take the hand 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 He has a battery in it for four 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.660
 for hours the stream should deliver that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.019
 ie you can spend hours four 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.640
 received dvb t programs ios devices 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.309
 and also an android devices pass 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.680
 that then runs on wifi device builds 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.480
 a wifi network on with ye 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.309
 then connect with that of the device 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.309
 reception should connect and he received 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.170
 the tv program then via an app in 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.030
 scope of delivery is on the one hand this small 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.649
 I can contain the telescopic antenna 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.390
 yes deductions also put on 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.190
 I also have one more 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.320
 small rod antenna then this so big and 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.910
 effect shows afterwards in the picture the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.739
 rod antenna I would at home then 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.600
 maybe place near the window 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.550
 I have indeed sent word can 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.199
 Try it when you open the antenna 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.210
 a metal surface, for example 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.250
 placed on the radiator 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.439
 reception performance even better that one 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.390
 Magnetic base also the rod antenna I 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 I tried it in the pub 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.810
 could pull out of it and it went 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.439
 actually quite good things on the table 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.780
 lay 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.200
 then his network built on her power 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.509
 or iphone or ipad or does that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.090
 app on the iphone or ipad and on 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.840
 receives the ones just above dvb-t 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.210
 channels 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.950
 These are sometimes even less 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.619
 we have a link in the article in it 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.590
 that depends entirely on where just dvb t 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.540
 receipt and before he buys something like that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.450
 always the availability in the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.040
 availability in your region so dvb t 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.200
 is very much in concentration centers 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.810
 very good are then even more times 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.579
 not how does it work 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.229
 I pulled out the antenna 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.920
 here on the side a small switch that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.700
 make something and now shines something 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.810
 I 've also got it to myself so I have 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.240
 the two things here next to each other 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.549
 I put the app on the ipad 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.229
 already started and have the ipad too 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.119
 connected to the wifi network that of the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.039
 small receiver here receiver and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.869
 transmitter is set up in the case 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.670
 Of course you do not have to be that tight 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.170
 lay side by side so loud manufacturer 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.859
 are not up to ten meters apart 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.319
 problem 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:18.450
 it depends entirely on the living situation 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.500
 So have three rooms away, it is 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.810
 probably go worse like in 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.640
 a 15 meter long big room where 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.530
 nothing stands in the way that you know yourself 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.659
 Now, first, a channel search 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.310
 that's why the app asks me 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:31.079
 if you use my current location 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.340
 The reception is over 10 is regional 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.189
 different and it will be just 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.769
 now takes into account when searching for stations 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.299
 I said okay and I'm in 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.310
 Germany is to go by default 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.079
 let's continue the station search run 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.680
 if it takes too long to play again 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.659
 just before your video you should 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.299
 search it through and I have 23 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.750
 found transmitter but just finished and 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.760
 I have his transmitter overview there must 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.409
 Let's say the channels back here 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.730
 in the end with the internet in parenthesis the 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.530
 do not work over this normal 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.870
 DVB-T receiver that is some kind of 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.430
 by itself is quite funny 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.530
 Googling what exactly is the band though 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.970
 but can not be recognized on this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.939
 Wise to be received I think there is 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.069
 an internet connection requirement 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:16.949
 is a point in itself above but 17 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.510
 normal dvb t dvb t channels I now 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.639
 I could have an immediate look here too 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.319
 even my program guide invites 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.359
 just in the background i can to 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.220
 example on arte now la strada das 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:33.930
 song of the road watching because you have time 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:35.540
 pure and he sows wonderfully works 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.590
 at first attempt 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.419
 I can now also through the channels 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.870
 You can change a second one here 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.870
 gamble 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.250
 but just as easy the possibility 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.760
 to go back to my show 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.650
 Survey could be easy now 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.060
 program is she watching what i want 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.740
 as nothing to see or even go 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.900
 further I say here we look that 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.790
 Program in detail what is coming 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.620
 this morning the next few days I have 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.340
 a program preview until friday in the 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.720
 moment in there 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.100
 can you already see what i am doing 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.910
 Friday night maybe from crime 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.110
 want to see in which channel 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.090
 Incidentally, I also have the option 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.890
 to record tv shows here but that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.109
 of course not in the background and 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.330
 Timed but you have to if he 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.160
 wanted to record such a show the 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.370
 play live broadcast that is quasi 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.590
 a live recording during the thing 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.970
 runs and then here in the film archive 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.070
 I have not put anything in there yet 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.120
 was nothing recorded at the live 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.420
 Watching TV as we look at each other 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.420
 take a look 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.130
 I can say that anytime now 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.690
 No, I want to pause for a moment and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.830
 then one stops the other offender becomes one 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.860
 buffer now loaded 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.419
 the cache with that now 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.950
 I sent in a cache 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.530
 I can pee if I go back 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.990
 I'm pressing on play here and very accurate 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.400
 where I was earlier, so I have 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.230
 it then between buffer with in it 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.910
 the slow running of the would have in the 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:10.240
 Settings are configurable there 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:14.290
 I'll just look at Frank Schaefer for a moment 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.520
 can say okay okay little 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.140
 memory then but can not 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.850
 To buffer for too long means that if I am 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.150
 now 100 mb / s the presets then 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.200
 Can he give me 38 minutes in the time buffer 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.060
 with pure could go up to 2gb 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.860
 76 minutes buffer accordingly much 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.160
 course is occupied on mine course 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.870
 ipad so you have to be on the basis of the 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.580
 memory size or the free 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.810
 memory size on your ios device 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.360
 maybe adjust if he is more or 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.510
 less volt 100 mb / s the default 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.320
 just four minutes buffer that was it 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:49.090
 big and big to the app double you 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:52.410
 everything else in the text in the article 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.410
 have fun on ifun.de
