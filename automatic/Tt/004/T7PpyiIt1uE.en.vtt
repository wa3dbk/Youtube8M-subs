hi this is Nate from acai I'm here to
show<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.430> analog<00:00:05.910> delay<00:00:06.299> from<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.690> Kai's

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
show you the analog delay from a Kai's

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.060 
show you the analog delay from a Kai's
analog<00:00:07.410> custom<00:00:07.830> shop<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> true<00:00:09.570> bypass

100%<00:00:11.070> analog<00:00:11.460> delay<00:00:11.759> pedal<00:00:12.059> let's<00:00:12.809> take<00:00:12.960> a

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
100% analog delay pedal let's take a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.060 
100% analog delay pedal let's take a
look<00:00:13.139> at<00:00:13.230> our<00:00:13.320> controls<00:00:13.759> our<00:00:14.759> mix<00:00:15.150> knob<00:00:16.070> blends

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
look at our controls our mix knob blends

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.580 
look at our controls our mix knob blends
our<00:00:17.460> clean<00:00:17.940> unaffected<00:00:18.690> guitar<00:00:19.020> signal<00:00:19.439> with

our delayed guitar signal the time knob

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.189 
our delayed guitar signal the time knob
controls<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.310> length<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.090> delay<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.600> our

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
controls the length of the delay and our

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.250 
controls the length of the delay and our
repeat<00:00:25.650> knob<00:00:25.859> controls<00:00:26.279> how<00:00:26.699> long<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.900> delay

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
repeat knob controls how long that delay

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.679 
repeat knob controls how long that delay
will<00:00:28.500> repeat<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.670> also<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> time<00:00:30.300> switch

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
will repeat we also have a time switch

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.380 
will repeat we also have a time switch
that<00:00:31.109> goes<00:00:31.170> between<00:00:31.679> 0<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> 600<00:00:32.640> milliseconds

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that goes between 0 to 600 milliseconds

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
that goes between 0 to 600 milliseconds
and<00:00:33.570> 0<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> 12<00:00:34.260> hundred<00:00:34.440> milliseconds<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and 0 to 12 hundred milliseconds the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:36.979 
and 0 to 12 hundred milliseconds the
first<00:00:36.180> thing<00:00:36.300> we're<00:00:36.450> gonna<00:00:36.510> hear<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
first thing we're gonna hear is the

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.410 
first thing we're gonna hear is the
rhythmic<00:00:37.410> delay<00:00:37.739> like<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> Gilmour<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.090> an<00:00:39.180> edge

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
rhythmic delay like a Gilmour or an edge

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.950 
rhythmic delay like a Gilmour or an edge
delay<00:00:39.870> our<00:00:40.829> mix<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> most<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.239> time

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
delay our mix is most of the way up time

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080 
delay our mix is most of the way up time
is<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.410> under<00:00:43.710> 12<00:00:43.950> o'clock<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> our<00:00:44.670> repeat

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is just under 12 o'clock and our repeat

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.569 
is just under 12 o'clock and our repeat
is<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.510> below<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.809> our<00:00:46.770> time<00:00:47.070> switch<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.430> at

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is just below that our time switch is at

00:00:47.579 --> 00:01:12.820 
is just below that our time switch is at
0<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> 600<00:00:48.239> milliseconds

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.780 

from<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:13.950> we're<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> go<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.370> a<00:01:14.460> slap

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
from here we're going to go to a slap

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.480 
from here we're going to go to a slap
back<00:01:15.030> delay<00:01:15.260> so<00:01:16.260> let's<00:01:16.440> dial<00:01:16.740> our<00:01:16.950> mixed<00:01:17.310> back

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
back delay so let's dial our mixed back

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.750 
back delay so let's dial our mixed back
to<00:01:17.700> about<00:01:17.940> twelve<00:01:18.270> o'clock<00:01:19.100> bring<00:01:20.100> our<00:01:20.280> time

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
to about twelve o'clock bring our time

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.420 
to about twelve o'clock bring our time
back<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.120> bit<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.800> our<00:01:22.920> repeats

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
back a bit as well and then our repeats

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.270 
back a bit as well and then our repeats
are<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.120> just<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.380> from<00:01:26.100> being

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
are going to go just up from being

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.940 
are going to go just up from being
completely<00:01:26.820> down<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.540> our<00:01:28.320> time<00:01:28.560> switch<00:01:28.800> will

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
completely down and our time switch will

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:49.300 
completely down and our time switch will
stay<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.220> zero<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.580> 600<00:01:30.000> milliseconds

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.610 

cool<00:01:50.330> lastly<00:01:51.330> let's<00:01:51.810> go<00:01:51.900> to<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.050> tape<00:01:52.380> echo

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
cool lastly let's go to a tape echo

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.960 
cool lastly let's go to a tape echo
delay<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> let's<00:01:54.420> bring<00:01:54.540> our<00:01:54.690> mix<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.260> bit

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
delay so let's bring our mix up a bit

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.180 
delay so let's bring our mix up a bit
also<00:01:56.970> bring<00:01:57.480> our<00:01:57.660> time<00:01:58.050> down<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.830> can<00:01:58.950> leave<00:01:59.100> it

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
also bring our time down we can leave it

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.510 
also bring our time down we can leave it
about<00:01:59.280> where<00:01:59.580> it<00:01:59.670> was<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.380> our<00:02:01.380> repeat<00:02:01.980> will

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
about where it was and our repeat will

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.250 
about where it was and our repeat will
come<00:02:02.820> up<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.180> we're<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.480> to<00:02:03.540> switch<00:02:03.960> our

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
come up and we're going to switch our

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.050 
come up and we're going to switch our
time<00:02:04.620> switch<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.160> zero<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> twelve<00:02:05.970> hundred

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
time switch to zero to twelve hundred

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:25.280 
time switch to zero to twelve hundred
milliseconds<00:02:06.840> for<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.080> one<00:02:23.990> we<00:02:24.990> increase

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
milliseconds for this one we increase

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.620 
milliseconds for this one we increase
our<00:02:25.440> repeating<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.310> bit<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.210> get<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.540> to

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
our repeating it a bit we can get it to

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:41.000 
our repeating it a bit we can get it to
feedback<00:02:32.300> remove<00:02:33.300> our<00:02:33.450> time<00:02:33.690> knob<00:02:39.800> then<00:02:40.800> back

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
feedback remove our time knob then back

00:02:41.010 --> 00:03:02.300 
feedback remove our time knob then back
up

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.890 

and<00:03:03.310> that's<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.820> analog<00:03:04.270> delay<00:03:04.600> from<00:03:04.810> a
