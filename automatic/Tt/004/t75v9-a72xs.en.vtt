 Hello Hello Hello Hello I thought that we were the only one 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 Shar always thinks, but this time we'll do what I thought it was roulette 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.639
 I will build in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:20.020
 Video ah easy to explain the rules 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:25.150
 I decide the building material block used for construction with roulette, but I am the kind of block class I 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.120
 We do not have enough work that we can tie and build and roulette what we use for interiors 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.450
 Not roulette start 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.450
 20 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.989
 It's a smartphone , and three will be decided from time to time 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.690
 I do not include the love brick in the brick brick 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 Now what will the third be 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.160
 It was wool 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.160
 Well, let's start building using these three .

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.349
 I do not feel

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.210
 One house was built in this empty space 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.530
 It's like this outside 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:04.130
 Let's go round 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:11.240
 The wall was made of red brick and the foundation was on the left bank. 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:14.200
 I could not use the glass, so the windows are full of openness. If this is a sense of liberation , the craftsman is also full. 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:18.070
 Let's go inside 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:24.610
 Open the door through the arch of Sagan 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:26.720
 It is one of the selling points that let the door close automatically when it enters how it feels a sense of life 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.380
 I tried out 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:34.030
 Then from here 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:37.360
 There is such a space where you can spend a day while talking with everyone 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:42.990
 There is also a folding seat and storage is also complete 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:48.700
 And the bed does not feel the height try to be low yet double bed 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:54.720
 Above the bed is decorated as an interior magma which provides light at any time 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.720
 It is also good to spend time while reading a complete book reading space 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.710
 This is the kitchen and the water line is also complete 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.520
 Horizontal chest is a high-performance chest that functions as a refrigerator 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.750
 It is a chest where food does not rot 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:15.629
 And here is a trash bin If you are cooking you will get garbage 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:21.360
 After that, in fact, please take a peek here . Furthermore, this kitchen is fully equipped with old fashioned stove 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:25.510
 You can cook delicious rice There is also a court coat so that customers can come on a rainy day 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:31.480
 By the way, is the box listed the large chest that was next to and what to say even if the house 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:34.450
 Was put in the Kara is a pillar of this water first, there is but feeling of pressure was set a pillar in the brick Takumi's 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:41.000
 I asked for a sense of openness, so I made it into water 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:43.570
 Then I will end the introduction Thank you for watching you look forward to the next time 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.570
 Great
