00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.789

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.490
 Juan Pablo Jaramillo here I will leave you 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:18.220
 his channel and is that these days he launched his 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.589
 first book called the age of the 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.689
 true fulfilling thus one of your dreams 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.669
 I dream that more than one of us 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.189
 we would like to comply and this is a 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.259
 very big achievement for a great person and 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.990
 more because he is an inspiration to 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.350
 many people since Juan is an example of 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.770
 overcoming tenacity and self-acceptance 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.440
 and all that is reflected in this book that 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.020
 it's like a son to him and it's a gift 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.329
 that he makes for everyone to use me healthy in 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.940
 which opens all your heart and your mind 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.460
 and what I like the most is that it is 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.340
 encouraging reading in a world of 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.920
 television to internet and that's why 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.629

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.859
 we can fulfill our dreams if we 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.880
