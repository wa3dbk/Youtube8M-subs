00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 good afternoon, we are the team 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.000
 which will be presented as a final project 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.380
 protein denaturation this 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.420
 is made up of murcia chávez sergio 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.390
 posadas of which they are 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.450
 take gómez alejandro y gonzález

 carlos miranda 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.470
 denaturation of proteins 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.420
 introduction when the protein has not 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.510
 suffered no change in their interaction 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.170
 with the solvent it is said that it presents 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.489
 a native structure is called 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 denaturation of proteins to the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.320
 loss of order structures 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.019
 upper secondary tertiary and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 quaternary being the poly chain 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.430
 peptide reduced to a polymer 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.519
 statistical of none of the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.650
 fixed three-dimensional structures in 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.440
 any protein the structure 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.049
 native and the denatured just 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.140
 they have in common the primary structure 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.390
 that is, the amino acid sequence that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.090
 it is made up of the other levels of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.659
 structural organization disappear in 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.390
 the denatured structure 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.689
 the denaturalization causes various 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.600
 effects on the protein first causes 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.100
 changes in properties 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.500
 hydrodynamics of the protein is 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.499
 increases the viscosity and decreases the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.780
 second diffusion coefficient one 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:38.929
 drastic decrease in solubility 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.479
 since the hydrophobic residues of 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.759
 inside appear on the surface and 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.630
 third the loss of properties 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.460
 biological 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.950
 agents that cause 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.189
 Denaturation of a protein is 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.500
 called agents denatured test is 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.350
 distinguish physical agents with heat 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.009
 and chemicals like detergents and solvents 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.020
 organic ph and ionic strength as in 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.780
 some cases the phenomenon of 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 denaturalization is reversible is 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.860
 possible to precipitate proteins in a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.510
 selective by changes in the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.620
 polarity of solvent strength 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.739
 ionic ph and temperature 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.720
 I experiment one necessary material one 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.720
 clear of an egg and a glass with alcohol 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:35.060
 chicken egg compositions 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.160
 clear 50% has 88 points 0 by 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.850
 Water percent protein concept 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.270
 most relevant point and point 8 of the rest 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:47.209
 the flame occupies 31 percent and occupy 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.840
 account water right and 7.5 of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.380
 proteins between 2.5 fat and 2.0 of 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.020
 rest 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.200
 procedure 1 clarify the egg 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.900
 inside the glass with alcohol 2 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.870
 cover the glass and extract at least half 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.710
 Hour 3 as time goes by 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.780
 observe what happens in the glass 4 lid 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.840
 the glass and vulgar and returns to observe the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.310
 results the protein chains that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.020
 there are in the egg white they are 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.900
 rolled up adopting a spherical shape 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.380
 they are called globular proteins 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.630
 fry 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.090
 or sewing an egg the heat makes the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.190
 protein chains are developed and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.090
 form links that link some chains with 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.920
 others 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.960
 this structure change gives the clear 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.180
 of egg the consistency and color that 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.810
 observe in a cooked egg this 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.460
 process that goes by the name of 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.370
 denaturation can occur from 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.740
 very different ways heating up cooking or 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.380
 fry by whipping the whites or by means of 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.890
 chemical agents like alcohol when detonating 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.670
 etc 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:57.110
 experienced two necessary materials 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.870
 a glass of milk half a lemon that is the 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.290
 Milk milk is a fat emulsion 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.290
 in an aqueous solution of proteins 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.900
 lactose minerals and vitamins milk 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:13.730
 It is composed of 87 percent of 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:18.700
 water a 3.5 of protein a 3.7 of fat 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.560
 a 4.9 of lactose and 1.7 of minerals 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.580
 process 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.060
 one adds the lemon in the glass 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.100
 two 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.580
 shake the glass to show your 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.580
 contents 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.029
 wait some minutes 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.740
 4 observe what happens in the glass that 

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:41.020
 there was no 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.449
 similar to what happens with the 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.630
 I play the habit present in the lemon 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.520
 citric acid is capable of producing the 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.650
 denaturation of the protein 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.650
 called caffeine there was milk
