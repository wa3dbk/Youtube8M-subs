they sometimes contain due to the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
they sometimes contain due to the
manufacturing<00:00:54.930> process<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.829> also<00:00:56.010> helps<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
manufacturing process it also helps to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.479 
manufacturing process it also helps to
create<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.000> fluffier<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.870> richer<00:00:58.260> texture<00:00:58.859> for

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
create a fluffier or richer texture for

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
create a fluffier or richer texture for
the<00:00:59.670> grain<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.480> they're<00:01:00.780> softer<00:01:01.379> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the grain so that they're softer and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.820 
the grain so that they're softer and
ultimately<00:01:02.129> easier<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.940> chew<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.539> digest<00:01:03.830> so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
ultimately easier to chew and digest so

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.609 
ultimately easier to chew and digest so
let's<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.220> started<00:01:05.700> among<00:01:06.420> these<00:01:06.659> four<00:01:07.049> brown

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
let's get started among these four brown

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
let's get started among these four brown
rice<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> only<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.510> should

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
rice is the only one that really should

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.840 
rice is the only one that really should
be<00:01:09.840> soaked<00:01:10.320> while<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> others<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.640> need<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
be soaked while the others just need a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.880 
be soaked while the others just need a
bit<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.299> rinse<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.810> if<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> do<00:01:13.530> soak

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
bit of a rinse because if you do soak

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
bit of a rinse because if you do soak
the<00:01:14.070> others<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.909> might<00:01:15.090> end<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> bit

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
the others you might end up with a bit

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 
the others you might end up with a bit
too<00:01:16.290> mushy<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> texture<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.420> you'll

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

cooked now oats tend to be the dustiest
of<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.640> grains<00:02:22.910> so<00:02:23.600> you<00:02:23.660> might<00:02:23.930> find<00:02:23.959> yourself

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
starts to look more clear you can wrap

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.180 
starts to look more clear you can wrap
it<00:02:45.709> up<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.790> can<00:02:46.970> just<00:02:47.180> use<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> spoon<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.290> pat

down some of the lingering moisture and
then<00:02:53.750> transfer<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.500> bowl

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.410

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
which is technically a seed but we'll

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.020
