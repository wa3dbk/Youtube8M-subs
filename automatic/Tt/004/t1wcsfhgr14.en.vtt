 I'm on vacation like I said but I 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 So you do not work at home 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.190
 and then when I'm at home I do not 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.390
 I'm not at home I'm I 'm pretty 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.210
 taken I want to tell you because

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.100
 or in front of the xbox as you know 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.600
 but no shop nothing at all you also need 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.810
 know that she's a transferred player who 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.789
 have appeared now so 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.010
 I do not know I do not think they have 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.099
 no I do not see any flagrant players 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.120
 then a free pack 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.620
 Be aware that bug servers 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.120
 always a home I do not know I know 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.650
 no I must be cursed they must 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.830
 feel at home that planted anyway 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.150
 at my house it always blocks the servers 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.920
 I do not know what's going on I do not know 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.970
 after you notice it I have a few 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.290
 balls at home in july jean 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.940
 is stuffy the improbable trick 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.590
 ah fucking I have turan who was 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.730
 transferred to the barca but we let the elected 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.019
 version is ethical so it's 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.420
 damage version barça it could have been 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.090
 cool but hey it does not matter how I 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.940
 say I do not know if you saw but 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.790
 also the Turkish player the agreement play there in 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.890
 which is called a silver card 9 5 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.420
 stars the little coy sirti I do not know 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.700
 not how to pronounce at all low I 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.110
 believe he signed to celtic 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.660
 so that can be interesting on smart 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.480
 we shoppe ospina boost this is not it 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.580
 nothing but I think it's worthless 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.470
 not sell if a way to the good ben 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.480
 this is not it's not too bad the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.970
 spina boost I would have preferred a small 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.400
 messi but that's why we're not going 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.390
 to list we will see nkoulou well 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.850
 twice that we have kane it's good 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.600
 schneiderhan my boyfriend here at 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.790
 theme also we will keep also friends 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.380
 this is good so it's a pleasure 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.670
 little boost and that's been a long time 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.350
 I did not have daddy 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.299
 little boost and we will open a pack on 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.950
 free pack 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.480
 that's so shock but if we make a 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.489
 party we sing that morning santala it's going 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.139
 santana for a free pack that's fine and 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.139
 then put the credit we are doing well 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.459
 we are doing well 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:48.230
 so what I was saying is that 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.120
 waited here it is good so also this 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.170
 that I said if you really do not know 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.609
 if you noticed but the market is 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.480
 completely emptying this 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.859
 empty and there was more carding 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.239
 bullard in fact it's simple if you 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.950
 look kind at a di maria office in 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.299
 simple card I'm not talking about a booster 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.680
 or a thomas you find it even more 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.910
 in fact I do not know what is going on 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.470
 to do without the market emptying 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.920
 way market party in ball since 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.420
 long ago 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.280
 it's not a surprise you know 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.959
 but here it was just a little 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.250
 precision I do not know if you 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.049
 have noticed but in any case 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.730
 I noticed star that it not 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.870
 really cool near the cards that are 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.920
 not found for a long time 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.359
 ouallal legends begin to 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.280
 disappear again like a cask a 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.229
 time that all of a sudden it reappears 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.510
 you do not know how we shook the puree 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.310
 wolf 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.590
 so in fact it's random mom I 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.870
 do not know how it goes, but that's it 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.190
 after quentin when you have a new 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.360
 player goes out in the bins good bah I 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.160
 take for example the players 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.890
 transferred from the straw kind to united 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.450
 or stuff like that but actually it 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.440
 have to talk to each other for hours and 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.990
 hours the transfer market for 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.190
 try to grab a player while in 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.900
 in the end we can not do it at all 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.040
 case with the connection me I have and those 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.110
 who must have a collection of nine 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.510
 months you will not arrive at the 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.010
 transfer market so I find that 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.450
 quite stupid he should put himself in 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.020
 up a system of buying players 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.090
 directly 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.530
 Finally, I do not know how there is the 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.120
 buys at the maximum price on the market of 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.100
 transfers but why not introduce 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.140
 a system that will buy them 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.520
 at the maximum price but without going through the 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.020
 transfer market finally I do not know 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.150
 I give ideas the gains after it's 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.600
 that little ideas like that that 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.460
 I guess I think so I do not know 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.570
 frankly that's after we arrive on the 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.910
 end anyway it's the end of a 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.620
 movie 15 is almost done 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.390
 and still means to have fun 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.500
 play with what we have but here is the 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.240
 problem is that we have to talk to each other about 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.160
 hours and hours and necessarily everything 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.690
 the world does not have time there and people 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
 want to play in general so that's it 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.320
 after I understand those who complain 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.970
 those who do not complain after separated 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.190
 each his opinion on each a notice 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.100
 different what I totally respect 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.750
 of course we are not here for 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.850
 all to life otherwise it would be too much 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.410
 easy so for now anyway 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.770
 apart from the final boost we had the 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.920
 cock 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.470
 yes in front of the other goal kaka I want 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:52.610
 to tell you but it does not matter 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:57.240
 continue to the 7th park was going to go and 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:59.430
 we do not pass and we shoppe iniesta 89 to 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.690
 buy our matches it's a pity 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.400
 pleased here is this player good of 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.960
 téhini and courses of pampering enormously 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:08.100
 once this year except when he was 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.990
 back you are tota by other tivola but 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.280
 when I saw the little thing appear 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.560
 I thought this is it is fired up 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.150
 jackpot and we go and munich and but 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.890
 no it does not matter you think it 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.170
 must be worth 5000 credit not even iniesta 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.460
 maintenance and that's how it was at the beginning 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.990
 right now you see your impact like that and 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.280
 müller iniesta telegraph yet 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.950
 frankly I think you're happy serious 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.240
 but the endorsement the end is so I 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.480
 know more these eighths it does not come 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.670
 there now we hit domingo but 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.810
 ricco which is always good against me 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.210
 I'm not paying attention on the lives of 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.350
 transferred players or not 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:42.870
 short, that's it, the receipt is something 

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:45.960
 of madness bar tribe 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.670
 we have already managed all that I think like 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.340
 still long towards two packs at 15,000 the 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.810
 guys and then after that's okay here we are 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.160
 finish in what reassures you it's about 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.770
 these two parks line I think it will be 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.890
 one of the latest opening was on packs 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.110
 And we had a player transferred on 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.360
 had at 2.6 to galatasaray who owes nothing 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.100
 worth I think frolics will arrive 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.900
 German 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.900
 I do not know if it's a couch 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.930

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:17.940

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:19.920
 it's settled here so with respect to 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.480
 gone for the last pack maybe the 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.450
 last pack 2 fifa that result 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.890
 imatinib before the packs part of 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.420
 success so here it goes 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.820

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:33.180
 pack go christmann give me heavy 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.670
 it's now or never if it's buggy 

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.940
 it's a good sign 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:41.910

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.400

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.450
 claudie cracks again hi 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.840

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:52.200

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.460
 noble 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.720
 we meet right away because we 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.430
 is not even able to open a pack 

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.880
 so the pacs was open and we have a 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:02.330
 Lake Tahoe Line 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.560

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.000
 the little boost we had here is 

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.690
 nothing exceptional but it makes 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.310
 always happy 

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.780
 it was that the pi take care of you one 

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.780
