 my name is jaume camps and i am seat 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.210
 i 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.980
 we test so much of cold in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.980
 winter in northern europe with 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.110
 temperatures that can reach up to 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.739
 40 degrees below zero and on ice and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.019
 snow up and up to places like this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.800
 where we temperatures above 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:54.800
 40 degrees 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.550
 I really believe that the people of the public 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.290
 in general, you can not imagine how much 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.890
 tests we do in a vehicle before 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.540
 that it reaches your hands 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.909
 we need to test the cars 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.300
 in extreme temperature conditions or 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.710
 from before to ensure that we cover 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.140
 all the conditions in which 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.040
 can find any driver 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.230
 specifically here in the summer test 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.040
 we make about 20,000 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.680
 kilometers with each project 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.670
 We are evaluating the duration of the 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.380
 air filter to the engine we are 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.030
 also assessing for example the 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.070
 leak tightness of the car how can 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.020
 affect the dust to the functionality of 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.330
 systems assistance 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.950
 driving a technician who does this 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.840
 type of evidence has to first of 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.450
 all like cars be a 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.820
 little passionate about their work and having 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.040
 good flexibility and ability to 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.350
 adapt to these conditions we have 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.930
 people that for example are doing 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.970
 tests for more than two hours stuck 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.440
 inside a car at 670 degrees 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.170
 temperature 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.650
 we also do tests for example in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.280
 russia tests in china in mexico in 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.910
 morocco argentina brazil usa north and 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.520
 south of africa we move to these 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.620
 countries to ensure that the vehicle is 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.610
 adapts to the specific conditions of 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.610
 each one these markets 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.489
 I had a boss who told me jauma you have 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.630
