what<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.640> think

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
what do you think about this you think

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.459 
what do you think about this you think
it's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> good<00:00:36.120> idea<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.540> keep<00:00:36.750> boys<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> girls

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it's a good idea to keep boys and girls

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.020 
it's a good idea to keep boys and girls
separate<00:00:37.920> when<00:00:38.160> they're<00:00:38.309> getting<00:00:38.489> their

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.100 
education
I<00:00:40.250> think<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.370> parents<00:00:41.730> choose<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.899> that's

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
I think if parents choose that that's

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.959 
I think if parents choose that that's
the<00:00:43.350> educational<00:00:44.010> environment<00:00:44.100> they'd<00:00:44.670> like

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
the educational environment they'd like

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.240 
the educational environment they'd like
to<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.870> their<00:00:46.020> children<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.680> could<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
to have for their children it could be a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.680 
to have for their children it could be a
good<00:00:47.579> intervention<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.360> could<00:00:48.480> help

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
good intervention that could help

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.529 
good intervention that could help
children<00:00:49.530> achieve<00:00:49.649> more<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.520> learn<00:00:51.210> better

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
children achieve more and learn better

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.400 
children achieve more and learn better
why<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.710> think<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.570> basically<00:00:54.570> there's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
why do you think that basically there's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.630 
why do you think that basically there's
qualitative<00:00:56.390> evidence<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.629> shows<00:00:57.930> that

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
qualitative evidence that shows that

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.290 
qualitative evidence that shows that
kids<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.940> different<00:01:00.920> environments<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.910> less

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
kids in different environments with less

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.140 
kids in different environments with less
distractions<00:01:03.960> such<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.229> single<00:01:04.890> sex<00:01:05.189> classes

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
distractions such as single sex classes

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.510 
distractions such as single sex classes
can<00:01:06.990> learn<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.130> learn<00:01:08.340> in

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
can learn more or they learn in

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.770 
can learn more or they learn in
different<00:01:08.580> ways<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.510> pay<00:01:09.689> attention

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
different ways or they pay attention

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.740 
different ways or they pay attention
more<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.530> concentrate<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.510> can

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
more they concentrate more so it can

educational world today but it is one

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
in that environment look for what do you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
in that environment look for what do you
think<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
think I think that this really is a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.590 
think I think that this really is a
band-aid<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.250> particular<00:01:29.490> problem<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.450> we

really have fundamentally our schools

really have fundamentally our schools
are<00:01:32.729> broken<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.180> all<00:01:33.299> know<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
are broken we all know that I think the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.649 
are broken we all know that I think the
best<00:01:34.979> choice<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.310> parents<00:01:35.790> would<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.479> know

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
best choice for parents would be to know

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.170 
best choice for parents would be to know
that<00:01:36.930> their<00:01:37.140> children<00:01:37.619> would<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:38.040> able<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.970> go

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that their children would be able to go

that their children would be able to go
