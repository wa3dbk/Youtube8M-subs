00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.080
 let's go to the camp of the cougars 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.799
 of the university because there it is 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.090
 Gilberto Palafox for good afternoon 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.559
 hello hello from such a taste 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.809
 university city the team of 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.849
 pumas is still preparing to visit 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.890
 this Saturday to jaguares de chiapas pumas 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.720
 are last place in the general table with 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.180
 only 8 units and the team of jaguars 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.010
 march in seventh with 20 points the 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.900
 Puma players' feeling is 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.269
 of debt embarrassment with the hobby with 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.980
 the directive we are going to listen to martín 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.019
 bravo that says embarrassed by this 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.820
 bad season also says that if they have 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.380
 have to leave some national players or 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.450
 foreigners have it well- deserved 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.270
 because they already learned that the directive 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.520
 of cougars and looking for a name forward 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.440
 Ismael soda a Chilean who plays in the 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.390
 catholic university this is martín 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.829
 bravo until sometimes the shame does not 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.690
 speak why 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.909
 No results get us 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.000
 we keep talking and the only thing we do 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:56.829
 is to speak it then we must talk to 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.690
 people or with the media because they are not 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.000
 As they have results, we are in a 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.350
 very big debt with people be with 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.420
 ourselves with the team of the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.659
 institution the truth that this tournament has 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.729
 been very bad for everyone and it's done 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.060
 the best for this team what 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.979
 They are looking is not like I say 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.290
 it is logical is not logical for the passage the 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.530
 team by the passage of each player 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 this is the terrible they deserve 7 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.450
 they will make it additive that we 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.780
 we make the effort to be nobody 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.780
 wants 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.820
 What we have left to do is work 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.009
 much this show the technician to 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.929
 technical management body that does not 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.600
 we deserve to be in cougars and good after 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.000
 since it was his hand yes that is the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.079
 continuity of each form well there the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.789
 words of martín bravo now 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.520
 we heard ariel nahuelpán that today 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.140
 he turned 26 he received some 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.060
 gifts from the fans that came the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.740
 miserable university and ariel 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.289
 nahuelpán says that it's everyone's fault 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.040
 not just the foreigners the team 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.660
 is composed love 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.200
 with many players in different 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.670
 positions I think 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.670
 each one has to fulfill its function 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.319
 unfortunately I think that when a 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.620
 team is wrong falls on 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.230
 it falls on foreigners I 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.569
 I feel calm, I know I can give a lot 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.180
 plus 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.900
 we will see that collectively we improve 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.659
 also like for that individual one 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.969
 I can get the best I can decide who 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.940
 is going to whoever wants to drive I am 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:37.230
 a bad player that comes to add 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.910
 and treat each other the best every day and so 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.710
 things in pumas a feeling of 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.910
 embarrassment that players have for 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.280
 the terrible campaign they have had 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.340
 we return to the studio good 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.110
 afternoons thank you liberto palafox it is 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.340
 the minimum that you would expect from this 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.000
 type of players who had a 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.000
 little bit of shame
