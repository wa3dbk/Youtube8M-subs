00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.950
 called faith in my blog this application is 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 to record that he has and has a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.580
 multitude of options good at first 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.990
 instead of that he had to say that this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 application is exactly what I 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.720
 I have 100 thousand but it is not in the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.189
 appstore right now in the appstore 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 are these two more the new list 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.550
 cansahcab and another global and 360 center 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.250
 what is this that I have is not me 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.469
 I also have this one in truth and it is 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.810
 good but do not have the same options 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:36.000
 which has the other if you want to get 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.820
 this is how I have you will need to have the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.440
 grass and you have downloaded and please 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.570
 contact and when ye please do 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.660
 you look in here and you'll have it 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.790
 well now I will teach the options and 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.930
 how does it work 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.630
 well now we are here in the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.120
 application from within vale we have 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.280
 a lot down here a lot of options 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.370
 that obvious teaching one by one so that 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.410
 you know how good he is doing here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.980
 is to focus is worth I think that all 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.750
 You'll know that when you've stopped better, you see 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.930
 that you already have the perfect focus if 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.580
 you press here the east button of the focus 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.530
 it will stay in red that's what 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.320
 means that even if you move it, 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.780
 you will move the focus you have this 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.990
 little ball that is for the brightness to catch 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.460
 more light from where you go pointing it 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.080
 you do not have much because with this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.430
 camera you will not notice but it 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.440
 they shrink a lot very much the brightness and you 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.200
 removes a lot of light supposes the most light as 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.960
 you see you have the same option to click 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.590
 in it the focus was no longer 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.540
 and the third option that we have here of 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.380
 camera stability I never the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.820
 used 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.190
 well if it works well well not good 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.560
 between the fourth place we have been 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.270
 here that is the zoom speed here 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.100
 you see that social I have it 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 five lines is to go more 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.160
 fast still much slower I usually 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.160
 have five hairlines 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.240
 this one here is the camera for 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.370
 put the front to the back you have 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.619
 this here that stops when he wants 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.180
 record if you want to record with bus or remove 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.520
 the american voice that next 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:15.050
 you know you have this pot that is the 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.510
 the voice if you click, it does not come out 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:21.110
 in third place we have here the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.620
 squares the little squares you see here 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.629
 it will be a line of approaches and you will see 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.520
 this option is for the videos if 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:35.450
 you have any been done or send them 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.230
 and well here we have the adjustments have 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.840
 a variety adjustment is worth this pixels 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.300
 Okay, yes 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.099
 you have here I am I these options very 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.530
 well I do not understand them I know that if we click 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.390
 here they go much slower I leave it as 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.250
 was and is in 30 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.040
 have the camera if you want the front 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.090
 or the frontal the sport mode if you want 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.090
 that turns alone 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.000
 the resolution is worth I have it in 1920 x 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.000
 1080 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.770
 here we have the zoom in case we want it 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.770
 activate or desactivate 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.390
 the retina that good to sensitivity me 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.540
 I do not touch it, I have it as it has 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.550
 some this, yes, you put the 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.700
 square in a box a circle there is 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.230
 a lot of variety of options and already 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.060
 that here I do not recommend you to do it 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.489
 how exactly is it good 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.920
 ok this is the option we have these 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.440
 three options that are like three channels 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.030
 valley and in one you have some 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.400
 options in the second you can put 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.020
 other options and in the third one another if 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.700
 you will see right now in the second me 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.040
 I have the options that I go to the 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.660
 camera gives like in slow motion worth you see 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.090
 that now he passed his hand behind me 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.370
 how is it going 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.080
 like in slow motion and that happened just 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.599
 right now to have the one that is here 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.250
 we have totally configured and 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.260
 well let's do it is a 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.920
 show vale here has this to me 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.300
 I really like it because the camera is good 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.700
 the video and you can not do it while 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.580
 this theory because they have the option 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.420
 to zoom in on what to stop 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:17.690
 put it here and what I like very much 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.280
 which is that if you are right now you are in 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.130
 this position and want to return to it 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.700
 look good you give some west and 7 creates 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.700
 few dots 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.130
 you give him some again and come back to him 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.920
 could mark the 2 also and already 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.780
 last the 3 and so you do not have to go 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.280
 squeezing if you want they did one squeeze 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.930
 is 1 and directly goes to that 1 is a 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.090
 very good valid I can go like this 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.030
 you'll have to be leaving in tight and 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.820
 Well, you see that it focuses a lot 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.440
 well everything and put for the videos of 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.320
 youtube in case you want to go see with 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.600
 your iphone or ipad I recommend you to use 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.640
 this application is very good and 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.430
 will get very little very good 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.710
 quality I at the moment in fact do not 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.910
 I have because as I do not always have not 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.560
 I can do it 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.920
 but by demonstrating a 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.380
 video to make a quick video 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.050
 I have the volume maybe it's worth it so that 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.810
 bother me well I'm doing here the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.490
 zoom to show a little and you will see that 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.580
 they do not go away much the letters look 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.440
 pretty well you see that it looks good and I 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.930
 I really like it 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.660
 and well , if you already see that, I 'll do that 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.870
 and already if it is to your videos and I tended 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.880
 it is already there I would show it we are going to see how 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.880
 the video would 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880
 play 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.280
 and it would start to not do not take away the video the 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.280
 volume 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.690
 that does not look 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.590
 and good 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.240
 that's all the obligation is worth if you 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.000
 I recommend a lot in this video if you have 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.949
 Any doubt about this application 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.789
 tell me in the comments and I will 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:10.770
 I will help everything I can and good 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.599
 I hope you liked this 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.430
 protection is a I like without majors in 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.560
 keep uploading videos subscribe for 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.780
