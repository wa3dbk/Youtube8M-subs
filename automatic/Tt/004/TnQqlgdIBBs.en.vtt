not least the way this thing is really

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.050 
not least the way this thing is really
really<00:01:37.110> thin<00:01:37.320> really<00:01:37.860> lightweight<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.310> find<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
really thin really lightweight I find it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.999 
really thin really lightweight I find it
hard<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.329> believe<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.840> even<00:01:40.049> 2.62

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
hard to believe that it's even 2.62

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.620 
hard to believe that it's even 2.62
pounds<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.460> feels<00:01:41.640> lighter<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.299> tell<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
pounds it feels lighter to tell you the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.230 
pounds it feels lighter to tell you the
truth<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> what<00:01:44.250> word<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
truth but that is what word is on the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.219 
truth but that is what word is on the
street<00:01:45.390> 2.2<00:01:46.759> 2.62<00:01:47.759> pounds<00:01:48.390> that's<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.840> all

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
