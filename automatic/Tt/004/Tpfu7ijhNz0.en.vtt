you didn't see it you can also find it

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:55.950 
you didn't see it you can also find it
on<00:00:20.150> this<00:00:20.270> link<00:00:20.539> below

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.720 

after<00:00:56.960> posting<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:57.500> video<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:58.160> have<00:00:58.579> some

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
after posting that video I have some

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.689 
after posting that video I have some
comments<00:00:58.969> some<00:00:59.780> questions<00:01:00.289> by<00:01:00.440> email<00:01:00.829> about

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
comments some questions by email about

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.509 
comments some questions by email about
the<00:01:01.850> thumb<00:01:02.059> jumps<00:01:02.449> then<00:01:03.409> also<00:01:03.559> what<00:01:04.129> happened

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
the thumb jumps then also what happened

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.600 
the thumb jumps then also what happened
at<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.759> end<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.210> verse<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:05.840> top<00:01:06.049> plays

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
at the end of the verse when top plays

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.710 
at the end of the verse when top plays
so<00:01:07.610> that's<00:01:07.790> we're<00:01:08.000> going<00:01:08.119> to<00:01:08.180> look<00:01:08.240> at<00:01:08.390> today

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
so that's we're going to look at today

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.840 
so that's we're going to look at today
in<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.560> middle<00:01:09.890> of<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.070> verse<00:01:10.220> there's<00:01:10.729> a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
in the middle of the verse there's a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:24.810 
in the middle of the verse there's a
little<00:01:11.479> section<00:01:11.869> like<00:01:12.110> this

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.160 

with<00:01:25.820> a<00:01:25.850> thumb<00:01:26.119> jumps<00:01:26.450> across<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.869> strings

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
with a thumb jumps across the strings

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.560 
with a thumb jumps across the strings
slightly<00:01:28.070> out<00:01:28.189> of<00:01:28.399> time<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:29.030> makes<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.420> kind

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
slightly out of time and makes the kind

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.289 
slightly out of time and makes the kind
of<00:01:29.719> a<00:01:29.810> syncopated<00:01:30.409> beat<00:01:30.939> we're<00:01:31.939> going<00:01:32.060> to<00:01:32.149> take

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
of a syncopated beat we're going to take

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.200 
of a syncopated beat we're going to take
a<00:01:32.329> look<00:01:32.539> at<00:01:32.689> this<00:01:32.810> first<00:01:33.110> then<00:01:34.100> after<00:01:34.219> this<00:01:34.520> we

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
a look at this first then after this we

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.480 
a look at this first then after this we
don't<00:01:35.390> look<00:01:35.450> at<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.689> end<00:01:35.810> section<00:01:36.490> the

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
don't look at the end section the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.480 
don't look at the end section the
intersection<00:01:38.060> goes<00:01:38.240> like<00:01:38.450> this

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.500 

so<00:01:46.490> we're<00:01:46.610> going<00:01:46.730> to<00:01:46.790> take<00:01:46.940> a<00:01:47.000> look<00:01:47.240> at<00:01:47.330> what's

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
so we're going to take a look at what's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.860 
so we're going to take a look at what's
happening<00:01:48.050> there<00:01:48.880> first<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.000> all<00:01:50.120> let's<00:01:50.810> look

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
happening there first of all let's look

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.270 
happening there first of all let's look
at<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.080> thumb<00:01:51.350> jumps<00:01:51.770> that<00:01:51.920> we're<00:01:52.070> seeing

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
at the thumb jumps that we're seeing

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.680 
at the thumb jumps that we're seeing
Doc's<00:01:52.580> playing<00:01:52.940> in<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.210> middle<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.630> verse

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
Doc's playing in the middle of the verse

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.360 
Doc's playing in the middle of the verse
first<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.840> all<00:01:56.960> our<00:01:57.410> played<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:57.950> something

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
first of all our played at something

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:09.290 
first of all our played at something
like<00:01:58.490> normal<00:01:59.030> speed

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.509 

now<00:02:10.300> let's<00:02:10.599> slow<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:10.929> down<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.290> little<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:12.220> take

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
now let's slow it down a little and take

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.550 
now let's slow it down a little and take
a<00:02:12.550> look<00:02:12.790> at<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> right<00:02:13.209> hand<00:02:13.450> again<00:02:13.599> with<00:02:14.470> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
a look at the right hand again with the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:25.200 
a look at the right hand again with the
tablature

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:37.250 

I'm<00:02:26.210> now<00:02:26.540> for<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.780> left<00:02:26.990> hand

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.770 

as<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.560> can<00:02:38.710> probably<00:02:38.860> detect<00:02:39.550> I<00:02:39.910> didn't<00:02:40.660> miss

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
as you can probably detect I didn't miss

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.390 
as you can probably detect I didn't miss
out<00:02:40.960> some<00:02:41.230> of<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.440> thumb<00:02:41.650> jumps<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.250> use

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
out some of the thumb jumps and I use

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.690 
out some of the thumb jumps and I use
two<00:02:42.670> fingers<00:02:43.120> instead<00:02:44.280> sometimes<00:02:45.280> we<00:02:45.430> have<00:02:45.580> to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
two fingers instead sometimes we have to

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.640 
two fingers instead sometimes we have to
do<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.000> because<00:02:46.240> we<00:02:46.690> can't<00:02:46.930> all<00:02:47.170> play<00:02:47.200> like

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
do this because we can't all play like

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.770 
do this because we can't all play like
Doc<00:02:47.890> Watson<00:02:48.270> but<00:02:49.270> at<00:02:49.360> least<00:02:49.480> we<00:02:49.660> can

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
Doc Watson but at least we can

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.200 
Doc Watson but at least we can
appreciate<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:50.680> these<00:02:50.830> guys<00:02:51.100> did<00:02:51.460> and<00:02:51.700> try

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
appreciate what these guys did and try

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.700 
appreciate what these guys did and try
and<00:02:52.330> incorporate<00:02:52.570> some<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.290> techniques

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
and incorporate some of the techniques

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.820 
and incorporate some of the techniques
into<00:02:54.100> our<00:02:54.250> playing<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.930> can't<00:02:56.170> hope<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.440> copy

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
into our playing we can't hope to copy

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.520 
into our playing we can't hope to copy
all<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.400> old<00:02:57.670> Greek<00:02:57.880> guitarists<00:02:58.690> because

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
all of the old Greek guitarists because

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.070 
all of the old Greek guitarists because
we<00:02:59.710> don't<00:02:59.890> have<00:03:00.040> enough<00:03:00.220> lifetimes<00:03:00.960> but<00:03:01.960> at

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
we don't have enough lifetimes but at

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.910 
we don't have enough lifetimes but at
least<00:03:02.290> we<00:03:02.380> can<00:03:02.470> appreciate<00:03:02.830> their<00:03:03.280> genius<00:03:04.920> now

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
least we can appreciate their genius now

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.770 
least we can appreciate their genius now
let's<00:03:06.160> take<00:03:06.340> a<00:03:06.370> look<00:03:06.640> at<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.210> end<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.600> thumb

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
let's take a look at the end the thumb

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:39.840 
let's take a look at the end the thumb
rolls

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:59.110
