going to do my brows and I'm just
working<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.869> brows<00:01:10.049> straight<00:01:10.710> across

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
working the brows straight across

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.590 
working the brows straight across

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
because her brows are a little bit

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.789 
because her brows are a little bit
straighter<00:01:12.960> than<00:01:13.200> mine<00:01:14.930> taking<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.350> well

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
straighter than mine taking a very well

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.100 
straighter than mine taking a very well
sharpened<00:01:17.520> pencil<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.780> short

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.050 
sharpened pencil I want to do short
little<00:01:19.409> strokes<00:01:19.740> working<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> direction

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
little strokes working in the direction

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
little strokes working in the direction
of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> hairs<00:01:21.710> it's<00:01:22.710> very<00:01:23.040> important<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
of the hairs it's very important that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.310 
of the hairs it's very important that
this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:24.000> sharpened<00:01:24.509> because<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:24.990> it's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
this is well sharpened because if it's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.320 
this is well sharpened because if it's
too<00:01:25.560> dull<00:01:25.860> you'll<00:01:26.490> get<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> thicker

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
too dull you'll get kind of thicker

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.050 
too dull you'll get kind of thicker
lines<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.960> won't<00:01:28.140> look<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.439> natural<00:01:28.970> taking<00:01:29.970> an

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
lines it won't look as natural taking an

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
lines it won't look as natural taking an
angled<00:01:30.509> brush<00:01:30.659> I'm<00:01:30.990> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> blend<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.890> in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
angled brush I'm going to blend this in

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.219 
angled brush I'm going to blend this in
just<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:33.180> look<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.780> have<00:01:33.960> too

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
just so we don't look like we have too

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.780 
just so we don't look like we have too
