thing we're going to do is tie down the
tack<00:01:47.920> on<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.940> first<00:01:49.210> loop<00:01:49.480> and<00:01:49.750> we<00:01:50.260> want<00:01:50.440> to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
tack on the first loop and we want to

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.280 
tack on the first loop and we want to
try<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.710> get<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:52.120> couple<00:01:52.630> good<00:01:52.780> wraps

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
try to get this a couple good wraps

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.990 
try to get this a couple good wraps
around<00:01:53.530> there<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.130> we<00:01:54.280> want<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.550> try<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.760> get

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
around there and we want to try to get

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.930 
around there and we want to try to get
it<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:55.570> it's<00:01:55.720> just<00:01:55.990> about<00:01:56.260> an<00:01:56.500> inch<00:01:57.100> off<00:01:57.400> of<00:01:57.430> the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
it so it's just about an inch off of the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.050 
it so it's just about an inch off of the
off<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:59.140> the<00:02:01.440> off<00:02:02.440> of<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:02.950> tack<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.460> then

off of the off of the tack and then

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.280 
off of the off of the tack and then
we'll<00:02:04.240> go<00:02:04.450> ahead<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.810> tie<00:02:05.260> this<00:02:05.320> off<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:11.050> it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
we'll go ahead and tie this off and it

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.190 
we'll go ahead and tie this off and it
will<00:02:11.380> go<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.740> second<00:02:12.130> loop<00:02:12.870> when<00:02:13.870> we<00:02:13.990> have

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
will go to the second loop when we have

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.860 
will go to the second loop when we have
the<00:02:14.320> tack<00:02:14.590> tied<00:02:15.520> on<00:02:15.700> here<00:02:15.910> properly<00:02:16.240> we<00:02:16.690> do

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
the tack tied on here properly we do

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.600 
the tack tied on here properly we do
want<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> try<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.440> keep<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.040> bulk<00:02:18.220> down<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
want to try to keep the bulk down to a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.030 
want to try to keep the bulk down to a
minimum<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.300> we<00:02:19.360> want<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.170> to<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
minimum and we want this to so that the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.860 
minimum and we want this to so that the
sail<00:02:21.250> will<00:02:21.550> actually<00:02:21.940> lay<00:02:22.209> flat<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:22.600> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
sail will actually lay flat on the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.070 
sail will actually lay flat on the
mandrel<00:02:23.200> as<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.560> mandrel<00:02:23.920> turns<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.660> second

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
mandrel as the mandrel turns the second

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.960 
mandrel as the mandrel turns the second
one<00:02:26.170> back<00:02:26.350> here<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:27.100> going<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.550> to

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
one back here is just going to be to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.590 
one back here is just going to be to
adjust<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.830> luff<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.940> bolt<00:02:31.120> rope<00:02:31.330> so

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
adjust the the luff and the bolt rope so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.320 
adjust the the luff and the bolt rope so
that<00:02:31.630> it'll<00:02:31.810> drop<00:02:32.050> straight<00:02:32.350> down<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.700> this

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
that it'll drop straight down so this

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.780 
that it'll drop straight down so this
one<00:02:34.570> can<00:02:34.750> either<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.200> moved<00:02:35.440> forward<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.220> tied

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
one can either be moved forward and tied

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.420 
one can either be moved forward and tied
to<00:02:37.030> adjust<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.540> forward<00:02:38.019> or<00:02:38.560> if<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:39.160> already

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
to adjust it forward or if it's already

the boom and tie on the clew it's
important<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.940> when<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.239> do<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:23.080> we

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
important that when we do this that we

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.860 
important that when we do this that we
try<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.440> get<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.920> clew<00:03:24.220> of<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.400> sail<00:03:24.510> down<00:03:25.510> to

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
try to get the clew of the sail down to

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.130 
try to get the clew of the sail down to
a<00:03:26.410> point<00:03:26.980> off<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.459> mandrel<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:28.060> same<00:03:28.330> as<00:03:28.600> the

a point off the mandrel the same as the
tack<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.670> best<00:03:30.849> way<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.270> this<00:03:31.450> is<00:03:31.660> tie

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
tack and the best way to do this is tie

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.010 
tack and the best way to do this is tie
a<00:03:31.840> bowline<00:03:32.140> or<00:03:32.560> in

back the other way and just keep

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.890 
back the other way and just keep
wrapping<00:04:01.460> through<00:04:01.850> it'll<00:04:02.210> twist<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.840> we

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
wrapping through it'll twist it and we

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.480 
wrapping through it'll twist it and we

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
want to try to get away from that so we

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.640 
want to try to get away from that so we
want<00:04:04.610> to<00:04:04.730> try<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:04.940> go<00:04:05.180> up<00:04:05.660> through<00:04:06.080> back<00:04:06.350> around

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
want to try to go up through back around

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.000 
want to try to go up through back around
up<00:04:07.010> through<00:04:07.460> back<00:04:07.760> around<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.740> then<00:04:09.740> tie<00:04:09.980> it

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
up through back around and then tie it

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.980 
up through back around and then tie it
off<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:11.000> other<00:04:11.120> thing<00:04:11.300> that's<00:04:11.450> important<00:04:11.900> to

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
off the other thing that's important to

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.860 
off the other thing that's important to
remember<00:04:12.080> is<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.830> this<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:14.120> handles<00:04:14.630> all

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
remember is that this this handles all

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.990 
remember is that this this handles all
the<00:04:15.110> leech<00:04:15.290> loads<00:04:15.620> of<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.980> sail<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.850> it's

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
the leech loads of the sail so it's

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.310 
the leech loads of the sail so it's
important<00:04:17.360> that<00:04:17.390> it<00:04:17.570> goes<00:04:17.720> around<00:04:18.080> the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
important that it goes around the

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.830 
important that it goes around the
mandrel<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.920> there's<00:04:19.520> enough<00:04:19.940> wraps<00:04:20.270> in<00:04:20.540> here

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.780 
mandrel and there's enough wraps in here
to<00:04:21.020> equal<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.680> load<00:04:22.250> that's<00:04:22.520> going<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.730> be

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
to equal the load that's going to be

can replicate these positions when we

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:17.769 
can replicate these positions when we

reestablished this in the spring then

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:19.479 
reestablished this in the spring then
that'll<00:06:18.049> take<00:06:18.229> a<00:06:18.259> lot<00:06:18.469> of<00:06:18.649> the<00:06:18.739> trouble<00:06:19.189> of

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:19.489 
that'll take a lot of the trouble of

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:22.569 
that'll take a lot of the trouble of
trying<00:06:20.149> to<00:06:20.269> set<00:06:20.449> this<00:06:20.539> up<00:06:20.689> initially<00:06:21.169> so<00:06:21.589> if

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:22.579 
trying to set this up initially so if

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:25.029 
trying to set this up initially so if
everything<00:06:22.909> is<00:06:22.999> working<00:06:23.029> in<00:06:23.449> the<00:06:23.539> fall<00:06:24.039> make
