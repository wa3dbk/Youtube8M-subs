some<00:02:48.460> seam<00:02:48.700> binding<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.300> for<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.440> used<00:02:51.130> a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
some seam binding and for that I used a

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.660 
some seam binding and for that I used a
Lindy's<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.860> mountain<00:02:53.860> lavender<00:02:54.760> gold<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
Lindy's in mountain lavender gold and it

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.740 
Lindy's in mountain lavender gold and it
matched<00:02:58.120> perfectly<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.320> paint<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
matched perfectly to the paint and the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.300 
matched perfectly to the paint and the
paper<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:02.800> was<00:03:03.190> really<00:03:03.340> happy<00:03:03.610> about<00:03:03.790> that

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
paper so I was really happy about that

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.390 
paper so I was really happy about that
so<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.340> just<00:03:06.460> did<00:03:06.880> one<00:03:07.060> of<00:03:07.090> my<00:03:07.300> bows<00:03:07.510> again<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.400> I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
so I just did one of my bows again and I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.390 
so I just did one of my bows again and I
tied<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.700> around<00:03:10.000> with<00:03:10.630> some<00:03:10.930> of<00:03:11.080> this

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
tied it around with some of this

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.370 
tied it around with some of this
cream-colored<00:03:12.430> lace<00:03:13.090> from<00:03:13.420> lavish<00:03:13.750> laces<00:03:14.140> I

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
cream-colored lace from lavish laces I

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.460 
cream-colored lace from lavish laces I
attached<00:03:15.390> this<00:03:16.390> Muse<00:03:16.750> token<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.260> says

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470

bow<00:03:20.470> with<00:03:20.650> a<00:03:20.680> garment<00:03:20.950> pin<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.330> thought<00:03:22.600> that

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
bow with a garment pin so I thought that

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.930

matched<00:05:18.129> the<00:05:18.580> ivory<00:05:19.060> color

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389

matched the ivory color
and<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:22.000> matched<00:05:22.210> the<00:05:22.360> ivory<00:05:22.659> color<00:05:22.810> of<00:05:23.169> the

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
and it matched the ivory color of the

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.379 
and it matched the ivory color of the
background<00:05:24.219> paper<00:05:24.610> as<00:05:25.029> well<00:05:25.449> as<00:05:25.689> these<00:05:26.680> ivory

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
background paper as well as these ivory

edges of the butterflies and the flowers
okay<00:05:34.930> and<00:05:35.409> I<00:05:35.440> think<00:05:35.500> that's<00:05:35.800> it<00:05:36.509> for<00:05:37.509> the<00:05:37.629> front

okay and I think that's it for the front

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:48.499 
okay and I think that's it for the front
or<00:05:38.409> for<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:38.919> top<00:05:39.099> and<00:05:39.430> then<00:05:40.029> inside<00:05:44.610> see
