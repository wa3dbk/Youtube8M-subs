00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.500
 good 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.920
 a more vertical space we come to talk 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.369
 of skiing in Europe has 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.870
 started the winter and has started 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.250
 what a snowing way very much 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.680
 happy in any case for that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.660
 climatology that we all now hope 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 but I'm not here to talk about that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 I'm here to talk about a new drop 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.140
 of a new boot of the agent dina fitz 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.690
 that the last years you all know that 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.239
 they are really making progress 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.579
 exceptional in the product line and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.680
 very much quality and very well designed 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.320
 for this winter they present us with a 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.260
 boot that is an ideal boot for good 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.719
 skier or the touring skier is 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.759
 skier that what he is looking for is to move 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.260
 for the mountain that does not have excessive 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:13.250
 hurry but what 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.080
 look for many guarantees what do you mean 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.390
 many guarantees seek comfort avoid 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.600
 Sores on the feet as a result of 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.880
 chafing and looking to take the feet 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.100
 hot in cold conditions this 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.630
 boot gives us those guarantees in what way 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.790
 gives us the guarantees we will go into 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.770
 matter gives us the guarantees because 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.950
 takes a booty called manual form 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.930
 or more and has the particularity that 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.620
 thanks to the heat generated by our 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.110
 body adapts to the ways of our 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.350
 skin what do you mean 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.930
 it's a question we would say very very very 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.630
 basic very very very easy to understand 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.360
 it means that when we have 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.460
 a foot wide this booty will give of itself 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.110
 in that area but instead the zones 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.330
 that we have the narrowest foot we are 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.910
 will adapt perfectly that gives us 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.670
 much comfort and at the same time they give us 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.000
 very good thermal thanks to having a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.090
 thick more than obvious is a booty that 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.640
 can weigh a little more 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.200
 the thermo formal boots but the 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.140
 Difference in weight is very little 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.960
 significant more questions about this 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.750
 boot is a note that is of three closures 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.150
 and it has the peculiarity that even being 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.790
 a three-zip boot keeps one 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.220
 stiffness similar to four boots 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.510
 closes how do we get this what 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.370
 we got thanks to the cane is cane 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.320
 incorporates a closure that they call ultra 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.890
 logo that is the closing a blunderbuss 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.390
 prefers a translator without double closing 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.740
 hammer to say it somehow or 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.350
 dual use 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.070
 on the one hand it tightens and on the other hand 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.290
 blocks as it blocks thanks to a 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.790
 pin system in the back that 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.220
 fits between two areas of the boot to cane 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.680
 in the upper part and in the part 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.990
 inside we would have another piece so 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.000
 that when we close lakers blocks 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.410
 completely this rod and it gives us a lot 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.080
 rigidity so that we can support 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.110
 all our weight in the front and 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.650
 be able to drive a lot better logistics 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.349
 this is a boot that can carry 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.420
 fixing dynafit obviously but that 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:24.189
 Can not only carry dynafit fixing 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.099
 we could take a fixation day 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.680
 so that we understand each other is a boot with 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.659
 a good sole and I was also born to 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.200
 have good grip in places where 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:38.019
 Rock the ground so on and so we 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.359
 demand to walk with them is a boot of 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:42.099
 a kilo 650 grams that obviously is not 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.019
 the lightest thing in the world but a ball 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.420
 that is in a weight more than good 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.690
 benefits between rise and fall is 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.409
 super balanced in agreement is a 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.480
 good option and I think it brings a lot 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.670
 to all those people who are looking for a 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.269
 less radical skiing and instead you look for 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.700
 go up and down enjoying skiing 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.700
 true according to who would cross it or 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.579
 what other materials could we have in 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.060
 good account we could take into account 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.670
 the new fixation the radical st of 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.489
 dynafit that incorporates in the part 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.949
 front where ers jeans would fit 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.740
 of the boot some guides that help us 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:26.289
 even more easily reach us 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.120
 to this boot so that it's easy with 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:33.099
 snow and the hotel is stone to put you in 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.830
 oslo without difficulties and tried was that 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.259
 is completely rebuilt as the 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.020
 we have reconstructed we have simplified 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:43.630
 very much fixing and we have got 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.330
 a double high system that with the 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.060
 sticks as simple as the sticks 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.819
 we got a double height that 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.689
 in the high part and in the part 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.849
 we would say of extra 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.589
 in the case of fall, an extra 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.279
 pines would brake the ski and also carries 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:04.610
 a plate that is obviously sliding 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:07.520
 has a much more adjustment range 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.110
 broad than the old 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.870
 therefore a very good fixation 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.629
 interesting good relationship 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.879
 quality-price a very good weight and a 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.470
 very good fixation with what to combine 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:20.330
 we can combine it with many types 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.330
 of different skis but I am very faithful 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.139
 just a bit classic and the sevens and it 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.050
 a paulonia skin with very good weight 1 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:33.830
 kilo 250 grams so in your life more 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.919
 that well and a very low skiing dor 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.470
 easy to drive an excellent ski 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.620
 both for experts and for 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.880
 that you begin to agree and good nothing 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.849
 mochilita to carry all your 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.870
 material when it is necessary to walk with 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:52.320
 the material of the back 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:56.670
 and nothing fun to ski boot 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.870
 presented a little gem and a material that 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.860
 would have to be taken into account in agreement 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.420
 come see you and tell you more things 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.420
 the next videos to another
