00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.510
 if all the economies states and 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.070
 this here is very serious we find ourselves 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.590
 a totally random day is not 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.210
 Wednesday Wednesday say that what a trick 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.410
 is the death of agreement and that is that 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.010
 all members who win 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.929
 you have a video of tricks I write 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.269
 tricks about boxes of agreements books in 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:21.759
 the 1.7 that there are in the chests that are very 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.680
 but yes very funny, so we're going 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.960
 let's start 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.920
 for that caught three volunteers or maybe 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.599
 two I'm not sure 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.480
 the first trick of everything recording otan 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.890
 fidel and leaf I am in the server of 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.970
 builders agree so I 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.520
 I sat before constructors randomly 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.050
 the first trick of all is to be able to 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.390
 put inside a chest 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 we have volunteers to jota lotus and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.670
 master so I'm going to tell you that it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.339
 methane 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.710
 they finally shrink very well that 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.929
 it seems that it is very funny is very 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.420
 fun and it's very easy to make it worth 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.470
 look only 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.920
 we take and 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:09.590
 we put this structure is worth to stay 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.590
 two empty then we take a chest 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.540
 we have the chest forgive him forgiveness forgiveness 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.980
 Sorry forgiveness we take a few ways and a 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.410
 we put there and put here and 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.050
 now practically in these we put the 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.180
 chests in such a way that we have left what 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.820
 that is being increased there and as 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.770
 the chest when you notice is our 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.990
 it's not the whole block but it's 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.220
 around the block itself whereby 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.400
 what allows us is that we can 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.870
 put inside the wagon such that 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.190
 and it looks like we're stuck inside 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.540
 from the chest that does not look good now 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.979
 yes because they are moving and there is more 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.710
 people and put is the j man also 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.140
 exact from the world but such I wanted such that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.000
 so then it's a good idea because 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.950
 good if you were a little better those 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.840
 names you can see what's around 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.580
 you see I'm seeing what there is 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.890
 around me it's like going through the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.240
 own chest and it's a trick worth it's a 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.430
 cooperation trick out 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.159
 and then there's the next trick this 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.950
 here apparently he has nothing but 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.000
 another chest below has no more than 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.310
 agreement and this one that can not be opened 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.110
 apparently there is nothing worth this 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.569
 glass is not worth to us they have to be the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 of colors I'm just going to catch these 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.060
 ok if I shot 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.330
 then we have the skaters hidden away 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.110
 another side of agreement we can update 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.510
 what is being the box is worth beige 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.450
 is shifter I'm hooked to 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.730
 writer we sold and if we break 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.880
 we are here to os kate now of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.250
 agreement 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.780
 go through if you insist I 'm not going to see 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.820
 your name then we are looking at 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.830
 through the chest we can do 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.480
 secret salts agree to think that 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.090
 this is all and then we can all 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.250
 put more things in agreement and this one is 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.660
 very open is very quiet and good these 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.610
 are the two tricks that I bring you over and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.010
 chests that like to see the law subscribe 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.530
 and nothing guys tomorrow more and better both 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.920
 they work in 1.7 in some points 6 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.990
 and at any point 8 is in agreement or 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.220
 almost all versions and more so 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.420
 this is all guys if you liked the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.260
 law - that you subscribe and help me more and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.260
 better until later
