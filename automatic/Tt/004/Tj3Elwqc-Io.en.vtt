00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
rotate it around and you take two

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.020 
rotate it around and you take two
fingers<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> twist<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.849> essentially<00:02:08.849> what

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
fingers to twist it and essentially what

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.430 
fingers to twist it and essentially what
you're<00:02:09.119> trying<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.720> figure<00:02:09.959> out<00:02:10.080> what

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you're trying to do is figure out what

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.070 
you're trying to do is figure out what
you<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.039> shadow<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.510> you're<00:02:12.780> trying

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you know shadow it is that you're trying

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.830 
you know shadow it is that you're trying
to<00:02:13.140> build<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.620> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
to build on the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.390 
to build on the
all<00:02:13.959> so<00:02:14.560> I'm<00:02:14.650> gonna<00:02:14.739> rotate<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.250> slightly

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
all so I'm gonna rotate it slightly

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.220 
all so I'm gonna rotate it slightly
looks<00:02:16.150> like<00:02:16.330> I'm<00:02:16.450> getting<00:02:16.599> some<00:02:16.930> kind<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.140> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
looks like I'm getting some kind of a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.369 
looks like I'm getting some kind of a
handle<00:02:17.650> there<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.750> you'll<00:02:19.750> notice<00:02:19.989> on<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:20.379 
handle there and you'll notice on the

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.410 
handle there and you'll notice on the
bottom<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.890> screen<00:02:21.099> there's<00:02:21.550> some<00:02:21.790> some

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
bottom of the screen there's some some

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.670 
bottom of the screen there's some some
dots<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:24.220> may<00:02:25.030> light<00:02:25.330> up<00:02:25.510> here<00:02:25.750> soon<00:02:26.080> if<00:02:26.440> I

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
dots that may light up here soon if I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.949 
dots that may light up here soon if I
get<00:02:26.860> close<00:02:27.129> to<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.670> is<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:27.819> I'm<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.269> yeah

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
get close to what it is that I'm I yeah

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.960 
get close to what it is that I'm I yeah
they<00:02:29.440> get<00:02:29.590> as<00:02:29.860> soon<00:02:30.010> as<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.220> get<00:02:30.370> close<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.849> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
they get as soon as I get close to the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.699 
they get as soon as I get close to the
puzzle<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.390> trying<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.629> solve<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.230> get<00:02:32.590> this

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
puzzle I'm trying to solve I get this

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.410 
puzzle I'm trying to solve I get this
feedback<00:02:33.010> on<00:02:33.459> these<00:02:33.549> glowing<00:02:33.970> dots<00:02:34.120> at<00:02:34.390> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
feedback on these glowing dots at the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.420 
feedback on these glowing dots at the
bottom<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:34.989> so<00:02:35.590> now<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.769> think<00:02:35.890> I'm<00:02:36.190> pretty

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
bottom and so now I think I'm pretty

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.890 
bottom and so now I think I'm pretty
close<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.970> something<00:02:37.299> that<00:02:37.420> looks<00:02:37.569> like<00:02:37.780> a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
close to something that looks like a

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.820 
close to something that looks like a
teapot<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.379> go

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
teapot and so there we go

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.770 
teapot and so there we go
I<00:02:41.860> get<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.340> six<00:02:42.549> dots<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.299> figured<00:02:43.690> out

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
I get the six dots and I figured out

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.410 
I get the six dots and I figured out
this<00:02:44.080> puzzle<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.739> every<00:02:45.459> level<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:45.970> like<00:02:46.180> this

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
this puzzle and every level is like this

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.750 
this puzzle and every level is like this
and<00:02:46.690> obviously<00:02:47.140> you're<00:02:47.470> timed<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:48.160> as<00:02:48.459> you<00:02:48.640> go

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
and obviously you're timed and as you go

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.190 
and obviously you're timed and as you go
up<00:02:48.819> through<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.239> levels<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.720> gets<00:02:49.900> more<00:02:50.140> and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
up through the levels it gets more and

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.530 
up through the levels it gets more and
more<00:02:50.290> complicated<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.489> we<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:51.910> love<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
more complicated but we just love the

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.449 
more complicated but we just love the
parallax<00:02:53.049> effect<00:02:53.230> here<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.950> makes<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.250> look

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
parallax effect here that makes it look

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.740 
parallax effect here that makes it look
like<00:02:54.640> you're<00:02:54.790> looking<00:02:54.970> through<00:02:55.180> kind<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.690> a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
like you're looking through kind of a

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.960 
like you're looking through kind of a
window<00:02:56.049> into<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.380> scene<00:02:56.709> we<00:02:57.370> love<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.760> high

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
window into the scene we love the high

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.420 
window into the scene we love the high
resolution<00:02:58.239> rendering<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.980> high<00:03:00.160> fidelity

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
resolution rendering the high fidelity

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.710 
resolution rendering the high fidelity
of<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.450> execution<00:03:02.440> in<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.650> app<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.819> we<00:03:04.360> think

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
of the execution in the app and we think

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.600 
of the execution in the app and we think
this<00:03:04.870> app<00:03:05.079> totally<00:03:05.769> makes<00:03:05.950> an<00:03:06.129> Apple<00:03:06.370> Design

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
this app totally makes an Apple Design

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:16.680 
this app totally makes an Apple Design
Award<00:03:06.879> winner<00:03:07.090> so<00:03:07.720> congratulations
