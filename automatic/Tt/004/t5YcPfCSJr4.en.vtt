00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.280
 I'm trying to catch fish 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.650
 of Italy 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.340
 so you have to use the approach 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.369
 completely different more aggressive le 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.939
 select the size and now I go to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.080
 show you what use and how zero is 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.320
 everything changes n'esco I don't use the bigattino 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 but of the flavored corn in this case 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 I personally prefer the strawberry 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.410
 use triga and is using new rig 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.829
 conception facts other cities there 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.719
 guarantee the correct retention of 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.370
 corn 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.670
 the final result I prepared of 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.780
 groundbait suitable for what we 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:00.890
 we intend to capture red months that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.890
 wrap him in 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:18.060
 where we 're going to hide ours 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:18.060
 and German is taken up high 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.190
 it's hidden 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.729
 now lance I always want to try 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.530
 margins because I believe our papers 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.530
 they run around below us 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.590
 obviously with an approach of this 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.869
 type considering that we catch margin 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.540
 it is advisable to have a ring 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.880
 bel the runner so that he guarantees us 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.400
 a certain calm advising the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.400
 fast and powerful card starts 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.650
 to try to make fish from Italy more 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.250
 big we have changed approach 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.450
 we have tried a specialist approach 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:45.069
 particular using a cane from 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:45.069
 barber specialist and the challenges method 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.870
 and the results are seen here 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.510
