00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:12.160
 We will need sera 2 refractory 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:15.780
 chopsticks chocolate sugar in 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.780
 milk powder and its blender 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.960

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.410
 we toss 3 tablespoons of the chocolate in 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.410
 powder 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.149
 three tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 we liquefy 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.890
 well already after we have liquefied 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.720
 will be something like that that is what 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.000
 we will use to make the pallets of 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.800
 chocolate what we will do next 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.950
 It will be served in the refractory 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.920
 with a paddle stick or with any 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.920
 thing that can be done there so that 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.200
 can take out their palette and what we will do 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.330
 next is to throw it out and put them in 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.240
 the freezer and wait for three 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.850
 hours after having waited three 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.460
 hours here are the rich pallets of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.060
 chocolate ready to taste and that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.600
