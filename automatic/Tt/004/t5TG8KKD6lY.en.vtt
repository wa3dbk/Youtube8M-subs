particular one is powder-coated black

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.910 
particular one is powder-coated black
which<00:00:40.060> I'm<00:00:40.390> a<00:00:40.420> big<00:00:40.930> fan<00:00:41.230> of<00:00:41.260> but<00:00:41.530> you<00:00:41.590> can<00:00:41.770> also

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
which I'm a big fan of but you can also

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.210 
which I'm a big fan of but you can also
get<00:00:42.220> it<00:00:42.310> in<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.490> polished<00:00:42.970> finish<00:00:43.180> as<00:00:43.510> well

get it in a polished finish as well
silicone<00:00:45.220> hoses<00:00:46.030> which<00:00:46.420> are<00:00:46.570> reinforced<00:00:47.380> that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
silicone hoses which are reinforced that

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.540 
silicone hoses which are reinforced that
means<00:00:47.800> they're<00:00:47.890> not<00:00:48.010> going<00:00:48.130> to<00:00:48.160> collapse

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
means they're not going to collapse

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.040 
means they're not going to collapse
under<00:00:48.760> boost<00:00:49.060> you<00:00:49.180> can<00:00:49.240> actually<00:00:49.450> tell<00:00:49.660> stiff

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
under boost you can actually tell stiff

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.690 
under boost you can actually tell stiff
that<00:00:50.230> one<00:00:50.410> is<00:00:50.530> which<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.829> fantastic<00:00:51.070> an

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
that one is which is fantastic an

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.120 
that one is which is fantastic an
aluminum<00:00:52.660> math<00:00:53.079> adapter<00:00:53.560> this<00:00:53.739> is<00:00:53.860> where<00:00:54.010> we

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
aluminum math adapter this is where we

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.850 
aluminum math adapter this is where we
bolt<00:00:54.910> in<00:00:55.090> our<00:00:55.329> math<00:00:55.630> which<00:00:55.870> is<00:00:56.020> of<00:00:56.140> course<00:00:56.380> very

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
bolt in our math which is of course very

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.860 
bolt in our math which is of course very
important<00:00:57.400> and<00:00:57.550> then<00:00:58.060> this<00:00:58.239> one<00:00:58.420> comes<00:00:58.690> with

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
important and then this one comes with

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.780 
important and then this one comes with
the<00:00:58.960> optional<00:00:59.410> air<00:00:59.649> box<00:00:59.920> which<00:01:00.250> i<00:01:00.460> think<00:01:00.670> is

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
the optional air box which i think is

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.930 
the optional air box which i think is
fantastic<00:01:01.710> anytime<00:01:02.710> you<00:01:02.800> can<00:01:02.920> keep<00:01:03.160> out<00:01:03.310> hot

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
fantastic anytime you can keep out hot

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.670 
fantastic anytime you can keep out hot
air<00:01:04.210> out<00:01:04.540> of<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.809> intake<00:01:05.110> you're<00:01:05.470> going<00:01:05.620> to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
air out of the intake you're going to

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.960 
air out of the intake you're going to
see<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.860> performance<00:01:06.190> gain<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.729> so<00:01:06.820> that's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
see a performance gain and so that's

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.820 
see a performance gain and so that's
what<00:01:07.150> this<00:01:07.240> air<00:01:07.420> box<00:01:07.600> does<00:01:08.140> exactly<00:01:08.500> just

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
what this air box does exactly just

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.490 
what this air box does exactly just
keeps<00:01:08.979> hot<00:01:09.159> air<00:01:09.340> out<00:01:09.370> plus<00:01:10.300> it<00:01:10.450> looks<00:01:10.479> great<00:01:11.290> it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
keeps hot air out plus it looks great it

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.960 
keeps hot air out plus it looks great it
almost<00:01:11.710> looks<00:01:11.950> factory<00:01:12.460> well<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.729> guess<00:01:12.880> I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
almost looks factory well I guess I

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.240 
almost looks factory well I guess I
should<00:01:13.120> say<00:01:13.240> provide<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.600> factory<00:01:14.200> look<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:15.159> the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
should say provide a factory look to the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.380 
should say provide a factory look to the
install<00:01:15.549> and<00:01:15.640> then<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:15.820> course<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.120> comes<00:01:16.210> with

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
install and then of course it comes with

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.480 
install and then of course it comes with
everything<00:01:16.630> you<00:01:16.870> need<00:01:17.340> clamps

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
everything you need clamps

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.360 
everything you need clamps
hardware<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:20.080> basically<00:01:20.500> just<00:01:20.830> everything's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
hardware and basically just everything's

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.880 
hardware and basically just everything's
all<00:01:21.580> in<00:01:21.790> one<00:01:21.970> box<00:01:22.180> now<00:01:22.570> what<00:01:23.409> we're<00:01:23.560> expecting
