and I'm pretty happy to get that so
here's<00:03:25.650> an<00:03:25.830> interesting<00:03:26.040> basis<00:03:26.700> I'm<00:03:26.850> it's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
here's an interesting basis I'm it's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.490 
here's an interesting basis I'm it's
very<00:03:27.390> interesting<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.050> think<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.380> he's

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
very interesting I think that he's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.910 
very interesting I think that he's
castle<00:03:28.890> level<00:03:28.980> 7<00:03:30.350> so<00:03:31.350> first<00:03:31.590> things<00:03:31.830> first

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
castle level 7 so first things first

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.730 
castle level 7 so first things first
which<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.120> okay<00:03:33.360> I'm<00:03:34.140> going<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.380> take<00:03:34.530> out

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.690 

and<00:03:39.420> everything<00:03:40.410> else<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.770> behind<00:03:40.890> walls<00:03:41.400> is

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
and everything else is behind walls is

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.150 
and everything else is behind walls is
kind<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.030> kind<00:03:42.300> of<00:03:42.420> cool<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:43.350> these<00:03:43.560> two<00:03:43.770> towers

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
kind of kind of cool so these two towers

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.890 
kind of kind of cool so these two towers
are<00:03:44.310> down<00:03:44.340> up<00:03:44.850> here<00:03:44.880> which<00:03:45.240> means<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.660> can

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
are down up here which means that I can

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.530
