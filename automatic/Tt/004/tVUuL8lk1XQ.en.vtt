00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.530 

just<00:05:25.590> burn<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:25.830> alcohol<00:05:26.640> off<00:05:26.850> so<00:05:27.180> we're<00:05:27.330> left

just burn that alcohol off so we're left

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.330 
just burn that alcohol off so we're left
with<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.900> nice<00:05:28.050> sweetness<00:05:28.800> of<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.130> liquor

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
with the nice sweetness of the liquor

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.970 
with the nice sweetness of the liquor
once<00:05:30.120> all<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.570> alcohol<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.200> burnt<00:05:31.440> off<00:05:31.710> and

once all the alcohol is burnt off and

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.220 
once all the alcohol is burnt off and
reduced<00:05:32.370> down<00:05:32.730> we're<00:05:33.330> going<00:05:33.450> to<00:05:33.510> pour<00:05:33.750> some<00:05:34.050> of

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
reduced down we're going to pour some of

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.780 
reduced down we're going to pour some of
this<00:05:34.410> stock<00:05:35.040> in<00:05:35.280> here

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
this stock in here

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.780 
this stock in here
so<00:05:36.240> probably<00:05:36.570> about<00:05:36.750> 50<00:05:37.410> mils<00:05:37.650> 25<00:05:38.370> milliliters

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
so probably about 50 mils 25 milliliters

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.110 
so probably about 50 mils 25 milliliters
per<00:05:39.180> lobster<00:05:39.930> is<00:05:40.080> sufficient<00:05:41.000> we're<00:05:42.000> just

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
per lobster is sufficient we're just

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.340 
per lobster is sufficient we're just
going<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.300> warm<00:05:42.510> that<00:05:42.750> through<00:05:43.080> gently

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
going to warm that through gently

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.840 
going to warm that through gently
they're<00:05:43.740> together<00:05:43.980> now<00:05:44.630> and<00:05:46.430> into<00:05:47.430> that<00:05:47.580> we're

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
they're together now and into that we're

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.660 
they're together now and into that we're
going<00:05:48.030> to<00:05:48.120> put<00:05:48.390> about<00:05:48.830> half<00:05:49.830> a<00:05:50.040> teaspoon<00:05:50.250> of

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
going to put about half a teaspoon of

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 
diced here so there's being peeled as

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.900 
diced here so there's being peeled as
well<00:05:57.080> so<00:05:58.080> that<00:05:58.260> is<00:05:58.380> equivalent<00:05:58.860> of<00:05:59.250> one<00:05:59.520> plum

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
well so that is equivalent of one plum

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.660 
well so that is equivalent of one plum
tomato<00:06:00.620> and<00:06:01.620> we've<00:06:01.920> got<00:06:02.100> some<00:06:02.340> flat<00:06:02.640> leaf

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
my video how to make more on a sauce so

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.000 
my video how to make more on a sauce so
we're<00:07:00.750> just<00:07:00.900> going<00:07:01.020> to<00:07:01.050> drizzle<00:07:01.320> some<00:07:01.530> of<00:07:01.740> this

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.010 
we're just going to drizzle some of this

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.830 
we're just going to drizzle some of this
again<00:07:02.430> it's<00:07:02.580> important<00:07:03.090> to<00:07:03.120> do<00:07:03.300> it<00:07:03.330> while<00:07:03.630> it's

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
again it's important to do it while it's

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.960 
again it's important to do it while it's
still<00:07:03.900> warm<00:07:04.110> and<00:07:04.530> nice<00:07:04.740> and<00:07:05.010> fluid<00:07:05.310> because<00:07:05.850> it

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
still warm and nice and fluid because it

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.780 
still warm and nice and fluid because it
will<00:07:06.150> get<00:07:06.360> thicker<00:07:06.750> as<00:07:07.170> the<00:07:07.680> source<00:07:07.950> sets<00:07:08.370> to

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790 
will get thicker as the source sets to

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.430 
will get thicker as the source sets to
basically<00:07:09.270> fill<00:07:09.630> all<00:07:09.780> the<00:07:09.930> little<00:07:10.230> crevices

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
basically fill all the little crevices

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.400 
basically fill all the little crevices
make<00:07:11.250> sure<00:07:11.400> it's<00:07:11.550> nice<00:07:11.670> and<00:07:12.000> smooth<00:07:12.360> and<00:07:12.780> see

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
make sure it's nice and smooth and see

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.290 
make sure it's nice and smooth and see
the<00:07:13.500> consistency<00:07:13.860> of<00:07:14.280> the<00:07:14.400> sauce<00:07:14.610> is<00:07:14.880> not<00:07:15.060> too

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:15.300 
the consistency of the sauce is not too

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.060 
the consistency of the sauce is not too
thick<00:07:15.690> you<00:07:15.720> can<00:07:16.020> actually<00:07:16.140> still<00:07:16.560> see<00:07:16.860> the

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
thick you can actually still see the

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.250 
thick you can actually still see the
lobster<00:07:17.280> make<00:07:17.730> through<00:07:18.150> the<00:07:18.360> sauce<00:07:21.020> and<00:07:22.020> we're

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.260 
lobster make through the sauce and we're

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.840 
lobster make through the sauce and we're
just<00:07:22.380> going<00:07:22.560> to<00:07:22.680> sprinkle<00:07:22.980> a<00:07:23.190> little<00:07:23.370> bit<00:07:23.670> more

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
just going to sprinkle a little bit more

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.760 
just going to sprinkle a little bit more
parmesan<00:07:24.330> on<00:07:24.660> the<00:07:24.780> top<00:07:24.990> not<00:07:25.230> too<00:07:25.260> much

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:25.770 
parmesan on the top not too much

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.880 
parmesan on the top not too much
remember<00:07:26.220> how<00:07:26.370> strong<00:07:26.760> the<00:07:26.910> parmesan<00:07:27.630> is

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:27.890 
remember how strong the parmesan is

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.200 
remember how strong the parmesan is
right<00:07:28.890> these<00:07:29.190> are<00:07:29.220> going<00:07:29.430> to<00:07:29.520> go<00:07:29.640> in<00:07:29.820> the<00:07:29.970> grill

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:30.210 
right these are going to go in the grill

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.170 
right these are going to go in the grill
now<00:07:30.510> probably<00:07:31.290> about<00:07:31.410> two<00:07:31.740> minutes<00:07:32.030> just<00:07:33.030> to

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
now probably about two minutes just to

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.270 
now probably about two minutes just to
glaze<00:07:33.420> nicely<00:07:34.410> well<00:07:34.560> and<00:07:34.740> the<00:07:34.800> nice<00:07:34.950> golden

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 
glaze nicely well and the nice golden

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.730 
glaze nicely well and the nice golden
brown<00:07:35.520> color<00:07:36.120> and<00:07:36.380> that's<00:07:37.380> how<00:07:37.560> to<00:07:37.620> make

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
brown color and that's how to make

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.310
