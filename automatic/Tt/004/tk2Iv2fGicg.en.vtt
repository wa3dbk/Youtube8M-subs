00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
of the crate so put a lot of time and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.680 
of the crate so put a lot of time and
effort<00:02:28.680> into<00:02:28.980> decline<00:02:29.370> we<00:02:29.940> got<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.209> new<00:02:30.329> big

roles that we have had made force here

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.280 
roles that we have had made force here
and<00:02:33.120> there<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:33.870> perfect<00:02:34.799> or<00:02:34.950> almost<00:02:35.190> so

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
and there just perfect or almost so

and there just perfect or almost so
that's<00:02:37.290> kind<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.560> how<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.709> bikes<00:02:38.010> are<00:02:38.190> made<00:02:38.340> so

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
that's kind of how the bikes are made so

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.580 
that's kind of how the bikes are made so
