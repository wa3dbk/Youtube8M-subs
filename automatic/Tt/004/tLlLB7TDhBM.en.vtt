00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
really matter does one metal which are

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.250 
really matter does one metal which are
probably<00:03:10.510> gonna<00:03:10.660> be<00:03:10.780> showing<00:03:10.990> right<00:03:11.230> now

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
probably gonna be showing right now

online or some like that the map in the
Middle<00:03:15.750> doesn't<00:03:16.750> do<00:03:17.050> anything<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.680> one

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
little standoff mission there and then

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.450 
little standoff mission there and then
you're<00:03:19.480> done<00:03:19.780> with<00:03:19.960> it<00:03:20.110> coming<00:03:21.070> back<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.250> what

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
you're done with it coming back to what

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.980 
you're done with it coming back to what
is<00:03:21.550> pointless<00:03:21.970> there's<00:03:22.270> nothing<00:03:22.720> else<00:03:22.870> you

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
is pointless there's nothing else you

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.530 
is pointless there's nothing else you
can<00:03:23.200> do<00:03:23.440> there<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:24.820> pretty<00:03:25.000> much<00:03:25.060> there's<00:03:25.330> two

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
can do there so pretty much there's two

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.040 
can do there so pretty much there's two

is called jungle and then Henderson

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.590 
is called jungle and then Henderson
which<00:03:35.800> yeah<00:03:36.040> they're<00:03:36.370> decently<00:03:36.970> sized<00:03:37.270> maps

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
which yeah they're decently sized maps

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.710 
which yeah they're decently sized maps
but<00:03:37.960> still<00:03:38.290> they're<00:03:38.440> nothing<00:03:39.090> compared<00:03:40.090> to

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
