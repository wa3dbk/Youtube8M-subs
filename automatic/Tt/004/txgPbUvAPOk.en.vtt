00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600
 Well I'll make a little 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.350
 tabs before anything 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.350
 with a curler 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.220
 It's worth raffle pretty well 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:22.910
 We also have the curler argel 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.910
 what is a club although I put it upside down 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.369
 this curling iron has a rubber 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.000
 red that turns white at the moment 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.800
 although good, it starts to heat up 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 and 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 the moment you go up it's the lever 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.469
 upwards 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.750
 the rubber heats s change color 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.260
 it gets white and let's say it's supposed to 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.059
 keeps curled lashes for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.030
 longer but I honestly have not been 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.570
 noticed nothing of difference with a curler 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.570
 normal 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.060
 Well, once they're curly 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:15.230
 let's catch the false eyelashes I'm going 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.230
 to use some stockings 318 black 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.520
 from abdel 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.710
 and now with a clamp and the glue duo 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.660
 Let's go there 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.390
 Go ahead 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.930
 we let it rest 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.010
 just to make it more natural 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.180
 possible has to go right in the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.590
 birth of the normal eyelash 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.590
 and at the end 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.670
 as we can see a lot of difference 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.260
 of what is this eye dares these lashes 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.150
 to suddenly here then what are we going 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.150
 to do is to put the most in 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.700
 with a swab impregnated in water of 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.010
 oatmeal or some tonic I'm removing the 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.100
 glue that may have remained for 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.200
 not to notice why 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.750
 well then 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.110
 let's say I'm not going to put a tab 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.710
 false for 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.750
 so that the issue of putting a 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.580
 false eyelash let's say that in your day to 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.260
 day every morning or in your makeup 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.020
 usual because you have very little 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.310
 eyelashes or you have very tiny 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.430
 so good against less you notice is that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.620
 you wear them much better and yours is 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.300
 Well, as you can see, it has to go 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.510
 completely at the birth of your 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.579
 eyelashes does not have that neither above nor 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.640
 below exactly where your 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.650
 eyelashes is the glue me 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.650
 she takes off the gray and turns black 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.090
 OK 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.830
 once this bet 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.260
 I'll make a little top 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.010
 this would be ideal to have a curler 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.010
 tiny 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.980
 and it would be ideal to put good with a 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.450
 eyelash mask or some kind of 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.580
 Things to use every day 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.200
 If you're not good then agree with your 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.360
 eyelashes well then why do you think that 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.150
 that are small that are very little 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.800
 populated or that are very short or are 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.770
 straight and do not have let's say that the state 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.080
 it's not the eyelashes that you 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.290
 they like it well, there are many 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.930
 Chances of changing that aspect 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.710
 man the easiest thing would be to accept what 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.690
 you have to accept what you have and good 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.870
 Well, with cosmetic products like 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.810
 masks and other lengthen it and bring it 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.510
 that volume that may be missing but if 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:41.650
 it does not convince you well then another option 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.520
 another possibility is false eyelashes I 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.880
 good in this case I have these but of 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:52.450
 the mark ar of the ay ay that are much 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:55.330
 more natural and that are not so curly 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.700
 nor so curved at this time do not you 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.400
 I can tell what tabs are because 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.770
 Well, I used them in one of the 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.900
 makeup I've had and I do not have 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.080
 in my power at the moment but what 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.110
 I leave it down in the information box 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.789
 for your help and they are the same as 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.930
 this one but much more natural 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.590
 let's say these are like more 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.990
 dramatic but what good will you see in the 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.629
 next video that can be super 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.430
 good for a day to day for good because 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:28.419
 for those people who want to have 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.710
 pretty eyelashes worth and that or well that 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.180
 we can not stand a mascara 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.939
 because they have very sensitive eyes and 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.710
 does not hit the right so nothing girl 

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:37.030
 I hope it has helped you 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.509
 has been useful we see the following 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.509
 chao video
