00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.930
 voodoo 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 Eh from now on a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:15.960
 It will be your first time &amp; It is the first card plug Yes 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:21.960
 We will introduce a bit of 8 winter 8 this time buzzing 8 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:26.660
 - that the number 8 took leave system of Frank bait 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.660
 Please look around 8 Nde try to little changed completely swim 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.980
 Now if you do a little while normally 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.390
 This increase 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.650
 I think that standing foam Once I am a little watching the water surface 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.940
 In yeah the Tteyuu this bubble 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:53.320
 The point is that although it is mart former model when saying why it is made though 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:58.470
 For that side 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.470
 In short It is this kind of feeling that big attitude is now 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:10.440
 8Swimming makes you look a little forward 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.440
 The tail strikes a lot of water surface when you act with just the right balance 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.360
 At that time eight sounds and bubbles 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.790
 They say they'll come out 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.700
 Depending on such Fu 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.390
 so 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.890
 Well there is a characteristic that it is amazing to say what this is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.460
 Here's the internal structure and a 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.460
 It is in the image but it is also in that tail 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:42.729
 Ball weight is built in 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.900
 In like that this ball weights are built is willing to work is that a fresh green 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.250
 It is said that 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.270
 Where is Winter's greatest feature 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.850
 To 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.060
 After the other one is to 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.869
 Put that say lose early in that mind 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.869
 I made it 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.010
 Please gather quite 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.690
 It is fine 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.650
 Without breaking the surface of the water also pulled early 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.140
 Quite fast 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.140
 Of course, if you pull it, you will usually swim in the slow retrieve normally. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.880
 Create a wave properly 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.380
 Us to action 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.530
 To and when to say in this early Umaku' why say important or in 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:38.470
 8 normally Well structure it is a slow retrieve 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:44.900
 Tree nutrition when you do not come out at this speed Well Toka when pulled It is wo is 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:51.079
 And I'll put that put the switch to 8 forced to fish in the effect of the reaction 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:54.980
 The purpose is to move quickly so of course whether you can hook up 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:59.120
 I don't know, but it depends on the situation 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.840
 If you do not ride it, the switch is already on, so the fish is on 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:07.160
 As 8 follow 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:11.510
 In short Well Toka is that no sinker as little increase 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:14.709
 If you approach it and then you can take fish 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.709
 It is a feature to say 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.050
 voodoo
