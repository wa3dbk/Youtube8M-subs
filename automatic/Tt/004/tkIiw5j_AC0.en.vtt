works the same this is left trigger
right<00:01:22.500> trigger<00:01:22.850> rbl<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> thing<00:01:25.170> which

layout exactly the same way except it

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.540 
layout exactly the same way except it
just<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.240> shaped<00:01:33.570> different<00:01:34.050> so<00:01:34.230> now<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.100> can

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
just is shaped different so now I can

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.430
