00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.130
 what there is the african the neighborhood eric de clercq the concern the honorable man 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.190
 career could be standard so the products drivers 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.640
 they are often that 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.190
 is used to that during the opening of restaurants and why they are there 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.840
 participate in competitions 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.470
 I am happy to have attendees if entrepreneurs appeal to me 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.630
 just to see what they consider to be very important 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.180
 I have been here a few weeks ago it was also a very beautiful one 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.540
 events became one 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.740
 and hockey club 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.190
 feyenoords started with a lot of children from this area 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.190
 and then owner of the and therefore when asked me 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.870
 meanwhile come open 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.560
 the current server time an agent that came this year he wanted this year still necessarily 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.330
 yeah that's just a sunday afternoon on an agenda and i'm incredible 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.820
 glad that so many people are here today because of the entrepreneurs but mine 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.950
 They are flirting with this environment on their business here 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.760
 biden internships provide employment in an environment that is not that easy 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.239
 is in Rotterdam 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.659
 it's nice that all those Rotterdam people in the area 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.120
 these people want to support in doing business because together the entrepreneurs 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.360
 police in the neighborhood residents the market and twittering with the children 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.439
 amazingly beautiful but the picture is here 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.979
 the 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:35.910
 they exist 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.910
 Sure then we are in good shape but the 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:43.409
 to 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.409
 beh de 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.369
 you may want to turn around differently 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:54.369
 so you got through a wild rise 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.260
 also come to estonia this week 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.260
 mini weyts network from the peak jabbeke 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.219
 we are working very hard to close 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.559
 level with the north side of rotterdam 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.479
 What you just see that they have higher unemployment here is also low 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:24.499
 educated 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:27.099
 the economy must really get going here 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.939
 whatever you see that the environment needs to be addressed or what you see is that 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.389
 the home the approach should be they have a lot to do in a south 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.920
 and especially feyenoord room ocÃ© it is actually the neighborhoods where a lot 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.069
 is invested from within municipalities 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.719
 the nice thing is that you also attract new entrepreneurs to the neighborhoods 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.609
 That is why we think it is important that you are not just new entrepreneurs 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:49.269
 gets 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.239
 I like entrepreneurs who have the quality it has to offer in itself 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.919
 many entrepreneurs but quality is what matters 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.689
 and we also want those entrepreneurs to feel responsible 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:00.989
 for environment 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.089
 corporate social responsibility 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.879
 and how can you achieve that okay by already being an entrepreneur but you 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.179
 also between for example 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:10.529
 children who lies adults 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.649
 I always say that the company will move into South 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.349
 team ensures that those people continue to work make sure that those with an internship at 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.180
 can walk from and I contribute again 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.430
 share for the liveliness of the neighborhood 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.650
 a pile of basf the entrepreneurs are in contact with the neighborhood 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:28.879
 local residents 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:34.330
 and then you hope that this coherence leads us to be even happier 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.330
 better to get safe 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.229
 where i can sign up from feyenoord 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:49.639
 for me 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.590
 so it concerns 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.969
 very important for feyenoord why 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.590
 because 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.930
 has the very large detailed concept 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.039
 always had 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.180
 started 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.380
 in 9 9 so far, many things have been achieved 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.220
 as 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.939
 fill this sponsor rings much more social 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:09.330
 social occasions 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.479
 and the hague nonsense 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.710
 dishes and our the quality 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.289
 geesje spirit and 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.249
 We are very proud of what my name means too much 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:23.389
 for feyenoord the example is how it should be invested 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.440
 film economy so we actually want people to say so 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.539
 who can provide for their own income that can be through work 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.430
 that can be by coming in well this is an entrepreneur and he just started 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.990
 with a restaurant and 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.979
 so I actually had nothing on income 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.120
 that is now the minimum condition that we also stimulated is the 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.939
 entrepreneurship quality is very important 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.839
 This is just a Google business because this is the example where you actually 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.080
 from as a dishwasher in the kitchen 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.080
 can actually become a co-owner because he has shown six 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.759
 everyone has talent 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.990
 some can develop talent at school 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.469
 that is our preference 

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:04.499
 but there are also just young people who just 

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:08.249
 Jennifer is busy with his hands and rather actually from his hands 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.909
 to learn 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.830
 m well that is a very nice example of someone just 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.900
 actually too 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.180
 has perspective 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.240
 and she can develop talents 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.370
 And the nice guy multiple of this entrepreneur further is that not only 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.979
 is concerned with himself and with his employees no who is also concerned with being 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.379
 surroundings 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.559
 and after doing so in principle for the youngsters, he doesn't get an internship 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:33.080
 give them work 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.250
 and for us as a borough it is also very nice if they just get out of the 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.080
 get the last about people we meet and they want something tasty 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.749
 called 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:46.429
 Well then this is one of the occasions where he is going and we have one 

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:48.689
 claim and feyenoord about five 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:53.689
 of this kind of business and we hope that we will be fifth in the coming four years 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:54.159
 come
