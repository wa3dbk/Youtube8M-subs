00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.710
 a well-functioning added-value discharge Sustained ensures a 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.050
 low weight and optimal ground adaptation of the Melt 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.900
 beam 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.620
 that protects the turf hub reduces wear on the device and reduces the 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.979
 Fu of pollution 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.710
 In addition, due to the lower thrust demand of 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.450
 fuel consumption 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.430
 Claas offers the SCO Trial thousand 100 FC for windscreen added value 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.220
 Profile next to the well-known mechanical discharge system now 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.070
 also the hydro-pneumatic discharge Active, according to Born 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.680
 we have the two systems in practice and to the test 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.680
 compared to each other 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.290
 we had three different tractors available for the mission rides 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.320
 a Steier CVP and the price is 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.380
 a clear Arion 410 Plus 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.380
 and ideas 312 Vario 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.850
 in the case of mechanical systems, the relief plans are then transformed into appropriate ones 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.320
 Brackets mounted on the tractor 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.930
 the bias of the springs is adjusted with chains 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.580
 The dimensions given in the operating instructions must be identical 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.000
 exactly adhered to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.390
 when drained 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.030
 E value must not exceed a travel of 120 millimeters 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.740
 At the Tec the vent system, the two become warriors simply because of 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.140
 replaced the hydraulic cylinder 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.200
 The discharge takes place via four accumulators with the sinners 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.600
 are connected 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.530
 The discharge struck is via an auxiliary control unit by the tractor 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.530
 Cabin off 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.340
 the pressure can also be read on a manometer at the cultivation puck 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.560
 According to Claas, this system is designed to cease the print run of the printer 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:19.870
 Constant value regardless of its position to the tractor constant 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.870
 to let 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:35.259
 To protect the turf it should be the bearing weight when driving over 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:38.399
 Uneven floors remain as constant as possible 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:46.949
 We have the pressure of Maybach Bens on both discharge to St Mend 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.159
 measured in three different positions 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.989
 once in one level with the tractor and each ten centimeters higher 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.989
 and deeper 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.029
 The new Active could be convincing here 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:11.159
 the change in the pad weight is significantly lower than that of the 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.939
 mechanical reliefs 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.450
 In practice, this means better ground adaptation 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.259
 with the support weight also depends directly on the required thrust 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:32.919
 Need to collect 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.389
 In order to determine this we have the tractor with special sensors in the 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.079
 Over- and underlay can be equipped 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.879
 In addition, the power requirement at the PTO shaft was measured 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.319
 via an antenna, the values â€‹â€‹determined during the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.120
 Transfer mission to the Thornton measuring car next door and there 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:07.119
 recorded 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:22.870
 the result 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.250
 With the Active for ohb system, the pad pressure could be reduced so far 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.470
 that the shoe purchase requirement was less than half the size of the 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.469
 mechanical discharge 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:38.009
 The recommended footing weight could also be used with the mechanical systems 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.229
 maximum elongation of the springs can not be achieved for the practice means 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.759
 that mowed with so high a jug 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.430
 Regarding the stop length we could not see any differences between the two 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.469
 Detect systems 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:57.110
 for a good ground adjustments when driving over terrain can be the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.330
 Reaction speed of the system crucial 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.159
 Our measurements have shown that here the mechanical discharge is about twice 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.159
 reacts so quickly and thus has the advantage 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.610
 The butcher's ground adaptation at NEC's flood systems can be through 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.850
 Reduction of travel speed can be counteracted 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.550
