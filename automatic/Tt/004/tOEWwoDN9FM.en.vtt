think<00:02:04.710> it's<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:06.149> brush<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.719> like

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
think it's because the brush is like

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.699 
think it's because the brush is like
really<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.380> dense<00:02:07.770> are<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.700> hard<00:02:09.709> so
