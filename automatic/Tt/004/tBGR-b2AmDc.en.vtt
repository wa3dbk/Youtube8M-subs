the largest power source it can find the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
Autobots new Power Core which actually

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.030 
Autobots new Power Core which actually
makes<00:03:05.630> sense<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.080> doesn't<00:03:06.290> feel<00:03:06.500> contrived

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
makes sense and doesn't feel contrived

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.490 
makes sense and doesn't feel contrived
which<00:03:07.820> just<00:03:08.270> feels<00:03:08.510> weird<00:03:08.630> given<00:03:09.260> what<00:03:09.380> we've

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
which just feels weird given what we've

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.440 
which just feels weird given what we've
become<00:03:09.650> accustomed<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.310> in<00:03:10.490> this<00:03:10.580> series<00:03:10.940> but

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
become accustomed to in this series but

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.420 
become accustomed to in this series but
now<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:11.900> makes<00:03:12.080> perfect<00:03:12.140> sense<00:03:12.530> they

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
now this all makes perfect sense they

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.770 
now this all makes perfect sense they
lure<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.790> thing<00:03:13.940> to<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.120> Power<00:03:14.270> Core

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
lure the thing to the Power Core

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.870 
lure the thing to the Power Core
then<00:03:15.050> they<00:03:15.200> eject<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.680> into<00:03:15.890> space<00:03:16.100> where<00:03:16.850> it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
then they eject it into space where it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.670 
then they eject it into space where it
naturally<00:03:17.360> goes<00:03:17.510> after<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:17.900> quintessons<00:03:18.320> a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
naturally goes after the quintessons a

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.650 
naturally goes after the quintessons a
little<00:03:19.220> predictable<00:03:19.550> perhaps<00:03:20.060> but<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.480> makes

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
little predictable perhaps but it makes

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.020 
little predictable perhaps but it makes
sense<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:21.260> have<00:03:22.010> a<00:03:22.040> soft<00:03:22.340> spot<00:03:22.430> for<00:03:22.610> an<00:03:22.850> episode

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
sense I have a soft spot for an episode

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.120 
sense I have a soft spot for an episode
that<00:03:23.300> makes<00:03:23.480> sense<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.959> has<00:03:24.110> badass<00:03:24.470> monster

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
that makes sense and has badass monster

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:34.350 
that makes sense and has badass monster
fights<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.520> it<00:03:25.640> call<00:03:26.209> me<00:03:26.330> sentimental<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.900> guess
