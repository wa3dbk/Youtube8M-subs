00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.369
 in this video I'll show you a 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.500
 really nice easter egg guys 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.250
 look what I discovered under the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.180
 seabed boys really na cool 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 a trap door a door you see that light 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.369
 over my helicopter you see guys 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.890
 that light is a door a capsule of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.899
 some alien guys tell me what it is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 because I have not the faintest idea 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.239
 before I forget I'll show you 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.110
 where they are they are exactly here guys 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.940
 you must take this as an indication 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.460
 these islets this this ledge 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.210
 here and this ledge where the boys 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:59.539
 this on top that bigger and sayings 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.829
 now I put myself so zummo you see that 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:07.049
 ride on a future is still boys 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.590
 here you see is a show and to the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.200
 maximum depth then boys then 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.970
 I will try to get even more boys 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.549
 but almost risked you see because the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 my submarine almost collapsed before 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.880
 see again up to 148 meters it will be 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 on the 160 meters boys then after 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.299
 We try 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.250
 now I wanted to show you a moment 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.079
 quad instantly look there is also the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.040
 light inside so there must be 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.490
 someone guys is a nasty show 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.930
 cow 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.829
 I always get too close look 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.780
 tell me what it might be that 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.729
 maybe opening it washes away all the water 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.920
 of the oceans boys 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.520
 noda is really must be something 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.090
 alien some special experiment 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.369
 something guys that maybe bo one 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.950
 show guys now i will try to 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.110
 put an invincibility trick 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.840
 guys so maybe we can 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.160
 go down lower without dying 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.160
 let me try then 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:25.740
 no i was wrong guys i don't so this 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.960
 I die because I am so no we find 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.960
 girls again without braking 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.800
 here's invincibility guys for 5 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900
 minutes 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.940
 we hope it will hold up even to the depths 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.890
 marine 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.080
 then I do revise it here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.110
 indeed we are without light is a bit of a 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.710
 problem would seem that we do not die 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:55.260
 guys I get even closer 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.370
 guys we want to get off look at me 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.750
 is deactivated 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:05.610
 now we are going to die girls, not luckily 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.870
 that I have the diving suit still trick 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.920
 disabled this guys anyway anyway 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.510
 and the easter egg in the middle of the seabed 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.610
 really a show you tell me what 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.730
 it could be anyway now that 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.140
 we are dead and nothing here from pistard e 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.800

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.800
