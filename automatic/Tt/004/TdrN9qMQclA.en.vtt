00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
and I go into my scissor having uses a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.170 
and I go into my scissor having uses a
in<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.759> sweet<00:01:24.330> before<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.960> um<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:26.640> idea<00:01:26.970> here

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
in a sweet before so um the idea here

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.260 
in a sweet before so um the idea here
was<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> throw<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.840> few<00:01:28.049> sauce<00:01:28.290> dances<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
was to throw up a few sauce dances and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.310 
was to throw up a few sauce dances and
yeah<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.299> don't<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.170> really

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
yeah I don't think you can do really

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.230 
yeah I don't think you can do really
much<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> me<00:01:31.890> because<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.280> only<00:01:32.579> has<00:01:32.670> body<00:01:32.909> slam

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
much to me because he only has body slam

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.569 
much to me because he only has body slam
I<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:34.110> quite<00:01:34.530> thankful<00:01:34.740> he<00:01:35.070> did<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.369> have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
I was quite thankful he did not have

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.880 
I was quite thankful he did not have
fire<00:01:35.880> punch<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.840> he<00:01:36.990> withdraws<00:01:37.439> knowing<00:01:37.770> you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
fire punch so he withdraws knowing you

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.380 
fire punch so he withdraws knowing you
can't<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:38.490> anything<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.150> he<00:01:39.210> goes

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
can't really do anything and he goes

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
can't really do anything and he goes
into<00:01:39.689> his<00:01:39.960> arc<00:01:40.259> will<00:01:40.530> fish<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> haven't<00:01:41.850> seen

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.300 
into his arc will fish so I haven't seen
qwilfish<00:01:42.450> before<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.799> was<00:01:43.829> kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.159> cool

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
