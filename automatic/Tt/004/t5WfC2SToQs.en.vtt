Monday<00:04:10.620> trade<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:12.980> really<00:04:13.980> think<00:04:14.340> he<00:04:14.790> would

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
Monday trade I really think he would

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.390 
Monday trade I really think he would
accept<00:04:15.390> for<00:04:15.570> all<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.079> good<00:04:16.320> stuff<00:04:16.880> um<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.480> is

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
accept for all that good stuff um it is

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.770 
accept for all that good stuff um it is
harder<00:04:20.419> for<00:04:21.419> a<00:04:21.740> non-member<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:24.030> get<00:04:24.390> this

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
harder for a non-member to get this

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.080 
harder for a non-member to get this
stuff<00:04:25.490> dang<00:04:26.490> I<00:04:26.700> moved<00:04:26.940> um<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:29.070> if<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.880> a

stuff dang I moved um so if you a
non-member<00:04:30.720> you<00:04:31.230> probably<00:04:31.800> have<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.340> buy

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669
