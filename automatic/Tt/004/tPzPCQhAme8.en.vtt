it<00:01:23.430> was<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.939> pointless<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.720> was

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
it was really pointless and it was

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.480 
it was really pointless and it was
really<00:01:25.110> boring<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.189> did<00:01:26.460> was

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
really boring because all you did was

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.870 
really boring because all you did was
face<00:01:26.850> matches<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.509> was<00:01:27.630> no<00:01:27.810> story<00:01:28.140> going

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
face matches there was no story going

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.810 
face matches there was no story going
into<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.630> actual<00:01:31.439> event<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.369> that's<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.790> think

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
into the actual event and that's I think

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.030 
into the actual event and that's I think
when<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.329> created<00:01:33.659> universe<00:01:34.049> mode<00:01:34.320> universe

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
when they created universe mode universe

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.310 
when they created universe mode universe
mode<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.400> definitely<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> step<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:37.079> but

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
mode was definitely a step up but

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.840 
mode was definitely a step up but
sometimes<00:01:38.189> again<00:01:38.700> has<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> hard<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.290> know

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
sometimes again has a hard time you know

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.490 
sometimes again has a hard time you know
actually<00:01:41.850> calculating<00:01:42.720> what's<00:01:42.930> happening

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
actually calculating what's happening
