00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.791
 "Pistachio Nuts Against Erectile Dysfunction" 

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:11.622
 Erectile dysfunction is considered an important cause 

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:13.853
 reducing the quality of life of men. 

00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:16.377
 One early theory even raised 

00:00:16.377 --> 00:00:17.879
 that erectile dysfunction could explain continuity 

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.932
 between impotence and heart attack. 

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:23.736
 Depression is a risk factor for ischemic heart disease and presumption 

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:25.530
 was that people who have difficulty getting an erection 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.246
 they are so depressed that they "die of a broken heart." 

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:32.354
 Now we know that erectile dysfunction and heart disease 

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.044
 there may be two different manifestations 

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:36.539
 same health problem 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.362
 - sick arteries: 

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:41.268
 inflamed, oxidized and clogged with cholesterol. 

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:44.350
 Not surprisingly, a diet full of anti-inflammatory drugs 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.452
 antioxidants and cholesterol-lowering foods 

00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:48.730
 can improve sexual function 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.754
 both men and women and at the same time 

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:54.099
 reduce the risk of heart disease. 

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:58.062
 But why settle for low risk when you can eliminate the risk completely? 

00:00:58.062 --> 00:00:59.667
 A full plant diet can even 

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:05.045
 stop and reverse our most common fatal disease. 

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.908
 Of all the individual plant foods that have been investigated so far, 

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:10.635
 include nuts among the foods most associated with longevity. 

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:13.640
 Two handfuls a week can prolong women 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.651
 life as well as 4 hours of jogging (slow running) per week. 

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.011
 Thus, if nuts reduce the risk of heart disease, 

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.350
 can they also help with sexual function? 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.818
 Men consuming 3-4 handfuls of pistachios a day 

00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:29.582
 noted a significant improvement over just 3 weeks 

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:31.199
 in the blood supply to the penis accompanied 

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:34.953
 stronger erections. 

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:36.785
 That may not surprise us. 

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.051
 You remember, as I said, food rich in antioxidants 

00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:40.990
 Viagra has a similar effect 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.280
 in promoting nitric oxide production? 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.870
 Pistachios are clearly a rich source of antioxidants. 

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:49.880
 And you remember citrulline from melons 

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:51.220
 helped with erection strength thanks 

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:52.810
 increased supply of arginine, 

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.660
 which our body uses to produce nitric oxide? 

00:01:55.661 --> 00:01:57.850
 Pistachios contain lots of arginine 

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:01.200
 which can help explain the observed improvement in blood flow. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 We also know that high cholesterol is important 

00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:07.400
 indicator of sexual dysfunction in both men and women. 

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.400
 After just 3 weeks of eating pistachios 

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:12.350
 there was a significant improvement in cholesterol levels. 

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:15.350
 And as in other studies that added nuts in the diet 

00:02:15.357 --> 00:02:18.760
 extra hundreds of calories a day, and there was no weight-loss. 

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.360
 Conclusion: Three weeks of pistachio consumption led 

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:24.210
 significant improvement in erectile function 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.010
 and in addition to improving cholesterol levels, 

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:28.420
 without any side effects. 

00:02:28.424 --> 00:02:30.450
 Note two important differences 

00:02:30.456 --> 00:02:31.810
 in the action of diet and drugs. 

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:35.410
 If you are just taking Viagra to destroy this enzyme and artificially 

00:02:35.417 --> 00:02:38.040
 increased nitric oxide signaling 

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:40.210
 just mask the symptoms of the hidden problem: 

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:42.970
 unhealthy vascular system. 

00:02:42.976 --> 00:02:45.480
 While eating whole and healthy vegetable foods such as nuts 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.740
 are you really targeting the cause of the problem: 

00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:50.160
 high cholesterol, oxidation and inflammation. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.400
 Moreover, it only has favorable side effects. 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.680
 The enzyme that drugs like Viagra suppress, 

00:02:57.687 --> 00:03:00.570
 especially in two places in the body: 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.540
 in scorching penis tissue 

00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:05.650
 and the retina of the eye. 

00:03:05.653 --> 00:03:08.350
 Therefore, FDA discourages people from using it 

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:10.580
 medicines like Viagra. You should also 

00:03:10.583 --> 00:03:12.100
 consult a doctor immediately 

00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.720
 if you notice sudden loss of vision. 

00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:17.260
 If you can even find a phone. 

00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:21.330
 However, disability usually subsides, 

00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:25.360
 An example is cyanopsis, in which your vision 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.610
 suddenly gets a blue color tone. 

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:30.120
 Why take any side effects at risk 

00:03:30.124 --> 00:03:33.090
 when the problem can be reversed, its cause cured and improved 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.950
 the quality and length of our lives? 

00:03:37.953 --> 00:03:40.560
 "Improving sexual function in men (and women) 

00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:44.000
 "should be added to a growing list of clinical benefits 

00:03:44.005 --> 00:03:50.750
 healthy lifestyle. ”
