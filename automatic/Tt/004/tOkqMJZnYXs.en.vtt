00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:32.000
This is my training room, here time and space don’t exist, there are no clocks at all.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.159
In 2008 I made 27 ‘ninety’ twists and it happened by chance:

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:44.269
I came in this room, I was angry and I wasn’t thinking about anything in particular.

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:50.199
I put my camera on the ground, I turned the music on and then I started pushing without thinking.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:09.099
I had spun for a long time but I didn't realize it at the moment. When I stopped I said to myself: ”Gosh, maybe I’ve set the record”

00:01:11.099 --> 00:01:18.399
UK B-Boy Championship 2010, I made the Guinness World Record on stage during the world event.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
This record is not that important for me, but it’s part of my style.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.500
I always use it when I go onstage and I’m part of the panel of judges. Here it is.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.190
Well, the moment when you go down and then…up! You start to fly. That feeling drives me crazy.  

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.160
I took a run and then I slid on my knees, and I enjoyed the moment.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:02:02.160
I try to twist with the top of my elbow, but it’s not the elbow-twist that goes like this. It’s like this.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.560
This new step is called Elbow Extreme. I made it for the first time during a Final in Germany,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.000
I started with the Windmill and then I put my elbows on the ground but I slipped and broke my ligaments.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:31.000
This injury scared me, but I want to regain confidence, and feel confident it again.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.160
 No one else does it, this is a record I set and a move I invented.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:10.000
It’s personal, and I want to bring it to competitions and to the world stages. That’s when you show your control.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.160
I have it...I was holding it in my grasp. After the second one I knew that’s mine.  

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.560
Here we go.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:00.160
You can either do it or not, “if” doesn’t exist. Only training exists, because you have to feel the move.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160
I have it, I have it.
