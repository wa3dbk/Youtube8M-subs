all<00:00:14.309> right<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.790> rundown<00:00:15.450> on<00:00:15.630> cemetry<00:00:16.230> let's

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
all right so rundown on cemetry let's

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.800 
all right so rundown on cemetry let's
pretend<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.699> example<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.359> don't<00:00:18.420> want<00:00:18.690> the

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
pretend for example I don't want the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.320 
pretend for example I don't want the
eyes<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:20.160> for<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:21.119> for

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
eyes in here just for just for

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.840 
eyes in here just for just for
educational<00:00:21.810> purposes<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.100> let's<00:00:23.400> turn<00:00:23.670> on

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
educational purposes and let's turn on

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.200 
educational purposes and let's turn on
transform<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.720> activate<00:00:25.230> symmetry<00:00:25.439> off<00:00:26.210> okay

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
transform and activate symmetry off okay

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
transform and activate symmetry off okay
so<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.779> basic<00:00:28.109> rundown<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.470> cemetry<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.160> how

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
so the basic rundown on cemetry and how

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.370 
so the basic rundown on cemetry and how
it<00:00:29.369> works<00:00:29.580> well<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.449> draw<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.900> one<00:00:31.080> side<00:00:31.289> of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
it works well if you draw on one side of

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.030 
it works well if you draw on one side of
the<00:00:31.439> model<00:00:32.329> like<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.890> on

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the model like that and if I want it on

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
the model like that and if I want it on
the<00:00:35.160> other<00:00:35.280> side<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> model<00:00:35.880> all<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.510> is

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
the other side of the model all I do is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.240 
the other side of the model all I do is
have<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.170> through<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> deformation

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
have to go through the deformation

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.250 
have to go through the deformation
palette<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.760> hit<00:00:39.170> smart<00:00:40.170> Reis<00:00:40.320> MMX<00:00:42.260> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
palette and hit smart Reis MMX this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.810 
palette and hit smart Reis MMX this
throws<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.890> other<00:00:44.100> side<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> model

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
throws it on the other side of the model

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.690 
throws it on the other side of the model
but<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.270> an<00:00:45.510> average<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.379> see<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.280> they

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
but at an average you see now that they

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
but at an average you see now that they
are<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> same

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
are not the same

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.069 
are not the same
control-z<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:51.270> time<00:00:51.539> I'm<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
control-z and this time I'm going to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.139 
control-z and this time I'm going to
hold<00:00:52.379> ctrl<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.039> mask<00:00:53.070> off<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> region<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hold ctrl and mask off the region and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.020 
hold ctrl and mask off the region and
then<00:00:55.110> smart<00:00:55.469> reset<00:00:57.260> no<00:00:58.260> average<00:00:58.680> occurs<00:00:59.039> okay

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
then smart reset no average occurs okay

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
then smart reset no average occurs okay
so<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.600> easy<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.140> located<00:01:01.890> underneath

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
so that's easy that's located underneath

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950 
so that's easy that's located underneath
the<00:01:02.280> smart<00:01:02.609> reset<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.149> how<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> works<00:01:03.719> so

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the smart reset and how that works so

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.950 
the smart reset and how that works so
let's<00:01:04.710> look<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.850> bit<00:01:06.210> harder<00:01:06.630> things

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
let's look a little bit harder things

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.450 
let's look a little bit harder things
let's<00:01:07.409> clear<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.189> mask<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.189> case

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
let's clear the mask and in this case

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510 
let's clear the mask and in this case
let's<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.780> something<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:14.070> always<00:01:14.220> do

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
let's do something that we always do

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.990 
let's do something that we always do
let's<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> move<00:01:15.390> tool<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:17.000> transpose

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
let's go to the move tool and transpose

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.929 
let's go to the move tool and transpose
it<00:01:18.030> over<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.869> side<00:01:21.049> draw<00:01:22.250> okay<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.460> now

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
it over to this side draw okay so now

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.480 
it over to this side draw okay so now
let's<00:01:24.210> try<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.479> same<00:01:24.630> trick<00:01:25.170> let's<00:01:25.650> draw<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
let's try that same trick let's draw on

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
let's try that same trick let's draw on
one<00:01:26.700> side<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.130> let's<00:01:30.090> smart<00:01:30.390> reset<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> oh<00:01:31.460> no

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
one side and let's smart reset it oh no

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
one side and let's smart reset it oh no
it<00:01:32.880> says<00:01:33.060> no<00:01:33.299> symmetry<00:01:33.750> found<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.320> those

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it says no symmetry found on those

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.950 
it says no symmetry found on those
points<00:01:34.710> why<00:01:35.220> well<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.390> go<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
points why well if you go to the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.530 
points why well if you go to the
almighty<00:01:37.470> preview<00:01:38.009> window<00:01:38.310> you'll<00:01:39.030> find<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
almighty preview window you'll find that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.770 
almighty preview window you'll find that
you<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.170> moved<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.770> centre<00:01:41.009> point<00:01:41.159> over<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
you have moved the centre point over and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.910 
you have moved the centre point over and
you're<00:01:42.780> probably<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.470> over<00:01:43.680> here

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
you're probably going to go over here

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
you're probably going to go over here
and<00:01:44.130> say<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> want<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> set<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.600> pivot

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and say well I want to set that pivot

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.630 
and say well I want to set that pivot
point<00:01:47.090> well<00:01:48.090> make<00:01:48.570> sure<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.780> set<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> twice

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
point well make sure you set it twice

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.840 
point well make sure you set it twice
set<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> one<00:01:50.880> more<00:01:51.090> time<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:52.579> you'll<00:01:53.579> find

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
set it one more time and now you'll find

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.179 
set it one more time and now you'll find
out<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.570> smart<00:01:54.930> resume<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
out that when you smart resume it it

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.620 
out that when you smart resume it it
works<00:01:58.340> okay<00:01:59.340> another<00:01:59.700> thing<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.180> while<00:02:00.479> I'm

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
works okay another thing is while I'm

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.510 
works okay another thing is while I'm
here<00:02:01.170> covering<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.340> preview<00:02:02.759> window<00:02:02.909> ah

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
here covering the preview window ah

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.130 
here covering the preview window ah
you'll<00:02:05.520> find<00:02:05.880> every<00:02:06.180> once<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> while<00:02:06.899> that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
you'll find every once in a while that

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.889 
you'll find every once in a while that
your<00:02:07.320> items<00:02:07.770> are<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.459> huge<00:02:08.970> let's<00:02:09.509> say<00:02:09.660> I'm

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
your items are really huge let's say I'm

scale the way out here the item looks

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.490 
scale the way out here the item looks

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
if I go to scale if I scale the item up

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.830 
if I go to scale if I scale the item up
it<00:02:17.810> scales<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.100> preview<00:02:21.090> window<00:02:21.180> like

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
it scales it in the preview window like

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.240 
it scales it in the preview window like
to<00:02:22.110> huge<00:02:22.380> proportions

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250

to huge proportions
let's<00:02:24.060> hit<00:02:24.210> draw<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:26.150> what's<00:02:27.150> going<00:02:27.300> to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
let's hit draw and what's going to

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.420 
let's hit draw and what's going to
happen<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.900> when<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.290> move<00:02:28.800> around<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.310> item

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
happen is when I move around the item

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.220 
happen is when I move around the item
it's<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.030> be<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.660> bit<00:02:30.780> slower<00:02:31.080> for

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
it's going to be a little bit slower for

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920 
it's going to be a little bit slower for
some<00:02:31.560> reason<00:02:31.920> okay<00:02:32.490> because<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:33.360> not<00:02:33.660> at

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
some reason okay because it's not at

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.530 
some reason okay because it's not at
ZBrush<00:02:34.740> standards<00:02:35.400> another<00:02:36.150> thing<00:02:36.390> you

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
ZBrush standards another thing you

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.360 
ZBrush standards another thing you
notice<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:37.620> happened<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.070> pivot

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
notice is what happened to the pivot

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.780 
notice is what happened to the pivot
point<00:02:38.610> well<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.390> moved<00:02:39.810> so<00:02:40.260> if<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:41.280> go<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.520> draw

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
point well it moved so if I go to draw

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.500 
point well it moved so if I go to draw
on<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.460> I<00:02:44.460> want<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:44.940> appear<00:02:45.300> on<00:02:45.330> the

on this and I want it to appear on the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.350 
on this and I want it to appear on the
other<00:02:45.540> side<00:02:45.959> when<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.560> hit<00:02:46.740> smart<00:02:47.100> resem<00:02:47.459> it's

other side when I hit smart resem it's

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.390 
other side when I hit smart resem it's
not<00:02:48.630> going<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.900> work<00:02:49.050> because<00:02:49.740> I<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.280> go

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
not going to work because I have to go

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.680 
not going to work because I have to go
