00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
camera and it was kind of blurry but

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.970

usually I fill my eyebrows and really

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.800 
usually I fill my eyebrows and really
slap<00:02:53.310> early<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.850> then<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.000> take<00:02:54.210> my<00:02:54.360> Revlon

Colorstay foundation in a flat brush and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.500 
Colorstay foundation in a flat brush and
it<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.720> fixes<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.590> by<00:02:59.330> kind<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.420> like

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
it kind of fixes it up by kind of like

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420 
it kind of fixes it up by kind of like
outlining<00:03:00.960> it<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.380> shaping<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> lot<00:03:02.160> better

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
outlining it and shaping it a lot better

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.580 
outlining it and shaping it a lot better
and<00:03:02.730> this<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.570> pretty<00:03:03.780> much<00:03:03.990> my<00:03:04.230> eyebrow

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590

and this is just pretty much my eyebrow
routine<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.780> yes<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.080> really<00:03:07.230> helps

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
routine and yes so this really helps

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.870

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.329 
eyeliner a black eye learn right or
anything<00:06:01.749> if<00:06:02.259> you<00:06:02.409> were<00:06:02.499> going<00:06:02.649> to<00:06:02.680> fly<00:06:02.860> island

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:03.339 
anything if you were going to fly island

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.189 
anything if you were going to fly island
I<00:06:03.460> suggest<00:06:03.849> playing<00:06:04.060> white<00:06:04.509> eyeliner<00:06:04.899> because

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:05.199 
I suggest playing white eyeliner because

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.260 
I suggest playing white eyeliner because
it<00:06:05.529> would<00:06:05.620> make<00:06:05.740> it<00:06:05.860> your<00:06:06.009> eyeshadow<00:06:06.879> Santa<00:06:07.240> a

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
it would make it your eyeshadow Santa a

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.659 
it would make it your eyeshadow Santa a
lot<00:06:07.569> more<00:06:07.990> because<00:06:08.800> if<00:06:08.949> you<00:06:09.039> did<00:06:09.189> black<00:06:09.430> it

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
lot more because if you did black it

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.219 
lot more because if you did black it
would<00:06:09.759> just<00:06:09.879> draw<00:06:10.300> from<00:06:10.629> the<00:06:10.779> tension<00:06:11.110> of<00:06:11.169> the

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
would just draw from the tension of the

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:12.929 
would just draw from the tension of the
eyeshadow<00:06:11.740> which<00:06:12.009> you<00:06:12.219> don't<00:06:12.370> want<00:06:12.610> that<00:06:12.759> to

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:12.939 
eyeshadow which you don't want that to

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.089 
eyeshadow which you don't want that to
do<00:06:13.089> because<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:13.719> whole<00:06:13.930> idea<00:06:13.960> is<00:06:14.379> the<00:06:14.589> sunset

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
do because the whole idea is the sunset

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.700 
do because the whole idea is the sunset
and<00:06:15.249> not<00:06:15.789> just<00:06:16.120> a<00:06:16.240> black<00:06:16.449> line<00:06:16.719> across<00:06:16.960> dry<00:06:17.379> a
