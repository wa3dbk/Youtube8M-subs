at<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> same<00:02:00.719> time<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.290> course<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:02.070> faster

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
at the same time of course it's faster

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.990 
at the same time of course it's faster
this<00:02:02.790> way<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> also<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:05.159> get<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> sense<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this way and also you get a sense of the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.670 
this way and also you get a sense of the
weight<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> two<00:02:06.780> meatballs<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.500> they<00:02:07.590> are

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
weight of the two meatballs and they are

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.100 
weight of the two meatballs and they are
the<00:02:07.770> same<00:02:08.009> weight<00:02:08.399> this<00:02:08.640> way<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.539> form<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
the same weight this way so you form the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.460 
the same weight this way so you form the
two<00:02:10.319> meatballs<00:02:10.879> like<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.150> two<00:02:12.330> at<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> time

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
two meatballs like this two at a time

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.590 
two meatballs like this two at a time
and<00:02:13.560> then<00:02:13.860> set<00:02:14.130> them<00:02:14.310> aside<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:14.910> make<00:02:15.300> all

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and then set them aside and you make all

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930 
and then set them aside and you make all
your<00:02:15.870> meatballs<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.560> way<00:02:16.770> once<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
your meatballs this way once the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.090 
your meatballs this way once the
meatballs<00:02:18.360> have<00:02:18.540> been<00:02:18.750> made<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.800> go
