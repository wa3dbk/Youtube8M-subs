this<00:02:46.739> they<00:02:47.459> will<00:02:47.609> be<00:02:47.640> probably<00:02:48.150> kind<00:02:49.019> of

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
this they will be probably kind of

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.800 
this they will be probably kind of
overpowered<00:02:49.769> if<00:02:49.859> they<00:02:49.980> did<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.190> guess<00:02:50.489> so<00:02:51.420> I'm

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
overpowered if they did I guess so I'm

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.050 
overpowered if they did I guess so I'm
glad<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.350> guess<00:02:53.100> they<00:02:53.250> don't<00:02:53.400> cuz<00:02:53.790> I'm<00:02:53.910> gonna
