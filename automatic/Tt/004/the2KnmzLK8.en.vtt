00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.519
 never was battery pack or the beautiful 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.770
 Niwa Battery pack this beautiful device 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.720
 here everyone has to say it would be just 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.070
 really something really cool for such a 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 Try or try in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.430
 be so play for the nostalgia fans 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.840
 that's definitely the right thing more 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.180
 He really liked it great 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.290
 rating at motto star donald link 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.329
 below in the video description and is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.950
 a four meter 10 cutting width we 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.530
 Just look in the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.739
 mods erntemaschine yes you never 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 it was k5 35,500 will cost the good piece 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.660
 440 ps or 3000 liter tank and that can 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.219
 as reap and quite normal the whole 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.109
 normal fruits and then we have 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.180
 still the cutting work so 35 and as 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.070
 big day the tailoring with eight euros 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 and heating costs on day 14 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.970
 and yes everything is cool but that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.970
 it was closed 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.500
 By the way , you can start driving this way 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.190
 really nice i do that to me 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.390
 again a moment ago 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.390
 you can just extend the tube completely 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.909
 normal standard occupancy button straw 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.440
 you can deposit on or off 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.970
 Also very cool, this one too 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.610
 Squeaky effect I can just do it 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.330
 In a nutshell, it really is overseer 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:53.330
 sander is harvester unfold fix 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:55.130
 So go up the lid on the measure so 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.840
 harvester again I know close 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.479
 not at all if something else happens and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.580
 climbs up the mountain here but people 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.280
 he has performance and that's right 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.130
 Achievement 20 km h the thing here the mountain 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.840
 high there team creates tactical 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.380
 really cool 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.910
 Of course we can do that 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.420
 cutting tools with the mouse button still 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.330
 imagine 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.709
 grips and can even go forward 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.090
 and drive back so you can 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.310
 Everything is set really well even 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.590
 one more motto that all automatically for 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.579
 your discussions takes on a cool word 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.549
 I actually thought about it and 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.380
 Definitely imagine but is nothing 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.989
 really continue besides that just there 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.380
 automatically the cutting height and 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.910
 everything a whole ramallah ever sets 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.590
 after what just reaps but also 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.350
 So I find something completely new myself 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.299
 cool so here tractor over to 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.650
 beautiful german steps lamborghini 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.880
 we have a little something left to do 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.790
 reap and that's what they will be now 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.859
 Do that to see how this part 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.769
 So here in the field doing so 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:56.959
 once the good piece turns one down 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.150
 machine from scarce year is just like that 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.870
 unfolded 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.870
 switch on once 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.360
 quite like that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.480
 is already just about as and 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.890
 then you just have to go with the part 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.260
 einzugs animation also everything super cool 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.850
 Made texture of the whole device 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.020
 also great the gloss effect it was god 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.200
 thanks were omitted 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.700
 because that would be nice, of course 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.560
 batty to order times very briefly the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.319
 helper 1 look in those views 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:36.140
 that also looks right ahead of traffic jams and 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:38.540
 really shit out moment so that is 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.840
 really nice before costs that 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.670
 part 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.820
 it's all animated so this whole 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.340
 what do you call that we are on the side? 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.130
 all these pulleys and rollers and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.080
 V-belts are all animated 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.280
 if you go off that's the turn 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:04:02.650
 can really get really wet out of it 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:05.959
 let's get off the moment very nice 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.670
 So here you can see it all 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.010
 works that's just really that 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.989
 cool here is the straw tray 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:18.190
 or black stock ever 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:18.190
 after it comes out very cool it also sparkles 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.039
 shrill degree moment 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.410
 he could 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.919
 Alas, the situation is about the break type 

00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:36.979
 not possible yes clearly we have that 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.099
 problem or and what is that 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:48.459
 I do not know exactly at the moment 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:48.459
 pity or is that 24 23 would do 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:58.909
 moment just quickly to 23 that were 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:01.430
 down there where so prelate here 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.930
 unbelievable with 26 km but wonder 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.300
 now without is so part of it 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:11.300
 really just new from i find 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.590
 the absolute class ahead light 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.569
 of course, also here by the three 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.190
 headlights behind but also a 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:21.830
 headlight nice work obligation 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:24.229
 left does not have the good part too 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.180
 There were not any longer at that time 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:32.240
 totally overrated I think so anyway 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.789
 even so i am not honest now 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.409
 said if we are with this trailer 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.469
 Well, it will not work 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.150
 work that well in full bloom 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.319
 well we can not unload just now 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.319
 Of course you can also do that there 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.349
 well he is but what I show 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.729
 wanted 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.159
 by the way, we already have nine percent 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.409
 in there above times ever the contact there 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.490
 is that namely turning 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:06:00.889
 Sarah is also such a small wave 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.680
 everything animates everything chic in the 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.860
 getting out looks really new 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.479
 that he was cool so pretty then 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.880
 if you like it for the nostalgia 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.199
 fans for the oldtimer fans you will find 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.520
 below in the video description just 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:14.360
 documents write me nice comment 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.520
 as he finds 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.930
 and leave that for me there if it is you 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.460
 I liked that sense 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.449
 first out until the next board 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.449
 Presentation of new maggie
