front it's called their SBS system and

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
front it's called their SBS system and
what<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> does<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.330> takes<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.780> sound

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
what it does is it takes the sound

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.660 
what it does is it takes the sound
coming<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.860> speaker<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.549> the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.660 
now you guys know I reviewed this before
the<00:02:48.630> system<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.860> be<00:02:49.950> utilized<00:02:50.130> with

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the system and this can be utilized with

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.280 
the system and this can be utilized with
all<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.450> could<00:02:51.600> put<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.050> like

all that so you could put this on like

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.280 
all that so you could put this on like
the<00:02:52.440> bike<00:02:52.650> mount<00:02:52.980> or<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.690> surface<00:02:54.690> mount<00:02:55.110> or

the bike mount or the surface mount or
anything<00:02:55.560> like<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.190> has<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> special

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
anything like that it has a special

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.699 
anything like that it has a special
locking<00:02:57.420> mechanism<00:02:57.990> which<00:02:58.170> also<00:02:58.350> you<00:02:58.590> can

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
locking mechanism which also you can

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.350 
locking mechanism which also you can
show<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.190> second<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.700> then<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.150> comes

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
show you in a second and then it comes

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.510 
show you in a second and then it comes
with<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.570> belt<00:03:00.750> clip<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.350> you<00:03:01.890> can<00:03:02.010> put<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.280> belt

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
with a belt clip so you can put the belt

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.170 
with a belt clip so you can put the belt
clip<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.570> then<00:03:04.110> use<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.800> work<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:05.940> onto

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
clip on and then use it to work it onto

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.580 
clip on and then use it to work it onto
your<00:03:06.270> belt<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.750> basically<00:03:07.260> what<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:07.560> is

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
your belt so basically what you do is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.440 
your belt so basically what you do is
you<00:03:07.800> line<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.160> up<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.610> slide<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.090> on<00:03:09.209> down

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you line this up and slide it on down

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.410 
you line this up and slide it on down
till<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.410> locks<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.860> place<00:03:10.890> like<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.880> now

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
till it locks in place like so and now

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.350 
till it locks in place like so and now
it's<00:03:12.600> locked<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:14.060> put<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.150> on<00:03:15.180> your

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
it's locked in and then put it on your

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.580 
it's locked in and then put it on your
belt<00:03:15.570> now<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:15.990> I<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.170> put<00:03:16.380> it<00:03:16.530> on

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
belt now I think I just put it on

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.740 
belt now I think I just put it on
backwards<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.400> let<00:03:17.940> me<00:03:18.060> pop<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.420> off<00:03:18.540> real

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
backwards so let me pop it off real

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.820 
backwards so let me pop it off real
quick<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.140> doesn't<00:03:19.350> really<00:03:19.470> matter

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
quick it doesn't really matter

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.860 
quick it doesn't really matter
I<00:03:19.980> don't<00:03:20.160> think<00:03:20.250> which<00:03:20.700> way<00:03:20.850> it<00:03:20.970> goes<00:03:21.030> but<00:03:21.540> I

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
I don't think which way it goes but I

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.530 
I don't think which way it goes but I
think<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.350> wants<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.680> go<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:23.400> way<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.910> I'll

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
think it wants to go this way and I'll

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.910 
think it wants to go this way and I'll
show<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:24.780> why<00:03:24.989> in<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.200> second<00:03:25.590> because<00:03:25.769> when

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
show you why in a second because when

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.100 
show you why in a second because when
you<00:03:25.980> put<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.310> lock<00:03:26.519> on<00:03:26.790> it<00:03:27.420> needs<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.959> be<00:03:28.080> a

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
you put the lock on it needs to be a

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.690 
you put the lock on it needs to be a
certain<00:03:28.320> way<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.800> there<00:03:29.070> now<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:29.459> clicked

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
certain way so there now it's clicked

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.060 
certain way so there now it's clicked
into<00:03:29.850> place<00:03:29.940> and<00:03:30.180> now<00:03:30.840> basically<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.590> have<00:03:31.769> a

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
into place and now basically you have a

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.160 
into place and now basically you have a
spot<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:32.760> your<00:03:32.970> phone<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.209> insert<00:03:33.720> into<00:03:33.870> and

spot for your phone to insert into and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.740 
spot for your phone to insert into and
it<00:03:34.230> just<00:03:34.410> clicks<00:03:34.769> in<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.820> this

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
it just clicks in like that and this

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.290 
it just clicks in like that and this
piece<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.410> optional<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.370> locking<00:03:38.910> clasp

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
piece is optional it's a locking clasp

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.449 
piece is optional it's a locking clasp
if<00:03:39.630> you<00:03:39.750> will<00:03:39.959> which<00:03:40.530> secures<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.250> phone

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
prevents it from coming out the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.330 
prevents it from coming out the
instructions<00:03:49.470> say<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.650> this<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.160> be

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
instructions say that this can be

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.280

wouldn't<00:03:52.620> see<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> reason<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.280> remove<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.760> this

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
wouldn't see a reason to remove it this

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.910 
wouldn't see a reason to remove it this
would<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.300> you<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.900> safeguard<00:03:55.560> your<00:03:55.680> phone

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
would just you know safeguard your phone

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.560 
would just you know safeguard your phone
and<00:03:56.310> make<00:03:56.489> sure<00:03:56.670> that<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:56.910> doesn't<00:03:57.090> fall<00:03:57.239> out

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
and make sure that it doesn't fall out

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.080 
and make sure that it doesn't fall out
forward<00:03:58.290> when<00:03:58.830> it's<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.100> your<00:03:59.250> belt<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.910> one

forward when it's on your belt the one

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.240 
forward when it's on your belt the one
thing<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.450> I<00:04:00.930> don't<00:04:00.989> necessarily<00:04:01.680> like

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
thing that I don't necessarily like

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.220 
thing that I don't necessarily like
about<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.640> holster<00:04:03.060> unless<00:04:03.660> I'm<00:04:03.900> missing

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
about the holster unless I'm missing

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.949 
about the holster unless I'm missing
something<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.680> can't<00:04:04.980> find<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.370> way<00:04:05.550> to<00:04:05.690> lock<00:04:06.690> it

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
something I can't find a way to lock it

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.080 
something I can't find a way to lock it
close<00:04:07.260> with<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.709> when<00:04:07.980> it's<00:04:08.100> screen<00:04:08.459> in<00:04:08.790> so

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
close with this when it's screen in so

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.940 
close with this when it's screen in so
it<00:04:09.570> will<00:04:09.720> go<00:04:09.870> into<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.200> holster<00:04:10.410> just<00:04:10.769> fine

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
it will go into the holster just fine

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.560 
it will go into the holster just fine
with<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.160> screen<00:04:11.489> facing<00:04:11.700> it<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.180> can<00:04:12.330> see

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
with the screen facing it as you can see

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.479 
with the screen facing it as you can see
but<00:04:13.140> then<00:04:13.320> when<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.530> go<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.650> put<00:04:13.890> this<00:04:14.010> clip<00:04:14.310> on

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
but then when you go to put this clip on

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.060 
but then when you go to put this clip on
it<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.299> won't<00:04:15.540> make<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.260> all<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.680> way<00:04:16.769> over

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
it just won't make it all the way over

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.400 
it just won't make it all the way over
and<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.640> doesn't<00:04:18.090> want<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.299> lock<00:04:18.540> on<00:04:18.810> so<00:04:19.169> I

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
and it doesn't want to lock on so I

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.409 
and it doesn't want to lock on so I
guess<00:04:20.070> if<00:04:20.250> you're<00:04:20.400> going<00:04:20.580> to<00:04:20.729> use<00:04:20.880> it<00:04:21.060> screen

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
guess if you're going to use it screen

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.820 
guess if you're going to use it screen
in<00:04:21.660> you're<00:04:21.840> going<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.049> have<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.320> remove<00:04:22.590> this

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
in you're going to have to remove this

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.520 
in you're going to have to remove this
piece<00:04:23.100> for<00:04:23.820> whatever<00:04:23.970> reason<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:25.110> just<00:04:25.169> won't

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
piece for whatever reason it just won't

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.340 
piece for whatever reason it just won't
fit<00:04:25.680> won't<00:04:25.860> work<00:04:26.070> that

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
fit won't work that

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.520 
fit won't work that
way<00:04:26.490> no<00:04:27.490> matter<00:04:27.640> which<00:04:27.940> way<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.930> go<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.380> just

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
way no matter which way you go it just

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.110 
way no matter which way you go it just
doesn't<00:04:29.800> want<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:29.950> do<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.160> so<00:04:30.430> it's<00:04:30.580> best<00:04:30.820> to<00:04:30.940> be

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
doesn't want to do it so it's best to be

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.380 
doesn't want to do it so it's best to be
screened<00:04:32.020> out<00:04:32.140> if<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.890> want<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.160> use<00:04:33.430> that

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
screened out if you want to use that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.170 
screened out if you want to use that
locking<00:04:35.200> mechanism<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:35.920> so<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.400> then<00:04:37.000> like

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
locking mechanism like so and then like

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.480 
locking mechanism like so and then like
I<00:04:37.300> said<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.540> belt<00:04:37.960> clip<00:04:38.110> part<00:04:38.620> is<00:04:38.830> removable

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
I said the belt clip part is removable

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.170 
I said the belt clip part is removable
and<00:04:39.760> this<00:04:40.210> clip<00:04:40.840> portion<00:04:41.710> becomes<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.910> fuse

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
and this clip portion becomes the fuse

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.670 
and this clip portion becomes the fuse
deck<00:04:43.420> you<00:04:43.600> already<00:04:43.810> saw<00:04:43.990> me<00:04:44.170> remove<00:04:44.440> it<00:04:44.530> when<00:04:44.620> I

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
deck you already saw me remove it when I

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.440 
deck you already saw me remove it when I
put<00:04:44.950> it<00:04:45.040> on<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.370> wrong<00:04:45.490> way<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:45.760> you

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
put it on the wrong way but you

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.480 
put it on the wrong way but you
basically<00:04:46.630> just<00:04:46.960> slide<00:04:47.350> this<00:04:47.560> piece<00:04:47.830> out<00:04:48.070> and

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
basically just slide this piece out and

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.910 
basically just slide this piece out and
then<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.390> becomes<00:04:49.900> part<00:04:50.230> of<00:04:50.320> the<00:04:50.440> fuse<00:04:50.710> deck

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.920 
then it becomes part of the fuse deck
