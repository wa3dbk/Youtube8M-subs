from<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> bottom<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.020> eye<00:01:28.200> here

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.890 

like<00:01:39.610> not

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.130 

and<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:43.640> between<00:01:44.480> her<00:01:44.990> eye<00:01:45.050> and<00:01:45.530> her<00:01:45.680> mouth

and it is between her eye and her mouth

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.820 
and it is between her eye and her mouth
pretty<00:01:48.140> much<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:50.180> then<00:01:50.330> for<00:01:50.540> her<00:01:50.600> hair<00:01:50.930> I<00:01:51.350> just

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
pretty much and then for her hair I just

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:59.820 
pretty much and then for her hair I just
need<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.370> put<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.360> some<00:01:53.560> arcs

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.929 

representing<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:00.850> cows

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
representing the cows

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.499 
representing the cows
she<00:02:03.479> also<00:02:03.600> has<00:02:03.840> eyelashes<00:02:04.880> for<00:02:05.880> Leah<00:02:06.210> try<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
she also has eyelashes for Leah try to

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:20.080 
she also has eyelashes for Leah try to
be<00:02:06.840> precise

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.850 

do<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.450> bottom<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.870> mouth<00:02:21.050> which<00:02:21.709> will

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
do the bottom of the mouth which will

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.340 
do the bottom of the mouth which will
come<00:02:22.040> roughly<00:02:22.640> about<00:02:22.760> halfway<00:02:23.260> where<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
come roughly about halfway where the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.910 
come roughly about halfway where the
topic<00:02:24.590> is

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:42.140 

straight

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.270 

basically<00:02:43.150> just<00:02:43.540> define<00:02:44.170> here<00:02:44.500> exactly<00:02:44.890> where

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
basically just define here exactly where

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.990 
basically just define here exactly where
the<00:02:45.430> hair<00:02:45.640> is<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:45.879> to<00:02:45.970> go<00:02:47.489> so<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.670> actually

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the hair is going to go so it actually

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.220 
the hair is going to go so it actually
comes<00:02:49.209> out<00:02:49.420> from<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.689> back<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.049> head

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
comes out from the back of the head

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.280 
comes out from the back of the head
slightly<00:02:51.239> it's<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.299> lot<00:02:52.450> thicker<00:02:52.720> than<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.110> air

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
slightly it's a lot thicker than the air

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.500 
slightly it's a lot thicker than the air
and<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.769> circles<00:02:54.189> I<00:02:54.280> originally<00:02:54.760> drew<00:02:55.920> so<00:02:56.920> you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
and the circles I originally drew so you

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.059 
and the circles I originally drew so you
had<00:02:58.510> to<00:02:58.750> compensate<00:02:59.170> for<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.920> go

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
had to compensate for that and go

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.800 
had to compensate for that and go
further<00:03:01.590> further<00:03:02.590> away<00:03:02.860> from<00:03:02.890> them<00:03:03.629> and<00:03:04.629> then

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
further further away from them and then

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.509 
further further away from them and then
again<00:03:05.019> as<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.349> did<00:03:05.500> with<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.709> hair<00:03:06.190> here<00:03:06.489> you

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
again as you did with the hair here you

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.979 
again as you did with the hair here you
just<00:03:06.849> add<00:03:07.060> in<00:03:07.209> arcs<00:03:08.159> all<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.310> way<00:03:09.459> up<00:03:10.269> the

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
just add in arcs all the way up the

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:22.490 
just add in arcs all the way up the
lines

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500 

we're<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.190> pencil<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.790> details<00:03:24.270> a<00:03:24.360> bit

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
we're just pencil in the details a bit

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.660 
we're just pencil in the details a bit
more<00:03:24.690> harder

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
more harder

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.270 
more harder
define<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.630> features<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:32.040> how<00:03:32.220> you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
define the features and that is how you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.790 
define the features and that is how you
draw<00:03:32.490> Marge<00:03:32.730> Simpson
