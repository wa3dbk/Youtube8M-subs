00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.910
 Hello everyone, guys and welcome 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.840
 finally after a very long time and a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.119
 new video the reason why not 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.359
 I was more uploading video because I am 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 committed to doing the personal thing that 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.079
 I cannot reveal you but we are not talking about 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.059
 me and let 's talk about what I saw to explain 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.579
 as you saw in the title of the video 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.690
 today we're going to emulate glasses 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.530
 of the spoons skirt from one thing only 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.899
 for the long gaming sessions they have 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.950
 created because of the glasses because 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.829
 eyes get tired 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.280
 but they get tired with the beast they have created 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.520
 these kind of glasses don't come with these 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.930
 slow those already the season I do not know that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.380
 those are made and their piece is not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.110
 that is so high that I am at the end 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.290
 about sixty euros of course 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.500
 let's talk down there are more models 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.939
 different but what he was going to pay is 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.740
 only the mount 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.040
 the problem what the problem adds 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.020
 for those who already have glasses because they have 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.530
 already the glasses if we will go to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.900
 buy them that of ad in stock base 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.220
 Price action increases so 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.220
 exaggerated 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.500
 for example, that it is 350 degrees 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.080
 price touches 300 euros 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.140
 600 euros is a hole in piece 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.690
 let's face it and I found this 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.690
 program that emulates through software 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.110
 it's the color of these lenses by doing yes 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.830
 that moves all the colors of the monitor 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.260
 towards the color of this lens this 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.810
 program I found it in my ass spin 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.540
 flooding on facebook is said the 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.470
 program the program in question 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.989
 precisely f.lux which can be downloaded 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.000
 from the official website obviously a high one 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.250
 download it we easily install from 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.750
 no need for a fucking tutorial 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.250
 all have been unplanned or 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.720
 at least I hope it will save us f.lux f.lux e 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.810
 this sort of iconic window in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.459
 lower right where is clock 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.120
 and what to do there is normally e 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.260
 computer of these colors that I don't think 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.470
 that you should see with the 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.040
 registration as it is a 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.390
 modification of the beautiful color of the software of the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 computer there is a figure of shit at the beginning 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.170
 we have so normal normal colors 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.650
 ok and to emulate the glasses of the 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:08.769
 gonna check or how much on the internet the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:11.049
 color is 33 thousand and 40k or so what 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.739
 you say that cazz colors are not me 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.269
 I find it very normal at the beginning but 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.100
 now I'm used to it now 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.660
 lot 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.510
 I can no longer do without it 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.500
 really keeping the original colors me 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.660
 they hurt your eyes 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.700
 thanks to this program actually 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.450
 and the eyes get less tired and there 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.530
 I can guarantee that I feel better 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.110
 both for the eyes and physically also 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.260
 because it has also been countered 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.720
 which helps you sleep at night because I am 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.690
 program with a different name exists 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.620
 also for android and for how many 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.460
 you used the phone at night and 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.960
 they have had 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.040
 controversy the brightness I think so of you 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.150
 however we don't talk about what 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.810
 let's talk about the computer 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:05.080
 I recommend the setting for who 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.740
 wants to do a classic thing about 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.850
 so put a normal day and night 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:16.450
 another 40 km 40k this will happen 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.610
 when we go towards the night it changes 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.360
 color when it the day will change 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:25.110
 again the color from women or bad needle 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.430
 doug an abnormal 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:30.310
 we go differently than the same 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.390
 I will explain another thing I ask for 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.860
 moon I am at 3400 boss ok I am all 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.030
 7400 k all two days because seen 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:45.010
 what the fuck does he have anyway we can 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.950
 bring the glow even more 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:52.060
 the eyeglasses gundam yet 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.920
 more yellow even more yellow on ok though 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.200
 that sucks is not that it sucks but 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:02.050
 when you go to play you don't really see 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.930
 a chocolate bat but you can't see one 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.700
 fuck can be good to be must 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.670
 read something with the white background 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:12.250
 like on facebook because on facebook to me 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.470
 happened to read billboards of things 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:21.550
 it hurt the eyes is due 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:23.920
 put to 27 from 2007 k but if only in 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.080
 certain situations I put it but I of 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.440
 new normally I always put the first ones 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.680
 four others 1,400 know no one from 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.980
 do anything this way for nothing 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.920
 the setting I want you to want that 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:42.190
 know this transactions up to 20 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.790
 second grandmother dislocates 60 thousand euros to a 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.160
 absurd casino is not that paid works 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.480
 lacks absurd breast, at least I don't 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.030
 council 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.940
 and it will be placed forever I keep so of 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.730
 day at night always at 3400 k is sto 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:03.139
 well well today I have explained to you how 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.939
 emulate the lagoon glasses 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.069
 who already has glasses for mirrors 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:10.340
 we do n't give ourselves could also very well 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:12.009
 check but if there is no money with 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.860
 this program is still excellent 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:18.469
 well I greet you or for a neighbor 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.319
 video hoping it will be the hardest 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.969
 possible but I don't think so but I can't not 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.430
 I think I can keep my promise 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:28.279
 made a long time ago or a viral 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.349
 this is my last week 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.599
 video in fact dates back to the beginning of March 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:36.620
 instead look where we are now we are 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.099
 at the end of March also for many 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.960
 problems 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:43.240
 ok, come on it's nothing we want 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.240
 then nice video maria ciao a tutti
