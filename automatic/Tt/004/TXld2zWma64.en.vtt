00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
bucks a good price for this thing I

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.100 
bucks a good price for this thing I
don't<00:00:41.670> know<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.329> Wemo<00:00:42.660> switch<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:43.050> we

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
don't know the Wemo switch that we

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200 
don't know the Wemo switch that we
tested<00:00:43.469> cost<00:00:43.710> 50<00:00:44.160> bucks<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.730> only<00:00:44.969> has<00:00:45.180> one

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
tested cost 50 bucks it only has one

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.720 
tested cost 50 bucks it only has one
outlet<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> also<00:00:46.260> adds<00:00:46.559> if<00:00:46.770> compatibility

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
outlet but it also adds if compatibility

outlet but it also adds if compatibility
and<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.030> works<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.360> well

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and it works really well

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
and it works really well

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.369 
you can plug a motion detector up with
it<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.820> think<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.840> pretty<00:00:51.989> good<00:00:52.170> product

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.049 
it I think that's a pretty good product
and<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> might<00:00:53.160> be<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> better<00:00:53.520> option<00:00:53.640> here

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and that might be the better option here

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
and that might be the better option here
but<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.449> does<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.809> two<00:00:55.020> outlets<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.590> the
