third time's a charm right let's try it

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.650 
third time's a charm right let's try it
one<00:05:25.380> last<00:05:26.540> time<00:05:28.970> I'm<00:05:29.970> pretty<00:05:30.180> I'm<00:05:30.360> pretty<00:05:30.390> bad

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
one last time I'm pretty I'm pretty bad

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.270 
one last time I'm pretty I'm pretty bad
at<00:05:30.720> spinning<00:05:31.170> maybe<00:05:31.350> that<00:05:31.500> weapon<00:05:31.860> is<00:05:32.070> to

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
at spinning maybe that weapon is to

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.710 
at spinning maybe that weapon is to
noxious<00:05:32.700> liebig<00:05:33.710> for<00:05:34.710> my<00:05:34.830> liking<00:05:35.420> ok<00:05:36.420> let's

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
noxious liebig for my liking ok let's

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.910 
noxious liebig for my liking ok let's
try<00:05:36.990> choke<00:05:37.590> on<00:05:37.770> spinning<00:05:39.200> again<00:05:40.200> my<00:05:40.560> spinning

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
try choke on spinning again my spinning

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.600 
try choke on spinning again my spinning
looks<00:05:41.160> kind<00:05:41.580> of<00:05:41.640> not<00:05:42.210> very<00:05:42.420> clean<00:05:42.930> um<00:05:43.410> he<00:05:44.370> seems

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
looks kind of not very clean um he seems

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.980 
looks kind of not very clean um he seems
to<00:05:44.700> spin<00:05:44.910> pretty<00:05:45.150> well<00:05:45.360> he's<00:05:45.660> a<00:05:45.690> little<00:05:45.780> bit

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
to spin pretty well he's a little bit

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.830 
to spin pretty well he's a little bit
smaller<00:05:46.320> so<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:47.270> little<00:05:48.270> bit<00:05:48.420> interesting<00:05:48.810> I

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
smaller so a little bit interesting I

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.540 
smaller so a little bit interesting I
wonder<00:05:48.870> how<00:05:49.230> the<00:05:49.290> UM<00:05:49.620> short<00:05:50.040> legs<00:05:50.250> actually

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
wonder how the UM short legs actually

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.670 
wonder how the UM short legs actually
affect<00:05:51.090> him<00:05:51.360> during<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:52.110> battle<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.650> the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
affect him during a battle and the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.120 
affect him during a battle and the
second<00:05:53.580> try<00:05:53.850> with<00:05:54.210> choke<00:05:54.510> on<00:05:54.660> spinning<00:05:55.140> that's

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
second try with choke on spinning that's

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.030 
second try with choke on spinning that's
been<00:05:56.280> wasn't<00:05:56.580> too<00:05:56.700> bad<00:05:56.880> well<00:05:57.770> his<00:05:58.770> to<00:05:58.950> be

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
been wasn't too bad well his to be

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.320 
been wasn't too bad well his to be
spinning<00:05:59.340> out<00:05:59.430> of<00:05:59.460> control<00:05:59.550> he's<00:06:00.000> going<00:06:00.150> too

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
spinning out of control he's going too

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.860 
spinning out of control he's going too

guys<00:06:03.960> he's<00:06:04.440> too<00:06:04.650> battling<00:06:05.250> but<00:06:05.430> I<00:06:05.460> had<00:06:05.670> to

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
guys he's too battling but I had to

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.030 
guys he's too battling but I had to
spend<00:06:06.060> both<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.510> them<00:06:06.720> and<00:06:06.960> one<00:06:06.990> would<00:06:07.530> be<00:06:07.650> spun

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
spend both of them and one would be spun

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.000 
spend both of them and one would be spun
first<00:06:08.610> which<00:06:09.570> would<00:06:09.840> probably<00:06:10.440> lead<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.740> an

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
first which would probably lead to an

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.180 
first which would probably lead to an
advantage<00:06:11.670> of<00:06:11.940> some<00:06:12.330> sort<00:06:12.660> for<00:06:12.930> some<00:06:13.530> size<00:06:13.770> so

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
advantage of some sort for some size so

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.160 
advantage of some sort for some size so
I<00:06:14.370> wish<00:06:15.330> I<00:06:15.450> could<00:06:15.600> show<00:06:15.750> you<00:06:15.780> these<00:06:15.960> two

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 
battling but I can't really and one last

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.790 
battling but I can't really and one last
spin<00:06:19.170> or<00:06:19.650> chokha<00:06:20.780> that<00:06:21.780> wasn't<00:06:22.080> too<00:06:22.170> bad<00:06:22.200> spin

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
spin or chokha that wasn't too bad spin

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.250 
spin or chokha that wasn't too bad spin
well<00:06:23.250> if<00:06:24.210> you<00:06:24.330> hadn't<00:06:24.630> hit<00:06:24.720> the<00:06:24.840> side<00:06:25.080> that

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.230 
well if you hadn't hit the side that
would<00:06:25.440> be<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.590> much<00:06:25.800> better<00:06:25.860> spin<00:06:26.400> but<00:06:26.640> I<00:06:26.820> had<00:06:27.030> to

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
would be a much better spin but I had to

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.970 
would be a much better spin but I had to
put<00:06:27.540> the<00:06:27.630> arena<00:06:27.960> here<00:06:28.260> so<00:06:28.410> they<00:06:28.500> wouldn't<00:06:28.710> run

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:28.980 
put the arena here so they wouldn't run

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.540
