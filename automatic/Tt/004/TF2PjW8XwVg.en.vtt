00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.910
 very good everyone today grants foxx and in 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.979
 this video I'm going to show you how to pass the 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.839
 second phase of the raid the end of 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:09.790
 create the bridge phase with your 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.160
 team your plan your friends 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.049
 our colleagues whatever you want from a 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.429
 quickly and easily through a 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.990
 trick that we can still do in 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.960
 destination and after the update 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.599
 that happened as you know on Monday 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.539
 11 or 12 in 12 from January 12 and 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.740
 nothing here I show you the trick is worth 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.060
 do this trick well then what 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.179
 we have to do is be with our 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.680
 team in the bridge area what 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.540
 we are going to do is form the bridge 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.489
 normally as if there were no tricks 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.920
 as if we had to go without 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.780
 tricks and for that you already know a 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.170
 player over the bridge and the 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.160
 others 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.449
 they are divided among the totens and I am going to 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.250
 explain the trick if you were six 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.469
 players but it's a trick so that what 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.719
 do then from three players 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.520
 if you want with three players it would be more 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.680
 enough to do this trick 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.420
 you would have to organize better but 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.699
 good is a trick for you to share 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.949
 with your friends this area and so that 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.270
 do it quickly then what 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.720
 we do when the bridge is formed 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.270
 completely 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.370
 to carry swords and we passed the bridge 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.410
 Normally, as we would do, I'll tell you if 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.360
 there were no tricks we killed the portal 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.000
 swords that there are to the custodian and forgiveness is 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.190
 what's in this area, you know that 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.270
 If 6.032 costs us nothing to kill the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.130
 custodian and then we have to stay 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.800
 in this area cleaning with a little 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.470
 area to make our companion that goes 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.570
 to come people later and once 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 that the sword disappears 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.960
 As you know, another one will appear 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.570
 carries swords on the other side of the bridge 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.270
 we would have to kill him and you should 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.380
 cross another of our companions 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.060
 because I say that I should cross another 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.710
 of our classmates because good I 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.260
 I recommend that two people spend in 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.810
 the bridge so that we make sure that 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.630
 you are going to complete this phase and that you are going 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.490
 to complete then with two players 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.140
 because they are the ones who are going to have to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.240
 actually commission to pass the phase 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.369
 could be done with a player could 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.380
 get with three players or with four 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.390
 in this part of the bridge that is already 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.820
 your choice I say two players 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.860
 because it 's a simple quick because 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.600
 surely with two players is more 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.190
 that enough we always 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.140
 with two players but I already say you could 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.200
 do it with 1 with 2 with 3 that with the 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.970
 I wanted 6 but good with two players 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.140
 in my opinion it is more than enough and it is 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.820
 I'm sure we're going to cross the bridge 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.550
 what the rest of the players do 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.170
 as you are seeing here are two of my 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.840
 friends passing the bridge I have 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.160
 Last good indeed and my clan will 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.900
 creep tarkas from here I send them a 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.540
 I greet and thank you for 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.730
 let me record the videos and foremost a 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.370
 Once we have built the bridge and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.530
 that two of our colleagues have 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.240
 past or that we have passed on to us and 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.410
 another partner then the rest of 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.570
 players what you have to do is 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.610
 come to the room where the portal comes out 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.680
 swords and on climbing on the stone of is 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.120
 where previously it did the trick 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.440
 the one they had uploaded to the channel and 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.980
 nothing what you have to do these 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.450
 players is to wait here for the rest 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.560
 make the rest of the enemies disappear 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.110
 this area of ​​the bridge is only 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 the sword holder as you know and good 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.710
 at the moment they start to appear 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.510
 the enemies on the other side of the bridge 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.730
 Well, the two players that we have sent 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.810
 to the other area they would have to kill them in 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.450
 the moment the ogres kill 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.709
 we would finish the phase 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.270
 in the players that stay in this 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.920
 side of the bridge should be the 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.239
 stone unless they kill one of 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.459
 our partners in which case 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.660
 we could leave this area to help 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.569
 to kill the ogre that comes out in that area 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.400
 and so avoid being killed or killed 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.140
 our partner but as I have with a 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.519
 player would be more than enough and a 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.650
 Once we kill the ogres as you go 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.599
 see later the phase that ends give us 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.640
 the prize if we have not had it and 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.709
 that's why we should go to the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.940
 next phase and nothing that's all 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.310
 we also have to do a 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.799
 rectification because in the phase of 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.349
 bridge in the trick of the bridge you 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.670
 alone you can do it with the hunter is 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.500
 that what with hunting is a little more 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.610
 difficult as soon as I have time or upload 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.680

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.780
