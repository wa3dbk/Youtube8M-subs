freeze<00:03:03.569> objects<00:03:04.109> rotation<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:05.579> has<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> whole

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
freeze objects rotation it has a whole

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.180 
freeze objects rotation it has a whole
bunch<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.209> stuff<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.930> really<00:03:07.709> tells<00:03:07.980> you

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
bunch of stuff so it really tells you

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.660 
bunch of stuff so it really tells you
exactly<00:03:08.989> how<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.019> do<00:03:10.290> it<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.470> I'm<00:03:11.280> going<00:03:11.489> to<00:03:11.549> do

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
exactly how to do it so I'm going to do

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.280 
exactly how to do it so I'm going to do
is<00:03:11.849> I'll<00:03:12.030> probably<00:03:12.209> play<00:03:12.420> strike<00:03:12.780> right<00:03:13.049> here

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
is I'll probably play strike right here

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.910 
is I'll probably play strike right here
so<00:03:13.620> what<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.040> need<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.459> first<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.880> hit<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:16.230> so

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
so what I need to do first is hit and so

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.629 
so what I need to do first is hit and so
i<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.099> bring<00:03:17.220> closer<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.730> myself<00:03:19.519> get<00:03:20.519> it

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
i can bring closer to myself get it

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.120 
i can bring closer to myself get it
about<00:03:21.000> i<00:03:21.720> think<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.290> might<00:03:22.560> be<00:03:22.620> as<00:03:22.799> close<00:03:23.069> as

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
about i think that might be as close as

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.240 
about i think that might be as close as
you<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.430> get<00:03:23.579> to<00:03:23.639> you<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.630> um<00:03:24.870> now<00:03:25.859> want<00:03:26.099> to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
you can get to you but um now want to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.789 
you can get to you but um now want to
put<00:03:26.549> it<00:03:26.639> up<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.819> little<00:03:26.940> bit<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:28.200> i<00:03:28.290> want<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.590> hit

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
put it up a little bit and i want to hit

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.289 
put it up a little bit and i want to hit
the<00:03:28.980> ground<00:03:29.190> perfectly<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.970> i'm<00:03:30.060> going<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.209> do

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
the ground perfectly so i'm going to do

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.960 
the ground perfectly so i'm going to do
is<00:03:30.419> hit<00:03:30.569> free<00:03:31.079> mode<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.560> then<00:03:32.340> what<00:03:32.669> i<00:03:32.700> want<00:03:32.910> to

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
is hit free mode and then what i want to

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
is hit free mode and then what i want to
place<00:03:33.150> it<00:03:33.359> i<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:33.599> drop<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.709> drop<00:03:35.010> to

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
place it i just drop it and I drop to

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.890 
place it i just drop it and I drop to
the<00:03:35.280> ground<00:03:35.400> there<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.180> tell<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.480> dropped<00:03:36.780> I

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
the ground there you tell it dropped I

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.149 
the ground there you tell it dropped I
don't<00:03:37.049> really<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.439> I<00:03:37.470> think<00:03:37.799> it's<00:03:37.920> stuck

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
don't really know I think it's stuck

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.410 
don't really know I think it's stuck
with<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.370> wall<00:03:38.549> right<00:03:38.700> there<00:03:38.849> but<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.090> is

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
with the wall right there but that is

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.110 
with the wall right there but that is
okay<00:03:39.780> step<00:03:40.080> number<00:03:40.200> seven<00:03:40.740> is<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:42.030> be

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
okay step number seven is going to be

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.400 
okay step number seven is going to be
going<00:03:42.300> back<00:03:42.480> here<00:03:42.630> inventory<00:03:42.959> as<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.319> see

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
your screen plus 3 times wood plank and

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.500 
your screen plus 3 times wood plank and
gonna<00:04:02.250> go<00:04:02.400> ahead<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:02.670> keep<00:04:02.940> on<00:04:03.150> going<00:04:03.420> with

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
let's see let's make a storage crate

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.050 
let's see let's make a storage crate
because<00:04:25.080> yeah<00:04:25.770> okay<00:04:26.100> cool<00:04:26.520> crap<00:04:27.260> +<00:04:28.260> 1<00:04:28.710> x<00:04:29.550> stores

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
because yeah okay cool crap + 1 x stores

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.550 
because yeah okay cool crap + 1 x stores
