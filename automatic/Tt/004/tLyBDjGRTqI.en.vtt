00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.760
 Welcome to the sixth edition of Biotechnology TV Labor 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.460
 News magazine of biotechnology d today we show you this in 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.750
 Detergent biotechnology puts forward new room therapies 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.690
 and in our section the Cretaceous explains the concept 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.259
 Autoimmune disease 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.409
 On March 24, World Tuberculosis Day was due to die of the lung disease tuberculosis 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:26.230
 There are about two million people a year worldwide, but there is a bit of hope 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.219
 German researchers are testing a novel vaccine 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:31.140
 pathogen 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
 Tuberculosis is one of the oldest plagues of humanity for a long time you thought 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.650
 that the disease can be eradicated by antibiotics 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.010
 but more and more tuberculosis pathogens are resistant to common antibiotics 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.540
 but not only that also the previously used vaccine offers many 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.720
 no more protection this is a big problem especially in developing countries 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.940
 Berlin researchers around Stefan Kaufmann from the max-planck-institut for 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.530
 Therefore, infection biology have been working on a novel method for years 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.690
 Vaccine that better mobilizes the body's defense against tuberculosis 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.160
 He is currently undergoing the first clinical trials in the compound 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.580
 Federal Ministry of Research 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.550
 Biotechnology is quite common in our everyday lives where exactly that shows 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.300
 Here we are in this new brochure 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.020
 Biotechnology in it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.790
 You can find this brochure on our website www Biotechnologie de 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.219
 ordered for free 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:24.649
 in the next episodes if we show you some examples today 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.890
 Motor oil or heather the juice of red wine or lipstick a disaster for 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.610
 The laundry washed today means the slopes also get stained 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.520
 smaller 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.180
 and that at 60 degrees or even less 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.760
 the reason for the progress the researchers of the big ones 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.140
 Detergent manufacturers are developing better and better additives 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.150
 To dissolve stubborn dirt they can rely on natural dirt 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.229
 eliminate certain enzymes and these molecules can thanks to the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.570
 Biotechnology at all is to be produced in large quantities 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.180
 namely with genetically programmed microorganisms the bacteria 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.210
 1 command in billions of euros give federation and countries since 2006 for the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.410
 Excellence Initiative Housekeeper of cutting-edge research on German 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.319
 Funded universities 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.400
 If you want to know what's going on with the money you can do it on the internet 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.019
 Videoportal Excellence - Visit Initiative de 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.669
 our selection 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.999
 More than 80 projects at German universities will get from the 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.539
 excellence initiative 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:26.509
 and what exactly is researched there 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:31.409
 This is shown by the many videos on the page Excellence - Initiative Points 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.829
 this is how the samples become research at the ludwig-maximilians-university in munich 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.879
 explained with beautiful graphics 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.239
 another video shows 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.350
 which is being researched at the medical college in Hanover 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.209
 to breed human organs 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.209
 and every week a new field of research is added 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.490
 The knee hurts for years the fingers can hardly be moved 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.990
 People with rheumatism often suffer indefinitely in Potsdam 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.130
 Scientists recently advised how to replace this stubborn disease with new ones 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.789
 Approaches can be cured 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.809
 Andreas Radbruch leads the German folder Forschungszentrum in Berlin 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.769
 Institution has organized a symposium at the scientist 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.379
 have discussed a topic that the RÃ¤umer researchers currently have 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.949
 electrified the refers you left 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.659
 For the first time it seems theoretically possible to cure rheumatism 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.529
 Many believe that you have inflammatory rheumatic diseases 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.829
 Percent in all pre-order immune system reaction the body 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:28.749
 attacks 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.849
 Percent percent of these diseases actually determines it 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:32.339
 percent 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.339
 March leave immune system are the the disease 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.659
 keep drifting and percent and we believe that you can get those cells when you go 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.519
 which could attack successfully 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.089
 there you had to come with the preparation 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:46.949
 So there is a vision, so to speak 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.289
 Norman Shetler is coming as a percent delayed cure 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.629
 which is not unrealistic by that 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.189
 The researchers are still far from achieving this vision 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.590
 Rheumatologists were able to do that with the help of biotechnology 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.079
 Medications develop the inflammatory reactions in people with rheumatism 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.389
 children 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:08.659
 Rheumatism is a so-called also TUI now illness 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.829
 but also what is an autoimmune disease actually "That 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.829
 we explain in our section Cretaceous 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.959
 in autoimmune diseases 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.650
 such as multiple sclerosis or rheumatism 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.650
 the body confirms against itself 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.909
 the FC St 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.909
 the disease has more 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.539
 - Coach Schaaf 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.409
 more 4 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.680
 or that Kaba is a stranger 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.629
 such as bacteria 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:45.990
 the secret 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.830
 what stay 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.879
 St 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:50.490
 60 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.490
 but it always means to stand 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.090
 body-own elements 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.490
 available 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.210
 I do not understand that either 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.039
 worldwide 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.430
 is determined 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.669
 so will 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.669
 so far with publication please send one 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.550
 he is taking care of 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.110
 the researchers work very hard on it 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.439
 getting better understood 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.099
 Waltraud 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.180
 really all 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.639
 that was the next issue of Biotechnologie TV again 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.889
 appears on April 20 in many thanks for watching me time to go
