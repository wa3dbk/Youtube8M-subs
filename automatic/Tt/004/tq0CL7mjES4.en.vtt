00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 google scar manila another startup under 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.319
 the name of the quest and she is known for 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.150
 your word lens app 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.730
 let's check how good it is 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.719
 is working and is she still friends with 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.929
 google translate 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.320
 this has not yet sat down and my android 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.750
 the table is 5 items one of them as 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 nor strangely this box from nexus 5 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.800
 the word white on blue is written on it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.800
 google 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.410
 but programs translates as goody for 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 interest I broke google translate and you 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.320
 really google translates as 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.440
 google 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.860
 Well, certainly not the Goody and only in Russian 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.809
 option is google and in english needles 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.280
 quite a challenge for our 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.789
 programs let's move on to the next one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.579
 the subject of this is a sprayer for plants 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.760
 can i understand that this is a sprayer 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.340
 just pointing the phone at the words yes 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 really see the words sprayer 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.559
 but I see a lot of other incomprehensible hit 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.680
 pressure is just right 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.080
 roughly I understand the meaning and isn't it 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.299
 whether developers wanted to achieve this 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 if you happen to be impatient with someone 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.159
 share the result then the application 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 supports this possibility 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.880
 next is the mortal cartridge Siberian 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.140
 kombat 3 probably everyone remembers what it is 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.210
 deadly battle 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.750
 but I see the brazier death code 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 deadly tommy 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.790
 obviously something related to death 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.520
 principle to expose the deadly 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.549
 skim cat skim code and 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.180
 sorry did not work but anyway 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 I understood that the game is connected with death and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.610
 The box shows that this is probably a fighting game 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.780
 here the application has managed no matter how 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.740
 strangely I would like something more 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.720
 here I still have a racket lying around 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.650
 table tennis maybe he 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.180
 something about her say well cup 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.750
 table tennis 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.229
 a cup of borscht that cup so here I 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.660
 approximate sense really understand it 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.380
 a clear recommended print is recommended 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.060
 text for example on pointers or menu 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.560
 damn so i have to translate 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.290
 road signs only 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.870
 it is a pity though the cooperation took place but 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.519
 the program is far from perfect 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.410
 translates into only banal words so 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.570
 what is useful on can only extreme 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.390
 situations don't get upset at 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.160
 example ok google we already see that he 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.110
 appeared in Russian so i 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.480
 I think this program will also improve soon 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.769
 so all kind of subscribe to 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.769
