we hoped for when we talked about having
a<00:01:06.150> place<00:01:06.390> where<00:01:07.140> children<00:01:07.170> could<00:01:07.710> understand

world red cedar represents something

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.250 
world red cedar represents something
that<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.220> fairly<00:01:20.520> unique<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.600> in

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
that I think is fairly unique if not in

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.320 
that I think is fairly unique if not in
the<00:01:22.590> state<00:01:22.800> of<00:01:22.920> Michigan<00:01:23.370> probably<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the state of Michigan probably in the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.870 
the state of Michigan probably in the
entire<00:01:24.450> country<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:25.980> a<00:01:26.130> small<00:01:26.550> place<00:01:26.760> but

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
entire country this is a small place but

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.720 
entire country this is a small place but
their<00:01:27.330> outlook<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> world<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.800> just<00:01:29.580> so

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
their outlook on the world is just so

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.760 
their outlook on the world is just so
much<00:01:29.880> larger<00:01:30.480> just<00:01:31.020> from<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.620> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
much larger just from that kind of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.080 
much larger just from that kind of
exchange<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.550> they<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.910> it's<00:01:35.090> somewhat

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
exchange that they have it's somewhat

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.870 
exchange that they have it's somewhat
beyond<00:01:36.450> diversity<00:01:37.010> something<00:01:38.010> was<00:01:38.250> happening

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
beyond diversity something was happening

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.000

incredible it has made made that outlook

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.530 
incredible it has made made that outlook
something<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.580> is<00:01:44.700> an<00:01:44.820> important<00:01:45.300> part<00:01:45.480> of
