00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
optimal yeah so at both sides but hey

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.730 
optimal yeah so at both sides but hey
yeah<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.310> might<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.780> might<00:02:03.990> all<00:02:04.500> you

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
yeah it might be a you might all you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.260
