00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.420
 night already in a few minutes a show 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.829
 full I imagine but all your 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.170
 successes what is the audience going to see 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.490
 of course we are the idea of ​​touching our 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.319
 songs from the first album until 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.450
 last not so we are fans of 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.950
 other artists and it 's amazing how 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.719
 they play those first songs too 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.759
 we are the same obviously until 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:46.960
 our last site that was with the face 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.960
 up this time 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.200
 with our first record composer of 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.610
 many of the members who know about 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.170
 us and it is for me the best 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.150
 guitarist has been a teacher for 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.970
 three so the truth let's also the 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.670
 friends of fan families a very show 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.200
 dynamic from dancing to crying 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.150
 talk about your third auditorium with 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.850
 exhausted localities is without place to 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.590
 doubt to remember that you guys without 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.510
 fear of making mistakes and for today 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.900
 grouping most important pop music 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.400
 in our country not yes of course course 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.600
 I think the audience that listens to me 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.610
 will also agree the 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.890
 drivers to our program I lived this 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.100
 it's a responsibility what it means 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.790
 Being such an important group 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.790
 national level 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.220
 and thank you very much but I do not know if we are 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.630
 the most important I say obviously 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.370
 always has always been the throw and 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.580
 it's always part of the dream to get the most 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.110
 high is not possible when you're there the 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.870
 truth is that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.580
 it feels a huge satisfaction and the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.650
 responsibility I think it falls well 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.570
 as I see it mainly in 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.460
 keep good not only keep but go 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.650
 increasingly raising the standard of 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.950
 quality of what we offer this is not 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.250
 I feel that we can not afford to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.500
 to stay stuck in some position 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.310
 but to continue surpassing us 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.740
 constantly disk with disk 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.950
 production with production and presentation 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.990
 with presentation is not the truth is 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.020
 yes yes it is something we miss 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.880
 very much desire this make us 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.690
 comments of all kinds but I think that 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.830
 in the end what is really reflected is 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.200
 in full concerts in high places in 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.450
 the radio in good sales throughout the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.760
 thing then it 's nothing to answer 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.970
 specifically your question what is the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.770
 responsibility yes yes it is great no no 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.900
 you can disappoint the audience but about 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.000
 everything you can not disappoint yourself 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.250
 you do not have to keep growing and you 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.090
 they set very high goals because out there 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.690
 someone 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.400
 who are ready to go to korea as 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.019
 is this so Koreans are going to sing 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.319
 the songs of reik to see explain me a 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.209
 little bit good is a song but that 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.269
 we are going to sing to them that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.970
 yes the truth is an experiment that 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.830
 we are doing comes a Korean band 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.500
 to here and we to an exchange is 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.390
 as a fair exchange that does not and I think 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.220
 that there are several things that several 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.410
 similarities between the Korean public and 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.970
 the Mexican public and I think that's what 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.669
 what are we trying, are not we going 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.169
 to see if it works if it works this is a 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.860
 despite the language barrier 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:26.169
 that many times we have checked with 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.360
 for example for example as in the case 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.050
 I believe in you that we recorded it in several 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.810
 Languages 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.169
 and you realize that there is an interest and there 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.520
 there is something something something worthwhile 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.660
 explore not and that's what we're 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.910
 doing we are always trying to 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.770
 reach the most places of 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.750
 reach as many hearts 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.930
 and this and this is our new our 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.340
 last experiment hear that I 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.449
 I am in a privileged place because 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.060
 is really these three boys 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.270
 but there is also a select group 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.160
 of fans who are with you for 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.840
 while during the trial he will ask 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.900
 My cameraman companion to Miguel Farfán 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.030

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.389

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.430

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.770

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.310

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.460

 a capella couples a pigeonhole to see 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.870

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.470
