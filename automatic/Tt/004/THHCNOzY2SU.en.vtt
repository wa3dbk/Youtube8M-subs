issues with my edges being thin um and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
issues with my edges being thin um and
now<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:26.549> natural<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:29.780> Lucy

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.350 

my<00:01:34.619> edges<00:01:35.299> over<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:37.159> they're<00:01:38.159> they're<00:01:39.030> just

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
my edges over here they're they're just

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.380 
my edges over here they're they're just
really<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:40.110> thin<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:43.970> it's<00:01:44.970> kind<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
really really thin and I it's kind of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:54.940 
really really thin and I it's kind of
like<00:01:50.149> as<00:01:51.860> if<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.039> can<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.670> thin<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
like as if you can see it's thin and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.130 
like as if you can see it's thin and
it's<00:01:55.950> kind<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> hereditary<00:01:57.119> thing<00:01:57.689> in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
it's kind of like a hereditary thing in

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.429 
it's kind of like a hereditary thing in
my<00:01:58.289> family<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:59.570> tend<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.720> have<00:02:00.929> like<00:02:01.229> these

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
my family we tend to have like these

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.149 
my family we tend to have like these
issues<00:02:02.009> with<00:02:02.220> our<00:02:02.369> edges<00:02:03.979> throughout<00:02:04.979> my

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
issues with our edges throughout my

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.100 
issues with our edges throughout my
family<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.149> thought<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.539> it<00:02:06.659> would<00:02:06.780> end

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
family and I thought that it would end

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.880 
family and I thought that it would end
when<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> went<00:02:08.220> natural<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.209> still<00:02:09.539> there

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
when I went natural but it's still there

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.160 
when I went natural but it's still there
so<00:02:10.890> I'm<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.360> doing<00:02:12.540> some<00:02:12.900> research

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so I'm going to be doing some research

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.330 
so I'm going to be doing some research
on<00:02:14.900> how<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:17.090> grow<00:02:18.090> out<00:02:18.299> your<00:02:18.330> edges<00:02:19.110> because<00:02:19.680> my

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
on how to grow out your edges because my

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.180 
on how to grow out your edges because my
arches<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.620> seems<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:22.769> they're<00:02:23.010> getting

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
arches it seems that they're getting

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.580 
arches it seems that they're getting
thin<00:02:23.810> once<00:02:24.810> again<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:26.569> I<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.170> don't<00:02:28.380> know

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
thin once again and I just I don't know

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.940 
thin once again and I just I don't know
why<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.420> when<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> was<00:02:31.049> relaxed<00:02:31.799> I

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
why but I know that when I was relaxed I

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
why but I know that when I was relaxed I
used<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.489> bad<00:02:33.239> edges<00:02:33.989> like<00:02:34.830> this<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.930> is

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
used to have bad edges like this this is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.699 
used to have bad edges like this this is
okay<00:02:37.640> compared<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:39.390> don't<00:02:40.290> know<00:02:40.380> like<00:02:40.560> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
okay compared to I don't know like the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.610 
okay compared to I don't know like the
way<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:41.010> was<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.730> was<00:02:41.910> worse<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:43.230> wasn't

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
way it was it was worse and it wasn't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.319 
way it was it was worse and it wasn't
just<00:02:43.739> my<00:02:43.950> edges<00:02:44.310> over<00:02:44.549> here<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.030> was<00:02:45.180> my

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
just my edges over here but it was my

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.020 
just my edges over here but it was my
name<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.959> my<00:02:45.989> nape<00:02:46.920> has<00:02:47.190> gotten<00:02:47.519> a<00:02:47.640> lot<00:02:47.820> better
