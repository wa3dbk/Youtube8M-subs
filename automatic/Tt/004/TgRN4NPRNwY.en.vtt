00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 so , ghost in the empress becomes warm 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.200
 welcome to the next last test www 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.510
 odww by video still the second 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.730
 Part of the black fans foundry with boss 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.740
 1 still with boss a bit 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.949
 the other way round the comments on beautiful 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.020
 thing with ansgar and franz yes that are 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.789
 two such aborted fish frog 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.740
 Brothers who share accordingly on the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 life the life ball and yes the boss fight 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.300
 do you find such as yes what are you called 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.099
 the conveyor belt instead of just that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.449
 production line system beautiful 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.529
 historically important but that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.450
 We are not interested in anything 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.700
 The boss is interested in the two 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.370
 separated from each other speaks normally 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.020
 Each boss has a tank that will perform well 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.059
 activate certain skills 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.340
 when the fill up the bosses jump 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 from time to time very well back and forth there 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 cause harm, say one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.520
 maybe it should be a bit too 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.379
 distribute to minimize the whole and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.539
 of course the treadmills have something to it 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 to do so is also a very very 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.620
 movement intense fight and that is 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.789
 the eternal at it the treadmills become 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.399
 activates one of the bosses jumps up 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.040
 activates the production line system correctly 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.090
 speak the goods must be promoted yes 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.710
 and that's actually interesting 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.299
 to the boss fight because you have to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.280
 change conveyor belts while you just 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.200
 is aborted to the certain things 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 to the German just here spawn 2 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.680
 we have with these plates once for 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 and once such plates from 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 I fall down personally 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.360
 not so easy was that here goes 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.040
 yes still if you then in the direction 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.509
 even can watch then it is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.549
 everything not so problematic only 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.310
 that is not there on it speak the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.390
 outermost yes the outermost bender the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.650
 You can not use it at all from the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.390
 assembly line down to come ie 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.740
 then you have to be careful 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.420
 here too, the plates overlap 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 some of these ribbons can be spoken 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.750
 also if two come now and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.100
 you put them in the middle of it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.270
 you still get hurt because 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.470
 not just on the production line 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.350
 are just a bit too 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 do not strip on this line 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.009
 why i have one of the brothers in the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.860
 focus the habs degree seen when the in 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.340
 have reached certain south pole then 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.780
 looks like he at least one 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.009
 roar expels what silenced us 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.420
 brings and that is of course not so 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.920
 nice that I tried the same 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.159
 the good to focus you have seen 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.749
 There are also 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.130
 After train warning so then that comes 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.539
 whole again to a standstill there 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.069
 we see just the jump on us are 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.879
 match red arrow to make sure 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.310
 can remove 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.780
 and yes as long as this is not flowing yet 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.459
 Activation is actually a fight 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.900
 Here also sits on the groups living 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.370
 at least highlight technically very 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.110
 relaxed is talking to the chambers here 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.000
 and I say it very much shots 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.620
 wonderful play at least in 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.330
 this phase which is very interesting 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.590
 if I read it correctly 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.720
 that the brothers make their anger automatic 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.950
 but above all, it increases 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.510
 when they suffer harm 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.069
 speaks that one causes both damage 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.079
 Maybe this is not so smart here 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.489
 that are the printing plates you see that 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.860
 it's pretty neat you get 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.879
 also hurt if you because we on this 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.890
 straps just not on the production line 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.150
 stands and there are two down that is 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.590
 quite interesting the sharks have 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.690
 The signs of the times we recognized 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.860
 does the Cure and such 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.209
 things so that's pretty nice 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.230
 neat what happened here we have 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.750
 you see, I have one or two 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.579
 others like it unnecessarily 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.459
 they are also very random here 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.720
 that it is relatively neat 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.890
 even the group does not quite have that 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.170
 coped so well 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.489
 so the dinger they are already angry 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.959
 are already where she wants to be at this 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.569
 Just remember that 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.510
 Eleven he is one to introduce you to and 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.940
 to unite together was nice 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.920
 the good thing is that these live during 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.299
 this question had at least in 11er 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.889
 do not come together 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.049
 I was so scared that if he did 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.639
 hebel third presses both comes 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.790
 the plates speak on the 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.139
 conveyor belts run and these too 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.430
 I personally had a lot of stampings 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.359
 very much afraid of you see that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.190
 has one or the other already 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.690
 torn and as I said in the ods at 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.980
 do not heal so we are quite simple with 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.810
 the cooler and the complete group 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.880
 Once again come up here 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.410
 You have to go to the side of the page 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.209
 is like you sometimes see in the movie 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.980
 if such a plane behind the country the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.359
 just go over to the side instead 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.340
 to achieve a dramatic effect 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.900
 you actually make it so panic 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.340
 when plane flies through and lands 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.410
 would try to run away from it 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.480
 Do not go to the side before you have 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.400
 so say a dear wheel loader 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.930
 Busy with the people 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.090
 and if they know this to run 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.069
 who then go the post of 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.900
 post came the post fight the boss fight 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.730
 it's easy and then 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.739
 fling as well as to do the porsche 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.180
 so speeding up for more bosses 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.860
 Skills he did not speak that is 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.209
 a nice change between not 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.650
 completely relaxed than the 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.060
 relaxation phase after these 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.500
 printing plates have the healer enough to 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.370
 Do the group again gradually 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.560
 lighten 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.060
 but we have stress phases and 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.010
 I would like to relax at this 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.479
 almost want to call bus almost 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.900
 call that nice too 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.150
 want 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.220
 and if you are so humble 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.540
 I can keep an eye on these orks 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.510
 do not know how to handle the mutant 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.729
 no idea 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.139
 then that works then we can do that 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.639
 I really want to be here 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.289
 really think it's nice to go to 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.490
 denotes relaxation and stress phases 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.900
 and then this boss fight goes very well 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.190
 very nice to play down I am pleased 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.270
 me whenever I can say it there 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.620
 we are already at the end of the camp 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.210
 and that was also in first try thing 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.699
 it is not above that must not that 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.289
 every lying is accused and java 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.520
 pretty interesting nice new mechanics 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.690
 so this one has tapes that one yes 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.850
 does not even seem to know this 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.260
 extension very much in progress 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.030
 to be interested in motor matters 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.430
 I remember scream track depot where 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.200
 we fight on that and similar and 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.789
 yes beautiful things can also this 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.500
 complete blackfield feeling arise 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.789
 and cool thing I like the very good 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.320
 bosskampf let me know how 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.520
 you the boss fight pleases you 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.680
 you or are you already afraid now 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.950
 before that as well as with your rudolf 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.180
 berger looks on the liveservern and 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.289
 if I forgot something she writes 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.550
 necessarily in the comments that can 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.960
 happen and also correct me if 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.880
 which was wrong I thank you for 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.500
 see if you have her on the lfa 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.849
 or on the rater looks up 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.310
 very beautiful now and luckily 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.750
 for the most part final too, though 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.099
 we strangely sometimes times 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.740
 did not get any harm 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.120
 but yes that everything will still 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.440
 pending, everything will settle down 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.940
 we we still have time until release 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.470
 See you in the next video if you are 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.160
 I want to say goodbye until then 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.160
 beautiful 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.720
 peppino no leaf in the mouth 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.939
 Applicant gives
