00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.020
 new video of max usd i want you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.740
 in this video, the lte 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.370
 function of samsung galaxy s 4 show 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.599
 i have the white samsung galaxy s 4 and 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 a vodafone card inserted 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.640
 spark so vodafone lte network on 800 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.529
 megahertz and now have my speedtest 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.789
 app launched so that we can 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.640
 can measure speed 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 the reception is about two bars from 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.580
 five bars so not very good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.250
 but not too bad 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:39.270
 yes and then i just do my test 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:43.020
 out here and you see that's straight 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.579
 about 25 megabits in download and 16 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.129
 megabit in the upload do it all 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:55.410
 just again and a little bit now 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.930
 higher up to 27 megabits and again 16 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.690
 megabit in the upload so you see 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.039
 Speeds are already very good 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.159
 but of course far from 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.439
 the maximum possible 100 we 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.920
 can get a maximum of 100 megabits 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.229
 possible 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.729
 and of course that always comes on the net 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.080
 And of course, the workload on the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.450
 not all servers are server too 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
 really so fast 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.689
 Now just want to take a quick look 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.439
 compare with a umts net to it 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.580
 Let's go the setting and switch 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.610
 then we'll do the lte network 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:36.600
 here then in which we the nets mode on 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:40.200
 only wcdma exhibit so then we wait 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.070
 In a nutshell he has got himself involved 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.890
 takes a little now it's done and 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.479
 then we start the speed test as 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 i stand up a hair for hsdpa 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.270
 or h + for hspa plus 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.909
 vodafone has hspa + that it is up to 21 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.299
 megabit fast 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.189
 theoretically, the galaxy s 4 can also be gc 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.020
 hspa + that is then in the telecom network 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.180
 mainly expanded and partly 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.310
 only in vodafone last are up to 42 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.989
 Megabit and you see here where in the test 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.700
 are also very good data rates 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.530
 actually possible 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.989
 with the download and upload it is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:26.099
 Of course, as always, a little less 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:27.959
 but here too 11 about 1.1 mbit in 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.760
 upload and that's probably pretty 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.010
 Well 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.170
 yes so much for speed test on the samsung 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.250
 galaxy s 4 in the network of vodafone 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.250
 Thanks for seeing
