important<00:04:29.300> to<00:04:29.330> note<00:04:29.510> that<00:04:29.540> later<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:30.230> year

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
important to note that later this year

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.320 
important to note that later this year
this<00:04:30.650> car<00:04:30.950> is<00:04:31.220> going<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.520> be<00:04:31.640> available<00:04:31.880> with

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
this car is going to be available with

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.050 
this car is going to be available with
the<00:04:32.360> I<00:04:32.690> loop<00:04:33.650> I<00:04:33.950> believe<00:04:34.250> it's<00:04:34.400> called<00:04:34.550> system

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
the I loop I believe it's called system

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.180 
the I loop I believe it's called system
which<00:04:35.240> basically<00:04:35.690> it's<00:04:36.020> not<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.200> hybrid<00:04:36.530> system

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
which basically it's not a hybrid system

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.240 
which basically it's not a hybrid system
but<00:04:37.910> Mazdas<00:04:38.900> doing<00:04:39.140> a<00:04:39.200> lot<00:04:39.350> more<00:04:39.380> work<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:39.770> that

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
but Mazdas doing a lot more work so that

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.060 
but Mazdas doing a lot more work so that
a<00:04:40.550> lot<00:04:40.850> of<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.060> regeneration<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:42.080> battery

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
a lot of the regeneration of battery

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.310 
a lot of the regeneration of battery
power<00:04:43.400> for<00:04:43.790> just<00:04:44.210> like<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.540> accessories<00:04:45.169> of

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
power for just like the accessories of

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.260 
power for just like the accessories of
the<00:04:45.380> car<00:04:45.620> are<00:04:46.340> going<00:04:46.400> to<00:04:46.580> be<00:04:46.640> driven<00:04:46.880> during

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
the car are going to be driven during

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.940 
the car are going to be driven during
braking<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.050> it's<00:04:48.169> one<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.470> regenerative

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
braking so it's one of the regenerative

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.080 
braking so it's one of the regenerative
braking<00:04:49.669> systems<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:51.470> have<00:04:51.650> less<00:04:52.090> parasitic

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
braking systems to have less parasitic
