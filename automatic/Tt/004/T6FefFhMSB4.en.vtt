help okay so didja cortex project
started<00:00:20.149> about<00:00:20.360> a<00:00:20.570> year<00:00:20.660> ago<00:00:20.869> as<00:00:21.320> kind<00:00:22.099> of<00:00:22.160> a

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
started about a year ago as kind of a

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.760 
started about a year ago as kind of a
hobby<00:00:22.489> project<00:00:23.000> of<00:00:23.119> mine<00:00:23.329> I<00:00:24.050> got<00:00:24.529> interested

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
hobby project of mine I got interested

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.069 
hobby project of mine I got interested
in<00:00:25.099> to<00:00:25.279> spiking<00:00:25.640> neural<00:00:25.939> networks<00:00:26.360> which<00:00:26.869> are

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
in to spiking neural networks which are

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.909 
in to spiking neural networks which are
a<00:00:27.890> very<00:00:28.550> precise<00:00:29.090> way<00:00:29.300> to<00:00:29.360> model<00:00:29.930> real<00:00:30.500> neurons

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
a very precise way to model real neurons

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.479 
a very precise way to model real neurons
so<00:00:31.520> unlike<00:00:32.029> the<00:00:32.210> old<00:00:32.239> neural<00:00:32.840> networks<00:00:33.200> like

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
so unlike the old neural networks like

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.980 
so unlike the old neural networks like
perceptrons<00:00:34.489> these<00:00:35.120> things<00:00:35.360> also<00:00:35.570> modeled

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
perceptrons these things also modeled

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.310 
perceptrons these things also modeled
time<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.330> thanks<00:00:38.330> to<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:38.630> they're<00:00:38.900> actually

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
time and thanks to that they're actually

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.800 
time and thanks to that they're actually
able<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.680> emulate<00:00:40.040> real<00:00:40.760> behavior<00:00:41.240> of<00:00:41.480> human

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
able to emulate real behavior of human

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.130 
able to emulate real behavior of human
neural<00:00:42.140> cells<00:00:42.410> which<00:00:42.740> is<00:00:42.890> spikes<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:44.990> is

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
neural cells which is spikes and this is

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.980 
neural cells which is spikes and this is
just<00:00:45.560> got<00:00:45.740> me<00:00:45.860> interested<00:00:46.040> and<00:00:46.600> because<00:00:47.600> I<00:00:47.810> was

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
just got me interested and because I was

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.110 
just got me interested and because I was
doing<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.260> lot<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.410> coding<00:00:48.740> in<00:00:48.980> my<00:00:49.070> past<00:00:49.370> like

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
doing a lot of coding in my past like

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120 
doing a lot of coding in my past like
audio<00:00:50.450> coding<00:00:50.720> and<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:51.260> on<00:00:51.470> and<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.950> like

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
audio coding and so on and I like

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.550 
audio coding and so on and I like
optimizing<00:00:52.850> things<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:54.170> the<00:00:54.410> neural

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
optimizing things and in the neural

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.500 
optimizing things and in the neural
networks<00:00:55.010> there<00:00:55.640> is<00:00:55.790> quite<00:00:56.000> a<00:00:56.030> lot<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.300> things

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
networks there is quite a lot of things

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.479 
networks there is quite a lot of things
you<00:00:56.660> can<00:00:56.810> do<00:00:56.930> to<00:00:56.960> make<00:00:57.320> them<00:00:57.500> faster<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.190> a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
you can do to make them faster and a

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.610 
you can do to make them faster and a
kind<00:00:59.150> of<00:00:59.270> a<00:00:59.390> sad<00:00:59.570> state<00:00:59.810> of<00:00:59.840> today's<00:01:00.200> like<00:01:00.470> you

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
kind of a sad state of today's like you

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.889 
kind of a sad state of today's like you
can't<00:01:00.829> really<00:01:01.070> simulate<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.579> human<00:01:01.760> or<00:01:02.360> animal

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
can't really simulate a human or animal

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.000 
can't really simulate a human or animal
brain<00:01:03.380> because<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:04.610> big<00:01:05.149> and<00:01:05.830> CPUs<00:01:06.830> of

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
brain because it's so big and CPUs of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.980 
brain because it's so big and CPUs of
today<00:01:07.280> they're<00:01:07.670> just<00:01:07.700> not<00:01:08.060> up<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.479> job<00:01:08.510> so

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
today they're just not up to the job so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.450 
today they're just not up to the job so
I<00:01:09.050> was<00:01:09.170> like<00:01:09.260> okay<00:01:09.320> let's<00:01:09.710> see<00:01:09.920> how<00:01:10.130> much<00:01:10.310> you

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
I was like okay let's see how much you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.310 
I was like okay let's see how much you
can<00:01:10.580> speed<00:01:10.850> these<00:01:10.970> things<00:01:11.210> up<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:11.690> this<00:01:12.140> how

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
can speed these things up and this how

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.680 
can speed these things up and this how
the<00:01:12.380> duty<00:01:12.860> cordic<00:01:13.190> started<00:01:13.580> okay<00:01:14.060> okay<00:01:14.360> and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
the duty cordic started okay okay and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.630 
the duty cordic started okay okay and
you<00:01:14.810> were<00:01:14.900> telling<00:01:15.170> me<00:01:15.200> earlier<00:01:15.260> that<00:01:15.650> when

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
you were telling me earlier that when

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.460 
you were telling me earlier that when
you<00:01:16.760> first<00:01:17.000> thought<00:01:17.150> about<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.540> GPU<00:01:18.229> you

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
you first thought about this GPU you

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.960 
you first thought about this GPU you
were<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> little<00:01:18.710> dubious<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.400> didn't<00:01:19.700> you

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
were a little dubious you didn't you

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.640 
were a little dubious you didn't you
didn't<00:01:20.270> think<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:20.479> was<00:01:20.750> gonna<00:01:20.900> fly<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:21.440> just

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
didn't think that was gonna fly it just

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.190 
didn't think that was gonna fly it just
was<00:01:21.830> because<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:22.670> notice<00:01:23.600> like<00:01:23.750> many<00:01:23.960> times

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
was because I notice like many times

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.560 
was because I notice like many times
people<00:01:24.409> compare<00:01:25.040> GPU<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:25.909> CPU<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.299> they<00:01:26.510> were

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
people compare GPU and CPU is they were

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.930 
people compare GPU and CPU is they were
using<00:01:26.810> not<00:01:27.320> so<00:01:27.440> often<00:01:27.770> my<00:01:27.799> cpu<00:01:28.280> code<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:28.760> the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
using not so often my cpu code so the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.550 
using not so often my cpu code so the
figures<00:01:29.240> were<00:01:29.390> like<00:01:29.600> okay<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:30.229> really

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
figures were like okay is this really

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.399 
figures were like okay is this really
possible<00:01:30.670> but<00:01:31.670> then<00:01:31.790> in<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.540> course<00:01:33.049> of<00:01:33.350> a

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
possible but then in the course of a

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.740 
possible but then in the course of a
couple<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:33.799> months<00:01:34.190> i<00:01:34.390> completely<00:01:35.390> change<00:01:35.659> i

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
couple of months i completely change i

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.660 
couple of months i completely change i
became<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.140> believer<00:01:36.500> in<00:01:36.830> game<00:01:37.250> because<00:01:37.460> it's

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
became a believer in game because it's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.789 
became a believer in game because it's
uh<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.390> really<00:01:38.450> really<00:01:39.110> managed<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.530> speed

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
uh it really really managed to speed

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.770 
uh it really really managed to speed
things<00:01:39.950> up<00:01:40.159> with<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.520> with<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.700> CUDA<00:01:41.060> ok<00:01:41.630> and

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
things up with it with the CUDA ok and

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.960 
things up with it with the CUDA ok and
pretty<00:01:42.440> amazingly<00:01:42.830> so<00:01:43.070> considering<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.729> fact

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
pretty amazingly so considering the fact

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.780 
pretty amazingly so considering the fact
that<00:01:44.060> i<00:01:44.360> spent<00:01:44.780> about<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.350> year<00:01:45.439> optimizing<00:01:46.430> cpu

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
that i spent about a year optimizing cpu

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.390 
that i spent about a year optimizing cpu
code<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.380> that's<00:01:48.380> like<00:01:48.740> few<00:01:48.950> months<00:01:49.159> ago<00:01:49.250> I

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
code and that's like few months ago I

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.170 
code and that's like few months ago I
talked<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.150> Anna<00:01:50.390> who<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.560> good<00:01:52.340> expert<00:01:52.820> here

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
talked to Anna who is a good expert here

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.899 
talked to Anna who is a good expert here
and<00:01:53.330> she<00:01:54.140> told<00:01:54.350> me<00:01:54.409> well<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.650> know<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:55.430> what

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
and she told me well you know this what

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.870 
and she told me well you know this what
you're<00:01:56.090> doing<00:01:56.390> is<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:56.810> parallel<00:01:57.320> that<00:01:57.950> GPUs

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
you're doing is so parallel that GPUs

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.640 
you're doing is so parallel that GPUs
and<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.210> CUDA<00:01:59.509> are<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.930> right<00:02:00.110> thing<00:02:00.380> for

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
and the CUDA are the right thing for

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.020 
and the CUDA are the right thing for
this<00:02:00.740> job<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.340> was<00:02:01.460> like<00:02:01.610> okay

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
this job and I was like okay

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.480 
this job and I was like okay
you<00:02:02.240> know<00:02:02.360> let's<00:02:02.570> give<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:02.900> try<00:02:03.049> and<00:02:03.490> even

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
you know let's give it a try and even

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.060 
you know let's give it a try and even
after<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:05.150> few<00:02:05.299> months<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:06.229> already<00:02:06.560> many

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
after a few months it's already many

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.980 
after a few months it's already many
times<00:02:07.340> faster<00:02:07.729> than<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.940> heavily<00:02:08.360> optimized<00:02:08.720> CP

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
times faster than a heavily optimized CP

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.809 
times faster than a heavily optimized CP
ago<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.170> was<00:02:09.319> like<00:02:09.500> whoa<00:02:09.619> it's<00:02:10.160> cheaper<00:02:10.670> it's

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
ago I was like whoa it's cheaper it's

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.570 
ago I was like whoa it's cheaper it's
many<00:02:11.450> times<00:02:11.510> faster<00:02:12.110> well<00:02:12.830> this<00:02:13.069> really<00:02:13.220> works

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
many times faster well this really works

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.730 
many times faster well this really works
it's<00:02:13.880> not<00:02:14.030> an<00:02:14.150> advertisement<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.110> became<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
it's not an advertisement so I became a

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.460 
it's not an advertisement so I became a
believer<00:02:16.010> okay<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:17.090> can<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:17.540> show<00:02:17.750> me<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.050> how

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
believer okay so can you show me the how

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.190 
believer okay so can you show me the how
it<00:02:18.800> works<00:02:18.950> or<00:02:19.100> just<00:02:19.880> give<00:02:20.030> me<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.120> dumb<00:02:20.720> oh<00:02:20.870> so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
it works or just give me a dumb oh so

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140 
it works or just give me a dumb oh so
this<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:21.680> a<00:02:21.709> visualization<00:02:22.190> so<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.790> project

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
this is a visualization so the project

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.479 
this is a visualization so the project
also<00:02:23.270> has<00:02:23.569> an<00:02:23.780> OpenGL<00:02:24.350> render<00:02:24.770> yeah<00:02:25.130> which<00:02:25.310> is

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
also has an OpenGL render yeah which is

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.309 
also has an OpenGL render yeah which is
kind<00:02:25.940> of<00:02:26.000> friend<00:02:26.270> during<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.569> activity<00:02:27.080> of

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
kind of friend during the activity of

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.170 
kind of friend during the activity of
the<00:02:27.560> network<00:02:27.890> yeah<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.430> what<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.730> see<00:02:28.910> here<00:02:28.940> is

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
the network yeah so what you see here is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.610 
the network yeah so what you see here is
about<00:02:29.890> 16.7<00:02:30.890> million<00:02:31.069> neurons<00:02:31.459> with<00:02:32.270> about

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
about 16.7 million neurons with about

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.370 
about 16.7 million neurons with about
3.5<00:02:33.620> billion<00:02:33.950> synapses<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.910> this<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.019> running

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
3.5 billion synapses and this is running

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.870 
3.5 billion synapses and this is running
this<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.769> old<00:02:36.920> version<00:02:37.220> which<00:02:37.519> is<00:02:37.550> running

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
this is the old version which is running

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.360 
this is the old version which is running
on<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:38.030> cpu<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:39.290> running<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.769> about<00:02:39.860> one

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
on a cpu and it's running in about one

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.490 
on a cpu and it's running in about one
thousandth<00:02:41.030> of<00:02:41.120> real<00:02:41.450> time<00:02:41.690> meaning<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.260> needs

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
thousandth of real time meaning it needs

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.470 
thousandth of real time meaning it needs
one<00:02:42.950> thousand<00:02:43.310> seconds<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:44.030> simulate<00:02:44.450> a

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
one thousand seconds to simulate a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.509 
one thousand seconds to simulate a
second<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.260> simulation<00:02:45.800> okay<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.400> get

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
second of a simulation okay so to get

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.490 
second of a simulation okay so to get
the<00:02:46.700> 30<00:02:46.940> frames<00:02:47.239> of<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.600> movie<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.230> took<00:02:48.470> a

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
the 30 frames of this movie that took a

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.160 
the 30 frames of this movie that took a
long<00:02:48.739> time<00:02:48.800> took<00:02:49.459> a<00:02:49.700> long<00:02:49.970> time<00:02:50.000> lon<00:02:50.540> exactly

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
long time took a long time lon exactly

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.809 
long time took a long time lon exactly
but<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:51.800> gorgeous<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.459> very<00:02:52.519> pretty

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
but it is it's gorgeous it's very pretty

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
cute okay so so enter the GPU why don't

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.220 
cute okay so so enter the GPU why don't
we<00:02:55.550> switch<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.790> Anna<00:02:56.239> here<00:02:56.600> cuz<00:02:56.840> i<00:02:56.930> wanna<00:02:57.140> i

so and I understand you were an early

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.580 
so and I understand you were an early
adopter<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.790> GPUs<00:03:02.360> for<00:03:02.690> computing<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.440> that

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
adopter of GPUs for computing is that

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.979 
adopter of GPUs for computing is that
correct<00:03:03.860> yeah<00:03:04.400> yeah<00:03:04.760> actually<00:03:05.330> I'm<00:03:05.690> totally

clue<00:03:08.959> diversion<00:03:09.470> was<00:03:09.650> out<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.910> started

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
clue diversion was out it started

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.319 
clue diversion was out it started
related<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> my<00:03:13.130> PhD<00:03:13.610> research<00:03:13.670> and

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
related to my PhD research and

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.030 
related to my PhD research and
compression<00:03:14.870> algorithms<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.799> was<00:03:15.890> like

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
compression algorithms and that was like

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.460 
compression algorithms and that was like
wow<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.730> do<00:03:16.880> amazing<00:03:17.120> things<00:03:17.450> with<00:03:17.959> the

wow you can do amazing things with the
really<00:03:18.799> empowers<00:03:19.190> people<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.670> do<00:03:20.660> beautiful

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
really empowers people to do beautiful

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.949 
really empowers people to do beautiful
beautiful<00:03:22.010> stuff<00:03:22.340> and<00:03:22.610> that's<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.540> reason

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
beautiful stuff and that's the reason

beautiful stuff and that's the reason
actually<00:03:24.290> how<00:03:24.799> I<00:03:24.829> joined<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.400> island<00:03:25.910> on<00:03:26.000> this

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
actually how I joined the island on this

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.420 
actually how I joined the island on this
project<00:03:26.420> he<00:03:27.350> showed<00:03:27.560> me<00:03:27.590> this<00:03:27.890> visualization

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
project he showed me this visualization

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.150 
project he showed me this visualization
and<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:29.180> was<00:03:29.299> wow<00:03:29.480> this<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.170> beautiful<00:03:30.500> so

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
and that was wow this is so beautiful so

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.039 
and that was wow this is so beautiful so
beautiful<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.850> they<00:03:32.150> couldn't<00:03:32.480> believe<00:03:32.570> that

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
beautiful and they couldn't believe that

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.050 
beautiful and they couldn't believe that
the<00:03:33.350> whole<00:03:33.560> thing<00:03:33.799> is<00:03:33.950> running<00:03:34.160> going<00:03:34.489> to<00:03:34.579> CPU

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
the whole thing is running going to CPU

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.960 
the whole thing is running going to CPU
ok<00:03:35.900> after<00:03:36.079> a<00:03:36.260> little<00:03:36.739> bit<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.430> chat<00:03:37.730> you

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
ok after a little bit of a chat you

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.090 
ok after a little bit of a chat you
figured<00:03:38.299> out<00:03:38.450> it's<00:03:38.750> not<00:03:38.959> really<00:03:39.350> just<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.890> cpu

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
figured out it's not really just the cpu

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.009 
figured out it's not really just the cpu
it<00:03:40.519> was<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:41.230> multiprocessor<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:44.090> 16<00:03:44.750> cores

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
it was a multiprocessor so the 16 cores

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.880 
it was a multiprocessor so the 16 cores
Ian<00:03:45.410> and<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.299> has<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.230> much<00:03:48.440> parallelism

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
Ian and but it has so much parallelism

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.009 
Ian and but it has so much parallelism
so<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:49.340> thought<00:03:49.579> wow<00:03:49.940> this<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:50.720> just<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
so I thought wow this is just the

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.729 
so I thought wow this is just the
perfect<00:03:51.170> thing<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.590> run<00:03:52.130> on<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.400> GPU<00:03:52.850> and<00:03:53.739> we

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
perfect thing to run on a GPU and we

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.949 
perfect thing to run on a GPU and we
started<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.250> couple<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.609> months<00:03:55.910> ago<00:03:56.030> just

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
started a couple of months ago just

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.160 
started a couple of months ago just
porting<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.670> highly<00:03:59.090> optimized<00:03:59.510> e<00:03:59.690> pico<00:04:00.109> to

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
porting this highly optimized e pico to

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.480 
porting this highly optimized e pico to
the<00:04:00.440> GPU

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
the GPU

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.550 
the GPU
and<00:04:01.580> made<00:04:02.090> really<00:04:02.480> really<00:04:02.810> nice<00:04:02.990> success<00:04:03.380> so

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
and made really really nice success so

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.710 
and made really really nice success so
far<00:04:03.590> we<00:04:04.250> released<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.760> first<00:04:04.970> food<00:04:05.300> aversion

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
far we released the first food aversion

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.020 
far we released the first food aversion
last<00:04:05.930> week<00:04:06.140> okay<00:04:06.680> okay<00:04:06.980> so<00:04:07.190> what<00:04:07.580> what<00:04:07.790> kind<00:04:07.970> of

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
last week okay okay so what what kind of

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.400 
last week okay okay so what what kind of
speed<00:04:08.270> up<00:04:08.390> are<00:04:08.540> we<00:04:08.630> talking<00:04:08.960> we<00:04:09.050> were<00:04:09.080> talking

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
speed up are we talking we were talking

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.800 
speed up are we talking we were talking
a<00:04:09.500> thousand<00:04:10.460> seconds<00:04:10.820> to<00:04:11.030> record<00:04:11.420> what<00:04:11.690> a

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
a thousand seconds to record what a

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.380 
a thousand seconds to record what a
frame<00:04:12.110> or<00:04:12.140> a<00:04:12.410> second<00:04:13.070> write<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.610> with<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.060> CPU

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
frame or a second write it with the CPU

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.300 
frame or a second write it with the CPU
what<00:04:14.930> are<00:04:15.020> you<00:04:15.110> able<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.350> do<00:04:15.560> now<00:04:15.800> with<00:04:16.190> this

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
what are you able to do now with this

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.820 
what are you able to do now with this
first<00:04:16.520> iteration<00:04:17.150> CUDA<00:04:17.780> yeah<00:04:18.080> yeah<00:04:18.410> well<00:04:18.680> the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
first iteration CUDA yeah yeah well the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.770 
first iteration CUDA yeah yeah well the
first<00:04:19.100> iteration<00:04:19.400> could<00:04:20.090> have<00:04:20.270> we<00:04:20.390> managed<00:04:20.750> to

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
first iteration could have we managed to

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.670 
first iteration could have we managed to
get<00:04:21.490> 200,000<00:04:22.490> neurons<00:04:22.910> in<00:04:23.240> real<00:04:23.480> time<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.140> ten

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
get 200,000 neurons in real time and ten

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.430 
get 200,000 neurons in real time and ten
million<00:04:25.010> synopsis<00:04:25.640> which<00:04:26.120> is<00:04:26.360> really<00:04:27.050> like

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
million synopsis which is really like

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.010 
million synopsis which is really like
like<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.040> nice<00:04:28.340> number<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:29.090> chip<00:04:29.300> makers<00:04:29.750> are

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
like a nice number so chip makers are

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.710 
like a nice number so chip makers are
making<00:04:30.380> chips<00:04:30.590> with<00:04:30.860> 1,000<00:04:31.820> durance<00:04:32.150> just<00:04:32.510> for

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
making chips with 1,000 durance just for

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.420 
making chips with 1,000 durance just for
comparison<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.500> give<00:04:33.650> you<00:04:33.740> an<00:04:33.860> idea<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:34.310> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
comparison to give you an idea of the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.340 
comparison to give you an idea of the
number<00:04:34.700> okay<00:04:35.390> and<00:04:35.510> that's<00:04:35.720> just<00:04:35.870> like<00:04:36.110> our

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
number okay and that's just like our

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.520 
number okay and that's just like our
first<00:04:36.680> CUDA<00:04:36.980> code<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.550> plan<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.270> optimize<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:39.290> to

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
first CUDA code I plan to optimize it to

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.890 
first CUDA code I plan to optimize it to
do<00:04:39.680> I<00:04:40.130> talked<00:04:40.520> with<00:04:40.610> nvidia<00:04:41.210> yesterday<00:04:41.780> about

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
do I talked with nvidia yesterday about

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.250 
do I talked with nvidia yesterday about
some<00:04:42.350> musician<00:04:43.070> opportunities<00:04:43.820> so<00:04:44.600> we<00:04:45.050> hope

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
some musician opportunities so we hope

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.500 
some musician opportunities so we hope
to<00:04:45.500> go<00:04:45.650> too<00:04:45.710> much<00:04:46.010> higher<00:04:46.070> scale<00:04:46.670> and<00:04:46.940> also

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
to go too much higher scale and also

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.990 
to go too much higher scale and also
implement<00:04:48.170> a<00:04:48.290> multi-gpu<00:04:48.770> solution<00:04:49.490> so<00:04:49.760> that's

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
implement a multi-gpu solution so that's

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.540 
implement a multi-gpu solution so that's
like<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.840> next<00:04:51.050> big<00:04:51.260> thing<00:04:51.500> okay<00:04:51.740> so<00:04:51.800> when

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
like the the next big thing okay so when

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.490 
like the the next big thing okay so when
we<00:04:52.670> were<00:04:52.700> talking<00:04:53.060> what<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.480> hundred<00:04:53.840> thousand

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
we were talking what a hundred thousand

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.960 
we were talking what a hundred thousand
neurons<00:04:54.710> that's<00:04:54.920> like<00:04:55.100> what<00:04:55.310> like<00:04:55.520> a<00:04:55.550> cat

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
neurons that's like what like a cat

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.790 
neurons that's like what like a cat
brain<00:04:56.360> or<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.660> dog<00:04:56.930> brain<00:04:57.200> or<00:04:57.380> something<00:04:57.500> but

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
brain or a dog brain or something but

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.190 
brain or a dog brain or something but
thats<00:04:58.010> i<00:04:58.160> no<00:04:58.820> know<00:04:59.240> how<00:04:59.450> much<00:04:59.600> really<00:04:59.990> i<00:05:00.020> think

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
thats i no know how much really i think

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.470 
thats i no know how much really i think
you're<00:05:00.620> going<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.920> need<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.130> in<00:05:01.610> video<00:05:01.970> computer

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
you're going to need a in video computer

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.680 
you're going to need a in video computer
plans<00:05:02.780> for<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.110> carry-over<00:05:03.980> guys<00:05:04.880> like<00:05:05.570> you're

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
plans for a carry-over guys like you're

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.170 
plans for a carry-over guys like you're
watching<00:05:05.930> send<00:05:06.440> us<00:05:06.590> why<00:05:06.770> okay<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:07.610> just<00:05:07.940> the

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
watching send us why okay so just the

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.800 
watching send us why okay so just the
lizard<00:05:09.020> brain<00:05:09.260> of<00:05:09.470> the<00:05:09.560> cat<00:05:09.740> reaction<00:05:10.400> yeah<00:05:10.810> so

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
lizard brain of the cat reaction yeah so

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.980 
lizard brain of the cat reaction yeah so
kid<00:05:12.050> branch<00:05:12.350> has<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.940> 303<00:05:13.940> million<00:05:14.330> okay

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
kid branch has a 303 million okay

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.590 
kid branch has a 303 million okay
yourself<00:05:15.620> you're<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.890> long<00:05:16.130> way<00:05:16.400> from<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:17.030> but

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
yourself you're a long way from that but

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.500 
yourself you're a long way from that but
i<00:05:17.930> think<00:05:18.410> that<00:05:18.740> with<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.130> multi-gpu<00:05:19.700> solution

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
i think that with a multi-gpu solution

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.470 
i think that with a multi-gpu solution
is<00:05:20.690> even<00:05:21.110> on<00:05:21.230> a<00:05:21.260> home<00:05:21.560> pc<00:05:21.980> we<00:05:22.340> could<00:05:22.520> maybe<00:05:22.700> do<00:05:23.030> 1

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
is even on a home pc we could maybe do 1

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.600 
is even on a home pc we could maybe do 1
million<00:05:23.870> neurons<00:05:24.020> quite<00:05:24.500> soon<00:05:24.800> actually<00:05:25.430> we

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
million neurons quite soon actually we

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.460 
million neurons quite soon actually we
are<00:05:25.700> set<00:05:25.970> to<00:05:26.240> get<00:05:26.420> to<00:05:26.690> that<00:05:26.840> level<00:05:27.140> this<00:05:27.410> year

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
are set to get to that level this year

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.850 
are set to get to that level this year
okay<00:05:28.280> okay<00:05:28.810> well<00:05:29.810> this<00:05:29.930> is<00:05:30.110> very<00:05:30.140> exciting<00:05:30.590> so

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
okay okay well this is very exciting so

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.550 
okay okay well this is very exciting so
how<00:05:31.340> far<00:05:31.550> away<00:05:31.670> would<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.030> estimate<00:05:32.420> that<00:05:33.260> we

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
how far away would you estimate that we

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.860 
how far away would you estimate that we
are<00:05:33.740> from<00:05:34.130> doing<00:05:34.760> the<00:05:34.850> whole<00:05:35.000> human<00:05:35.360> brain<00:05:35.630> and

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
are from doing the whole human brain and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.470 
are from doing the whole human brain and
with<00:05:36.410> at<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:36.890> progress<00:05:37.130> are<00:05:37.460> showing<00:05:38.060> now<00:05:38.210> oh

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.480 
with at the progress are showing now oh

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.590 
with at the progress are showing now oh
well<00:05:39.140> yours<00:05:39.970> well<00:05:40.970> that's<00:05:41.210> what<00:05:41.390> they<00:05:41.540> told

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
well yours well that's what they told

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.100 
well yours well that's what they told
you<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.170> can<00:05:42.350> bring<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.770> just<00:05:43.490> never<00:05:44.110> imagined

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
you you can bring it just never imagined

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.930 
you you can bring it just never imagined
sir<00:05:45.260> okay<00:05:45.650> well<00:05:45.920> mine<00:05:46.160> is<00:05:46.370> like<00:05:46.610> only<00:05:46.850> one

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
sir okay well mine is like only one

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.600 
sir okay well mine is like only one
that's<00:05:47.330> left<00:05:47.390> working<00:05:47.990> with<00:05:48.200> but<00:05:48.620> uh<00:05:48.650> but

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
that's left working with but uh but

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:50.980 
that's left working with but uh but
there's<00:05:49.790> there's<00:05:50.060> more<00:05:50.240> complexities<00:05:50.810> than

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
there's there's more complexities than

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.350 
there's there's more complexities than
just<00:05:51.230> the<00:05:51.440> network<00:05:52.280> you're<00:05:52.460> saying<00:05:52.700> and<00:05:52.880> yeah

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
just the network you're saying and yeah

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.320 
just the network you're saying and yeah
yeah<00:05:53.720> of<00:05:53.840> course<00:05:54.200> I<00:05:54.440> think<00:05:54.950> that<00:05:55.100> we<00:05:56.000> have<00:05:56.210> to

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
yeah of course I think that we have to

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.630 
yeah of course I think that we have to
go<00:05:56.510> really<00:05:56.810> really<00:05:57.170> long<00:05:57.620> way<00:05:57.890> to<00:05:57.950> understand

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
go really really long way to understand

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.260 
go really really long way to understand
how<00:05:59.630> human<00:06:00.020> brain<00:06:00.290> even<00:06:00.680> works<00:06:01.190> and<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.790> dirty

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
how human brain even works and the dirty

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.330 
how human brain even works and the dirty
terms<00:06:02.510> of<00:06:02.690> people<00:06:03.050> working<00:06:03.440> on<00:06:03.590> that<00:06:03.770> making

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:04.340 
terms of people working on that making

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.480 
terms of people working on that making
it<00:06:04.720> little<00:06:05.720> steps<00:06:05.960> every<00:06:06.230> day<00:06:06.440> but<00:06:07.070> what<00:06:07.310> we

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
it little steps every day but what we

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.050 
it little steps every day but what we
can<00:06:07.700> do<00:06:07.880> is<00:06:08.030> simulate<00:06:08.570> maybe<00:06:09.350> audio<00:06:10.310> auditory

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
can do is simulate maybe audio auditory

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.629 
can do is simulate maybe audio auditory
and<00:06:11.210> visual<00:06:11.390> system<00:06:11.990> so<00:06:12.380> far

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
and visual system so far

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.709 
and visual system so far
animals<00:06:14.419> and<00:06:15.340> to<00:06:16.340> do<00:06:16.759> some<00:06:16.939> interesting<00:06:17.210> stuff

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:17.719 
animals and to do some interesting stuff

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:20.080 
animals and to do some interesting stuff
like<00:06:17.749> pattern<00:06:18.379> recognition<00:06:18.889> in<00:06:19.400> genomes<00:06:19.849> I

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
like pattern recognition in genomes I

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.019 
like pattern recognition in genomes I
think<00:06:20.330> yesterday<00:06:20.900> we<00:06:21.319> had<00:06:21.499> a<00:06:21.560> wonderful<00:06:22.490> talk

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
think yesterday we had a wonderful talk

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.260 
think yesterday we had a wonderful talk
at<00:06:23.240> the<00:06:23.330> keynote<00:06:23.569> and<00:06:24.639> there<00:06:25.639> were<00:06:25.789> all<00:06:25.849> these

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
at the keynote and there were all these

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.809 
at the keynote and there were all these
little<00:06:26.539> patterns<00:06:27.110> coming<00:06:27.560> up<00:06:27.740> in<00:06:27.979> genomes<00:06:28.580> I

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:28.819 
little patterns coming up in genomes I

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:30.070 
little patterns coming up in genomes I
think<00:06:29.360> that<00:06:29.479> would<00:06:29.629> be<00:06:29.689> wonderful

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
think that would be wonderful

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.379 
think that would be wonderful
application<00:06:30.590> just<00:06:31.189> for<00:06:31.490> a<00:06:31.849> neural<00:06:32.180> network

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:32.389 
application just for a neural network

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.100 
application just for a neural network
because<00:06:33.289> it<00:06:33.979> cannot<00:06:34.310> just<00:06:34.580> match<00:06:34.939> thinks<00:06:35.900> that

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
because it cannot just match thinks that

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.989 
because it cannot just match thinks that
you<00:06:36.259> see<00:06:36.469> like<00:06:36.710> okay<00:06:37.099> you<00:06:37.159> have<00:06:37.460> a<00:06:37.490> redhead<00:06:37.969> and

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:37.999 
you see like okay you have a redhead and

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:40.540 
you see like okay you have a redhead and
if<00:06:38.300> I<00:06:38.449> get<00:06:38.599> an<00:06:38.779> orange<00:06:39.110> yet<00:06:39.349> to<00:06:39.680> be<00:06:39.860> in<00:06:40.400> the

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
if I get an orange yet to be in the

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.110 
if I get an orange yet to be in the
south<00:06:40.789> with<00:06:40.969> my<00:06:41.150> that's<00:06:41.810> you<00:06:42.199> know<00:06:42.379> the<00:06:42.770> ground

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
south with my that's you know the ground

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.080 
south with my that's you know the ground
and<00:06:44.139> then<00:06:45.139> it's<00:06:45.319> a<00:06:45.439> good<00:06:45.590> match<00:06:45.830> so<00:06:46.669> once<00:06:46.939> you

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:47.090 
and then it's a good match so once you

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.879 
and then it's a good match so once you
have<00:06:47.210> this<00:06:47.330> working<00:06:47.689> model<00:06:48.080> is<00:06:48.229> the<00:06:48.620> idea<00:06:48.860> that

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
have this working model is the idea that

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.950 
have this working model is the idea that
that's<00:06:49.340> something<00:06:49.699> you<00:06:49.819> can<00:06:50.000> use<00:06:50.029> to<00:06:50.779> test

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
that's something you can use to test

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.659 
that's something you can use to test
hypotheses<00:06:51.620> against<00:06:52.099> and<00:06:52.250> do<00:06:52.340> experiments

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:52.669 
hypotheses against and do experiments

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.089 
hypotheses against and do experiments
but<00:06:53.360> inside<00:06:53.960> the<00:06:54.169> computer<00:06:54.439> is<00:06:54.740> that<00:06:54.949> the<00:06:55.039> idea

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:55.099 
but inside the computer is that the idea

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:57.670 
but inside the computer is that the idea
exactly<00:06:55.759> this<00:06:56.029> is<00:06:56.210> what<00:06:56.750> we<00:06:56.930> already<00:06:57.110> started

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
exactly this is what we already started

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.800 
exactly this is what we already started
doing<00:06:58.129> with<00:06:58.340> we<00:06:58.909> have<00:06:59.120> certain<00:06:59.479> learning

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
doing with we have certain learning

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.050 
doing with we have certain learning
algorithms<00:07:00.379> which<00:07:00.650> are<00:07:00.680> very<00:07:01.520> similar<00:07:01.879> to

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060 
algorithms which are very similar to

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.300 
algorithms which are very similar to
what<00:07:02.270> really<00:07:02.750> happens<00:07:03.050> in<00:07:03.199> the<00:07:03.259> brain<00:07:03.439> so<00:07:04.069> like

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
what really happens in the brain so like

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.829 
what really happens in the brain so like
it's<00:07:04.610> called<00:07:04.789> spike<00:07:05.060> time-dependent

00:07:05.829 --> 00:07:05.839 
it's called spike time-dependent

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:08.619 
it's called spike time-dependent
plasticity<00:07:06.110> for<00:07:06.529> example<00:07:06.979> and<00:07:07.129> what<00:07:08.060> is<00:07:08.300> not

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:08.629 
plasticity for example and what is not

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:10.749 
plasticity for example and what is not
possible<00:07:08.839> today<00:07:09.259> is<00:07:09.589> that<00:07:09.800> if<00:07:10.039> you<00:07:10.339> want<00:07:10.520> to<00:07:10.610> do

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 
possible today is that if you want to do

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:13.209 
possible today is that if you want to do
a<00:07:10.789> hypothesis<00:07:11.539> how<00:07:12.379> something<00:07:12.830> works<00:07:12.949> in<00:07:13.159> a

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:13.219 
a hypothesis how something works in a

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:15.010 
a hypothesis how something works in a
real<00:07:13.400> brain<00:07:13.699> you<00:07:14.240> need<00:07:14.419> to<00:07:14.539> have<00:07:14.689> it<00:07:14.839> on<00:07:14.990> a

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
real brain you need to have it on a

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.409 
real brain you need to have it on a
larger<00:07:15.259> scale<00:07:15.710> and<00:07:16.009> today<00:07:16.520> with<00:07:16.939> the<00:07:16.999> CPUs

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
larger scale and today with the CPUs

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:18.730 
larger scale and today with the CPUs
this<00:07:17.599> is<00:07:17.750> just<00:07:17.930> not<00:07:18.080> going<00:07:18.229> to<00:07:18.289> work<00:07:18.349> unless

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.740 
this is just not going to work unless

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.890 
this is just not going to work unless
you<00:07:18.919> have<00:07:19.069> a<00:07:19.099> super<00:07:19.699> cluster<00:07:20.060> in<00:07:20.180> your<00:07:20.330> in<00:07:20.839> your

you have a super cluster in your in your

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.320 
you have a super cluster in your in your
barn<00:07:21.259> or<00:07:21.469> somewhere<00:07:21.830> so<00:07:22.430> so<00:07:22.819> what<00:07:23.150> we<00:07:23.300> are

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
barn or somewhere so so what we are

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.939 
barn or somewhere so so what we are
going<00:07:23.599> to<00:07:23.689> do<00:07:23.900> is<00:07:24.080> we<00:07:24.259> bring<00:07:24.529> it<00:07:24.680> to<00:07:24.800> this

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:24.949 
going to do is we bring it to this

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:27.159 
going to do is we bring it to this
million<00:07:25.460> of<00:07:25.699> neurons<00:07:26.240> or<00:07:26.449> millions<00:07:27.050> of

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:27.169 
million of neurons or millions of

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:28.899 
million of neurons or millions of
neurons<00:07:27.289> real<00:07:27.620> time<00:07:27.860> and<00:07:28.069> then<00:07:28.460> we<00:07:28.580> can<00:07:28.729> really

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:28.909 
neurons real time and then we can really

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:30.490 
neurons real time and then we can really
start<00:07:29.000> to<00:07:29.270> do<00:07:29.389> cool<00:07:29.539> stuff<00:07:29.810> because<00:07:30.169> you<00:07:30.289> have

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 
start to do cool stuff because you have

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.849 
start to do cool stuff because you have
the<00:07:30.680> scale<00:07:30.949> for<00:07:31.370> the<00:07:31.430> first<00:07:31.669> time
