a different option would be if you don't

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.130 
a different option would be if you don't
have<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.520> video<00:01:48.789> camera<00:01:49.060> how<00:01:49.840> about<00:01:50.020> your

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
have a video camera how about your

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.410 
have a video camera how about your
smartphone<00:01:50.680> just<00:01:50.950> about<00:01:51.909> everyone<00:01:52.270> has<00:01:52.359> a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
smartphone just about everyone has a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.270 
smartphone just about everyone has a
smartphone<00:01:52.899> these<00:01:53.170> days<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.680> obviously<00:01:54.100> you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
smartphone these days and obviously you

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.980 
smartphone these days and obviously you
know<00:01:54.430> they<00:01:54.640> take<00:01:54.850> still<00:01:55.180> photographs<00:01:55.479> and

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
know they take still photographs and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.099 
know they take still photographs and
videos<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.549> you<00:01:57.609> can<00:01:57.880> actually<00:01:58.149> do<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.810> lot<00:01:59.049> of

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
videos so you can actually do a lot of

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.929 
videos so you can actually do a lot of
uploading<00:01:59.619> straight<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.189> YouTube<00:02:00.579> from<00:02:00.820> your

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
smartphone and that would get you some

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.830 
smartphone and that would get you some
videos<00:02:03.520> up<00:02:03.759> there<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.539> I<00:02:04.570> would

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
videos up there and going so I would

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.810 
videos up there and going so I would
suggest<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:05.799> you<00:02:05.950> don't<00:02:06.130> have<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.310> video<00:02:06.460> camera

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820

high as 150 but I know I bought mine on
amazon.com<00:07:04.950> that's<00:07:05.950> where<00:07:06.100> my<00:07:06.190> link<00:07:06.490> leads<00:07:06.760> to

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910 
amazon.com that's where my link leads to

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.270 
amazon.com that's where my link leads to
and<00:07:07.390> every<00:07:08.140> time<00:07:08.350> I<00:07:08.380> go<00:07:08.590> and<00:07:08.770> check<00:07:08.920> that<00:07:09.100> link

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
and every time I go and check that link

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.490 
and every time I go and check that link
it's<00:07:09.490> right<00:07:09.730> around<00:07:09.880> $99<00:07:10.870> sometimes<00:07:11.290> you<00:07:11.410> can

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
it's right around $99 sometimes you can

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.310 
it's right around $99 sometimes you can
get<00:07:11.590> them<00:07:11.680> as<00:07:11.770> low<00:07:11.950> as<00:07:12.100> $89<00:07:12.970> and<00:07:13.840> they'll<00:07:14.050> go<00:07:14.200> up

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
get them as low as $89 and they'll go up

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.480 
get them as low as $89 and they'll go up
to<00:07:14.410> about<00:07:14.560> 119<00:07:15.310> but<00:07:15.850> that's<00:07:16.030> the<00:07:16.150> best<00:07:16.300> part

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
to about 119 but that's the best part

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.880 
to about 119 but that's the best part
$99<00:07:18.700> compared<00:07:19.330> to<00:07:19.360> 300<00:07:19.990> plus<00:07:20.200> dollars<00:07:20.650> and

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:20.890 
$99 compared to 300 plus dollars and

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.590 
$99 compared to 300 plus dollars and
that's<00:07:21.460> that's<00:07:21.970> a<00:07:22.180> low<00:07:22.330> in<00:07:22.540> handycam<00:07:23.470> so<00:07:24.600> $99

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600 
that's that's a low in handycam so $99

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.350 
that's that's a low in handycam so $99
is<00:07:25.720> a<00:07:26.020> great<00:07:26.530> investment<00:07:27.070> for<00:07:27.550> someone<00:07:28.270> who
