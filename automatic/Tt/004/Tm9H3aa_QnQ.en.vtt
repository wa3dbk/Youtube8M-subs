00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.660
 good afternoon everyone i will show you 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.280
 one way armani trawl for rubik 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.200
 we will do this here on this spawn 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.280
 that is , we will be the first skill of the Rubik 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.950
 raise a big creep 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 throw it here and then we will 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.400
 do so that he went here for such 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.490
 trajectories and hooked creeps that go 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.580
 the first line to go 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.619
 here here there are trees initially 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.420
 grow here and just don't come here but 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.640
 after you first quit and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.780
 creep here and the tree will collapse and in 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.879
 further general it will all be 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.550
 easier to make 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.620
 we will do about 27 irina 57 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.799
 second to be drinking creeps in 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.580
 which will go the floor and well here we are 

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:47.460
 raise it 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.809
 we throw here and now need it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 accompany or do so that he 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.879
 coming after you here when john is here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.940
 conducts himself ie initially literally 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.470
 few steps need to be done because 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.180
 if this is not done then fish may 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.229
 just run over the top under this 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 trajectories here here and 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.180
 accordingly it goes with the flu which 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.039
 you are light and important to be able to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.210
 that here at the turn of the creep can 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:14.100
 go into the fog and accordingly its not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 will be seen and how your creeps can 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.609
 turn around and go back to the line then 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.679
 There is here as an option, you can put 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:25.109
 ward right now we farm this spam and our 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:30.030
 script and then go up now we 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:32.149
 everyone will see here the creeps go here we are 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.630
 will be 2 spawn right away 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:38.909
 farm it also sometimes turns out 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.469
 make spawn here and in general 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.030
 if they did, they gave spawn then your hobbies 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.130
 Scratch no longer live to these 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.509
 neutrals but it's nothing scary that is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.799
 You can fuck in principle here are two 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.509
 spawn here now our creeps for 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.869
 farm it and now you can farm 3 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.850
 spawn 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.229
 here they do n't always get for bullets 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.789
 creeps but there is still an important point just 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.829
 you need a little bit ahead of their 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.049
 creeps, that is, have time to take out neutrals 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.990
 that's it that's just to close 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.939
 on neutrals the same can be done 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.009
 roughly target or with force 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.860
 staff are ducks frames there need be already 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.510
 shake the vapor of that level because 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.460
 level 1 dad may just not get it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.980
 here here and not pull creeps 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.330
 with for footsteps you can do this too 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.010
 this is not very long ago simply because 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.350
 will have to farm too long and creeps 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 sometimes not very lucky to stand that 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.920
 force to smell u now here croton you 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.530
 pushed you think it's not just not 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.720
 pushed out and select now here is creep 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.460
 ran us the other way that is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.650
 through the top and here we would not have succeeded 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.720
 to foul it, that is, again, you need to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 it slowly accompany Tupolev 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.880
 example joy then bring it further 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.300
 he is already starting to run to you himself 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.260
 Thank you all for watching a nice day 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.260
