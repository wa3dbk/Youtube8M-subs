00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
first night of back-to-back I think it's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.060 
first night of back-to-back I think it's
the<00:01:15.840> muscle<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> got<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.920> get

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the muscle it's the one you got to get

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.380 
the muscle it's the one you got to get
because<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.970> never<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.210> especially

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
because you never know especially

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
because you never know especially
traveling<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.860> never<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.130> what's<00:01:20.250> gonna

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
traveling you never know what's gonna

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
traveling you never know what's gonna
happen<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.759> back<00:01:20.970> side<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.080> believe

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
