this<00:00:07.390> is<00:00:07.600> the<00:00:07.960> Roco<00:00:08.650> multi<00:00:09.220> mouse<00:00:09.400> system

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
this is the Roco multi mouse system

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.390 
this is the Roco multi mouse system
I<00:00:11.290> have<00:00:12.040> a

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.830 

in<00:00:15.460> trainset<00:00:16.150> sir<00:00:16.359> there's<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.630> large

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
in trainset sir there's a large

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.220 
in trainset sir there's a large
transformer<00:00:17.670> there's<00:00:18.670> the<00:00:18.970> multi<00:00:19.630> central

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:20.230 
transformer there's the multi central

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.760 
transformer there's the multi central
which<00:00:20.439> is<00:00:20.619> the<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:21.070> brains<00:00:21.310> of<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.759> unit

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:22.770 
which is the the brains of the unit

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.080 
which is the the brains of the unit
there<00:00:23.770> is<00:00:23.919> the<00:00:24.300> multi<00:00:25.300> mouse<00:00:25.480> handset<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
there is the multi mouse handset the

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.089 
there is the multi mouse handset the
beauty<00:00:28.449> of<00:00:28.480> this<00:00:28.720> system<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.410> that<00:00:29.470> it's<00:00:29.890> all

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
beauty of this system is that it's all

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.119 
beauty of this system is that it's all
bespoke<00:00:30.820> plug<00:00:31.239> so<00:00:31.539> you<00:00:31.570> can't<00:00:32.019> plug<00:00:32.769> in<00:00:32.949> the

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
bespoke plug so you can't plug in the

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:35.930 
bespoke plug so you can't plug in the
wrong<00:00:33.870> item

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
wrong item

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.460 
wrong item
so<00:00:37.500> take<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.620> handset<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.690> plug<00:00:40.690> in<00:00:40.839> the<00:00:41.050> X

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
so take the handset and plug in the X

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.689 
so take the handset and plug in the X
bus<00:00:41.890> cable<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.989> will<00:00:44.170> go<00:00:44.350> into<00:00:44.589> the<00:00:44.949> master

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
bus cable that will go into the master

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.750 
bus cable that will go into the master
socket<00:00:45.970> you<00:00:46.390> can<00:00:46.570> then<00:00:46.750> connect<00:00:47.170> another

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
socket you can then connect another

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.979 
socket you can then connect another
handset<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.059> slave<00:00:49.440> socket<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.750> power

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
handset to the slave socket the power

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.390 
handset to the slave socket the power
goes<00:00:53.680> into<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:54.280> check<00:00:54.729> socket<00:00:54.970> there<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:56.400> the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
goes into the check socket there and the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
goes into the check socket there and the
track<00:00:57.699> is<00:00:58.000> a<00:00:58.750> two<00:00:58.930> pin<00:01:01.199> there<00:01:02.199> is<00:01:02.320> a<00:01:02.350> booster

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
track is a two pin there is a booster

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.580 
track is a two pin there is a booster
cable<00:01:04.420> that<00:01:04.600> can<00:01:04.780> go<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:05.019> there<00:01:05.199> so<00:01:05.409> if<00:01:05.470> you're

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
cable that can go in there so if you're

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.440 
cable that can go in there so if you're
using<00:01:05.799> boosters<00:01:06.400> they'll<00:01:06.970> connect<00:01:07.360> from

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
using boosters they'll connect from

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.249 
using boosters they'll connect from
there<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.650> can<00:01:11.890> get<00:01:12.130> additional<00:01:12.970> cables<00:01:13.720> for

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
there you can get additional cables for

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.830 
there you can get additional cables for
different<00:01:14.680> track<00:01:14.950> systems<00:01:15.490> so<00:01:16.150> that's<00:01:16.479> just<00:01:16.689> a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
different track systems so that's just a

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.190 
different track systems so that's just a
plain<00:01:17.049> two<00:01:17.590> wire<00:01:18.150> cable<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:19.330> plugs<00:01:19.690> into<00:01:19.960> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
plain two wire cable that plugs into the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.310 
plain two wire cable that plugs into the
system<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.270> one<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.600> comes<00:01:22.780> with<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.050> set

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
system the one that comes with the set

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.800 
system the one that comes with the set
is<00:01:23.620> actually<00:01:24.180> attached<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.420> bottom<00:01:25.720> of

largely<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.600> standard<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.410> go<00:02:45.980> with<00:02:46.160> that

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
largely the standard so go with that

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.170 
largely the standard so go with that
lots<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.440> engine<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.490> entered<00:02:49.880> into

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
lots of that engine just entered into

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.800 
lots of that engine just entered into
the<00:02:50.330> database<00:02:52.300> when<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.390> get<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.570> new

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
the database when you get a new

the database when you get a new
locomotive<00:02:54.200> or<00:02:54.760> decoder

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
locomotive or decoder

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.980 
locomotive or decoder
it's<00:02:56.450> normally<00:02:56.959> supplied<00:02:57.290> on<00:02:57.770> address<00:02:58.250> 3<00:02:58.990> now

it's normally supplied on address 3 now
you<00:03:00.770> don't<00:03:00.920> want<00:03:01.040> every<00:03:01.310> low<00:03:01.550> could<00:03:01.760> have<00:03:01.910> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
you don't want every low could have the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.090 
you don't want every low could have the
same<00:03:02.209> address<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.020> will<00:03:03.320> need<00:03:03.440> to<00:03:03.500> go<00:03:03.980> in
