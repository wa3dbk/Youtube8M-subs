00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.039
 Hello friends, how are you? 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.410
 this time I show you two options 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.500
 similar for halloween and why not 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.510
 for the day of the dead this 1 and 2 of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 November here in Mexico 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.200
 I hope you like it and share it with your 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.930
 Friends of facebook or twitter 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.020
 then let's start 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.540
 and you want to see these spider accessories 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.410
 for halloween I invite you to click on 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.410
 continuation 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.180
 I will start doing previously two 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.400
 tail 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.519
 I use a ribbon of the same length as 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.710
 hair already folded in half 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:55.780
 placing it at the ends of the three 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.780
 separate strips of hair 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.760
 I continue weaving a braid of 3 segments 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.310
 doing the steps as if it were a 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.640
 inverted braid taking care that the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.100
 strip is behind the threads and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.130
 that the back of the braid will be 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:20.140
 the face of the hairstyle so to speak and 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.140
 You'll see later because I'm telling you 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.170
 we will leave approximately 10 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.740
 centimeters without finishing the braid 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.470
 [Music] 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.970
 If the bar is too long, you can 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.820
 cut it or place a league or with this 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.200
 same ribbon holding the braid with a 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.200
 knot and ready 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.500
 due to the tips in half 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.050
 as you can appreciate having woven the 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.470
 ribbon behind the strands is 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.410
 will appreciate more when rolling it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.340
 roll the braid to the base of the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.080
 pigtail leaving the ends in half 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.050
 We hold very well with pins and 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.750
 also with hairpins all around 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.750
 and remember to place enough 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.550
 [Music] 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.100
 Now we will separate four locks 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.060
 for each side 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.850
 so we will have eight legs of this 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.550
 spider remembers to go placing spray 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.000
 while you are ironing or sliding your 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:03.660
 fingers on the strands of hair leaves 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.660
 dry a little and you can go placing more 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.560
 now I will only place the eyes the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.340
 which you can make of the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.340
 Following way 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.700
 the material is a piece of ribbon 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.960
 movable eyes ligament a hairpin 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:37.980
 and a scissor 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.980
 placed some glue on the ribbon 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.590
 and I'm sticking it around the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.590
 fork 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.549
 placed a little more glue and cut 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.549
 excess 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.280
 I keep sticking my eyes on the ribbon 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.300
 and now I have my eyes to be 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.300
 there 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.709
 I divided the hair into three double lath 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.440
 in half he placed it above the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.890
 two works that lie sideways and 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.250
 I continue weaving a braid of three 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:29.330
 leaving the bar behind 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:33.199
 [Music] 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.800
 here we will remove small strands of 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.870
 the braid while I'm knitting this already 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.780
 towards the middle of this braid 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.710
 and here we will finish the braid 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.710
 complete 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.699
 It has inspired me in the braid at 100 feet 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.840
 that you will find in the channel and that here 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.840
 I leave the link 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.650
 Now I 'm just holding a little girl 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.570
 now all the loose strands are 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:15.630
 they will pray with a pincer or iron too 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.630
 you can entangle them as you prefer 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.760
 we roll the braid towards the base of the 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.780
 pigtail we put enough pins to 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.780
 all around 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.439
 [Music] 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:50.870
 we separated the strands into many more 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.870
 we can go entangle as you like 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.660
 we put the eyes and ready 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.820
 good friends I hope you liked it 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:10.540
 any of these two options and 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.130
 I hope you tell me which one you liked the most 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.460
 remember that you can share it with the 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.220
