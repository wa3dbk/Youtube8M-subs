00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.580
 from the card holder who is not a teacher to an advanced basic registration 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.580
 people 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.389
 up to 19 94 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.269
 the state the population administration of the netherlands 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.779
 from the card trays in which personal cards were stored from 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.800
 inhabitants of The Netherlands 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.740
 of every citizen there was a person card 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.439
 and every municipality had its own card box 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.439
 with the maps of its inhabitants 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.050
 third-party personal data is recorded on such a card 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.820
 next to the name 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.150
 date of birth 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.480
 nationality and the record giant 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.859
 the person skype also included information about people 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.060
 but not everyone can have a relationship 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.650
 so father was mother husband and children 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.390
 of these related persons where again personal cards with all described 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.840
 in relationships 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.999
 This allowed certain information about a person 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.340
 occur 5 or more times in the population administration 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.990
 both on his own personal cards 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.350
 as on the personal cards of his father's mother 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 husband 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.860
 or child 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.000
 in nineteen 94 they stepped into the town with keeping personal cards 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.050
 you could have intellectually nice person lists on a regular basis 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.020
 the municipality continued with the gb apa 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
 the municipal basic administration of personal data 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.560
 the population administration now consisted of the electronic card box 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 this had many advantages because data could be processed automatically 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.049
 and provision of data 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.389
 all kinds of government agencies could also be done digitally 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.300
 the introduction of the gpda was a great success 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.680
 the many government organizations and various other institutions are now making 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 use of the gb of data 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.960
 at the beginning of this year it is still a card box system it has 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.030
 be electronic 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.030
 and the communication is mainly through mail traffic 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.849
 in addition, part of the data is still being stored more securely 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.610
 where there is a risk of quality defects 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.249
 modernization is needed to offer more quality, flexibility and speed 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.019
 ex gb modernization program 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.319
 currently works on the current gmbh 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.760
 to transform into a new advanced basic person registration 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.199
 replace the gb on board 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.489
 this means the completely new way of storing data 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 and fast processor for data exchange 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:57.670
 the personal data is given a new order 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.430
 where data about a person is in principle no longer multiple, but 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.329
 saved only once 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.499
 if there is a relationship with other persons, for example in the elderly with 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.869
 a child you will find a link in the system through it 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.869
 citizen service number of the persons involved 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:22.479
 in the new data structure one can no longer talk about one 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.699
 electronic card box 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:29.729
 the data about people are divided into groups of data that whenever 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:30.389
 required 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.829
 when puzzle pieces fall together and then contain the necessary information 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.970
 the data will no longer be distributed in all municipalities 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.499
 but in a central location 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:48.519
 that makes keeping and providing the data much easier 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:54.459
 the basic registration can be consulted 24 hours a day 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.969
 m optimally protected against unjust breaches of privacy 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.189
 what does this modernization move mean 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.439
 the basic registration the strike services of the government administration as a whole 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:18.459
 all government agencies that need information about individuals get that 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.229
 soon even faster from a central system and the data is from one 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.189
 immediate clear quality 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.800
 the government tasks can therefore be carried out crater 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.850
 modern government to improve all kinds of government services for citizens 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.599
 information provision 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.250
 next to authorities 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.250
 and that also benefits citizens 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.919
 online access for government agencies means better services 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.430
 because they are in contact with citizens in hours 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.040
 have immediate access to the current data of those involved 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.110
 municipalities that have to keep up with the basic registration will start working with a major 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.460
 share standardized systems 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.460
 that help prevent input errors 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.750
 municipalities remain responsible for keeping the data up to date 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.030
 work within the basic registration that coincided efficiently and effectively 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.919
 data can be kept up to date 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:26.899
 the processing of a change of address of a citizen from one to the other 

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:28.379
 municipalities has moved 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.959
 this as a result of the new book system now at least two to four days 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.089
 in the new basic registration persons this can be done within a few minutes 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:40.580
 to happen 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.770
 that is also of great importance for modern services 

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:48.190
 the basic registration of persons 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.160
 becomes an advanced basic registration of 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.180
 personal data 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.449
 the introduction of the new basic registration takes effort 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:01.270
 time 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.610
 and involvement of the four organizations 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.180
 but in the long run it is cheaper 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.090
 better 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.090
 and smarter 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.639
 There is also a new law in preparation that the current legislation 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.990
 to replace 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.009
 the new works set up this technique independently 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:25.639
 This allows changes to the basic registration of persons 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:28.639
 processed in the systems in a more flexible way 

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:35.809
 together with the technical innovations the basic registration of persons with it 

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:41.129
 be prepared for its important administrative and administrative responsibilities for the coming decades 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.449
 social function
