00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.319
 some additional details that must be done regarding the examples that 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.319
 we have done previously of embedding of sources 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.240
 for the use of the kits provided by the page we made 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.560
 mention above of fundes kudelka 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 if we can use more than one source 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.289
 embedded within our own pages 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.970
 here for example we have seen 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.539
 we are also using the sources 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.869
 howell 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.880
 that we have also downloaded from the same web page 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.320
 and how we have moved them to the funds folder so much 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.200
 the signings of sources like 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.730
 signing this visit 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.070
 is he who is 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.170
 referenced by Nestor 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.090
 new typeface 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.440
 Of course we have had to complain so that it does not just overlap with the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.660
 previous with him is and sirte 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.270
 and on the other hand also by the same procedure and that we had mentioned 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.070
 previously 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.319
 we have generated a style sheet called quabit 

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.790
 the css 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.309
 a series of styles 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.309
 this time as classes we can not see 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.220
 by this definition by points 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.900
 in such a way that we can use 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.570
 these styles 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.900
 so much list the good second communist and turned not only 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.130
 to paragraphs yes we can not even use it 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.900
 to words or groups of words 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.270
 as for example in this case 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.740
 applying him 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 the style that is higuaÃ­n 1 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.130
 the property itself automatically what it does is generate the label is 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.190
 payment as we can see who he 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.120
 obinna tag selector in the code 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.840
 we see how 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.550
 this block of text generates us through the Spanish label that 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.410
 can be 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.410
 format independently 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.290
 as well 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.179
 What about there 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.350
 you should keep in mind that when 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.560
 one go 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.810
 to publish the website should publish 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.889
 not only the pages but you should also upload to your server 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.859
 an ftp method 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:15.909
 the source files 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.189
 needed to make it look less 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:20.039
 browsers 

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.539
 the style sheet 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.519
 that contains the tag @ confetis 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.930
 and that refers to the location of where they are 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.459
 the sources 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.809
 stored 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.829
 and also in our case the style sheet 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:41.059
 both wade ccs and a vulgar css that define the styles 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.059
 based on this technology 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:48.939
 some other issues 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.749
 What we should mention is that 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.719
 all these sources 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.259
 phelps usually have some are copyright which is convenient 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.549
 Read the license file in this case 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.139
 Well, we have an example that usually 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:13.159
 rights managed group moon license equity disk mons 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.650
 and that we can have for a we should rather be very careful with the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.259
 embedding fonts 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.969
 what are protected by copyright against the 5th station 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.339
 and like 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:32.089
 what happens with embedding fonts in pdf files 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.489
 we can see the result 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.679
 in exploring 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.169
 we can see in this area here 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.899
 this other source is being used 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.199
 called quabit powell 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.619
 and like the crazy years two styles that we have 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:01.519
 redefined 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.139
 which we can see here 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.489
 in 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.430
 in the css styles panel 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.989
 let's see how they were in concrete 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.279
 it's found 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.139
 linked to distilled water 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.139
 hamburg the fss guarido css 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.569
 well it is clear from that would be enough the French
