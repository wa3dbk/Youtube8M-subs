 curse consumed the earth and its 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.039

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.629
 all those who were glad at heart 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.610
 the rejoicing of the tambourines ceased 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 finished the roar of those who cheer is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.109
 a joy of the harp 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.960
 they will not drink wine with singing the cider 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.250
 it will be bitter to those who drank it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.679
 broken this city for vanity 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.259

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.479

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.459
 He darkened the joy of the exiled 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.189
 land the city was desolate and with 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:31.350
 ruin the door was knocked down because that's how 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.719
 will be in the middle of the earth in the middle of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:39.030
 searched after the harvest these 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 they will raise their voices they will sing joyfully for the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.630
 Greatness of Jehovah from the sea will give 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.399
 voices 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.500

 At the end of the earth we hear chants 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.380
 glory to the just and I said my misery my 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.360
 unhappiness there are of my prevaricators have 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.689
 perverted and have transgressed with 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.299
 prevarication of disloyal terror moat 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.009
 network over you oh dweller of the earth and 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.200
 it will happen that the one who has the voice 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.150
 of terror will fall into the pit and whoever 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.160
 come out of the middle of the pit he will be imprisoned 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.650
 in the network because from on high 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.350
 in windows and the foundations of 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.810
 the earth will be broken completely 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.970
 entirely crumbled earth will be the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.610
 earth will be in a great way the earth 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.490
 moved to tremble to the earth like a 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.160
 drunk and it will be removed like a hut and 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.550
 her sin will be aggravated over her and she will fall 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.410
 and will never rise again it will happen in 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.480
 that day that jehovah will punish the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.180
 army of the heavens above and 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.220
 the kings of the earth on earth and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.500

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.840
 imprisoned in prison and in prison 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.570
 they will be locked up and punished 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.520
 after many days the moon 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.740

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.900
