 very important configuration and they are the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.089
 keys does not read the keyboard and here in this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 message german diaz tells me good day

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.930
 time and to serve us I am a person who 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.000
 I have the same one that had my name 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.060
 it's real it's german I live in colombia and I 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.250
 love watching your videos with my son both 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.170
 we are gay - high level we try to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 make plays like yours analyze 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.649
 how do you play and this whole question 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 I would like to ask you three questions 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.170
 I hope not to bother you good guys read 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.079
 the questions while I pass to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.420
 tell you the configuration that I have here 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.000
 which is the most comfortable German I'm telling you 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.160
 already directly there good I according to the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.100
 pc that each of us have, I have a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.590
 resolution of 1024 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.109
 this keyboard theme is worth this is 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.660
 very important to copy and paste to make 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.390
 a screen to this part and memorize 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.840
 because it is the most comfortable to play 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.290
 ok now let's see the theme of the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.360
 sensitivity of the mouse I have it to 60 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.200
 but every pc at the best requires more or 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.330
 less 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.610
 and the configuration of etc by the I have 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.200
 so it's worth 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.090
 let's continue and let's see 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.620
 really how do you have to handle it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.040
 look at the question is to have reduced in 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.850
 the fingers when playing the most 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.310
 as possible, the more 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.610
 short range of the fastest movement 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.170
 we will play not logically and here we are going to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.520
 be very good here we are seeing now 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.729
 Well, everything that controls is worth 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.820
 I'm going to say one thing also good 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.869
 efe 5 this is for the punctures the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.299
 also and all this is valid and I have him 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.149
 putting an insulating tape on the bar 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.640
 of the space by the theme of the jump is worth 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.979
 why let's see look I have the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.370
 insulating tape right in the middle what 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.500
 You see, this is because I do it because with 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.660
 the touch of the finger I know where it is 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.829
 just the medium because if I give it very 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.900
 to the left the key takes a 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:25.829
 slit and sometimes I do not jump well 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.950
 according to which the material of the 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.349
 good keyboard here we have b &amp; n that is 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.610
 bullet from shot to shot or from bursts and the in 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.590
 the one that we already know everything that is 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.920
 nocturnality and here we are with the mouse 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.769
 a very important thing of the game I what 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.599
 wireless use and here we have the part 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.629
 left of the shot in the part 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.980
 right to aim and then we have what 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.710
 which is the subject of the court and the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.130
 minimap in larroulet and there 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.980
 in the second the second question the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.720

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.140

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.270
