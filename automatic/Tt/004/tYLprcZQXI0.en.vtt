street art in Los Angeles is incredibly

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.529 
street art in Los Angeles is incredibly
exciting<00:00:21.830> it's<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.310> unique<00:00:22.640> environment<00:00:23.390> and

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
exciting it's a unique environment and

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.040 
exciting it's a unique environment and
we're<00:00:24.259> in<00:00:24.439> a<00:00:24.529> celebrity-obsessed

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
we're in a celebrity-obsessed

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.540 
we're in a celebrity-obsessed
entertainment<00:00:27.050> capital<00:00:27.710> of<00:00:27.919> the<00:00:27.980> world<00:00:28.099> and

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
entertainment capital of the world and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.819 
entertainment capital of the world and
we<00:00:28.759> have<00:00:28.970> some<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.329> the<00:00:29.619> probably<00:00:30.619> the<00:00:30.679> most

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
we have some of the probably the most

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.850

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.700 
production and so our landscape the
weather<00:00:43.660> really<00:00:44.660> differentiate<00:00:45.470> ourselves

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
weather really differentiate ourselves

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.460 
weather really differentiate ourselves
from<00:00:46.070> other<00:00:46.460> places<00:00:47.050> when<00:00:48.050> I<00:00:48.080> speak<00:00:48.350> about

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
from other places when I speak about

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.770 
from other places when I speak about
ethos<00:00:49.100> I'm<00:00:49.430> talking<00:00:49.970> about<00:00:50.030> what<00:00:50.480> is<00:00:50.600> at<00:00:50.750> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
ethos I'm talking about what is at the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.470 
ethos I'm talking about what is at the
core<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.530> what<00:00:51.950> drives<00:00:52.370> the<00:00:53.000> artist<00:00:53.330> to

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
core and what drives the artist to

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.890 
core and what drives the artist to
create<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:53.990> work<00:00:54.170> that<00:00:54.410> they<00:00:54.530> do<00:00:54.910> what<00:00:55.910> why<00:00:56.840> do

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
they have to go out in the middle night

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.610 
they have to go out in the middle night
and<00:00:58.790> put<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.090> work<00:00:59.270> up<00:00:59.420> why<00:00:59.690> risk<00:01:00.140> the

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
and put that work up why risk the

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.310 
and put that work up why risk the
opportunity<00:01:01.520> of<00:01:01.580> getting<00:01:01.700> arrested<00:01:02.090> why<00:01:02.690> put

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
opportunity of getting arrested why put

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.640 
opportunity of getting arrested why put
yourself<00:01:03.350> out<00:01:04.040> in<00:01:04.460> such<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.390> manner<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.140> there's

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
yourself out in such a manner so there's

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.709 
yourself out in such a manner so there's
something<00:01:06.890> deep<00:01:07.310> down<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:07.969> every<00:01:08.420> artist

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
something deep down that every artist

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.249 
something deep down that every artist
has<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:10.270> motivates<00:01:11.270> them<00:01:11.539> and<00:01:11.990> why<00:01:12.229> they

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
has that motivates them and why they

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.779 
has that motivates them and why they
have<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.770> go<00:01:12.890> out<00:01:12.979> there<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.219> do<00:01:13.429> it<00:01:13.549> and<00:01:13.729> I

if you want to live on the riverbank
that's<00:02:10.970> where<00:02:11.209> communities<00:02:11.810> are<00:02:11.930> built<00:02:12.049> but

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
that's where communities are built but

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.750 
that's where communities are built but
we<00:02:12.349> have<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> scar<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.010> runs<00:02:13.400> through<00:02:13.730> our

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
we have a scar that runs through our

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.910 
we have a scar that runs through our
city<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.390> basically<00:02:15.110> what's<00:02:15.379> happened<00:02:15.769> with

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
city and basically what's happened with

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.160 
city and basically what's happened with
all<00:02:16.129> this<00:02:16.280> concrete<00:02:16.579> we've<00:02:17.450> had<00:02:17.659> artists

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
all this concrete we've had artists

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.929 
all this concrete we've had artists
basically<00:02:18.590> saying<00:02:18.769> hey<00:02:18.890> I'm<00:02:19.220> here<00:02:19.579> and<00:02:19.760> we're

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:19.939 
basically saying hey I'm here and we're

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.610 
basically saying hey I'm here and we're
adding<00:02:20.269> humanity<00:02:20.720> back<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.200> streets<00:02:21.500> and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
adding humanity back to the streets and

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.600 
adding humanity back to the streets and
I<00:02:21.680> think<00:02:21.860> that's<00:02:21.980> what<00:02:22.099> street<00:02:22.280> artists<00:02:22.489> are

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
I think that's what street artists are

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.309 
I think that's what street artists are
doing<00:02:22.909> they're<00:02:23.060> giving<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.540> personal<00:02:24.110> touch

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
doing they're giving this personal touch

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.619 
doing they're giving this personal touch
that<00:02:24.620> hey<00:02:25.040> we're<00:02:25.280> humans<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.000> we<00:02:26.120> live<00:02:26.390> here

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
that hey we're humans and we live here

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.330 
that hey we're humans and we live here
and<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:26.900> modern<00:02:27.379> dream<00:02:27.650> doesn't<00:02:27.920> exist

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
and this modern dream doesn't exist

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.180 
and this modern dream doesn't exist
anymore<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.930> rules<00:02:30.140> aren't<00:02:30.379> consistent<00:02:30.799> and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
anymore the rules aren't consistent and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.770 
anymore the rules aren't consistent and
you<00:02:31.250> can<00:02:31.400> just<00:02:31.519> listen<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.420> way<00:02:32.569> they
