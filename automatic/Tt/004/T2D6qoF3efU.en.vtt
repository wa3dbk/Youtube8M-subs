00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:14.119 
gigabit ethernet switch that I just got

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:18.339 
gigabit ethernet switch that I just got
I<00:00:14.480> normally<00:00:16.029> don't<00:00:17.029> like<00:00:17.240> unboxing<00:00:17.929> videos<00:00:18.230> i

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:18.349 
I normally don't like unboxing videos i

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.019 
I normally don't like unboxing videos i
think<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:18.619> kind<00:00:18.830> of<00:00:18.949> lame<00:00:19.130> but<00:00:19.160> i<00:00:19.669> couldn't

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
think the kind of lame but i couldn't

particular<00:00:23.470> switch<00:00:24.470> on<00:00:24.919> youtube<00:00:25.550> or<00:00:25.759> anywhere

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
particular switch on youtube or anywhere

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.419 
particular switch on youtube or anywhere
really<00:00:26.390> on<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:26.960> internet<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:27.980> i<00:00:28.009> thought<00:00:28.249> i'd

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
really on the internet so i thought i'd

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.530 
really on the internet so i thought i'd
just<00:00:28.460> give<00:00:28.909> a<00:00:28.939> little<00:00:29.439> quick<00:00:30.439> unboxing<00:00:30.589> video

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
just give a little quick unboxing video

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.880 
just give a little quick unboxing video
about<00:00:32.540> what<00:00:32.689> the<00:00:32.840> switch<00:00:33.050> looks<00:00:33.290> like<00:00:33.440> and

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
about what the switch looks like and

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.620 
about what the switch looks like and
what<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:34.280> comes<00:00:34.490> up<00:00:34.640> what<00:00:35.030> it<00:00:35.150> comes<00:00:35.240> with<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:35.600> i

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
what it comes up what it comes with so i

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.960 
what it comes up what it comes with so i
just<00:00:35.840> got<00:00:36.020> it<00:00:36.170> today<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:37.370> we'll<00:00:37.520> go<00:00:37.670> ahead<00:00:37.790> and

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
just got it today so we'll go ahead and

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.540 
just got it today so we'll go ahead and
open<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.540> up<00:00:38.690> here<00:00:39.080> and<00:00:39.170> see<00:00:40.040> what<00:00:40.070> it<00:00:40.340> came

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
open it up here and see what it came

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.290 
open it up here and see what it came
with<00:00:40.820> they<00:00:41.650> it's<00:00:42.650> it<00:00:43.310> came<00:00:43.640> in<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.850> lot<00:00:44.000> smaller

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
with they it's it came in a lot smaller

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.000 
with they it's it came in a lot smaller
box<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:44.810> I<00:00:44.870> thought<00:00:45.080> but<00:00:45.350> I<00:00:45.380> guess<00:00:45.590> it<00:00:45.740> is<00:00:45.800> only

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
box and I thought but I guess it is only

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.500 
box and I thought but I guess it is only
a<00:00:46.160> 16<00:00:46.490> port<00:00:48.310> Ethernet<00:00:49.310> switch<00:00:49.640> so<00:00:49.940> um<00:00:52.180> go<00:00:53.180> right

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
a 16 port Ethernet switch so um go right

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.160 
a 16 port Ethernet switch so um go right

getting started guide for all the 2800
series<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:23.450> routers<00:01:24.109> so<00:01:25.100> that's<00:01:25.280> kind<00:01:25.520> of

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
series of routers so that's kind of

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.309 
series of routers so that's kind of
handy<00:01:25.969> i<00:01:25.999> guess<00:01:28.090> this<00:01:29.090> switch<00:01:29.509> is<00:01:29.719> considered

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
handy i guess this switch is considered

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.359 
handy i guess this switch is considered
green<00:01:30.710> I<00:01:31.130> suppose<00:01:32.409> so<00:01:33.409> I'm<00:01:33.619> sure<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.039> is<00:01:34.219> what

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
green I suppose so I'm sure this is what

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.700 
green I suppose so I'm sure this is what
all<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:35.619> environmental<00:01:36.619> I<00:01:37.100> don't<00:01:37.969> even<00:01:38.060> know

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
all this environmental I don't even know

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.219 
all this environmental I don't even know
stuff<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.819> you<00:01:40.819> can<00:01:40.999> throw<00:01:41.329> away<00:01:41.569> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
stuff that you can throw away and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.679 
stuff that you can throw away and
looks<00:01:44.229> like<00:01:44.350> we<00:01:44.470> got<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.710> power<00:01:44.950> cord<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:46.479> does

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
looks like we got the power cord it does

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.499 
looks like we got the power cord it does
have<00:01:46.899> a<00:01:46.930> built-in<00:01:47.610> power<00:01:48.610> supply<00:01:49.060> which<00:01:49.360> I

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
have a built-in power supply which I

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.630 
have a built-in power supply which I
mean<00:01:49.750> it's<00:01:49.899> approach<00:01:50.290> more<00:01:50.680> of<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.890> pro<00:01:51.189> series

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
mean it's approach more of a pro series

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.399 
mean it's approach more of a pro series
small<00:01:51.939> business<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:52.570> know<00:01:52.689> managed<00:01:53.079> switch

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
small business you know managed switch

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.980 
small business you know managed switch
though<00:01:53.789> having<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.909> internal<00:01:55.479> power<00:01:55.689> supply

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
though having the internal power supply

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.050 
though having the internal power supply
is<00:01:56.259> really<00:01:56.710> nice<00:01:56.829> it<00:01:57.159> eliminates<00:01:57.610> kind<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.939> one

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
is really nice it eliminates kind of one

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.080 
is really nice it eliminates kind of one
of<00:01:58.090> those<00:01:58.320> wall<00:01:59.320> warts<00:01:59.830> with<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.789> know<00:02:00.880> some

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
of those wall warts with you know some

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.570 
of those wall warts with you know some
of<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.360> consumer-grade<00:02:02.289> stuff<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.549> know

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
of the consumer-grade stuff so you know

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.149 
of the consumer-grade stuff so you know
standard<00:02:04.149> power<00:02:04.929> cord<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.649> you<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.920> see<00:02:06.070> it

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
standard power cord and you can see it

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.930 
standard power cord and you can see it
as<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> big<00:02:06.490> old<00:02:06.990> oxygen<00:02:07.990> absorber<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.590> there

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
as a big old oxygen absorber in there

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.309 
as a big old oxygen absorber in there
looks<00:02:09.940> like<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.269> is<00:02:10.420> all<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.780> rack<00:02:10.989> mount

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
looks like this is all the rack mount

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.470 
looks like this is all the rack mount
hardware<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.099> switches<00:02:12.459> rack<00:02:12.700> mountable<00:02:13.180> so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
hardware the switches rack mountable so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.720 
hardware the switches rack mountable so
it<00:02:13.569> comes<00:02:13.720> with<00:02:13.900> your<00:02:14.050> little<00:02:14.220> square<00:02:15.220> inserts

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
it comes with your little square inserts

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.289 
it comes with your little square inserts
for<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:17.160> server<00:02:18.160> racks<00:02:18.370> with<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.730> square<00:02:19.030> I

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
for the server racks with the square I

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.590 
for the server racks with the square I
might<00:02:19.720> not<00:02:20.140> even<00:02:20.290> know<00:02:20.470> what<00:02:20.590> they're<00:02:20.739> called

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
might not even know what they're called

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.300 
might not even know what they're called
which<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.750> what<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:23.019> server<00:02:23.319> rack<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.160> has

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
which is what my server rack is it has

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.750 
which is what my server rack is it has
those<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.269> ends<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.170> rack<00:02:26.319> mount<00:02:26.760> it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
those and it ends all the rack mount it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.370 
those and it ends all the rack mount it
looks<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.299> comes<00:02:28.720> with<00:02:28.870> rack<00:02:29.110> mount

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
looks like that comes with rack mount

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.199 
looks like that comes with rack mount
screws<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.069> they<00:02:30.130> have<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> little<00:02:30.730> nylon

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
screws and they have a little nylon

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.809 
screws and they have a little nylon
washer<00:02:31.599> so<00:02:32.230> it's<00:02:32.849> insulated<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.370> let's<00:02:36.580> take<00:02:36.790> a

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
washer so it's insulated so let's take a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.070 
washer so it's insulated so let's take a
look<00:02:37.090> at<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.299> actual<00:02:38.220> switch<00:02:39.540> there's<00:02:40.540> 16

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
look at the actual switch there's 16

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.220 
look at the actual switch there's 16
ports<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:42.269> want<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.330> come<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.720> Serie<00:02:43.959> okay

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
ports I want it come to the Serie okay

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.740 
ports I want it come to the Serie okay
well<00:02:44.440> that's<00:02:44.500> nice<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.000> can<00:02:46.180> do<00:02:46.330> your<00:02:46.360> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
well that's nice so you can do your you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.569 
well that's nice so you can do your you
can<00:02:46.900> do<00:02:47.049> use<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.620> hyper<00:02:47.829> terminal<00:02:48.160> or

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
can do use like hyper terminal or

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.280 
can do use like hyper terminal or
whatever<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.090> configure<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.690> switch<00:02:49.930> if<00:02:50.170> you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
whatever and configure the switch if you

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.780 
whatever and configure the switch if you
want<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.500> go<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> manage<00:02:50.950> drought<00:02:51.340> well<00:02:51.609> that's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
want to go to manage drought well that's

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.330 
want to go to manage drought well that's
what<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.090> have<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.299> do<00:02:52.630> you<00:02:53.380> have<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.680> hyper

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
what you have to do you have to hyper

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.150 
what you have to do you have to hyper
term<00:02:54.700> in<00:02:54.820> there<00:02:55.000> or<00:02:55.239> whatever<00:02:56.010> emulator<00:02:57.010> you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
term in there or whatever emulator you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.420 
term in there or whatever emulator you
use<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.540> that<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.709> configure<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.400> and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
use so that you can configure it and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.580 
use so that you can configure it and
then<00:03:00.609> pass<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:01.090> point<00:03:01.390> what<00:03:02.019> they<00:03:02.200> have<00:03:02.440> an

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
then pass that point what they have an

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.890 
then pass that point what they have an
easy<00:03:02.829> set-up<00:03:03.160> guide<00:03:03.280> on<00:03:03.579> these<00:03:03.730> switches<00:03:04.000> and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
easy set-up guide on these switches and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.390 
easy set-up guide on these switches and
then<00:03:05.170> once<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.410> get<00:03:05.530> past<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.890> point<00:03:06.190> and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
then once you get past that point and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.430 
then once you get past that point and
sign<00:03:06.609> an<00:03:06.790> IP<00:03:06.940> address<00:03:07.120> if<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.750> do<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.079> go<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
sign an IP address if you do to go the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.229 
sign an IP address if you do to go the
managed<00:03:08.829> route<00:03:09.100> then<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.850> use<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
managed route then you just use the

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.250 
managed route then you just use the
table<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:13.120> also<00:03:13.239> comes<00:03:13.569> up<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.780> little<00:03:13.959> ears

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
table and it also comes up a little ears

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.830 
table and it also comes up a little ears
so<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.650> can<00:03:14.799> rack<00:03:15.010> mount<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.540> these<00:03:16.540> ones<00:03:16.690> are

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
so you can rack mount it these ones are

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.720 
so you can rack mount it these ones are
for<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.139> rack<00:03:17.319> mount<00:03:17.680> and<00:03:18.069> these<00:03:18.280> ones<00:03:18.549> are

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
for the rack mount and these ones are

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.360 
for the rack mount and these ones are
for<00:03:18.910> like<00:03:19.739> surface<00:03:20.739> mount<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.510> wall<00:03:22.510> mount

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370

on the side but I believe this is a

Manish<00:04:29.460> mode<00:04:29.670> and<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:29.970> think<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.510> what

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
Manish mode and I think this is a what

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.570 
Manish mode and I think this is a what
exactly<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> little<00:04:31.950> switch<00:04:32.220> or<00:04:32.430> something

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
exactly a little switch or something

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.750 
exactly a little switch or something
that<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.000> click<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.600> can<00:04:33.750> go<00:04:33.900> over<00:04:34.080> to

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
that you click and you can go over to

that you click and you can go over to
manage<00:04:35.760> mode<00:04:37.550> yeah<00:04:38.550> there's<00:04:38.760> not<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> lot<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.360> it

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.990 
manage mode yeah there's not a lot to it
it's<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.200> pretty<00:04:40.440> simple<00:04:40.650> switch<00:04:41.130> but<00:04:41.400> it's

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
it's a pretty simple switch but it's

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.320 
it's a pretty simple switch but it's
gigabit<00:04:42.600> it's<00:04:43.169> managed<00:04:43.970> or<00:04:44.970> can<00:04:45.180> run
