00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.529
 without telling us anything, he developed a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.910
 sort of story that catapults the group 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.350
 the trio towards a distant world therefore 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.599
 a fantastic adventure for all men 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.039
 childrens have hoped for one day 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.949

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.890
 our behaviors that usually 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.280
 story is about a bad crohn who gives 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 what human explained to me was 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.289
 call themselves kronos for a matter of 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.840
 rim and will be called crohn and we trio that 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.879

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.570
 planet mars conquered by this 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.760
 enemy 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.770

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.120
 first songs or even stories that you 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.769

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.450
 our friendship has brought us to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.010
 form a group that can be called 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.510
 trio can be called another way 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.640
 that can be formed by three people 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 or the future from many others 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.229
