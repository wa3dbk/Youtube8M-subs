00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.110
 and we will need apples 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.440
 morkovochka half a lemon here such here 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.370

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:43.390
 its like salted cucumber side cheese 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.640
 roquefort salad leaves a few pieces 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.159

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.129
 chopped ground beef and 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.010
 as well as a tablespoon of dried basil 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.049
 and red hot chili pepper 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:02.850

 dried basil knead the meat mixed 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.410
 lay aside until the beauty 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.600
 we take this handsome man in half 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.600
 dice come forward so my stripes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:33.010
 finely chopped and so we divide the fact in half 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.220
 in half with a flick of the wrist this 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:40.210
 the piece must be finely flattened here 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.630
 such thickness will suffice well as that 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.070
 so a little more should be meat 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.410
 roasted and will be pore now now 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.030

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.050
 the action inside is now a little bit needed 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.110
 freeze to keep her 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.270

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.780
 stuffing 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.420
 it is necessary to finely chop cabbage 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.510
 subtly thin if you have a special 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.400

 half a tablespoon of sugar more precisely salt 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.440

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.650
 sugar we knead the whole thing 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.380

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.250
 inedible on three apples on 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.170
