00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.060
 last week that today and we're going to 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.730
 work the lateral steps and for that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.090
 we have a surprise we come to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 visit the cross laura gym 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.130
 barceló good laura we are delighted to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 that you are here and you know what we have to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 do today today we have to do the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.880
 lateral steps to the left side 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 I know this is for you tontxu for 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.000
 you 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.649
 then we will not entertain more 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.969
 at the time of the classroom is ready and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.760
 really want if we are not going to spend 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.750
 inside the gym to see how the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.360
 side steps and today we work the step 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.370
 lateral to the left side first 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 explain that there are two types of steps 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 laterals may not be dynamic and 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.800
 it could be static it could be without 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.989
 move the left foot 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.710
 the one that we're going to work with and we're going to 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.420
 impact the left lateral step today 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.420
 shifting the foot out looking 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 an angle and turning on ourselves 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.110
 we see the aura as it does 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.600
 wonderfully we like it 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.470
 work that this side step with 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.729
 displacement of foot work it on 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.800
 an attack of the aura the 12 crochet and from 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.159
 there after the blow or move the foot 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.340
 and turn and look for another type of angle 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.880
 It would be convenient to end a coup 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.410
 left up because to entertain 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.060
 to the rival 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.369
 that is in this case we are working 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.470
 with a new crochet where we see how 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.990
 we take the foot to get out of the line and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.020
 stay in another angle and from there 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.899
 cross our right straight too 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.789
 could be done in a movement of 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.580
 dodge as we see how he is doing 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:02.520
 now laura with kiko on hit from kiko 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:06.790
 how at the same time he takes the step and as a logy 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.070
 the aura barceló is the current champion of 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.840
