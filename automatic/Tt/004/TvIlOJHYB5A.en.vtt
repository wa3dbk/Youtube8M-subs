00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.050 
doing a comparison of these two consoles
would<00:01:58.110> necessarily<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.740> fair<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.850> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
would necessarily be fair and also that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.569 
would necessarily be fair and also that
isn't<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.540> much<00:02:00.659> information<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> go<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.579> but

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
isn't that much information to go on but

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.399 
isn't that much information to go on but

ported across from one console to
another<00:05:15.349> it'll<00:05:16.129> mean<00:05:16.279> that<00:05:16.430> all<00:05:16.550> these<00:05:16.729> games

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:19.029 
another it'll mean that all these games
have<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.240> much<00:05:17.449> similar<00:05:17.990> feel<00:05:18.439> and<00:05:18.710> experience

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.450 
is designed on PC it won't feel a little
bit<00:05:23.659> flawed<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.259> a<00:05:24.349> little<00:05:24.589> bit<00:05:24.710> flat<00:05:25.069> when<00:05:25.370> it

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
bit flawed and a little bit flat when it

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.309 
bit flawed and a little bit flat when it
moves<00:05:25.610> across<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:25.909> console<00:05:26.539> so<00:05:27.050> what<00:05:27.199> does

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
moves across the console so what does

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.019 
moves across the console so what does
this<00:05:27.409> mean<00:05:27.620> for<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.009> next<00:05:28.310> generation<00:05:28.879> of

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:29.029 
this mean for the next generation of

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:31.300 
this mean for the next generation of
battlefield<00:05:29.629> well<00:05:30.229> hopefully<00:05:30.409> battlefield

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
battlefield well hopefully battlefield

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.369 
battlefield well hopefully battlefield
will<00:05:31.580> seem<00:05:31.849> like<00:05:32.029> a<00:05:32.180> more<00:05:32.479> unified<00:05:33.080> game

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
will seem like a more unified game

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.980 
will seem like a more unified game
across<00:05:33.740> consoles<00:05:34.310> on<00:05:34.490> battlefield<00:05:35.240> 4<00:05:35.539> than<00:05:35.900> it

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
across consoles on battlefield 4 than it

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.200 
across consoles on battlefield 4 than it
does<00:05:36.139> with<00:05:36.289> battlefield<00:05:36.800> 3<00:05:37.099> as<00:05:37.310> we<00:05:37.939> all<00:05:38.060> know

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
does with battlefield 3 as we all know

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.329 
does with battlefield 3 as we all know
now<00:05:38.389> playing<00:05:38.810> battlefield<00:05:39.259> on<00:05:39.379> PlayStation<00:05:40.009> 3

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:40.339 
now playing battlefield on PlayStation 3

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.040 
now playing battlefield on PlayStation 3
is<00:05:40.639> a<00:05:40.699> very<00:05:41.060> different<00:05:41.509> experience<00:05:41.599> to

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
is a very different experience to

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.529 
is a very different experience to
playing<00:05:42.379> it<00:05:42.500> on<00:05:42.589> the<00:05:42.710> pc<00:05:43.060> larger<00:05:44.060> servers

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
playing it on the pc larger servers

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.200 
playing it on the pc larger servers
larger<00:05:45.020> Maps<00:05:45.259> larger<00:05:45.860> play<00:05:46.129> accounts<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:47.060> this

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
larger Maps larger play accounts so this

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.610 
larger Maps larger play accounts so this
is<00:05:47.330> a<00:05:47.360> kind<00:05:47.539> of<00:05:47.599> thing<00:05:47.779> that<00:05:47.810> hopefully<00:05:48.379> when

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
is a kind of thing that hopefully when

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.139 
is a kind of thing that hopefully when
we<00:05:48.710> move<00:05:48.830> across<00:05:49.039> to<00:05:49.339> the<00:05:49.430> next<00:05:49.669> generation<00:05:50.089> of

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:50.149 
we move across to the next generation of

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.059 
we move across to the next generation of
consoles<00:05:50.599> on<00:05:50.839> the<00:05:51.229> next<00:05:51.500> generation<00:05:51.949> of

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:52.069 
consoles on the next generation of

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.100 
consoles on the next generation of
battlefield<00:05:52.610> this<00:05:53.360> will<00:05:53.569> be<00:05:53.689> a<00:05:53.719> much<00:05:53.899> more

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
battlefield this will be a much more

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.079 
battlefield this will be a much more
unified<00:05:54.589> game<00:05:54.889> that<00:05:55.099> has<00:05:55.189> a<00:05:55.219> you<00:05:55.699> know<00:05:55.819> a<00:05:55.849> much

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:56.089 
unified game that has a you know a much

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.510 
unified game that has a you know a much
more<00:05:56.300> unified<00:05:56.839> feel<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:57.500> signature<00:05:58.250> to<00:05:58.399> it

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
more unified feel and signature to it

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.159 
more unified feel and signature to it
rather<00:05:58.969> than<00:05:59.120> moving<00:05:59.449> across<00:05:59.689> from<00:05:59.960> one

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169

battlefield<00:06:05.960> will<00:06:06.229> also<00:06:06.620> be<00:06:06.800> very<00:06:06.979> helpful

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:07.279 
battlefield will also be very helpful

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.339

for<00:06:07.639> the<00:06:07.729> developers<00:06:08.210> now<00:06:08.870> with<00:06:09.020> battlefield

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
for the developers now with battlefield

for the developers now with battlefield
3<00:06:09.860> we<00:06:10.099> saw<00:06:10.279> issues<00:06:10.639> that<00:06:10.789> only<00:06:10.939> affected<00:06:11.389> the

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:16.909 
developers had to individually try and

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:18.490 
developers had to individually try and
rectify<00:06:17.060> all<00:06:17.539> of<00:06:17.689> these<00:06:17.779> problems<00:06:18.050> for

rectify all of these problems for

rectify all of these problems for

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.940 
are going to be seeing on the next gen
consoles<00:07:05.330> is<00:07:05.510> it<00:07:05.960> going<00:07:06.080> to<00:07:06.140> be<00:07:06.230> similar<00:07:06.440> to<00:07:06.530> pc

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
consoles is it going to be similar to pc

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.640 
consoles is it going to be similar to pc
with<00:07:07.520> maybe<00:07:07.730> 64<00:07:08.270> players<00:07:08.600> and<00:07:08.870> over<00:07:09.080> 60<00:07:09.440> frames

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:09.650 
with maybe 64 players and over 60 frames

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.770 
with maybe 64 players and over 60 frames
per<00:07:09.740> second<00:07:10.160> we<00:07:10.490> don't<00:07:10.640> know<00:07:10.850> now<00:07:11.540> personally

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
per second we don't know now personally

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.080 
per second we don't know now personally
I<00:07:12.050> think<00:07:12.170> it<00:07:12.500> will<00:07:12.650> have<00:07:12.920> 60<00:07:13.280> players<00:07:13.550> but<00:07:14.000> it

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090 
I think it will have 60 players but it

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.000 
I think it will have 60 players but it
will<00:07:14.240> have<00:07:14.420> that<00:07:14.570> a<00:07:14.630> forfeit<00:07:15.380> of<00:07:15.410> only<00:07:15.680> 30

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.010 
will have that a forfeit of only 30

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.860 
will have that a forfeit of only 30
frames<00:07:16.400> per<00:07:16.490> second<00:07:16.910> still<00:07:17.090> but<00:07:17.630> that's<00:07:17.750> just

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870 
frames per second still but that's just

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.570 
frames per second still but that's just
