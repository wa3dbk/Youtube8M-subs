00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.240
 My lover is very witty 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.880
 She giggled at the funeral 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.740
 Despite knowing that everyone objected 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.960
 I should have worshiped her earlier 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.760
 If heaven has ever spoken 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.720
 She is the real spokesperson 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.380
 Every Sunday is gradually becoming cold 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.100
 Every week there is an extra dose of poison 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.080
 "We are born sickly" 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.040
 I heard them say it! 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.720
 The church where I did not preach any truth 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.580
 She told me: "Please worship in the bedroom" 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.580
 The only paradise I will be sent 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680
 It's when I'm alone with you 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.480
 I was born sick 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.380
 But I like that 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.840
 Order me to be a "good" person 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.960
 Take me to the church 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.760
 I will worship like a dog 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.740
 Temple place of your lies 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.500
 I told my sins 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.600
 And then you can sharpen the knife 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.420
 Give me immortal death 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.740
 Thank goodness, let me give you my life. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.320
 Take me to the church 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.220
 I will worship like a dog 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.040
 Temple place of your lies 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.820
 I told my sins 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.000
 And then you can sharpen the knife 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.840
 Give me immortal death 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.680
 Thank goodness, let me give you my life. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.380
 Suppose I was a pagan of a good time 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.260
 Then my lover is the sun 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.140
 To keep the goddess beside me 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.120
 She requires a sacrifice 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.880
 To drain the entire ocean 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.880
 Get something bright 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.800
 Something meaty for the main meal 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.560
 It was a very tall and beautiful horse 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.420
 What do you have in the barn? 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.460
 We are hungry for faith 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.180
 Looks delicious 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.040
 Looks so much 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.140
 This is a hungry job 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.220
 Take me to the church 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.200
 I will worship like a dog 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.960
 Temple place of your lies 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.820
 I told my sins 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.800
 And then you can sharpen the knife 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.660
 Give me immortal death 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.100
 Thank goodness, let me give you my life. 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.680
 Take me to the church 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.440
 I will worship like a dog 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.420
 Temple place of your lies 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.100
 I told my sins 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.220
 And then you can sharpen the knife 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.060
 Give me immortal death 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.440
 Thank goodness, let me give you my life. 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.600
 There is no saint or king 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.400
 When the ceremony begins 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.340
 There is no sweet innocence 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.760
 More than our sins 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.760
 In madness and dirty 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 Of that sadly mundane world 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.660
 Only then was I a human being 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.500
 It was only then that I was completely clean 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 Take me to the church 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.800
 I will worship like a dog 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.780
 Temple place of your lies 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.500
 I told my sins 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.580
 And then you can sharpen the knife 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.260
 Give me immortal death 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.500
 Thank goodness, let me give you my life. 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.220
 Take me to the church 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.340
 I will worship like a dog 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.160
 Temple place of your lies 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.780
 I told my sins 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.720
 And then you can sharpen the knife 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.640
 Give me immortal death 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.040
 Thank goodness, let me give you my life.
