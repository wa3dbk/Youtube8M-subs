we're<00:04:30.510> going<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.960> second<00:04:31.350> incident<00:04:31.560> I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
we're going to see the second incident I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.110 
we're going to see the second incident I
think<00:04:32.160> there<00:04:32.280> must<00:04:32.370> be<00:04:32.550> some<00:04:32.700> oil<00:04:32.880> down<00:04:33.060> there

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
think there must be some oil down there

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.290 
think there must be some oil down there
because<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.840> way<00:04:34.170> they<00:04:34.350> were<00:04:34.440> look<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:38.300> think

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
because the way they were look I think

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.090 
because the way they were look I think
there<00:04:39.750> was<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> blue<00:04:40.200> light<00:04:40.440> from<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.740> original

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
there was a blue light from the original

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.800 
there was a blue light from the original

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
Cushman back onto the track and then

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.420 
Cushman back onto the track and then
dribbled<00:04:43.260> something<00:04:43.680> onto<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.220> track

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
dribbled something onto the track

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.580 
dribbled something onto the track
because<00:04:44.940> that<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.360> for<00:04:45.780> sure<00:04:45.990> something<00:04:46.350> on

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
because that is for sure something on

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.070 
because that is for sure something on
the<00:04:46.680> circuit<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:47.820> mean<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.420> marshals<00:04:48.930> have

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
the circuit and I mean the marshals have

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.750 
the circuit and I mean the marshals have
a<00:04:49.170> difficult<00:04:49.620> job<00:04:49.650> it's<00:04:49.860> their<00:04:50.070> job<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.400> see<00:04:50.700> if
