00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
back to the sequencer just gonna pull it

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.090 
back to the sequencer just gonna pull it
up<00:04:29.770> standalone<00:04:30.280> by<00:04:30.460> itself<00:04:30.490> again<00:04:31.090> and<00:04:32.100> you

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100

up standalone by itself again and you
see<00:04:33.280> here<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.880> basically<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.330> here

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
see here what you basically have here

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.950 
see here what you basically have here
are<00:04:34.690> three<00:04:34.990> rows<00:04:35.169> they're<00:04:35.590> all<00:04:35.740> identical<00:04:36.130> and

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
are three rows they're all identical and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.140 
are three rows they're all identical and
you<00:04:37.960> have<00:04:38.199> your<00:04:38.650> filter<00:04:39.130> feedback<00:04:39.370> time<00:04:39.789> you

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
you have your filter feedback time you

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.820 
you have your filter feedback time you
do<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.389> in<00:04:40.510> steps<00:04:41.850> easy<00:04:42.850> to<00:04:43.120> understand<00:04:43.830> you

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.500 
milliseconds you have line one feedback
you<00:05:01.300> have<00:05:01.600> your<00:05:01.960> pre<00:05:02.199> filters<00:05:03.180> or<00:05:04.180> you<00:05:04.300> can<00:05:04.419> go

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
you have your pre filters or you can go

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.960 
you have your pre filters or you can go
pre<00:05:04.720> filter<00:05:04.930> our<00:05:05.139> first<00:05:05.380> filter<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.740> mean<00:05:05.970> and

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
pre filter our first filter I mean and

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.730 
pre filter our first filter I mean and
this<00:05:07.449> is<00:05:07.570> actually<00:05:07.840> cool<00:05:07.990> when<00:05:08.229> you<00:05:08.380> deal<00:05:08.710> with

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
this is actually cool when you deal with

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.040 
this is actually cool when you deal with
the<00:05:08.889> LFO<00:05:09.400> s<00:05:09.460> on<00:05:09.699> the<00:05:09.789> bottom<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.720> can<00:05:10.900> actually

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
the LFO s on the bottom you can actually

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.800 
the LFO s on the bottom you can actually
choose<00:05:11.380> a<00:05:11.410> source<00:05:11.770> LFO<00:05:12.370> for<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.940> filter<00:05:13.330> so

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
choose a source LFO for the filter so

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.409 
choose a source LFO for the filter so
you<00:05:13.900> choose<00:05:14.080> up<00:05:14.289> source<00:05:14.770> one<00:05:14.949> two<00:05:15.220> or<00:05:15.430> three<00:05:15.789> to

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
you choose up source one two or three to

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.029 
you choose up source one two or three to
go<00:05:16.539> with<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.840> three<00:05:17.080> LFO<00:05:17.530> s<00:05:17.590> that<00:05:17.800> you<00:05:17.889> have

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
go with the three LFO s that you have

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.180 
go with the three LFO s that you have
her<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.220> the<00:05:18.430> bottom<00:05:19.770> of<00:05:20.770> course<00:05:20.919> you<00:05:21.039> have

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
her on the bottom of course you have

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.400 
her on the bottom of course you have
their<00:05:21.310> filter<00:05:21.639> envelope<00:05:21.930> your<00:05:22.930> LFO<00:05:23.380> a

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
their filter envelope your LFO a

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.839 
their filter envelope your LFO a
mountain<00:05:23.919> how<00:05:24.010> much<00:05:24.130> LFO<00:05:24.460> do<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.639> want<00:05:24.760> to

then<00:05:43.720> again<00:05:43.960> on<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.110> output<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.800> can<00:05:45.010> work

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
then again on the output you can work

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.490 
then again on the output you can work
the<00:05:45.970> LFO<00:05:46.330> again<00:05:46.599> from<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.900> sound<00:05:47.110> source<00:05:47.139> one

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
the LFO again from the sound source one

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.439 
the LFO again from the sound source one
two<00:05:47.650> or<00:05:47.770> three<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.370> then<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.970> have<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.150> pan

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
two or three and then you have a pan

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.750 
two or three and then you have a pan
knob<00:05:49.750> so<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.020> can<00:05:50.199> actually<00:05:50.580> rent<00:05:51.580> out<00:05:51.729> a

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
knob so you can actually rent out a

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.779 
knob so you can actually rent out a
modulation<00:05:52.449> on<00:05:52.690> the<00:05:52.840> pan<00:05:53.080> itself<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:54.610> have<00:05:54.639> a

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789 
modulation on the pan itself you have a

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.330 
modulation on the pan itself you have a
ducking<00:05:55.210> knob<00:05:55.419> on<00:05:55.840> top<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.740> master

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
ducking knob on top and the master

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.790 
ducking knob on top and the master
controls<00:05:57.729> with<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.419> mix<00:05:58.690> on<00:05:59.050> wet/dry<00:05:59.260> fader

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
controls with the mix on wet/dry fader

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.290 
controls with the mix on wet/dry fader
which<00:06:00.010> is<00:06:00.159> always<00:06:00.340> good<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.639> have<00:06:00.880> if<00:06:01.210> you're

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
which is always good to have if you're

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.360 
which is always good to have if you're
gonna<00:06:01.449> use<00:06:01.659> this<00:06:01.750> as<00:06:01.900> an<00:06:02.020> insert<00:06:02.440> if<00:06:03.220> you're

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
gonna use this as an insert if you're

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.890 
gonna use this as an insert if you're
gonna<00:06:03.460> use<00:06:03.639> it<00:06:03.789> as<00:06:03.880> an<00:06:04.000> optional<00:06:04.419> of<00:06:04.599> course<00:06:04.659> I

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
gonna use it as an optional of course I

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.960 
gonna use it as an optional of course I
just<00:06:04.930> leave<00:06:05.229> it<00:06:05.260> at<00:06:05.440> 100<00:06:05.740> that's<00:06:06.610> just<00:06:06.789> mean

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
just leave it at 100 that's just mean

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.510 
just leave it at 100 that's just mean
you<00:06:07.630> have<00:06:07.810> a<00:06:07.870> pan<00:06:08.169> position<00:06:08.680> master<00:06:09.159> pan<00:06:09.340> and

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
you have a pan position master pan and

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.339 
you have a pan position master pan and
then<00:06:09.610> master<00:06:09.940> volume<00:06:10.150> the<00:06:10.840> bottom<00:06:11.169> two

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
then master volume the bottom two

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.620 
then master volume the bottom two
channels<00:06:11.800> are<00:06:12.699> exactly<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.240> same<00:06:13.419> as<00:06:13.539> the

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
channels are exactly the same as the

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.659 
channels are exactly the same as the
first<00:06:13.870> and<00:06:14.440> then<00:06:14.860> you<00:06:14.949> have<00:06:14.979> three<00:06:15.370> separate

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
first and then you have three separate

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.149 
first and then you have three separate
LFO<00:06:16.090> so<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.599> have<00:06:16.780> your<00:06:16.960> basic<00:06:17.289> waveforms

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
LFO so you have your basic waveforms

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.560 
LFO so you have your basic waveforms
your<00:06:18.639> LFO<00:06:19.030> rate<00:06:19.150> so<00:06:19.510> our<00:06:19.599> fashion<00:06:19.930> with<00:06:20.050> LFO

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
your LFO rate so our fashion with LFO

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.800 
your LFO rate so our fashion with LFO
and<00:06:20.990> then<00:06:21.620> of<00:06:21.710> course<00:06:21.770> tempo<00:06:22.220> sync<00:06:22.570> yeah<00:06:23.570> that

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
and then of course tempo sync yeah that

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.510 
and then of course tempo sync yeah that
three<00:06:23.990> times<00:06:24.170> and<00:06:24.530> then<00:06:24.980> you<00:06:25.130> have<00:06:25.310> more

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
three times and then you have more

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.760 
three times and then you have more
global<00:06:25.940> controls<00:06:26.360> where<00:06:27.110> you<00:06:27.140> can<00:06:27.470> run<00:06:27.650> these

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
global controls where you can run these

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.820 
global controls where you can run these
in<00:06:27.920> parallel<00:06:28.100> combo<00:06:28.760> or<00:06:29.000> serial<00:06:29.540> you<00:06:30.530> can

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
in parallel combo or serial you can

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.610 
in parallel combo or serial you can
drive<00:06:31.550> the<00:06:31.730> input<00:06:31.880> of<00:06:32.120> course<00:06:32.150> have<00:06:33.140> a<00:06:33.170> global

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
drive the input of course have a global

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.880 
drive the input of course have a global
feedback<00:06:34.070> I'm<00:06:34.280> a<00:06:34.310> global<00:06:34.580> LFO<00:06:35.120> if<00:06:35.240> you<00:06:35.360> want<00:06:35.890> so

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
feedback I'm a global LFO if you want so

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.220 
feedback I'm a global LFO if you want so
it's<00:06:37.040> a<00:06:37.160> really<00:06:37.640> really<00:06:38.090> deep<00:06:38.330> well<00:06:38.810> thought

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
it's a really really deep well thought

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.040 
it's a really really deep well thought
out<00:06:39.260> back<00:06:39.740> extension<00:06:40.280> I<00:06:40.460> really<00:06:41.360> really<00:06:41.810> like

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
out back extension I really really like

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.280 
out back extension I really really like
this<00:06:42.880> it's<00:06:43.880> actually<00:06:44.510> like<00:06:44.690> I<00:06:44.810> said<00:06:44.990> I<00:06:45.020> don't

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
this it's actually like I said I don't

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.880 
this it's actually like I said I don't
generally<00:06:45.560> buy<00:06:45.860> effects<00:06:46.730> rack<00:06:47.030> extensions

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:47.890 
generally buy effects rack extensions

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.620 
generally buy effects rack extensions
but<00:06:48.890> I<00:06:49.040> think<00:06:49.580> I<00:06:49.700> might<00:06:50.030> actually<00:06:50.090> buy<00:06:50.570> this

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
but I think I might actually buy this

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.690 
but I think I might actually buy this
island<00:06:50.930> bought<00:06:51.230> a<00:06:51.260> rack<00:06:51.500> extension<00:06:52.100> and<00:06:52.280> quite
