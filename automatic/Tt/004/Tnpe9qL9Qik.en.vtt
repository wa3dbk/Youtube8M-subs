tulips using play-doh and here's the
first<00:00:15.290> caller<00:00:15.679> i<00:00:16.070> chose<00:00:17.109> as<00:00:18.109> usual<00:00:18.650> we<00:00:18.949> roll

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
first caller i chose as usual we roll

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.710 
first caller i chose as usual we roll
out<00:00:19.310> to<00:00:19.490> Plato<00:00:19.760> first<00:00:25.000> so<00:00:26.000> let's<00:00:26.029> make<00:00:26.449> our

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
out to Plato first so let's make our

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.750 
out to Plato first so let's make our
tulip<00:00:27.109> flowers<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.949> let's<00:00:28.189> make<00:00:28.430> them<00:00:28.640> a

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
tulip flowers and let's make them a

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.290 
tulip flowers and let's make them a
little<00:00:28.880> bigger<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:29.980> we<00:00:30.980> can<00:00:31.189> practice<00:00:31.429> and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
little bigger so we can practice and

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:41.280 
little bigger so we can practice and
just<00:00:33.250> kind<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.340> do<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:37.000> semi-circle<00:00:39.309> here<00:00:40.309> and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
just kind of do a semi-circle here and

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.560 
just kind of do a semi-circle here and
then<00:00:42.290> at<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.040> top<00:00:43.070> for<00:00:43.579> the<00:00:43.610> petals<00:00:44.120> we<00:00:44.420> need

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
then at the top for the petals we need

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:55.650 
then at the top for the petals we need
to<00:00:44.719> create<00:00:44.930> about<00:00:45.230> three<00:00:46.180> three<00:00:47.180> panels

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.420 

let's<00:00:56.660> try<00:00:56.960> to<00:00:57.080> see<00:00:57.530> what<00:00:57.830> we<00:00:58.010> got<00:00:58.220> here

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.540 

okay<00:01:06.170> that's<00:01:07.170> our<00:01:07.500> first<00:01:07.800> to<00:01:08.070> live<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
okay that's our first to live but I

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.280 
okay that's our first to live but I
think<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.570> better<00:01:11.870> let's<00:01:12.870> try<00:01:13.050> one

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
think we can do better let's try one

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:41.460 
think we can do better let's try one
more

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.010 

all<00:01:42.470> right<00:01:42.680> it<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.760> coming<00:01:44.180> out<00:01:44.330> older<00:01:44.810> butter

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
all right it is coming out older butter

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.890 
all right it is coming out older butter
so<00:01:45.650> let's<00:01:45.830> make<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> few<00:01:46.400> other<00:01:46.520> colors<00:01:47.000> I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.480 

rolled<00:01:50.900> out<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.290> play-doh<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.890> little<00:01:52.250> thinner

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
rolled out of play-doh a little thinner

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.120 
rolled out of play-doh a little thinner
and<00:01:53.150> I'm<00:01:53.240> going<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.600> cut<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:54.110> straight<00:01:54.770> edge<00:01:57.130> for

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
and I'm going to cut a straight edge for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.830 
and I'm going to cut a straight edge for
we're<00:01:58.340> dumb<00:01:59.440> the<00:02:00.440> petals<00:02:00.860> are<00:02:01.040> going<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.310> start

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
we're dumb the petals are going to start

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:20.530 
we're dumb the petals are going to start
let's<00:02:02.840> see<00:02:03.110> how<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.560> is<00:02:03.620> going<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:04.010> work<00:02:04.100> out

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.140 

and<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.520> our<00:02:24.530> yellow<00:02:25.530> tulip<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.310> think<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
and here is our yellow tulip I think it

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:42.890 
and here is our yellow tulip I think it
looks<00:02:27.180> much<00:02:27.510> better

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.080 

so<00:02:43.900> here<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.319> have<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:45.069> lilac<00:02:45.670> or<00:02:45.970> purple

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
so here we have the lilac or purple

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.500 
so here we have the lilac or purple
play-doh<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:48.400> want<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.670> try<00:02:48.879> it<00:02:48.909> something

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
play-doh and I want to try it something

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.809 
play-doh and I want to try it something
just<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.989> little<00:02:50.019> bit<00:02:50.349> different<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.860> time

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.170 

after<00:02:54.819> making<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.500> semicircle<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:58.420> create

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
after making the semicircle and I create

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.599 
after making the semicircle and I create
the<00:03:01.180> paddles<00:03:01.659> I<00:03:01.840> want<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.290> try<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:03.040> do<00:03:03.430> the

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
the paddles I want to try and do the

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.839 
the paddles I want to try and do the
side<00:03:03.940> panels<00:03:04.569> first<00:03:05.109> and<00:03:05.620> see<00:03:06.190> if<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.519> will

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
side panels first and see if that will

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:19.430 
side panels first and see if that will
help<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:08.129> making<00:03:09.129> a<00:03:09.310> more<00:03:09.819> beautiful<00:03:11.340> tulip

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.039 

here's<00:03:20.440> our<00:03:20.680> to<00:03:20.889> flower<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.870> little<00:03:22.870> better

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
here's our to flower a little better

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.129 
here's our to flower a little better
maybe<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:24.430> let's<00:03:25.000> flag<00:03:25.299> will<00:03:25.510> practice<00:03:25.900> more

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
maybe but let's flag will practice more

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.039 
maybe but let's flag will practice more
and<00:03:26.170> get<00:03:26.470> more<00:03:26.500> flowers<00:03:27.480> okay<00:03:28.480> our<00:03:28.599> final

and get more flowers okay our final
caller<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.680> here's<00:03:30.579> what<00:03:30.790> I<00:03:30.819> noticed<00:03:31.329> in

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
caller and here's what I noticed in

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.110 
caller and here's what I noticed in
order<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.620> make<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:32.889> tulips<00:03:33.310> more

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
order to make the tulips more

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.069 
order to make the tulips more
symmetrical<00:03:35.669> this<00:03:36.669> first<00:03:37.090> part<00:03:37.540> the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
symmetrical this first part the

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.479 
symmetrical this first part the
semicircle<00:03:38.889> needs<00:03:39.099> to<00:03:39.370> be<00:03:40.680> more<00:03:41.680> symmetrical

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
semicircle needs to be more symmetrical

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.710 
semicircle needs to be more symmetrical
itself<00:03:44.129> so<00:03:45.129> if<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.459> try<00:03:45.819> to<00:03:45.849> make<00:03:46.180> sure<00:03:46.209> that

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
itself so if I try to make sure that

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.580 
itself so if I try to make sure that
that's<00:03:47.280> more<00:03:48.280> symmetrical<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.989> tulips<00:03:50.410> look

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
that's more symmetrical the tulips look

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:58.590 
that's more symmetrical the tulips look
better

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:17.190 

let's<00:03:59.230> make<00:03:59.470> some<00:03:59.710> steps<00:04:00.040> for<00:04:00.310> them<00:04:00.490> now<00:04:16.200> maybe

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
let's make some steps for them now maybe

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.430 
let's make some steps for them now maybe
we<00:04:17.410> should<00:04:18.239> make<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.270> a<00:04:19.600> little<00:04:19.720> tender<00:04:20.260> as

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
we should make this a little tender as

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:31.740 
we should make this a little tender as
well<00:04:20.770> we<00:04:21.459> can<00:04:21.640> get<00:04:21.790> two<00:04:21.970> stands<00:04:22.390> out<00:04:22.510> of<00:04:22.660> it

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:43.719 

this<00:04:32.750> looks<00:04:32.990> better

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.360
