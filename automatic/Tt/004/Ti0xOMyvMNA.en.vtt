00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.539
 everything I have Peruvian but until the 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:23.160
 2012 nothing of 2013 everything I had until 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.990
 2012 and let's start with the beginning with 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.330
 spider-man 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.130
 that is good when it was launched and like 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.130
 people got excited and it was over 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.000
 fast and that's what reposted 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.820
 to reprint but this is the first 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.910
 Print 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.840
 and we see with being little coast a single 50 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.830
 more coupon and 255 fine for you but what 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.550
 It will be more 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.550
 thinner 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:59.160
 number 3 this lion in 2008 number 4 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:04.080
 fifteen 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.080
 and when you discover interest 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.940
 from there we went back to number one 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.030
 12 number 3 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.030
 4 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.030
 5 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.810
 17 among your walks walks as a fill 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.729
 because it will be nice short number 8 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.729
 to protest and in low 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.159
 number 9 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.159
 number 10 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:49.150
 number two is good because a special 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.210
 of the twin towers was very cool and 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.440
 a as a supplement or an addition to 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.460
 obama president 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.920
 just when obama is president by 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.549
 first time in 2008 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.550
 and cool victory is short 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.570
 stuffed with it 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.300
 let's follow the other one that I managed to get 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.840
 firm peter davies in the last year in 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.170
 2012 was here 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.550
 in which there is also the second 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.670
 and the third 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:31.060
 pitifully he signed me with red down 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.060
 good exported red do not have much 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.060
 white or black 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.060
 let's continue with the other 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.170
 well this was very interesting but very 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.970
 long there are also when more in 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.800
 spider-man additive emotion will sleep 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.900
 Sword material and twinned one event 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.990
 spectacular new but the next day 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.990
 a cat received that field and revived 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:05.880
 and how it came out stronger and then we continue 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.390
 with god and bill ward I interviewed 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.030
 spider-man with the costume that ironman creates 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.230
 that never again the curious thing of his life does not 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.240
 we know why 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.170
 It's not too late if we know 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:22.050
 then we come with civil war 1 fire 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.030
 maintains equality or palm 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.370
 spider-man 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.760
 4 of spider 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.019
 or 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.870
 and 6 I do not know what happened to the 7 I'm 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.840
 sure I had it but it disappeared 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.030
 it was lost I have no good idea after 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.159
 of this stop buying a good time 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.829
 like two years but today I have several in 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:50.060
 reality and it comes with spider-man and they are 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.060
 black january returns 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.780
 good money 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.480
 and this with a lot of festive people who 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.360
 like to save the aunt mail 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.599
 erased the memories for the menu and not 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.500
 would exist was never married to bear and 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:12.519
 nobody ever knows what peter parker is 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.519
 40 years 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:20.109
 and here was when I came back strongly with 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:22.859
 2012 american spider-man are the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.859
 beings that com 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.370
 I'm surprised to see so many types of 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.370
 the green 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:44.520
 here ends the 31 the 600 that we what 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:48.180
 mutilated three parts of taking out a name 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.400
 of his mask treated three cheap 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:54.090
 and the powders that they did not even give us 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.610
 a cover to the truth cover the 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.670
 main although at least they gave 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.420
 this one of romita father who is cool 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:09.610
 and until 2012 ended here until the 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:12.280
 601 as berman for that year 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.759
 now let's continue with the second thing that he published 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.759
 but 21 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.500
 these are women 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.260
 so we will have continuity what happens 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.800
 they only take short stories of exxon 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.229
 I think it would be a 24-21 but I 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.300
 I held the first twelve because 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:57.289
 remember that a time stop buying 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.930
 comics in the time of malote in the 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.990
 danger room becomes bad and is a 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.540
 kill people many things 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.570
 in the balls that more like ex 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.170
 while he was given wolverine's enemy 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:15.670
 state that they were six numbers gave us 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.670
 in three numbers but also 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.219
 new member of the project remembered 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:24.079
 and then comes the people without this 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:28.149
 direct continuation that were also 

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:28.149
 six numbers I had in 3 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.650
 well this does the first part of 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.690
 video because if they do not last long I'm not going to 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.400
 improve a lot in uploading them in the 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:43.360
 next video we will see for others 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.360
 how
