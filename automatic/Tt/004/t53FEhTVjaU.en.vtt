320 gigs of hard drive so what I'm going

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.369 
320 gigs of hard drive so what I'm going
to<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.000> pretty<00:00:51.239> much<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.539> few<00:00:51.870> tests

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
to do is I'm pretty much in a few tests

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.790 
to do is I'm pretty much in a few tests
and<00:00:52.590> see<00:00:52.800> which<00:00:53.129> was<00:00:53.340> faster<00:00:54.140> obviously<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.379> Mac

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and see which was faster obviously I Mac

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.830 
and see which was faster obviously I Mac
it's<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.370> much<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.579> faster<00:00:56.940> than

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it's going to be much more faster than

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.869 
it's going to be much more faster than
sets<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.260> quad<00:00:58.500> core<00:00:58.739> machine<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.340> more

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
sets a quad core machine it's more

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
sets a quad core machine it's more
powerful<00:01:00.260> but<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.649> give<00:01:01.680> me<00:01:01.949> some<00:01:02.160> sort

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
powerful but just to give me some sort

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.340 
powerful but just to give me some sort
of<00:01:02.399> indication<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.090> head<00:01:03.480> much<00:01:03.719> faster

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
of indication as to head much faster

the first test is going to be a bit of

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.750 
the first test is going to be a bit of
test<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:09.750> loads<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.080> faster

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the macbook pro loaded up much faster

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.220 
the macbook pro loaded up much faster
than<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.300> mark

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
than now you mark

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.440 
than now you mark
now<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.099> may<00:02:12.280> be<00:02:12.310> wondering<00:02:12.459> what<00:02:13.269> is<00:02:13.300> a

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
now you may be wondering what is a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.690 
now you may be wondering what is a
scream<00:02:13.810> difference<00:02:14.260> between<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.800> 13<00:02:15.010> inch<00:02:15.310> on

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
scream difference between the 13 inch on

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.059 
scream difference between the 13 inch on
the<00:02:16.090> quad<00:02:16.330> core<00:02:16.659> it's<00:02:17.349> quite<00:02:17.590> simple<00:02:17.650> really

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
the quad core it's quite simple really

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.899 
the quad core it's quite simple really
if<00:02:19.030> we<00:02:19.209> take<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.450> look<00:02:19.599> at<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.870> as<00:02:20.140> roughly<00:02:20.980> 3

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
if we take a look at this as roughly 3

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.170 
if we take a look at this as roughly 3
watts<00:02:22.209> one<00:02:22.569> screen<00:02:22.959> or<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:24.909> want<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.120> be

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
watts one screen or if you want to be

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.680 
watts one screen or if you want to be
exact<00:02:25.480> once<00:02:25.930> clean<00:02:27.000> props<00:02:28.000> them<00:02:28.180> at<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.390> two

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
exact once clean props them at the two

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.839 
exact once clean props them at the two
screens<00:02:29.019> and<00:02:29.500> then<00:02:30.190> you've<00:02:30.340> got<00:02:30.370> your<00:02:30.549> halves

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
screens and then you've got your halves

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.140 
screens and then you've got your halves
up<00:02:31.150> here<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:32.080> as<00:02:32.290> quite<00:02:32.819> regulate<00:02:33.819> when<00:02:34.030> you're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
up here so as quite regulate when you're

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.229 
up here so as quite regulate when you're
talking<00:02:34.540> in<00:02:34.750> terms<00:02:34.959> of<00:02:35.140> screen<00:02:35.530> size<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:37.120> can

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
talking in terms of screen size you can

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.030 
talking in terms of screen size you can
do<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.450> lot<00:02:37.660> more<00:02:37.720> stuff<00:02:38.170> on<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.680> screen

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
do a lot more stuff on the one screen

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.490 
do a lot more stuff on the one screen
then<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.549> obviously<00:02:39.819> in<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.269> 13<00:02:40.690> inch<00:02:40.780> so

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
then you can obviously in the 13 inch so

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.800 
then you can obviously in the 13 inch so
it's<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.650> no<00:02:41.829> win<00:02:41.860> situation<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:43.269> one<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.629> much

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it's a no win situation that one is much

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.600 
it's a no win situation that one is much
much<00:02:44.049> better<00:02:44.260> for<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:45.420> screen<00:02:46.420> size

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
much better for the screen size

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.690 
much better for the screen size
so<00:02:49.450> in<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.660> next<00:02:49.960> then<00:02:50.290> video<00:02:50.980> segment<00:02:51.520> or<00:02:51.640> if

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
so in this next then video segment or if

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.210 
so in this next then video segment or if
you<00:02:51.760> want<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:51.970> call<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.150> I'm<00:02:52.480> going<00:02:53.350> to<00:02:53.530> export

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
you want to call it I'm going to export

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.730 
you want to call it I'm going to export
a<00:02:54.310> movie<00:02:54.640> on<00:02:54.850> iMovie<00:02:55.600> both<00:02:56.140> are<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.710> same

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
a movie on iMovie both are the same

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.850 
a movie on iMovie both are the same
movies<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.180> when<00:02:58.840> export<00:02:59.350> them<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.680> show

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
movies and and when export them and show

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.010 
movies and and when export them and show
you<00:02:59.920> what<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.310> time<00:03:00.520> difference<00:03:00.550> or<00:03:01.510> the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
you what the time difference or the

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.200 
you what the time difference or the
speed<00:03:02.350> difference<00:03:02.680> actually<00:03:03.580> as<00:03:03.790> between

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
speed difference actually as between

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.080 
speed difference actually as between
those<00:03:04.390> two<00:03:04.630> machines<00:03:05.100> so<00:03:06.100> after<00:03:06.490> three<00:03:06.640> one

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
those two machines so after three one

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.080 
those two machines so after three one

two three preparing project creating the
large<00:03:13.300> movie<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:14.260> both<00:03:14.620> machines<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:16.260> we<00:03:17.260> have

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
large movie on both machines and we have

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.580 
large movie on both machines and we have
a<00:03:17.740> time<00:03:18.400> figure<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.180> nine<00:03:19.570> minutes<00:03:20.230> on<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
a time figure of nine minutes on the

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.760 
a time figure of nine minutes on the
imac<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.250> we've<00:03:22.060> got<00:03:22.240> 24<00:03:22.750> minutes<00:03:23.230> on<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
imac and we've got 24 minutes on the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.390 
imac and we've got 24 minutes on the
macbook<00:03:23.950> pro<00:03:25.110> 23<00:03:26.110> minutes<00:03:26.440> now<00:03:26.709> on<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.070> and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
macbook pro 23 minutes now on this and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.420 
macbook pro 23 minutes now on this and
nine<00:03:28.030> minutes<00:03:28.630> on<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.890> you've<00:03:30.040> got<00:03:30.070> about

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
nine minutes on this so you've got about

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.400 
nine minutes on this so you've got about
a<00:03:30.489> 12<00:03:30.850> minute<00:03:31.120> difference<00:03:31.660> between<00:03:32.050> those<00:03:32.200> two

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
a 12 minute difference between those two

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.770 
a 12 minute difference between those two
machines<00:03:32.739> but<00:03:32.980> just<00:03:33.160> quite<00:03:33.430> good<00:03:33.790> especially

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
machines but just quite good especially

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.600 
machines but just quite good especially
for<00:03:35.140> clicking<00:03:35.440> lot<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.770> movies<00:03:36.100> you<00:03:36.130> having<00:03:36.489> to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
for clicking lot of movies you having to

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.660 
for clicking lot of movies you having to
run<00:03:36.790> a<00:03:36.820> boat<00:03:37.620> definitely<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.739> quad<00:03:38.950> core<00:03:39.280> has

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
run a boat definitely the quad core has

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.930 
run a boat definitely the quad core has
a<00:03:40.000> huge<00:03:40.420> improvement<00:03:40.780> in<00:03:41.140> my<00:03:41.290> opinion<00:03:41.590> as<00:03:41.940> less

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
a huge improvement in my opinion as less

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.390 
a huge improvement in my opinion as less
than<00:03:43.120> half<00:03:43.300> of<00:03:43.540> that<00:03:43.840> of<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.170> macbook<00:03:44.320> pro<00:03:44.709> i'm

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
than half of that of the macbook pro i'm

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.190 
than half of that of the macbook pro i'm
just<00:03:45.580> going<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.730> take<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.910> bit<00:03:46.090> close<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.660> see<00:03:46.840> to

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
just going to take a bit close to see to

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.350 
just going to take a bit close to see to
let<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.440> see<00:03:47.650> for<00:03:47.680> your<00:03:47.980> own<00:03:48.100> so<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.120> here's

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
let you see for your own so so here's

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.860 
let you see for your own so so here's
the<00:03:49.480> imac<00:03:50.070> 27-inch<00:03:51.070> quad<00:03:51.430> core<00:03:51.730> eight<00:03:52.209> minutes

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
the imac 27-inch quad core eight minutes

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.500 
the imac 27-inch quad core eight minutes
for<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:53.410> project<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:54.730> let's<00:03:55.000> pan<00:03:55.239> over<00:03:55.480> to

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
for this project now let's pan over to

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.090 
for this project now let's pan over to
the<00:03:55.690> macbook<00:03:56.049> pro<00:03:57.810> which<00:03:58.810> is<00:03:59.110> down<00:03:59.380> here<00:03:59.410> it's

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
the macbook pro which is down here it's

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:07.740 
the macbook pro which is down here it's
a<00:04:00.280> zoomin<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:05.850> obviously<00:04:06.850> always<00:04:07.150> mess<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.510> up

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
a zoomin and obviously always mess it up

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.590 
a zoomin and obviously always mess it up
when<00:04:08.019> i'm<00:04:08.110> zooming<00:04:08.350> in<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.519> there<00:04:09.700> we<00:04:09.820> go<00:04:09.940> 20

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
when i'm zooming in but there we go 20

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.570 
when i'm zooming in but there we go 20
minutes<00:04:12.480> for<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.630> same<00:04:13.840> movie<00:04:14.580> different

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
minutes for the same movie different

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
minutes for the same movie different
machines<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:17.470> again<00:04:17.919> eight<00:04:18.580> minutes<00:04:19.120> unless

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
machines so again eight minutes unless

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.570 
machines so again eight minutes unless
and<00:04:19.900> 20<00:04:20.260> minutes<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.680> not<00:04:20.799> 12<00:04:21.310> minute

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
and 20 minutes and not 12 minute

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.610 
and 20 minutes and not 12 minute
difference<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.810> decide<00:04:23.140> whether<00:04:23.380> that's

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
difference you decide whether that's

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.770 
difference you decide whether that's
enough<00:04:24.010> for<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.370> or<00:04:24.460> not<00:04:24.610> now<00:04:25.300> obviously<00:04:25.479> I

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
enough for you or not now obviously I

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.370 
enough for you or not now obviously I
think<00:04:26.050> that<00:04:26.530> core<00:04:26.860> i7<00:04:27.610> model<00:04:28.350> has<00:04:29.350> a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
think that core i7 model has a

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.590 
think that core i7 model has a
twenty-five<00:04:30.130> percent<00:04:30.370> increase<00:04:31.060> over<00:04:31.479> this

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
twenty-five percent increase over this

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.420 
twenty-five percent increase over this
machine<00:04:31.930> here<00:04:32.110> that's<00:04:32.800> going<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.040> twenty-five

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
machine here that's going to twenty-five

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.980 
machine here that's going to twenty-five
percent<00:04:33.580> more<00:04:33.910> faster<00:04:34.360> so<00:04:34.660> if<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:34.810> need<00:04:34.840> that

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
percent more faster so if you need that

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.260 
percent more faster so if you need that
extra<00:04:35.380> better<00:04:35.620> speed<00:04:35.890> obviously<00:04:36.220> go<00:04:37.060> for<00:04:37.210> the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
extra better speed obviously go for the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.540 
extra better speed obviously go for the
core<00:04:37.479> i7<00:04:37.960> so<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:38.560> pretty<00:04:38.919> much<00:04:39.010> for<00:04:39.370> the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
core i7 so that I pretty much for the

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.690 
core i7 so that I pretty much for the
same<00:04:39.850> comparison<00:04:40.360> with<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.890> yes<00:04:41.890> imac<00:04:42.430> has

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
same comparison with you yes imac has

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.990 
same comparison with you yes imac has
one<00:04:42.910> that<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.750> pretty<00:04:44.080> much<00:04:44.229> as<00:04:45.130> much<00:04:45.310> more<00:04:45.820> so

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
one that is pretty much as much more so

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.640 
one that is pretty much as much more so
much<00:04:46.210> more<00:04:46.330> faster<00:04:46.690> processors<00:04:47.290> for<00:04:47.380> wanting

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
much more faster processors for wanting

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.990 
much more faster processors for wanting
to<00:04:47.710> expect<00:04:48.130> this<00:04:48.400> one<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.610> be<00:04:48.820> much<00:04:48.970> more

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
to expect this one to be much more

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.060 
to expect this one to be much more
faster<00:04:49.390> I<00:04:49.750> just<00:04:50.169> wanted<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.440> give<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.620> guys<00:04:50.740> an

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
faster I just wanted to give you guys an

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.580 
faster I just wanted to give you guys an
idea<00:04:51.190> of<00:04:51.460> how<00:04:51.790> this<00:04:52.000> is<00:04:52.180> working<00:04:52.410> about<00:04:53.410> the

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
idea of how this is working about the

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.950 
idea of how this is working about the
