00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.410
 for talking now about the history of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.870
 aeromodelling well 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.330
 many people practice Robian but not 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.279
 has a clue how it all started 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.529
 It's probably you're one of those 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.570
 people so I joined the maximum of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.470
 possible information to talk a little 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.269
 this story 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.730
 according to some available sources 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.240
 on the internet the precursor of aeromodelismo 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.399
 was the French alphonse penou well it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.440
 wanted to pursue a military career but 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.530
 was prevented because of rheumatism 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.930
 is more than a guy with rheumatism has 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.090
 to see with aeromodelismo is all about 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.980
 even because in 1870 he invented motorola 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:50.219
 claiming that he wanted to use force 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.530
 Extraordinary relaxation of rubber is 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.730
 If you are not in the middle and know this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.090
 elastic force 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 It is then that he already had the motor 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 I missed an airplane but as you know the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.949
 was only invented at the beginning of the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.040
 The 20th century had to do its own thing. 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.110
 the fans was barring a problem that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.299
 was about the balance of the model 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.000
 so he had the idea of ​​making an enemy. 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.340
 horizontal inclined upwards 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.369
 hence stabilizer is born and also 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:27.119
 developed the slope of the water that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:29.009
 day came in 1871 he built the 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.409
 first model to and lazio remembering that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.270
 people did not even dream of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.939
 radio controlled models 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 this model was called a strong plan 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.439
 which must be a very sewage 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.009
 word planacon his name then he 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.869
 left the flight in August 1871 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.990
 women's gardens for society 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.970
 French EU air navigation but wait a minute 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.470
 let's not only was invented in 1905 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.610
 because there is already a shipping company 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.860
 aerial 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.619
 there already invested dirigibles at this time 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.520
 they were avoided in the middle of the century 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.460
 19 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.500
 because it is then coming back soon to state that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.600
 was also the course of the machine 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.440
 to fly because of his invention that is 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.600
 the heavier it was, the easier it was 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.240
 basically this what happened 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.040
 I was going to fly and if only I think 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.830
 that was not controlled by her a 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.320
 Good time but let's talk about the 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.220
 aeromodelling here on Brazilian soil 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.270
 here the model airplanes only appeared in 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.550
 1931 to a company and the curious 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.920
 They began to call it spock yes 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.560
 at that time there were already models 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.300
 which were very expensive and went up 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.100
 quickly from the market because of 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.590
 United States entrance on the second 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.870
 world war and these other things 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.850
 models with motors in the elastic were the 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.020
 more targeted because they had more 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.450
 adepts 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.250
 away from the war here in Brazil were 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.500
 various events 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.520
 I really want to be honored by the ministry 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.410
 of aeronautics 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.510
 the end of the war began to 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.060
 appear the rays that were actually well 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.110
 simple only one channel where the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:06.180
 only one spot controlled game and only 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.160
 because to defend it he would have to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 spiral of the command command problem it 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.670
 spiral to the ground but with the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.350
 the passing of time began to emerge 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.600
 other equipment including one that 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.320
 let the other team go and see you 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.500
 City 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.370
 that's how it got accelerated or 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.320
 idle 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.890
 It is worth remembering that at this 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.320
 was reigning ovcc but then he had 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.500
 more strength still there in the 60's 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.900
 but hence the comrade called king order 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.760
 invented the sailing blow that many did not 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.580
 You know why the name is a goal, but it's okay. 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.160
 simple equal in English means brightness 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.140
 this because the engine used sailing 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.060
 incandescent filaments that 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.000
 replace the primitive engines with 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.560
 with two coils 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.230
 conversationalists Flight Battery and other 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.600
 things that only made an airplane weigh 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.670
 from there came the fuel that in the 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.380
 a mixture of methanol at risk 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.600
 in what was then done by the 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.650
 the modeler using the proportions 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.750
 dedicated 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.600
 but as many already know gasoline today 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.000
 returned with great force to the garden and 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.550
 finally there by the 60's began 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.100
 to appear with the brakes that 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.290
 were resonance-driven 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.210
 metal blades that closed the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.650
 for a command, it's okay 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.350
 You do not have to understand the 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.400
 operation simply says in penalty 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.410
 which was bad because you needed to 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.229
 eight channels on the radio to control 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.720
 four basic channels of an airplane and 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.610
 even with so much technology were still the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.160
 pilot was not the model because they do not 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.590
 there in my command me it was all 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.650
 the senate is not triggered 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.780
 disrupting much flight stability 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.870
 4311 time and in bed was one thing that a 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.270
 fever actually use one of them was you 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.960
 who was making a lot of success in that 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.949
 time 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.560
 then what is and if you do not u mean flight 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.110
 controlled khullar is placed because 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.180
 You will tie a thing on an airplane and 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.460
 will let it fly flying around it will 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.729
 make only one circle you have only the 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:09.639
 command of the deep or it just goes up 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.260
 10 and the engine is always found not to be 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.150
 always accelerated 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.100
 so it was passing time were 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.570
 other modalities was already the 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.150
 modernism were emerging. 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.760
 technologies entered 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.500
 the electric models the turbines 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.930
 They began to price people download 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.139
 began to buy the radios 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.960
 which has greatly facilitated the 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.449
 life of zero modernist daewoo holden se 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.669
 becomes increasingly popular egg comes 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.630
 gaining more space in the scenario 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.520
 national 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.680
 Okay, well, let's stop this here. 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.990
 historical turnaround because I have had some 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.729
 current times and I'm sure you 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.550
 you already know enough 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.479
 Okay, so I'm sorry if I missed talking. 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.400
 something 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.949
 or if something went wrong 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.949
 so there are the comments below you 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.030
 can comment on your opinion by saying that 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.500
 I forgot 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.409
 or what I could do to 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.630
 improve on the next videos and then you 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.220
 helping knows me very well so it was 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.080
 This is what I prepared for you, I hope. 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.750
 that you have liked to help in the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.330
 disclosure of that legal pleasure there in the 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.580
 video favorite elipse want to follow 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.190
 my job to subscribe to the channel 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.830
 I also hope on the facebook page and 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.830
 said until next week or the beautiful
