00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.230
 do not 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.490
 welcome today we are going to talk about the topic 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.529
 of blush the fair of blush is to give us 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.960
 color to our skin so it is very 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.539
 important to always apply after the 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.550
 base and then the dust so you have to 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.039
 be very careful with how much we apply 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.590
 the different shades we have great 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.689
 variety more than anything depends a little on 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.820
 the season and our skin tone 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.309
 we have the range of golds is a 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.839
 super natural place create more than anything 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.729
 a little bit of brightness but not so much 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.799
 intensity is seal for which they are not 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:44.290
 so lovers of Uruguay we have the 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.540
 more orange tones are very cute 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.869
 for the summer 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.699
 we have the neutral brownish ones that 

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:54.309
 It's nice if he still does not like to notice 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.440
 much cheekbones a good color more 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.839
 brick and finally we have the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.089
 pink the pink is also a color 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.490
 ideal to give us a pretty tone 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.100
 natural to our skin 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.050
 and we have different tones for example s 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.360
 we have a darker pink and this is a 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.700
 lighter pink also if you notice the 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.910
 difference the one above is shiny and the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.470
 below is opaque that more than anything is a 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.840
 taste everyone there are people who like 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.060
 use shiny blush and there are people who 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.530
 like to use the blush more matt the trick 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.990
 that I tell you if you have 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.640
 spots or some imperfection in the area 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.110
 where are we going to apply the blush not 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.930
 they use the glitters because it's going to do 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.970
 to be noticed more let's practice 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.690
 see a bit of the application form and 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.690
 the different tricks 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.600
 good about the blush to the 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.189
 blush application we have different 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.439
 brush types more than anything what 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.360
 modify in what changes is the type of 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.270
 size that what I recommend is 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.369
 that they choose it according to the size of our 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.500
 face so we have a face 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.939
 very large and we have an area for 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.549
 apply the very big place we can 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.409
 choose a brush a little wider if 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.299
 we have a little face there 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.340
 eat a smaller brush so as not to 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.459
 make such a big blot of blush 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.280
 The function of the blush is to give us color by 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.519
 which is very important to apply 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.220
 always but we have two ways of 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.220
 apply one can be above the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.470
 cheekbones in this part that what is going to 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.900
 do is not going to be the face a little more 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.780
 angled for example is very useful for 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.879
 round-faced people because it's going to 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.129
 get out there the rounded shape of your 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.099
 face instead there people from 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:39.440
 I face very long or very square we 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.980
 to apply it in this part of our 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.530
 higher cheekbone to just not hit 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.290
 so much angle to our face but more 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.019
 that nothing give it a little more shape 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.420
 round we have different shades like them 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.940
 I counted previously we will choose in 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.960
 she a little 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.500
 brownish on one side and the other side 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.440
 I'm going to apply the pinkest on this side 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.080
 let's apply the shape for faces 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.020
 more round as we are going to apply is very 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.420
 important that they fit a bit because the 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.820
 blush when it adheres to dust and 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.780
 base is very difficult to correct then 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.990
 let's go loading a little bit 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.990
 Y 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.660
 when we download the product 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.140
 we remove the surplus in our hand and 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.140
 is we smoke 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.190
 the amount will depend a little more 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.930
 that nothing of our taste there are people who 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.880
 he likes to have a very marked flush and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.090
 there are people who like to have the blush 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.340
 softer 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.860
 I did it to her pretty little 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.900
 so that to show you two ways that 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.230
 we have to remove a little bit the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.790
 surplus if we have a lot of surplus and 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.260
 we want a little bit softer then 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.319
 let's do is with the powder that 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.450
 we use in the previous video 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:04.580
 applying it at the top will lower a tone 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.580
 the color of the blush 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:14.030
 and if not the other trick is with a little 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.580
 of dry cotton we will go over 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.310
 and it also helps to remove a little bit 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.650
 of the surplus but always try to 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.260
 be very careful and it is better loaded 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.230
 to little that loads a lot and then have 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.660
 to fix what is more complicated 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.020
 on the other side we are going to apply a blush 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.560
 more pink and in more parts of the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.780
 high cheekbone are kings in this part of 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.540
 here it is very important that they do not apply it 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.910
 in this area of the cheekbone but more than 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.660
 nothing in this part that is the cheekbone 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.660
 towards the side 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.520
 when we already apply the product 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.889
 we remove the surplus and we melt and there 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.290
 we can melt a little back 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.630
 to unify is that it is not so 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.630
 rounded out there that we do not like 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.460
 they liked it I hope it serves them us 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:15.460
 rediscover the next
