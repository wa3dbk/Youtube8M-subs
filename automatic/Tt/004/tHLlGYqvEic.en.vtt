00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.120
 yes 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.639
 or the back we are welcome to the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.500
 conquer to me what I have clear is that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.049
 we will not be able to face any 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.779
 enemy to get a new country 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.770
 because I do not have the very enough not 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.640
 I have too big an army 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.880
 then to see if we find any 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.830
 little person 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.009
 with which we can face now 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:38.000
 same I have 53 thousand 566 as you see 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:42.290
 and the next look is that rape 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.290
 3000 Remedy Remedy 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.900
 and the other one has like double then 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.900
 It would be easy enough to lose 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:59.340
 I am a country that teach us 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:05.080
 lie let's give it a beating ticket 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.970
 Secunda will believe ja ja challenges 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.630
 to see how many very good now 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.770
 lose would be happy no no 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.770
 to see seven thousand 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.960
 Let's see how we organize the army 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.000
 smarter 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.710
 first let's go with our stone we're going to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.710
 go thinking of numerical superiority 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.079
 establish one more and now we are going to 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.079
 throw the scissors 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:02.430
 to the beating on the edge 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.430
 oh how much gives me three thousand 858 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.720
 many cencos 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:13.220
 I already have almost more than 9000 we are going to look 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.450
 to another that we are going to give him 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.290
 delay in a battle 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.920
 Now that I've won, I do not have to have faith 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.920
 in this life 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.730
 with fear so strong the archers are 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.519
 weak against all mother types 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.840
 well let's move on from the archers 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.670
 organize the army 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.390
 we just went from the archers 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.390
 all ready 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.770
 and let's start with let's start 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.770
 with the pretty 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.160
 human 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.340
 numerical superiority 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.640
 you just need another victory we go with 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.640
 stone 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:13.410
 another numerical superiority well to see 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:17.060
 see how much they give me 3.168 we're already going 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.060
 let's see if we get the 62 thousand 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.610
 Super Super missing always gives me 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.680
 a lot but I do not know why our 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.740
 consoles do not do is guts not take 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.740
 all right 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.130
 good 62,000 well fine well I'm going to 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.010
 teach so you can see the next 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.170
 good enemy was telling us there are 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.030
 some enemies that are ninjas that only 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.270
 you can beat them that were the ones in this 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.160
 this here that as I taught him to see if 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.770
 still super how was the game 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.510
 they saw it and it was one of the phases 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.090
 that played 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.950
 and now you see there were many possibilities 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.020
 of losing the papers 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.740
 he said then 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.560
 with what it costs to get here to the 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:15.520
 colleagues and they were ninjas then against 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.520
 the ninjas do not have superiority of 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.590
 as I tell you of type but it is 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.800
 you can simply have superiority 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.510
 number then you have to go and they were 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.000
 they were fucking one even though I had 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.290
 a lot of numerical superiority a 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.390
 from them they won what happens to me 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.830
 I won to the next this stone paper 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.990
 and scissors is that you earn two of three 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.380
 you fight one of them I won it 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.380
 and I had to win with the spaces 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.380
 families 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.560
 well, it 's bananas, you know that we 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.750
 we see with the social networks that are 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.310
 twitter bars for 3ds facebook neighborhoods 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.410
 for 3ds obviously you are in the channel 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.830
 of youtube de espartinas and how we do not 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.010
 we see with the spa forums 3ds.com bye 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.010
 bye
