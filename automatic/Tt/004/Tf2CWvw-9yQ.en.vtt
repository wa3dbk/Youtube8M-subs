00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.050 
and they found cancer in my breast in
three<00:02:19.540> different<00:02:19.719> areas<00:02:20.109> now<00:02:20.829> if<00:02:21.099> I<00:02:21.280> didn't<00:02:21.790> go

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
three different areas now if I didn't go

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.440 
three different areas now if I didn't go
like<00:02:22.780> they<00:02:23.379> stated<00:02:23.739> out<00:02:23.980> there<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.489> society

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
like they stated out there in society

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.360 
like they stated out there in society
you<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:25.959> go<00:02:26.049> every<00:02:26.379> other<00:02:26.409> year<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.099> would<00:02:27.280> have

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
you can go every other year I would have

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.190 
you can go every other year I would have
probably<00:02:27.519> skipped<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.209> year<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.780> next<00:02:28.810> year

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
probably skipped this year and next year

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.920 
probably skipped this year and next year
it<00:02:29.499> would<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.829> been<00:02:30.030> maybe<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.180> stage<00:02:31.480> three

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
it would have been maybe a stage three

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.440 
it would have been maybe a stage three
stage<00:02:31.959> four<00:02:32.829> so<00:02:33.430> they<00:02:33.609> caught<00:02:33.849> this<00:02:34.150> in<00:02:34.329> time

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
stage four so they caught this in time

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.440 
stage four so they caught this in time
so<00:02:35.109> it's<00:02:35.379> best<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.549> done<00:02:36.819> on<00:02:36.879> a<00:02:37.120> yearly

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
so it's best to get it done on a yearly

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.110 
so it's best to get it done on a yearly
basis<00:02:38.049> and<00:02:38.319> if<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.129> have<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.549> fight<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:39.969> your

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.970 
basis and if you have to fight with your
doctor<00:02:40.540> if<00:02:40.689> they<00:02:40.870> said<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.439> don't<00:02:41.620> need<00:02:41.799> it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
