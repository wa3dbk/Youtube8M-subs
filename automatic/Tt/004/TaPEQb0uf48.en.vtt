00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.940

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.530

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 my book the other right? 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.600
 The book also makes an approach that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.130
 very organized and try to right the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.000
 people understand about the behavior 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.259
 on passive characteristics 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.910
 aggressive assertive 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.149
