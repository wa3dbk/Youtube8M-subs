choose to refuse and been told by bt
that<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.200> can't<00:02:33.200> block<00:02:33.350> these<00:02:33.530> numbers<00:02:34.209> because

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
that I can't block these numbers because

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.910 
that I can't block these numbers because
there<00:02:35.359> are<00:02:35.420> certain<00:02:35.690> organizations<00:02:36.650> and

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
there are certain organizations and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.150 
there are certain organizations and
businesses<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.750> certain<00:02:38.750> prefixes<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.650> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.420 
businesses and certain prefixes that you
can<00:02:40.370> work<00:02:40.670> with<00:02:40.910> it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
can work with it

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.030 
can work with it
ironically<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.599> very<00:02:43.629> tapes<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.739> numbers

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
ironically the very tapes of numbers

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.589 
ironically the very tapes of numbers
that<00:02:45.189> you<00:02:45.219> want<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.640> block<00:02:46.079> can't<00:02:47.079> be<00:02:47.230> blocked

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
that you want to block can't be blocked

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.000 
that you want to block can't be blocked
so<00:02:49.599> not<00:02:49.840> only<00:02:49.930> is<00:02:50.079> that<00:02:50.170> but<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:50.650> less<00:02:50.859> it's

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
so not only is that but is less it's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.369 
so not only is that but is less it's
also<00:02:51.189> a<00:02:51.370> bit<00:02:51.489> of<00:02:51.609> a<00:02:51.670> waste<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.939> money<00:02:52.379> there's

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
also a bit of a waste of money there's

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.429 
also a bit of a waste of money there's
also<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.829> anonymous<00:02:54.700> caller<00:02:54.909> reject<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.679 

that's<00:02:59.439> got<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.709> loophole<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.069> I'm<00:03:01.060> peeing<00:03:01.599> over

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:01.689 
that's got a loophole to I'm peeing over

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:05.399 
that's got a loophole to I'm peeing over
a<00:03:01.870> 30<00:03:02.439> pound<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.709> year<00:03:02.739> for<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.219> and<00:03:04.409> if

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
a 30 pound a year for that and if

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.009 
a 30 pound a year for that and if
somebody<00:03:06.040> phones<00:03:06.519> up<00:03:06.760> from<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:08.639> switchboard

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
somebody phones up from a switchboard

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.030 
somebody phones up from a switchboard
rather<00:03:11.019> than<00:03:12.060> having<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.180> use<00:03:13.359> 141<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.290> make<00:03:14.919> an

rather than having to use 141 to make an
anonymous<00:03:15.250> call<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.810> comes<00:03:16.989> up<00:03:17.169> as

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
anonymous call it just comes up as

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.830 
anonymous call it just comes up as
number<00:03:17.950> not<00:03:18.129> available<00:03:18.239> which<00:03:19.239> is<00:03:19.389> still<00:03:19.569> an

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
number not available which is still an

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.940 
number not available which is still an
unknown<00:03:20.079> of<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.379> skull<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:22.379> that<00:03:23.379> gets<00:03:23.620> through

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
unknown of a skull but that gets through

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.440 
unknown of a skull but that gets through
because<00:03:25.409> anonymous<00:03:26.409> caller<00:03:26.760> reject<00:03:27.760> doesn't

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
because anonymous caller reject doesn't

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.720 
because anonymous caller reject doesn't
block<00:03:29.669> when<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:30.790> number<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.060> not<00:03:31.209> available

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
block when the number is not available

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.000 
block when the number is not available
so<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:34.689> is<00:03:34.719> all<00:03:34.959> custom<00:03:35.469> a<00:03:35.560> fair<00:03:35.799> bit<00:03:35.950> of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
so this is all custom a fair bit of

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.640 
so this is all custom a fair bit of
money<00:03:36.129> every<00:03:36.849> year<00:03:37.060> over<00:03:37.780> eat<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.139> pound

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.309

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.509 
and i'm still getting unwanted calls DNA
even<00:03:46.319> at<00:03:46.409> weekends<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:48.120> not<00:03:48.360> anymore<00:03:49.519> they're

what<00:04:20.250> we've<00:04:20.400> got

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.410 

manuals<00:04:29.479> obviously<00:04:29.930> not<00:04:30.650> very<00:04:30.680> interesting

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
manuals obviously not very interesting

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.720 
manuals obviously not very interesting
but<00:04:33.020> there<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.650> actual<00:04:34.010> device<00:04:34.370> itself

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
but there is the actual device itself

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.060 
but there is the actual device itself
there<00:04:35.210> hopefully<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:36.560> is<00:04:36.680> going<00:04:36.800> to<00:04:36.890> be<00:04:36.980> an

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
there hopefully this is going to be an

answer<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.430> all<00:04:37.580> my<00:04:37.700> problems<00:04:37.910> and<00:04:39.160> quite

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
answer to all my problems and quite

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.940 
answer to all my problems and quite
simple<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.520> use<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:41.810> plug<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.290> phone<00:04:42.740> into

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
simple to use you plug the phone into

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.240 
simple to use you plug the phone into
their<00:04:43.280> that<00:04:44.060> into<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.390> wall<00:04:44.860> it's<00:04:45.860> going<00:04:46.070> so<00:04:46.190> a

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
their that into the wall it's going so a

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.710 
their that into the wall it's going so a
little<00:04:47.050> power<00:04:48.050> supply<00:04:48.410> here<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:50.300> I'm<00:04:50.510> going<00:04:50.690> to

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
little power supply here so I'm going to

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.810 
little power supply here so I'm going to
set<00:04:50.900> this<00:04:50.990> up<00:04:51.140> tonight<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:55.640> good<00:04:55.790> thing

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
set this up tonight and the good thing

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.600 
set this up tonight and the good thing
about<00:04:56.000> this<00:04:56.270> is<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.600> can<00:04:56.870> block<00:04:57.340> not<00:04:58.340> only

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
about this is it can block not only
