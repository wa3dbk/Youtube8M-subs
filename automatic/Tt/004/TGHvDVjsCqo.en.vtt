really<00:01:57.810> interesting<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.439> though<00:01:58.740> they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
really interesting actually though they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.770 
really interesting actually though they
appear<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.579> screen<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.240> start<00:02:00.540> floating

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
appear on screen and start floating

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.010 
appear on screen and start floating
around<00:02:00.960> sort<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.619> randomly<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.329> oh<00:02:03.329> isn't<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020

around sort of randomly and oh isn't a
sister<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.469> ham<00:02:05.479> yeah<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.469> advance

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
sister of a ham yeah that's the advance

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.960 
sister of a ham yeah that's the advance
wars

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.610 
really simplifies things and actually in
my<00:03:40.330> mind<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.600> sort<00:03:40.810> of<00:03:40.870> it<00:03:41.080> takes<00:03:41.320> me<00:03:41.440> back<00:03:41.560> to

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
my mind is sort of it takes me back to

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.500 
my mind is sort of it takes me back to
NES<00:03:42.400> days<00:03:42.640> because<00:03:42.940> you're<00:03:43.060> doing<00:03:43.270> a<00:03:43.330> lot<00:03:43.450> of

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
NES days because you're doing a lot of

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.570 
NES days because you're doing a lot of
the<00:03:43.630> similar<00:03:43.840> movements<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:45.310> move<00:03:45.459> around

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
the similar movements you move around

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.900 
the similar movements you move around
with<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.360> d-pad<00:03:46.920> double<00:03:47.920> tap<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.100> dash<00:03:48.400> so

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
with the d-pad double tap to dash so

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.760 
with the d-pad double tap to dash so
again<00:03:49.630> it's<00:03:49.810> sort<00:03:49.990> of<00:03:50.050> similar<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.440> old<00:03:50.470> school

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
again it's sort of similar to old school

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.210 
again it's sort of similar to old school
fighters<00:03:51.270> attack<00:03:52.270> is<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.480> a<00:03:52.980> special<00:03:53.980> attack
