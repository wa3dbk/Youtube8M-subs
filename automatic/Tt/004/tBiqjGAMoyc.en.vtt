00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.970
 Today I have fresh mussels 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.369
 brought directly from the ship and how ready 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.500
 I am now right for you 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.960
 Here in the middle of the Dutch Wadden Sea 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.210
 where the best mussels come from 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.180
 and our recipe for today means 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.100
 mussels of all provence before we 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.650
 let's start looking at the shells 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.360
 all mussels are open 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.600
 before preparing are sorted out 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.370
 We only use the closed ones when 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.559
 Clams open a small crack 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.390
 then we'll just knock 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.390
 against each other, they close again 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.710
 the ingredients for our recipe today 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.050
 are not many 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.259
 We need some one herbal 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.229
 bit of cream fraiche some white wine 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:13.090
 bacon garlic olive oil and 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.009
 of course our mussels and the recipe 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.990
 today will be under a quarter of an hour 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.240
 be prepared and with that you too 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.240
 you can watch the clock above 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.420
 in some olive oil we have the first 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.820
 bacon with a bit of garlic if 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.050
 the bacon is browned vigorously delete 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.910
 We do it all with a good shot 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:42.420
 white wine from then on the herbs come 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:44.280
 with rosemary thyme and something 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.140
 mussels of all provence would be without 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 a good shot of creme fraiche that 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.800
 all we can stir into again 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.690
 getting hot 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.610
 we give the mussels to you pro 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.850
 person calculates about 500 grams 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.410
 mussels is the mussel now 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.890
 It will be about four minutes 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.560
 last 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.340
 we look again at our watch we 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 are great in the time 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.200
 we can do that too 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.220
 Serve that smells very spicy 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.260
 herbs after bacon before we eat 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.630
 Let's see that the shells are beautiful 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.250
 open when mussels are there 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.540
 that did not work out are the sortier 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.540
 Me out of the food when I'm with 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.750
 We can shell at the first the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.130
 simply meat with the fingers 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:46.620
 is outside and then we use this 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.790
 shell as cutlery so special 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.319
 a piece of it tastes good as well 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.599
 baguette so you can also beautiful the 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.170
 take a dip we look up again 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.970
 our clock 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.769
 we did not need quarter of an hour 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.660
 even here in the Netherlands 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.819
 Wadden Sea were the mussel of all 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.349
