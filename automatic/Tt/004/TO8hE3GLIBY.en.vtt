they<00:02:09.869> do<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.229> they<00:02:10.500> freeze<00:02:10.770> dry<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.300> then<00:02:12.300> they

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
they do is they freeze dry and then they

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.600 
they do is they freeze dry and then they
put<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
put it in this

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.400 
put it in this
special<00:02:15.610> capsule<00:02:15.850> they<00:02:16.420> call<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.840> enteric

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
special capsule they call it enteric

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.080 
special capsule they call it enteric
caps<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.100> then<00:02:18.280> they<00:02:18.459> flush<00:02:18.880> away

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
caps you and then they flush away

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.230 
caps you and then they flush away
nitrogen<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.840> reason<00:02:20.170> for<00:02:20.319> that<00:02:20.380> is<00:02:20.880> when<00:02:21.880> air

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
nitrogen the reason for that is when air

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.830 
nitrogen the reason for that is when air
a<00:02:22.420> has<00:02:22.720> oxygen<00:02:23.190> okay<00:02:24.190> air<00:02:24.459> has<00:02:24.850> bacteria<00:02:25.569> and

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
a has oxygen okay air has bacteria and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.030 
a has oxygen okay air has bacteria and
germs<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.350> whatnot

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
germs and whatnot

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.449 
germs and whatnot
when<00:02:27.850> they<00:02:28.390> don't<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:29.230> don't<00:02:29.260> flush<00:02:30.069> out<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
when they don't you don't flush out the

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.270 
when they don't you don't flush out the
air<00:02:30.700> inside<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.930> germs<00:02:32.290> or<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.770> bacteria<00:02:33.160> in

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
air inside the germs or the bacteria in

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.480 
air inside the germs or the bacteria in
the<00:02:33.370> air<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:34.060> actually<00:02:35.040> either<00:02:36.040> kill<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
the air can actually either kill the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.680 
the air can actually either kill the
cells<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.850> contaminate<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.690> cells<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.890> that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
cells of contaminate the cells so that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.240 
cells of contaminate the cells so that
can<00:02:40.690> cause<00:02:40.959> problem<00:02:41.470> when<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.860> consume

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
can cause problem when you consume

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.140 
can cause problem when you consume
something<00:02:42.520> like<00:02:42.730> that

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
something like that

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.220 
something like that
so<00:02:43.660> when<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.870> look<00:02:43.989> at<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.170> product<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:46.230> you

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
so when you look at the product and you

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.650 
so when you look at the product and you
need<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.500> ask<00:02:47.680> how<00:02:48.190> they<00:02:48.430> keep<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.060> stem<00:02:49.420> cells

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
need to ask how they keep the stem cells

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.040 
need to ask how they keep the stem cells
of<00:02:49.810> life<00:02:50.020> are<00:02:50.320> they<00:02:50.730> clean<00:02:51.730> quality<00:02:52.570> are<00:02:52.780> they

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
of life are they clean quality are they

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.380 
of life are they clean quality are they
life<00:02:53.380> are<00:02:53.680> they<00:02:53.769> clean<00:02:54.010> quality<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:55.269> know

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
life are they clean quality you know

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.410 
life are they clean quality you know
this<00:02:55.600> coating<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.110> is<00:02:56.790> available<00:02:57.790> for<00:02:58.000> other

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
this coating is is available for other

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.699 
this coating is is available for other
products<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.050> it's<00:02:59.200> not<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.590> this

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
products so it's not just for this

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.090 
products so it's not just for this
product

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
product

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.460 
product
okay<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.459> particularly<00:03:01.360> this<00:03:02.140> particular

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
okay this particularly this particular

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.009 
okay this particularly this particular
enteric<00:03:03.310> coating<00:03:03.790> okay<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.840> very

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
enteric coating okay and this is very

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.620 
enteric coating okay and this is very
important<00:03:05.440> because<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:06.400> viability<00:03:07.120> of<00:03:07.390> the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
important because the viability of the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.180 
important because the viability of the
stem<00:03:07.840> cells<00:03:09.810> once<00:03:10.810> you<00:03:10.900> consume<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.440> then<00:03:11.950> you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
stem cells once you consume it then you

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.520 
stem cells once you consume it then you
can<00:03:12.430> go<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.610> work<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:13.060> see<00:03:13.239> because<00:03:13.840> if<00:03:14.019> inside

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
can go to work you see because if inside

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.380 
can go to work you see because if inside
the<00:03:14.620> capsu<00:03:14.950> whatever<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.459> is<00:03:15.550> not<00:03:15.700> enteric<00:03:16.120> and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
the capsu whatever it is not enteric and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.650 
the capsu whatever it is not enteric and
it<00:03:16.600> is<00:03:16.810> not<00:03:16.959> flush<00:03:17.200> with<00:03:17.470> nitrogen<00:03:17.890> then<00:03:18.760> you

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
it is not flush with nitrogen then you

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.860 
it is not flush with nitrogen then you
can<00:03:19.840> zoom<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.079> that<00:03:20.230> cells<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:21.010> know<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.690> no

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
can zoom in that cells you know and no

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.620 
can zoom in that cells you know and no
effect<00:03:23.170> you<00:03:23.680> know<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.360> another<00:03:25.360> thing<00:03:25.540> a

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
effect you know so another thing a

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.900 
effect you know so another thing a
