that'll<00:01:59.919> be<00:01:59.950> part<00:02:00.279> of<00:02:00.399> the<00:02:00.489> process<00:02:00.639> we're

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
that'll be part of the process we're

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.209 
that'll be part of the process we're
sort<00:02:01.539> of<00:02:01.569> taking<00:02:01.809> the<00:02:02.020> lead<00:02:02.259> on<00:02:02.559> an<00:02:03.069> issue

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
sort of taking the lead on an issue

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:04.589 
sort of taking the lead on an issue
that's<00:02:03.399> incredibly<00:02:03.939> important<00:02:04.329> for<00:02:04.359> this

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
that's incredibly important for this

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.070 
that's incredibly important for this
country

for the world and by taking an action

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.810 
for the world and by taking an action
like<00:02:07.870> this<00:02:08.020> and<00:02:08.160> building<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.250> building<00:02:09.430> that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
like this and building a building that

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.940 
like this and building a building that
embodies<00:02:10.510> all<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.780> principles<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:11.470> they're

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
embodies all the principles that they're

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.350 
embodies all the principles that they're
trying<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.430> teach<00:02:12.610> their<00:02:12.820> students<00:02:13.150> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
trying to teach their students and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.960 
trying to teach their students and
trying<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.930> spread<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.710> the<00:02:14.740> community<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.610> a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
trying to spread to the community it's a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.370 
trying to spread to the community it's a
much<00:02:16.240> more<00:02:16.390> powerful<00:02:16.450> way<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:16.930> do<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.230> than

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
much more powerful way to do it than

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.140 
much more powerful way to do it than
just<00:02:17.410> having<00:02:18.040> somebody<00:02:18.370> read<00:02:18.670> in<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.850> book<00:02:18.880> oh

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
just having somebody read in a book oh

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.700 
just having somebody read in a book oh
this<00:02:19.330> is<00:02:19.420> what<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.630> should<00:02:19.660> be<00:02:19.840> doing<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.590> our

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
this is what you should be doing so our

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.850 
this is what you should be doing so our
students<00:02:21.160> don't<00:02:21.280> just<00:02:21.580> learn<00:02:21.730> they<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.300> and

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
students don't just learn they do and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.260 
students don't just learn they do and
around<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.010> environment<00:02:24.490> there's<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.730> lot<00:02:24.970> to

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
around the environment there's a lot to

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.270 
around the environment there's a lot to
do<00:02:25.420> they<00:02:25.900> want<00:02:26.080> to<00:02:26.170> be<00:02:26.260> touching<00:02:26.620> their<00:02:27.040> own

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
do they want to be touching their own

do they want to be touching their own
connection<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.450> environment<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.230> they

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
connection to the environment and they

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.050 
connection to the environment and they
want<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.530> be<00:02:29.650> minimizing<00:02:30.070> their<00:02:30.370> impact<00:02:30.790> in

want to be minimizing their impact in
ways<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.630> are<00:02:31.720> demonstrable<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.500> draw

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
ways that are demonstrable and draw

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
front on the cutting edge it's trying to

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.320

do something that's never been done

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.350 
do something that's never been done
before<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.520> excites<00:02:45.520> students<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.240> new

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
before that excites students the new

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.850 
before that excites students the new
environmental<00:02:46.960> center<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.260> think<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.620> going<00:02:47.800> to

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
environmental center I think is going to

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.040 
environmental center I think is going to
be<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:48.010> fabulous<00:02:48.310> opportunity<00:02:48.730> for<00:02:49.480> lots<00:02:49.840> of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
be a fabulous opportunity for lots of

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.960 
be a fabulous opportunity for lots of
connections<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.250> made<00:02:51.280> among<00:02:51.670> various

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
connections to be made among various

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:52.920 
connections to be made among various
groups<00:02:52.060> around<00:02:52.300> campus

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
groups around campus

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.600 
groups around campus
well<00:02:53.140> when<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.410> Kelly<00:02:53.590> house<00:02:53.800> is<00:02:54.010> finished<00:02:54.550> I

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
well when the Kelly house is finished I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.760 
well when the Kelly house is finished I
think<00:02:54.850> it'll<00:02:54.970> mean<00:02:55.540> for<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.960> students<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.620> a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
think it'll mean for the students just a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.530 
think it'll mean for the students just a
very<00:02:57.040> clear<00:02:57.280> place<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.670> they<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:58.000> go<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.450> a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
very clear place that they can go in a

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.000 
very clear place that they can go in a
place<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.750> they'll<00:02:59.020> really<00:02:59.410> enjoy<00:02:59.500> spending

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
place that they'll really enjoy spending

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.830 
place that they'll really enjoy spending
time<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.460> a<00:03:00.550> way<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.330> environmental

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
time in a way that the environmental

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.780 
time in a way that the environmental
studies<00:03:02.050> programs<00:03:02.860> we<00:03:02.980> can<00:03:03.160> become<00:03:03.490> a<00:03:03.520> much

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
studies programs we can become a much

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.820 
studies programs we can become a much
bigger<00:03:04.000> part<00:03:04.300> of<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.540> whole<00:03:04.660> Williams<00:03:05.020> life

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830

host of high performance goals I think
is<00:03:15.970> really<00:03:16.239> important<00:03:16.690> from<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:16.959> leadership
