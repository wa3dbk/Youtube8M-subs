hair the best smell ever
and<00:05:20.689> I<00:05:20.749> think<00:05:20.809> above<00:05:21.199> all<00:05:21.409> the<00:05:21.589> products<00:05:22.069> the

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:22.189 
and I think above all the products the

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.570 
and I think above all the products the
smell<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.610> the<00:05:22.759> strongest<00:05:23.210> and<00:05:23.509> the<00:05:23.569> best

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.660 

and<00:05:27.090> we<00:05:27.210> have<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.660> final<00:05:28.200> results<00:05:28.800> now<00:05:29.280> as<00:05:29.520> the

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
and we have the final results now as the

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.490 
and we have the final results now as the
night<00:05:29.940> goes<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.450> my<00:05:30.720> hair<00:05:30.960> will<00:05:31.140> get<00:05:31.230> more

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
night goes on my hair will get more

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.020 
night goes on my hair will get more
volume<00:05:31.950> because<00:05:32.010> it's<00:05:32.250> still<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.460> little<00:05:32.700> damp

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
volume because it's still a little damp

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.210 
volume because it's still a little damp
I<00:05:33.390> don't<00:05:33.810> like<00:05:33.960> to<00:05:34.050> dry<00:05:34.260> it<00:05:34.320> all<00:05:34.620> the<00:05:35.100> way

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
I don't like to dry it all the way

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.620 
I don't like to dry it all the way
because<00:05:35.400> then<00:05:35.670> it<00:05:35.760> gets<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:36.000> little<00:05:36.210> crunchy

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
because then it gets a little crunchy

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.600 
because then it gets a little crunchy
but<00:05:37.140> this<00:05:37.350> is<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:37.590> final<00:05:37.920> result<00:05:38.040> for<00:05:38.400> right

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
but this is the final result for right

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.880 
but this is the final result for right
now<00:05:38.640> I<00:05:39.120> will<00:05:39.720> turn<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.140> camera<00:05:40.560> back<00:05:40.860> on

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
now I will turn the camera back on

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.370 
now I will turn the camera back on
probably<00:05:41.790> in<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.090> morning<00:05:42.480> and<00:05:42.690> let<00:05:43.080> you<00:05:43.200> guys
