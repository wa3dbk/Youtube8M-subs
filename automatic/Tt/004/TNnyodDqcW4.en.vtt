00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.490 
we're going to do the reverse light LEDs
so<00:00:17.619> for<00:00:18.189> this<00:00:18.310> we're<00:00:18.550> just<00:00:18.699> gonna<00:00:18.820> need<00:00:19.500> the

reverse lights so what you do take a

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.489 
reverse lights so what you do take a
close<00:00:31.570> be<00:00:31.750> driver<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.109> here<00:00:32.289> comes<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.809> this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
close be driver in here comes and this

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:38.819 
close be driver in here comes and this
is<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.339> bulb<00:00:36.550> this<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:36.909> a<00:00:36.940> socket<00:00:37.269> to<00:00:37.659> get<00:00:38.649> this

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
is the bulb this is a socket to get this

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.669 
is the bulb this is a socket to get this
out<00:00:39.039> you<00:00:39.249> have<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.460> turn<00:00:39.609> it<00:00:39.789> one<00:00:39.909> quarter

00:00:40.669 --> 00:00:40.679 
out you have to turn it one quarter

and turn it the other way so that's it

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.320 
and turn it the other way so that's it
got<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.560> bulb<00:01:32.740> in<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.810> put<00:01:35.050> it<00:01:35.170> back<00:01:35.320> in

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
on angle like this turn it clockwise

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.140 
on angle like this turn it clockwise
till<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.640> clicks<00:01:44.760> come<00:01:45.760> in<00:01:45.850> here<00:01:45.970> with<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
till it clicks come in here with the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.670 
till it clicks come in here with the
panel<00:01:47.580> pop<00:01:48.580> it<00:01:48.730> in<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:50.230> you're<00:01:50.290> done

alright<00:01:51.340> so<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.640> got<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:51.940> in<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.330> other

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
alright so we got it in on the other

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.320 
alright so we got it in on the other
side<00:01:52.720> those<00:01:53.409> are<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.700> lights<00:01:54.700> we<00:01:54.850> just<00:01:55.030> put<00:01:55.210> in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
side those are the lights we just put in

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.420 
side those are the lights we just put in
the<00:01:56.050> other<00:01:56.260> video

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the other video

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.410 
the other video
do<00:01:59.300> zeolites<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.640> again<00:02:01.640> very<00:02:01.940> easy<00:02:02.270> very

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
do zeolites and again very easy very

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.480 
do zeolites and again very easy very
simple<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:03.200> think<00:02:03.410> this<00:02:03.560> cost<00:02:03.830> me<00:02:03.950> two<00:02:04.130> dollars

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
simple I think this cost me two dollars

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.510 
simple I think this cost me two dollars
for<00:02:05.450> these<00:02:05.570> two<00:02:05.750> bulbs<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.260> it<00:02:06.710> makes<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.340> world

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
for these two bulbs and it makes a world

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.370 
for these two bulbs and it makes a world
of<00:02:07.700> difference<00:02:07.760> it's<00:02:08.360> much<00:02:08.750> safer<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:11.380> light

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
of difference it's much safer and light

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.200 
of difference it's much safer and light
replacements<00:02:12.980> probably<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.850> easiest

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
replacements probably the easiest

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.970 
replacements probably the easiest
