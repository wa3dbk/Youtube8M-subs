glycogen<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.490> use<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.150> energy<00:01:12.570> later<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
glycogen to use this energy later on so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.740 
glycogen to use this energy later on so
right<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.550> morning<00:01:14.970> blood<00:01:15.270> Sugar's<00:01:15.660> low

glycogen and they're gonna be used as

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.520 
glycogen and they're gonna be used as
energy<00:01:30.240> throughout<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> day<00:01:31.050> especially

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530

you've got energy to get through a 40

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.860 
you've got energy to get through a 40
minute<00:03:39.260> workout<00:03:39.940> spartacus<00:03:40.940> okay

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.680 

so<00:03:45.230> we've<00:03:45.470> talked<00:03:45.709> about<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.400> right<00:03:46.700> time<00:03:47.450> to

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
so we've talked about the right time to

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.460 
so we've talked about the right time to
eat<00:03:47.840> carbs

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
eat carbs

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.920

possible and that our vegetables and

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.140 
possible and that our vegetables and
theirs<00:04:01.069> I'm<00:04:01.220> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> provide<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:01.700> list<00:04:02.000> of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
theirs I'm going to provide a list of

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.820 
theirs I'm going to provide a list of
vegetables<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.750> are<00:04:02.989> what<00:04:03.379> I<00:04:03.410> call<00:04:03.680> the

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
vegetables that are what I call the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.619 
vegetables that are what I call the
metabolic<00:04:04.250> vegetables<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.150> ones<00:04:05.360> that

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
metabolic vegetables the ones that

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.670 
metabolic vegetables the ones that
really<00:04:06.410> give<00:04:06.590> me<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.860> metabolic<00:04:07.580> effect<00:04:08.090> of

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
really give me that metabolic effect of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.890 
really give me that metabolic effect of
fat<00:04:09.680> burn<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.220> what<00:04:10.849> I<00:04:11.120> mean<00:04:11.299> by<00:04:11.390> metabolic

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
fat burn and what I mean by metabolic

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.380 
fat burn and what I mean by metabolic
effect<00:04:12.260> is<00:04:12.470> these<00:04:12.980> carbs<00:04:13.549> or<00:04:13.910> started<00:04:14.299> these

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
effect is these carbs or started these

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.520 
effect is these carbs or started these
vegetables<00:04:15.080> are<00:04:15.860> very<00:04:16.220> low<00:04:16.459> in<00:04:16.609> calories<00:04:17.239> but

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
vegetables are very low in calories but

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.170 
vegetables are very low in calories but
cause<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.799> body<00:04:19.040> to<00:04:19.190> expend<00:04:19.729> a<00:04:19.820> lot<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:20.000> energy

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
cause the body to expend a lot of energy

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.620 
cause the body to expend a lot of energy
to<00:04:20.600> metabolize<00:04:21.019> them<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:21.979> you're<00:04:22.160> actually

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
to metabolize them so you're actually

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.390 
to metabolize them so you're actually
burning<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.870> lot<00:04:24.020> more<00:04:24.080> calories<00:04:24.290> then<00:04:25.160> the

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
burning a lot more calories then the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.530 
burning a lot more calories then the
calories<00:04:25.760> are<00:04:25.850> taking<00:04:26.180> in<00:04:26.270> from<00:04:26.450> the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
calories are taking in from the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.780 
calories are taking in from the
vegetable<00:04:26.990> which<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.260> amazing<00:04:27.889> for<00:04:28.070> fat<00:04:28.580> loss

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
vegetable which is amazing for fat loss

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.990 
okay so let's talk about different types
of<00:04:48.990> carbs<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:49.980> went<00:04:50.340> through<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.520> quick<00:04:50.730> list

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
of carbs so I went through a quick list

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.370 
of carbs so I went through a quick list
but<00:04:51.240> let<00:04:51.390> me<00:04:51.450> just<00:04:51.630> break<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.960> down<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.140> little

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
but let me just break it down a little

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
involved in each type of carbs so the

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.240 
involved in each type of carbs so the
first<00:04:56.910> our<00:04:57.360> whole<00:04:57.600> grains<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.440> whole<00:04:58.980> grains

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
first our whole grains and whole grains

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.500 
first our whole grains and whole grains
are<00:04:59.400> great<00:04:59.610> because<00:04:59.760> they're<00:05:00.120> high<00:05:00.300> in<00:05:00.330> fiber

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
are great because they're high in fiber

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.080 
are great because they're high in fiber
they're<00:05:01.440> very<00:05:01.770> low<00:05:01.980> in<00:05:02.010> fat<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.670> it's<00:05:02.940> a

expend<00:05:55.080> more<00:05:55.350> energy<00:05:55.410> which<00:05:56.160> is<00:05:56.340> calories

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
expend more energy which is calories

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.990 
expend more energy which is calories
more<00:05:57.090> calories<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.810> burn<00:05:58.530> them<00:05:58.830> so<00:05:59.280> they<00:05:59.820> get

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
more calories to burn them so they get

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.430 
more calories to burn them so they get
that<00:06:00.180> great<00:06:00.390> metabolic<00:06:00.900> effects<00:06:01.260> like<00:06:01.350> a

that great metabolic effects like a
negative<00:06:01.890> effect<00:06:02.220> so<00:06:02.729> the<00:06:03.210> more<00:06:03.450> vegetables

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
negative effect so the more vegetables

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.350
