00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
be able to make of material and texture

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.969 
be able to make of material and texture
built<00:01:29.149> into<00:01:29.420> one<00:01:29.630> that<00:01:29.899> represents<00:01:30.110> all<00:01:30.710> these

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
built into one that represents all these

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.440 
built into one that represents all these
little<00:01:31.189> details<00:01:31.310> okay

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450

so what you do is back it all the way

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.620 
so what you do is back it all the way
down<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:35.360> then<00:01:35.630> go<00:01:36.560> into<00:01:36.860> texture<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.000> enable

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
down you then go into texture and enable

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.350 
down you then go into texture and enable
you<00:01:38.780> v's<00:01:39.069> you<00:01:40.069> have<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:40.310> give<00:01:40.429> it<00:01:40.549> you<00:01:40.640> these<00:01:40.909> so

you v's you have to give it you these so

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.999 
you v's you have to give it you these so
we'll<00:01:41.659> give<00:01:42.079> it<00:01:42.110> a<00:01:42.409> UV<00:01:42.770> tiles<00:01:44.170> okay<00:01:45.170> we'll<00:01:45.860> go

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
we'll give it a UV tiles okay we'll go

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.520 
we'll give it a UV tiles okay we'll go
down<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.340> displacement

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
down to displacement

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.779 
down to displacement
go<00:01:48.530> to<00:01:48.649> adaptive<00:01:49.450> turn<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.840> 2048<00:01:54.729> go<00:01:55.729> to

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
go to adaptive turn this to 2048 go to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.320 
go to adaptive turn this to 2048 go to
mode<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:57.250> create<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.310> displacement<00:01:58.700> it's<00:01:59.209> only

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
mode and create a displacement it's only

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.850 
mode and create a displacement it's only
got<00:01:59.539> four<00:01:59.569> levels<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.500> should<00:02:00.679> go<00:02:00.830> pretty

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
got four levels so it should go pretty

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:09.039 
got four levels so it should go pretty
fast<00:02:05.709> now<00:02:06.709> let's<00:02:07.610> grab<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:07.909> alpha<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.630> came

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
fast now let's grab that alpha that came

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:13.319 
fast now let's grab that alpha that came
mmm<00:02:10.069> see<00:02:10.429> now<00:02:11.299> it<00:02:11.420> doesn't<00:02:11.569> make<00:02:11.780> too<00:02:11.930> much

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
mmm see now it doesn't make too much

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.170 
mmm see now it doesn't make too much
resemblance<00:02:14.329> to<00:02:14.630> whatever<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.260> guy<00:02:15.709> is<00:02:16.180> based

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
resemblance to whatever the guy is based

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.759 
resemblance to whatever the guy is based
off<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.540> human<00:02:17.840> eye<00:02:17.959> that's<00:02:18.470> for<00:02:18.650> sure

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
off the human eye that's for sure

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.849 
off the human eye that's for sure
because<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.340> UV<00:02:19.609> tiles<00:02:20.560> another<00:02:21.560> thing<00:02:21.739> that

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
because they UV tiles another thing that

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.380 
because they UV tiles another thing that
I<00:02:21.950> found<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.370> some<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:22.970> mat<00:02:23.150> cat

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
I found that some of the mat cat

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.030 
I found that some of the mat cat
materials<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.140> know<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.319> might<00:02:24.739> think<00:02:24.980> that

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
materials you know you might think that

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.789 
materials you know you might think that
it's<00:02:25.489> going<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:25.850> be<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.150> shiny<00:02:26.420> as<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.870> new<00:02:27.230> no

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
it's going to be as shiny as that new no

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.099 
it's going to be as shiny as that new no
Mac<00:02:28.280> hat<00:02:28.459> materials<00:02:28.970> do<00:02:29.450> kind<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.840> look<00:02:30.049> a

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.109 
Mac hat materials do kind of look a

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.319 
Mac hat materials do kind of look a
little<00:02:30.470> bit<00:02:30.650> awful<00:02:31.040> with<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.310> sometimes<00:02:31.549> but

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
little bit awful with it sometimes but

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.530 
little bit awful with it sometimes but
we're<00:02:32.600> going<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.870> use<00:02:33.049> in<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.650> cat<00:02:33.889> material

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
we're going to use in that cat material

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.059 
we're going to use in that cat material
let's<00:02:35.540> say<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:36.500> pewter<00:02:37.160> for<00:02:37.519> once<00:02:37.750> okay<00:02:39.069> what

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
let's say this pewter for once okay what

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.259 
let's say this pewter for once okay what
I'm<00:02:40.160> going<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.340> do<00:02:40.549> now<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.060> take<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.510> pewter

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
I'm going to do now is take the pewter

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.539 
I'm going to do now is take the pewter
go<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.389> here<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.750> say<00:02:45.109> crop<00:02:45.380> and<00:02:45.590> fill<00:02:48.549> with

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
go in here and say crop and fill with

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.900 
go in here and say crop and fill with
that<00:02:49.700> alpha<00:02:50.180> lit<00:02:50.690> up<00:02:51.160> it'll<00:02:52.160> go<00:02:52.280> in<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.760> make

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
that alpha lit up it'll go in and make

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.309 
that alpha lit up it'll go in and make
this<00:02:53.120> texture<00:02:54.310> okay<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.489> based<00:02:56.209> on<00:02:56.480> let's<00:02:57.200> say

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
this texture okay and based on let's say

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.729 
this texture okay and based on let's say
down<00:02:57.859> here<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.850> depth<00:02:59.150> factor<00:02:59.389> is<00:02:59.720> set<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.079> 2.2

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
down here the depth factor is set to 2.2

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.349 
down here the depth factor is set to 2.2
okay<00:03:01.130> this<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.579> perfect<00:03:01.819> depth<00:03:02.180> factor

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
okay this is the perfect depth factor

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.270 
okay this is the perfect depth factor
but<00:03:02.810> if<00:03:02.930> I<00:03:03.019> want<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.319> little<00:03:03.500> bit<00:03:03.620> more<00:03:03.680> vivid

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
but if I want a little bit more vivid

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.699 
but if I want a little bit more vivid
like<00:03:04.609> three<00:03:04.850> point<00:03:05.090> three<00:03:05.150> I<00:03:05.569> can<00:03:06.200> then<00:03:06.380> go

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
like three point three I can then go

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.059 
like three point three I can then go
drop<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> fill<00:03:08.060> and<00:03:08.440> you'll<00:03:09.440> see<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.739> bolts

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
drop a fill and you'll see the bolts

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.430 
drop a fill and you'll see the bolts
stick<00:03:10.340> out<00:03:10.489> farther<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.030> more<00:03:11.690> shadows<00:03:12.139> start

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
stick out farther and more shadows start

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.490 
stick out farther and more shadows start
appearing<00:03:13.180> okay<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.239> now<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.780> we<00:03:15.079> have<00:03:15.260> this

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
appearing okay so now that we have this

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.240 
appearing okay so now that we have this

okay<00:03:29.970> good<00:03:30.240> let's<00:03:30.780> go<00:03:31.020> back<00:03:31.260> document<00:03:32.040> new

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
okay good let's go back document new

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.740 
okay good let's go back document new
document<00:03:32.730> no<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.900> let's<00:03:34.170> grab<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:36.150> kickboxer

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
document no and let's grab the kickboxer

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.290 
document no and let's grab the kickboxer
guy<00:03:37.370> click<00:03:38.370> and<00:03:38.550> drag<00:03:38.700> them<00:03:38.880> out<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.209> they

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
guy click and drag them out and they

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.050 
guy click and drag them out and they
edit<00:03:43.459> let's<00:03:44.459> turn<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.000> fat<00:03:45.270> shader<00:03:45.510> 5

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
edit let's turn it to a fat shader 5

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.380 
edit let's turn it to a fat shader 5
turn<00:03:48.060> out<00:03:48.209> an<00:03:48.300> MRG<00:03:48.780> B<00:03:48.989> color<00:03:49.500> fill<00:03:50.040> object<00:03:50.489> ok

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
turn out an MRG B color fill object ok

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.690 
turn out an MRG B color fill object ok
so<00:03:51.450> that<00:03:51.750> filled<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.380> white<00:03:52.709> and<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.520> fat

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
so that filled the white and the fat

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.850 
so that filled the white and the fat
shader<00:03:53.970> 5<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.480> it

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
shader 5 to it

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.410 
shader 5 to it
ok<00:03:55.860> now<00:03:56.160> turn<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.940> off<00:03:57.180> texture<00:03:58.140> import

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
ok now turn this off texture import

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.570 
ok now turn this off texture import
ZBrush<00:04:00.420> document<00:04:00.930> open<00:04:03.110> there<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:04.200> go<00:04:04.580> now

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
ZBrush document open there we go now

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.350 
ZBrush document open there we go now
let's<00:04:05.610> break<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.480> up<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.780> like<00:04:07.320> 4<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:08.269> you<00:04:09.269> can

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
let's break it up to like 4 and you can

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.050 
let's break it up to like 4 and you can
see<00:04:09.570> sure<00:04:10.410> enough<00:04:10.709> all<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.280> bolts<00:04:11.610> are<00:04:11.670> now

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
see sure enough all the bolts are now

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.000 
see sure enough all the bolts are now
highlighted<00:04:12.769> okay<00:04:15.290> let's<00:04:16.290> also<00:04:16.500> burn<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
highlighted okay let's also burn that

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.440 
highlighted okay let's also burn that
into<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.489> object<00:04:18.500> make<00:04:19.500> sure<00:04:19.940> mrgp<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.269> or

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
into the object make sure mrgp is on or

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.860 
into the object make sure mrgp is on or
RGB<00:04:24.110> color<00:04:25.110> from<00:04:25.710> texture<00:04:26.270> ok<00:04:27.270> now<00:04:27.630> it<00:04:27.780> is

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
RGB color from texture ok now it is

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.550 
RGB color from texture ok now it is
burned<00:04:28.169> within<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.680> object<00:04:28.800> for<00:04:29.340> all<00:04:29.520> and

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
burned within the object for all and

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.230 
burned within the object for all and
it's<00:04:31.560> not<00:04:31.680> being<00:04:32.070> represented<00:04:32.729> by<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.820> texture

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
it's not being represented by a texture

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.150 
it's not being represented by a texture
anymore<00:04:33.600> so<00:04:33.840> that's<00:04:34.020> a<00:04:34.140> quick<00:04:34.380> way<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.680> shadow

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
anymore so that's a quick way to shadow

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.380 
anymore so that's a quick way to shadow
your<00:04:35.490> objects<00:04:36.650> and<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.190> go<00:04:38.340> into<00:04:38.550> render

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
your objects and if you go into render

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.140 
your objects and if you go into render
and<00:04:39.570> turn<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.680> flat<00:04:41.100> you'll<00:04:41.669> find<00:04:41.970> that

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
and turn it to flat you'll find that

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.159 
and turn it to flat you'll find that
that<00:04:42.560> texture<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.740> already<00:04:44.430> self<00:04:44.729> shaded<00:04:45.169> okay

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
that texture is already self shaded okay

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.750 
that texture is already self shaded okay
that's<00:04:46.350> one<00:04:46.620> method<00:04:46.979> and<00:04:47.100> in<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.460> next<00:04:47.640> movie

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
that's one method and in the next movie

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.870 
that's one method and in the next movie
I'm<00:04:48.000> going<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.300> cover<00:04:48.450> another
