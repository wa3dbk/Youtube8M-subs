00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.700
 hello friends you probably noticed 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.900
 what do we have like some 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.170
 irregularity last few days 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.000
 in the appearance of the video thing is that here 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.490
 us on the ground 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.520
 in the family can say such a mournful 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.750
 events and we must setting 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.590
 find out and decide will return to the circles 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:40.400
 my own and I want to say so 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:45.550
 you know what I'm experiencing is losing 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:48.320
 very close person it is difficult and 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.140
 even when in general you know it 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.720
 happen and still it seems that it is not 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.379
 happen right today or tomorrow it 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:01.360
 it is not known when and here and 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.360
 understand and still unexpected and 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.020
 the hardest thing about it when 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.930
 the person is gone and you understand that you are 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.390
 you can not return anything and debts 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.960
 you can’t return and the wine is not smoothed 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.330
 you can 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.810
 and just do nothing good 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.960
 Can Now would not you, and yet 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.649
 man alive the barrier to this I meanwhile 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.800
 man alive seems like there are so many 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.979
 time for everything well for everything well here 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.539
 you can not now have another one 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.580
 priority is urgent there 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.759
 there is an urgent need to run up here 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.000
 is there someone to answer and so on and 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.280
 in this race and 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.610
 I would say that very often the most 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.220
 close people who need something can 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.580
 to give maximum attention to these 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.660
 people are most up to not working out 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.720
 our attention 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.360
 and then you will not return further without correcting 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.220
 then you will only speak to yourself so 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:09.640
 so I could have known i loved 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:14.380
 I live here cases of feelings it is no longer 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.050
 you will return it and so on the sly 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.750
 complex know with age arises like 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.000
 somehow while you live you are small 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.950
 tramp foreman anyway how young and 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 you cover the top 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.780
 older generations there grandparents 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.180
 There parents then so slowly 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.850
 it means that the upper layers are removed 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.480
 removed removed and you grow up and you 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.270
 you come 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.239
 But in this state when there is no one 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.310
 no and only you and 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.799
 and here's how it is on you and the matter is not even that 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.850
 what are you what are you next some sense 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:54.010
 there and so forth you are glad everything but this 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.280
 feeling openly steoka laziness 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:01.989
 do you understand nobody, nobody, nobody 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.890
 appeal no one not to rely on and 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.140
 not in the sense of relying on that 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.680
 no money to lend but well, that's just 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.480
 when there are older generations 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.519
 they may be with us there in conflict in 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.950
 some or there is not necessarily all 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.320
 happens smoothly but they are here one 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.690
 in itself the fact that they are he 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.840
 very worth it 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.980
 I often know such an association 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.250
 I go in my mind when here's a kid 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.330
 small in the arena of whales jumping or hatch 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.730
 and there is played and mom is near there somewhere 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.299
 in the kitchen is messing around or around the house and 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.819
 baby okay she there okay a 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.860
 suddenly you went somewhere well I do n’t know where 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.870
 she's that other room flag and suddenly 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.760
 baby panic starts to get worried 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.900
 starts to worry starts 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.209
 be nervous 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.069
 cry can why there was no 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.140
 to get in not that she needed to 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.959
 direct communication is in the form 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.120
 talk of some or there something 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.459
 bring carry no but the fact 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.640
 presence here i am such a parallel 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:17.829
 to spent and immigration when around 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.180
 do you remember our our generation 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.789
 migration when suddenly 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.310
 the gate opened when suddenly like an avalanche 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.169
 gushed eat look there every day 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.449
 someone struck out of notebooks 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.539
 that is, not that you can't live 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.080
 what you there I do not know but somehow 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.210
 basically stopped 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.490
 functioning but here is the feeling that 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.210
 there is no near you stay in the arena ki 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:42.310
 and mom is not there and dad is there 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.880
 little brother aren't you somehow you're alone in this 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.950
 they same disketch is about the same 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.910
 happens when people leave and and 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.689
 leave forever and and do nothing and 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.089
 why not 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:05:02.449
 I call like all of us so far 

00:04:59.089 --> 00:05:04.459
 people have to do what you can do 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.979
 then what you want is already in and the possibility of 

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:07.579
 I will probably not be on this one 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.209
 will finish 

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.209
 substantially
