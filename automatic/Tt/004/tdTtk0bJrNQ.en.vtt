00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
of a drain outside you making a little

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
guess you can use it for fibers there it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.689 
guess you can use it for fibers there it
would<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.710> nothing<00:00:16.890> wrong<00:00:17.039> with<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.400> using

this thing but it basically plugs into
the<00:00:58.230> wall<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.469> think<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.859> may<00:00:59.039> need<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.680 
the wall I think you may need the
adapter<00:00:59.670> though<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.180> doesn't<00:01:00.329> come<00:01:00.539> with<00:01:00.660> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
adapter though it doesn't come with that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.039 
adapter though it doesn't come with that
