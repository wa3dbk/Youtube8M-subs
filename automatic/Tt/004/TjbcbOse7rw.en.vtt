it out he is scared but at the same time
has<00:03:06.630> excited<00:03:06.960> so<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:08.790> doesn't<00:03:09.120> assume<00:03:09.390> an<00:03:09.570> that

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
has excited so it doesn't assume an that

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.890 
has excited so it doesn't assume an that
the<00:03:09.780> relationship<00:03:10.260> is<00:03:10.440> over<00:03:11.450> he<00:03:12.450> honestly

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
could really be feeling really deep

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.410 
could really be feeling really deep
feelings<00:03:14.970> for<00:03:15.060> you

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
and he just wants to just get away for a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.090 
and he just wants to just get away for a
second<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.870> figure<00:03:19.410> out<00:03:19.530> what's<00:03:19.770> going

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
second and just figure out what's going

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.520 
second and just figure out what's going
on<00:03:20.250> because<00:03:20.459> you<00:03:20.850> know<00:03:21.420> he's<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.660> guy<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.350> know

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
on because you know he's a guy you know

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.290 
on because you know he's a guy you know
he<00:03:22.709> probably<00:03:22.980> has<00:03:23.250> never<00:03:23.459> had<00:03:23.700> these<00:03:23.850> types<00:03:24.150> of

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
he probably has never had these types of

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.690 
he probably has never had these types of
feelings<00:03:24.360> before<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.230> he's<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:26.220> some<00:03:26.430> degree

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
feelings before and he's to some degree

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.600 
feelings before and he's to some degree
scared<00:03:27.150> but<00:03:27.990> he<00:03:28.050> also<00:03:28.200> made<00:03:28.470> maybe<00:03:28.740> as<00:03:28.980> well<00:03:29.220> he

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
scared but he also made maybe as well he

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.270 
scared but he also made maybe as well he
also<00:03:29.790> may<00:03:30.030> be<00:03:30.060> excited<00:03:30.810> as<00:03:31.110> well<00:03:31.320> it's<00:03:32.070> almost

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
also may be excited as well it's almost

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.850 
also may be excited as well it's almost
a<00:03:32.520> weird<00:03:32.850> sort<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.360> combination<00:03:34.140> of<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.590> two

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
a weird sort of combination of the two

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.470 
a weird sort of combination of the two
so<00:03:35.100> those<00:03:35.490> are<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.700> two<00:03:35.880> scenarios<00:03:36.209> that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
so those are the two scenarios that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.100 
so those are the two scenarios that
you're<00:03:36.630> probably<00:03:36.840> looking<00:03:37.290> at<00:03:37.410> okay<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:39.110> that

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
you're probably looking at okay and that

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.840 
you're probably looking at okay and that
that's<00:03:40.290> really<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.770> if<00:03:40.920> your<00:03:41.310> boyfriend<00:03:41.700> says

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
that's really it if your boyfriend says

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.190 
that's really it if your boyfriend says
he<00:03:42.000> wants<00:03:42.239> a<00:03:42.270> break<00:03:42.480> from<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.720> relationship

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
he wants a break from the relationship

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.720 
he wants a break from the relationship
those<00:03:43.739> are<00:03:43.890> probably<00:03:44.070> too<00:03:44.340> soon<00:03:44.459> as<00:03:44.610> you

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
those are probably too soon as you

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.729 
those are probably too soon as you
looking<00:03:45.000> at<00:03:45.120> now<00:03:45.630> there<00:03:46.140> could<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.290> more<00:03:46.530> but

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
looking at now there could be more but

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.630 
looking at now there could be more but
these<00:03:47.250> are<00:03:47.400> probably<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.820> two<00:03:48.090> most<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640
