 So that's it's a little legal 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.390
 to whom put a magazine that I did 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.250

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:47.800
 Drake's room will have it blank 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.410
 surrounded with tape so white there a 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.420
 light during the night

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.850
 the athenaeum here is here it is a window 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.350
 frames broken that's why we're going 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:08.170
 use the channels so here it's 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.030
 the anxiety is the little image that 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.330
 Normally we find when you buy 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:16.480
 the frames and bahia that and then after by 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.490
 on it I put green because when 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.470
 even so much I like the noise 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.570
 so for the dhabi room it's the 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.980
