00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.980
 that 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.080

 and they do not even apologize both are 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.079

 to be present with the lawyer with 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:26.490

 canada I repeat and what to measure from that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.640
 way I feel very sad if I do not 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.550
 Sir, not the contrary, I keep this 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.479
 with all the love of the world and believe me 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.199
 that when there are children helpless and 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.440
 children for the institution that I go for free 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.840
 to wear this uniform I do it with a lot 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.760
 With a lot of love and a lot of honor, believe me 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.090
 that has hurt me at the bottom of the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.010
 I tell you this because I believe that 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.710
 use a person like that I think that 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.159
 I do not deserve it because I think that this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.960
 it weighs more there is still much more much more 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.240
 to clarify I tell you with all the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.970
 sadness and with all sincerity 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.479
 sincere I tell you that suddenly 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.220
 you are a moment if you also 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.250
 I imagine you have the soul of a child 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.560
 that you have that heart that stops 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 them you live that by thank you like 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.750
 you say many generations 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.119
 they ask thanks to that sensitivity 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 that we can never break it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.200
 we can not destroy it because that comes out 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.439
 of the heart that should never exist 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.720
 never should we not fight or 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.000
 destroy us because I think that has not 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.270
 born of you because you are not like that 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.920
 I'm sure and I give my life I know what 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.979
 I say that you face me 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.110
 it's about not telling me that if you see me 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.970
 work would not tell me that if you see me 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.330
 in each country in each city in each 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.180
 nation wearing this uniform this 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.549
 quality that you know to be much better 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.920
 that I but I am nothing but I wear it 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.830
 with all the humility and affection and the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.560
 chest to tell him that you 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.720
 maybe in spite of everything take 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.910
 suddenly profiting from the paper that 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.740
 is interpreting is making money 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.240
 is that we have also received the 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.430
 information that also opens the circus 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.740
 for some some young people who 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.320
 wrote and form for free 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.330
 That is also true, of course, many 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.250
 Sometimes the circus has opened 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.880
 free institutions that have 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.910
 awarded for characterizing the circus we are 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.890
 this humble server omar felipe pineapple 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.860
 marquez who plays kiko that thanks 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.840
 thanks to all of you and thanks to that 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.880
 character that I do not have in you what 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.040
 would happen if suddenly to my son's house 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.870
 in July I think that or Carlos Villagrán is going 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.010
 to start to start a trial has 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.510
 suddenly afraid of losing the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.840
 opportunity to continue inviting kiko 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.350
 Well, I think that if it is when 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.780
 the laws but I are human laws and 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.300
 human laws have many errors 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.310
 they are human I think that as you 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.560
 said one day when I started are laws 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.050
 divine because the only one who has the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.300
 truth is God the only one who has the 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.370
 truth of all of us god is not 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.850
 the human being the human being has a lot 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.010
 plus 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.990
 the sea is publicly apologized 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.310
 at this moment suddenly for some 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.680
 confusion has reached the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.540
 information to carlos villagrán or is that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.640
 Follow the position to say I will continue 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.620
 working and I do not have to why give 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.320
 explanations to carlo villagrán not to 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.520
 otherwise I am here because of the program 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.890
 that if you do not give me the opportunity 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.380
 Well, like I'm going to clarify 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.690
 say that it does not have effect of 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.580
 right as a human being pre out there 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.890
 beyond that human being of the 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.050
 sensitivity that that man has I think 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.960
 I that he is not like that I think and I 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.400
 I think beyond the cameras people 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.470
 beyond the thoughts for that more 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.950
 there that man I know there's more 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.920
 still to give and if he says to me 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.320
 you say that I will not interpret anymore 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.600
 I would leave him if he told me he is 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.210
 saying publicly in any case 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.070
 He knows very well that Peru in Mexico 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.390
 let's center to play this 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.280
 program is apologizing 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.470
 public with carlos villagrán 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.380
 if I'm in faults would logically have 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.230
 to say sorry if I were in 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.780
 the fault I tell you honestly but if 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.639
 it's not like that and if it's not like that 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.740
 tell me never more than an interpreter if 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.300
 I will not do it, I will not do it 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.240
 I will not interpret this again 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.530
 staff but what can I do if inside 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.419
 of human things 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.669
 I repeat human again if there are errors 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.919
 I apologize if there are things 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.660
 human but more the spiritual 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.000
 it's deeper I know that you have it 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.380
 in recognition of each part of the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.990
 honorable municipal council of the city 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.450
 of oruro that also guarantees of course 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.820
 his work tells us that he is very 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.680
 well done anyway and in the country 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.380
 the circus is triumphing is happening 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.760
 great and also obviously with the paper 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.760
 from kiko yes yes 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.640
 that for me is the knowledge of 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.310
 city ​​of oruro to name logically of the 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.130
 circus we are one of the national circuses 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.930

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.850
 that there is love that almost comes to us 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.100
 circus down by the wind of more than 5 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.660
 150 kilometers around here in the city of 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.040
 holy cross that each of the 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.960
 workers each of the artists 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.539
 each of the owners put 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.639
 and I also to raise that company 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.370
 so that the children come the parents of 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.440
 family to simply see a 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.660
 character that is characterized by this 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.660
 humble server but recognizes
