00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 Good morning, good morning, the rural globe was 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.639
 new this week until the seashore was 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.400
 documentary that is happening with 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.650
 grain harvest on the road giving access 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.980
 to the port of santos the queue of trucks 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.949
 continues to clutter the traffic in the courtyard 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.109
 is also always crowded and the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.390
 truck drivers are suffering because of 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.789
 delay of who thinks that there is a truck 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.220
 others in the grain transport has not 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.869
 saw the truth is that the harvest of this 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.130
 year is so great that they are missing 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.170
 trucks 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.660
 the rural globe traveled through factories and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 dealers in various parts of the country and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.950
 only found optimism with a good 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.719
 progress of sales or more 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.789
 has no way to delay the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.739
 investment in roads and ports the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.350
 porto de santos registered one more 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.640
 busy week 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.829
 congesting the streets and roads of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.239
 access to reporter cristina vieira 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.340
 followed the situation of the truck drivers 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.100
 hours in the queues for 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.109
 to discharge the soybean or corn a problem 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.799
 which is already affecting even businesses with 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.299
 large importers from the top the image 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939
 impress 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.970
 are miles of road with trucks 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.030
 that hardly leave the place all with the same 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.689
 destination the port of santos the main one of the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.869
 parents 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.380
 the problem of goya the soybean gate of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.150
 mato grosso do sul last year 80% of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.189
 everything that went through the harbor was 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.250
 transported by highways 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.229
 the remainder by the railways when 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.790
 talks only about the loading of grains 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.189
 to the port of santos 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.950
 the central-west region of the country leads 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.250
 mato grosso and goiás were responsible 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.860
 for 83% of soybean and corn 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.850
 last year being that only the bush 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.090
 wholesale exported 60% of soybeans and 70% of 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.340
 cent of the corn that came out of saints as 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.420
 the supercritical bottlenecks are 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.820
 evident 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.799
 the most critical point is an excerpt from 25 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.719
 kilometers that leads the terminals 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.759
 port of guarujá 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.909
 the course that should take a maximum of 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.360
 40 minutes became a test of resistance 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.200
 for drivers is the case of their 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
 Leandro as 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.360
 he brought soy from sinop mato grosso 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.209
 How long have you been since you arrived? 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.940
 here it took to unload soy 25 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.060
 hours pulling the sleepless queue 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.030
 I picked up 148 trucks in front of me 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.330
 but I did not like the hours 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.670
 up to discharge to the sorting 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.160
 landing of cargoes in the port 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.709
 two patio patios installed in 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.019
 cubatão the neighboring municipality to santos 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.730
 before reaching the terminals 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.310
 truck drivers need to go through 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.170
 here and are parked waiting for the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.080
 release to unload 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.090
 the driver must present all 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.080
 documentation of the goods to receive 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.080
 a password 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.540
 the vehicle can only leave here when the 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.849
 company that hired the service to release 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.489
 the load with it waiting for it 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.739
 usually is six hours in the last 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:10.270
 days goes from 20 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.470
 I am she passed and 24/26 hours that 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.620
 I stayed here in the pot 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.110
 we hope the release already the stay is 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.989
 pays truckers complain about the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.180
 structure the patio when it rains 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.130
 You arrive here, there's no way you can get down. 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.860
 from your truck to make a 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.569
 biggest problem facing the meal 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.640
 drivers who bring grain to 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.630
 exporters who do not operate with 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.090
 patios 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.400
 these truckers thicken the ranks 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.260
 on public roads only entered that will 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.739
 to discharge the company to the 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.260
 identify on the street has bathroom has no 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.000
 nothing there 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.190
 according to data from codesp company docks 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.730
 of São Paulo the movement of trucks 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.640
 carrying grain increased by 49% in 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.190
 February 2013 in relation to the same 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.130
 last month for the director 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.120
 the problem is access to the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.600
 port 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:10.269
 not enough you have modern terminals 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.730
 canal deepening works 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.220
 finally working within the best 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.989
 technology if you do not have a 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.650
 compatible accessibility 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.440
 with this development in the port operates 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.310
 19 companies shipping corn and soybeans 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.860
 bran 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.210
 the capacity is to receive seven ships 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.849
 simultaneously 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.370
 the expectation of the port administration 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:38.000
 of saints is that in this harvest they go through 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.039
 here 35 million tons of grain 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.500
 eight and a half percent more than in the 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:45.349
 last year only on this ship are being 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.490
 now shipped 70 thousand tons of 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:51.860
 soy to Singapore this week 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.569
 because of the delay in shipments a 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.000
 importer of china has announced that 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.400
 cancel the purchase of Brazilian soybeans 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.590
 a serious problem according to the president 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.830
 association of producers of 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.349
 soybean from mato grosso carlos fávaro no 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.389
 I have confirmation of at least ten 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.340
 ships have already been canceled on account of 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.380
 delay in loading in ports 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.849
 Brazilians basically your company 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.550
 our biggest buyer 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:19.430
 bought 30% of the Brazilian crop and 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.919
 buyer is aware of the jungle harvest 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.500
 wholesale starting January february 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.389
 paid well paid well paid to have the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.070
 first Brazilian soybean and today it is not 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.800
 able to pick up a computer that 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.840
 canceled looking for soy in argentina 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.449
 in porto alegre the market analyst 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.580
 antônio sartori believes that the 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.979
 advertising is a buyers strategy 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.080
 Chinese to lower prices 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:44.449
 there has actually been a delay in 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.789
 shipments for two reasons because the 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.349
 early in the harvest delay because it has 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.550
 it rained a lot in the ports 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.159
 so what are you saying will 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.169
 Can not cancel because I do not have 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.389
 options to where to look for two million 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.240
 short term and they will not 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.240
 imports at least 63 billion this year. 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.270
 year and with the objective would be china 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.009
 make this Chinese ad has five thousand 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.849
 years of history are strategic are 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.800
 smart 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.139
 every time they put the rumor in the 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.630
 The market always has san antonio 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.729
 scares and occurs in selling the market drops 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.330
 china will buy again they need 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.180
 purchase 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.310
 they will buy they have no option 2 in 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.770
 the carts that descend to the 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.350
 port do not return empty 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.590
 many drivers only 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.360
 the sawing of fertilizers resembles 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.920
 his leandro comelli that we show in the 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.560
 beginning of report 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.530
 he waited 25 hours to unload 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.400
 but the truck is full again 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.560
 left the soybean and will carry fertilizers 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.730
 I loaded the engine tonight on the 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.210
 state of são paulo interior of são 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.830
 Paulo 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.920
 you have a deadline to deliver this 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.600
 fertilizer has no scheduled time but the 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.760
 People want to download tomorrow to be able to 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.320
 to follow behind other cargo being comes with 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.320
 more soybeans again
