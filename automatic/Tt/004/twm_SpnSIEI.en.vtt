00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.040
 next to the head up display the new one 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.690
 interface of kompendium 2015 became 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.309
 now also the new boards 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.759
 unlocked and you can visit us 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.320
 buy and look like those look 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:21.800
 so I can place here 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.800
 That's what they look like 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:33.190
 I find very cool up close 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:36.900
 so they look so small 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 stone hands coming from the earth 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.220
 I think that's pretty cool especially here 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.960
 Inventory shows that are from the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.870
 motto abi los as in steinheim comes from 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.360
 that contains the eye up the word 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.860
 you get on level 1 when I am 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.010
 not would be wrong to say right 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.900
 but very briefly compendium in the car 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.629
 sweetheart 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:04.119
 Here is the head up display gets it 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 but not on level 1 you get 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.930
 maybe not 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:16.000
 I just want it manual motto shows 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.110
 emoticons custom fountain effect needs 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.439
 but here is his compendium international 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.960
 pack head up display hud sports are there 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.679
 they are international 1015 wards altogether 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.520
 overlook 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:33.909
 So everyone gets the companion 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 also needs to level 1 so they are as 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.869
 item and are actually from walls 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.310
 even the coolest ones I think are right 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.000
 it will not be that beautiful anymore 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.560
 diced or taken and in the game 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.670
 I also think it's pretty chic 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.330
 especially if you have the eye in between 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.220
 to lose 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.039
 so drop then give up again 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.619
 hardly anybody can celebrate it 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.360
 No one here would be if they still 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.100
 now and then different eyes 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.179
 not just picking up 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:05.470
 but also found happiness 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.450
 while losing do not know it 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.640

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.470

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.750
 for a quick look what else is coming 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.450
 on level 1 what everyone still got was 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.450
 The rewards are still missing the new terra 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.280

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:27.070

 The white hussy messenger is one more 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.630

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.440

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.900

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.299

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.489

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.980

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.660
 and I'm really looking forward to that 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.609

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.650
 until now there is moonlight snow 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.359
 and rain those by chance 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.250
 I'm pretty cool 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.150
