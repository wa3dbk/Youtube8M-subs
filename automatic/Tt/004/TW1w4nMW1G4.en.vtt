00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.609
 after having done this step on 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.560
 second step 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.769
 let's go do this kind of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.130
 working with a career like that 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.990
 that of body builders who use precisely 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.560
 to store brands 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.250
 so this one publishes or pasta 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:29.599
 usual pasta and let's go to put of a 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.599
 make these little dough taps 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.829
 she is we put it up altogether 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:43.620
 so as to let these these 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:49.460
 let's say this processing can come out 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:55.199
 out at the time we then go to 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.510
 polishing this serves precisely to give 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 even more the decorative aspect than 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:13.100
 to the biggest trowel and then let's go 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:18.360
 to put it up let's leave it leave 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:22.799
 that this here these beer taps 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:29.189
 sierra are not always direct data 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:35.840
 so but just 11 that is we say and scattered 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:39.240
 a bit in the forella then after 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.130
 complete them perfectly then can 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:47.340
 perfectly complete all 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:57.420
 after he starts to pull the dough 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:02:08.600
 so let's close them upstairs 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:14.310
 then assemble everything at this point 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:18.750
 We expect that you begin to breathe a little the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.620
 the painting and then we go to the exit 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.620
 re completely
