transmit<00:04:08.410> data<00:04:08.590> this<00:04:09.549> allows<00:04:09.820> automakers<00:04:10.360> to

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
transmit data this allows automakers to

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.080 
transmit data this allows automakers to
eliminate<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.380> transmitter<00:04:12.100> in<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.610> car<00:04:12.820> and

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
eliminate a transmitter in the car and

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.420 
eliminate a transmitter in the car and
who'da<00:04:13.750> thunk<00:04:13.900> you<00:04:14.079> can<00:04:14.230> do<00:04:14.380> all<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.739> just

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
who'da thunk you can do all that just

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.210 
who'da thunk you can do all that just

with a key fob coming up next a look at
a<00:04:18.370> new<00:04:18.729> recognition<00:04:19.630> technology<00:04:20.410> that

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
a new recognition technology that

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:38.090 
a new recognition technology that
recognizes<00:04:21.640> your<00:04:22.180> gestures

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.740 

last<00:04:39.100> year<00:04:39.370> we<00:04:39.490> showed<00:04:39.699> you<00:04:39.880> technology<00:04:40.540> from

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
last year we showed you technology from

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.600 
last year we showed you technology from
Visteon<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.620> refers<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.280> as<00:04:42.430> its

haptic touch and a display that lights
up<00:04:49.570> when<00:04:49.750> it<00:04:49.870> detects<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.440> hand<00:04:50.770> that's<00:04:50.979> near<00:04:51.250> it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
up when it detects a hand that's near it

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.610 
up when it detects a hand that's near it
this<00:04:52.030> year<00:04:52.210> we<00:04:52.389> got<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:52.690> look<00:04:52.840> at<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.110> updated

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
this year we got to look at the updated

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.830 
this year we got to look at the updated
version<00:04:53.650> Jim<00:04:54.550> Kornacki<00:04:55.000> from<00:04:55.360> Visteon

version Jim Kornacki from Visteon

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.120 
version Jim Kornacki from Visteon
explains<00:04:56.560> what's<00:04:56.830> new<00:04:57.510> we<00:04:58.510> have<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:59.130> spatial

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
explains what's new we have a spatial

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.100 
explains what's new we have a spatial
gesture<00:05:00.490> control<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.030> we<00:05:01.120> added<00:05:01.300> a<00:05:01.600> typical

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
gesture control that we added a typical

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.030 
gesture control that we added a typical
touchscreen<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:02.710> you'll<00:05:02.830> have<00:05:03.010> a

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
touchscreen that you'll have a

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.790 
touchscreen that you'll have a
capacitive<00:05:03.760> touchscreen<00:05:04.270> will<00:05:04.510> lock<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:05.560> will

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
capacitive touchscreen will lock it will

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.529 
capacitive touchscreen will lock it will
have<00:05:05.949> some<00:05:06.130> touch<00:05:06.340> gestures<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.270> that<00:05:07.419> you

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
have some touch gestures and it that you

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.210 
have some touch gestures and it that you
can<00:05:07.750> do<00:05:07.900> you<00:05:08.199> can<00:05:08.229> flip<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.650> screen<00:05:08.889> but<00:05:09.070> this

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
can do you can flip the screen but this

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.560 
can do you can flip the screen but this
one<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.400> do<00:05:09.580> not<00:05:09.760> have<00:05:09.910> to<00:05:10.060> come<00:05:10.210> in<00:05:10.330> contact

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
one you do not have to come in contact

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
one you do not have to come in contact
with<00:05:10.900> it<00:05:11.110> together<00:05:11.260> to<00:05:11.620> change<00:05:11.919> okay<00:05:13.440> so<00:05:14.440> we

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
with it together to change okay so we

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.240 
with it together to change okay so we
use<00:05:14.850> use<00:05:15.850> infrared<00:05:16.510> signal<00:05:17.410> to<00:05:17.620> be<00:05:17.770> able<00:05:17.919> to

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
use use infrared signal to be able to

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.629 
use use infrared signal to be able to
act<00:05:18.580> as<00:05:18.850> a<00:05:18.880> switch<00:05:19.680> be<00:05:20.680> able<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:20.919> move<00:05:21.070> move

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
act as a switch be able to move move

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.450 
act as a switch be able to move move
around<00:05:21.940> and<00:05:22.240> select<00:05:22.600> features<00:05:22.840> on<00:05:23.260> the<00:05:23.620> on<00:05:24.190> the

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
around and select features on the on the

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.250 
around and select features on the on the
property<00:05:24.940> and<00:05:25.110> really<00:05:26.110> when<00:05:26.979> you<00:05:27.070> talk<00:05:27.310> about

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
property and really when you talk about

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.100 
property and really when you talk about
you<00:05:29.260> know<00:05:29.289> infrared<00:05:29.979> technology<00:05:30.220> like<00:05:30.880> this

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
you know infrared technology like this

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.300 
you know infrared technology like this
what<00:05:32.110> would<00:05:32.199> you<00:05:32.350> use<00:05:32.380> it<00:05:32.710> for<00:05:32.740> it's<00:05:33.130> really

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
what would you use it for it's really

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.640 
what would you use it for it's really
meant<00:05:33.639> to<00:05:33.699> augment<00:05:34.270> your<00:05:34.360> HMI<00:05:35.080> system<00:05:35.470> within

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
meant to augment your HMI system within

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.070 
meant to augment your HMI system within
the<00:05:35.830> vehicle<00:05:36.220> it's<00:05:36.460> not<00:05:36.639> meant<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.030> be<00:05:37.120> the

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
the vehicle it's not meant to be the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.810 
the vehicle it's not meant to be the
only<00:05:38.410> thing<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.950> you<00:05:39.039> would<00:05:39.220> have<00:05:39.400> in<00:05:39.460> here

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
only thing that you would have in here

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.610 
only thing that you would have in here
so<00:05:40.030> you<00:05:40.090> have<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.479> move<00:05:40.840> your<00:05:40.900> hands<00:05:41.260> around<00:05:41.410> to

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
so you have to move your hands around to

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.640 
so you have to move your hands around to
control<00:05:42.090> its<00:05:43.090> it's<00:05:43.599> an<00:05:43.750> added<00:05:43.960> feature<00:05:44.110> it's

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
control its it's an added feature it's

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.290 
control its it's an added feature it's
something<00:05:45.039> that<00:05:45.220> you<00:05:45.370> can<00:05:45.639> do<00:05:45.789> to<00:05:45.820> simplify

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
something that you can do to simplify

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.170 
something that you can do to simplify
really<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.340> enhance<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.490> experience<00:05:48.580> with

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
really and enhance the experience with

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.360 
really and enhance the experience with
the<00:05:49.270> vehicle<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:50.470> concepts<00:05:50.979> not<00:05:51.160> only

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
the vehicle the concepts not only

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.400 
the vehicle the concepts not only
high-tech<00:05:51.910> but<00:05:52.180> it<00:05:52.300> also<00:05:52.450> makes<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.900> easier<00:05:53.349> to
