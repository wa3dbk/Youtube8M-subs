00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.660
 I'm going to do the second class in the preparation of the port mode jorgina three 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.740
 drums 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.890
 he then to check everything I got along with the future this year has three 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.809
 years and a half 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.280
 it will show you a decisive moment of practicing the news in the 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.249
 route 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.249
 come with your reviews 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.779
 after I spoke in the first class the circle the fundamental trophy horse ' 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.130
 is this the horse has with the palettes standing with the body bathed it will not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 I can get this exercise to give me what I want from the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.070
 trotting horse 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.550
 at a comfortable speed for him does not forget that he does not yet know the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.960
 What is the drum? 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.240
 p when the smithy feel that a late horse lined comfortable 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.730
 chilled out 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.639
 around the hole of the ox 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.890
 I'll ask to come in from the inside. 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.370
 can handle amendment 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.040
 inside the post office 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.430
 and not letting the horse turn around the drum 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 because if the horse starts to turn very close support you learn 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.070
 fell talita this is not good because another who does not know what drum I want 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.190
 I want him to learn just to make a circle. 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.490
 with his backs under his body burned his body forward 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.530
 the fucinho de limeira man had nothing jumped in without much pressure 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.800
 being given to the work much horse by the fla with pain in the body getting uncomfortable 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.530
 annoying to him 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.060
 this perfect position move towards the achievement of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.750
 out 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.479
 with the horse with the valley also land 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.230
 were a little inward 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.330
 and I also do not like to do this kind of record for a long time 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.820
 not to stay a boring thing tiresome thing for horse 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.610
 so he gave three frames around the way I wanted this net pleases 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.790
 since then 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.360
 As we did to the left now I already spoke to the right also but never 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.380
 back very relaxed can see that his snout inside that favors 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 with it to keep the palette upright 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.110
 to move very good a light hand effect 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.999
 pay close attention to the bridle 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.999
 without fighting with the foal 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.409
 he works a perfect circle then lieutenant of the dry law but 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.239
 Half an hour there, then they will fall on the inside. 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.569
 go through a greater degree of difficulty there may be attached to make a circle 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.319
 smaller 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.319
 it has the reference of the drum can skin 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.799
 take the goal if you know what his whole life is going to have to make the raven grow 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.169
 well aligned there 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.839
 the cores are there give a reference to know where the horse is 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:34.450
 wrong 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.179
 and the recent one should make the correction 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:40.359
 in case the sun can jump from within the line 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.399
 are armchairs world scolese strap reed he closes the siege I was 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.839
 impressed drum 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:50.229
 we'll go with him at the next race time back when he has a 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.320
 core before error 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.430
 I'll ask you to hurt the inside leg near the barrier 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.760
 to lift the vane and open the siege more first thing is that I can 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.339
 talk outside the circle 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:02.230
 if he wants 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.049
 it's up to cori 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.629
 that come will give another one back I did not run past what took it is going to hit 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.829
 leg off pushing the fucking payment I do not want you to keep the 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.099
 all the time, creating little will never keep your hands off putting 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.249
 inside if it falls pretends inside 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.370
 to push it out 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.640
 this the strong point fell out looks down low lose out to push it 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.659
 inside 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.419
 do with them this exhausting game a tiring thing proposing to do the same 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.599
 thing in the then did the right thing pleases as reward this is an exercise 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.599
 proposed to have total control of the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.270
 because it is well-founded you will not want to take a step higher than 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.850
 leg 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.520
 The first class I said is good, you work it until the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.039
 perfect conditions for the next exercise 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:52.700
 and doubles but there are mayors with Sandra doing this 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.040
 if you skip a few steps you can get out of this crisis said if you will not have 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.119
 success 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.119
 so offer here doing 8 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.119
 the usefulness of the cones is the lowest of the year two previous months we will have a 

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:07.690
 reference to where the port will go wrong 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.779
 And where are you going to make the correction? 

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:12.199
 did a perfect spin 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.120
 leave the mark baba next goal 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.410
 was the main mentor in the hand position of in or out for a year horse 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.239
 get out 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.539
 that exactly in that moment that crosses 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.009
 to pass the course after finishing the game for the second class 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:30.169
