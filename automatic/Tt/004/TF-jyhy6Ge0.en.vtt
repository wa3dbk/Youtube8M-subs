hx2 it's on about 350 watch right now
and<00:00:34.080> that's<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.870> sub<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.990> old<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.980> got

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
and that's because the sub is old we got

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.370 
and that's because the sub is old we got
it<00:00:38.250> Rico<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.820> put<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.180> for<00:00:39.420> 400<00:00:39.750> for

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
it Rico and we can put it on for 400 for

it Rico and we can put it on for 400 for
400<00:00:40.950> watts<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> uh<00:00:42.680> it's<00:00:43.680> not<00:00:44.480> all<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.690> way<00:00:45.780> up

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:55.090 
400 watts but uh it's not all the way up
right<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:46.260> well<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.540> on<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.630> -<00:00:48.870> does<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:03.529 

amp<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> looking

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.210

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
come on I hate this little seat

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
come on I hate this little seat
full-system<00:01:17.990> all<00:01:18.990> right<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.320> as<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.710> see

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
full-system all right but as you can see

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.389 
full-system all right but as you can see
Rubicon<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.509> on<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:21.869> now<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:23.100> working

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
Rubicon that's on right now it's working

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.730 
Rubicon that's on right now it's working
good<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.729> screwed<00:01:27.330> down<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> box<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.710> box

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
good it screwed down to the box the box

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.289 
good it screwed down to the box the box
doesn't<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.369> much<00:01:29.549> vibration<00:01:30.149> it's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
doesn't have that much vibration it's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.270 
doesn't have that much vibration it's
only<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.539> ten<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.830> amp<00:01:32.009> should<00:01:32.190> be<00:01:32.340> fine

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
only a ten so the amp should be fine

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.370 
only a ten so the amp should be fine
like<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.399> said<00:01:35.460> stock<00:01:35.850> head<00:01:36.090> unit<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:37.200> have

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
like I said stock head unit so we have

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.820 
like I said stock head unit so we have
the<00:01:37.670> RCA<00:01:38.670> converter<00:01:39.179> it's<00:01:39.990> hooked<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.649> the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
the RCA converter it's hooked up to the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.740 
the RCA converter it's hooked up to the
stock<00:01:41.100> stop<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.520> now

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
stock stop right now

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.779 
stock stop right now
so<00:01:43.100> it's<00:01:44.100> getting<00:01:44.399> all<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> lower

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
so it's getting all the lower

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.600 
so it's getting all the lower
frequencies<00:01:45.390> without<00:01:46.170> having<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.679> block<00:01:47.429> out

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
frequencies without having to block out

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.430 
frequencies without having to block out
the<00:01:47.640> higher<00:01:47.909> ones<00:01:50.659> as<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:51.929> see<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.229> power

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
the higher ones as you can see the power

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.230 
the higher ones as you can see the power
wires<00:01:52.710> looking<00:01:53.190> nice<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:54.440> hidden<00:01:55.440> in<00:01:55.560> there<00:01:56.240> so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
wires looking nice or hidden in there so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.059 
wires looking nice or hidden in there so

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.860 
just make it look a little bit better
and<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:23.670> turned<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.150> up<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.480> went<00:02:24.630> around<00:02:24.720> the

and I turned it up and went around the
pocket<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.380> blue<00:02:25.590> dust<00:02:25.860> everywhere<00:02:26.190> already<00:02:26.930> so

it's<00:02:31.050> pretty<00:02:31.260> good<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.980> excursion<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
up here I mean it's just sitting there

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.750 
up here I mean it's just sitting there
but<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.519> not<00:02:53.610> gonna<00:02:53.880> move<00:02:55.519> it's<00:02:56.519> not<00:02:56.549> gonna

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
come out it's at an angle sitting back

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
I can't show you guys a demo right now

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.060 
I can't show you guys a demo right now
because<00:03:13.330> it's<00:03:13.870> real<00:03:14.260> early<00:03:14.410> in<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.740> morning

that's<00:04:17.180> pretty<00:04:17.360> much<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:18.940> these<00:04:19.940> cars<00:04:20.210> come

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
that's pretty much it these cars come

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:30.270 
that's pretty much it these cars come
stocked<00:04:20.870> with<00:04:24.190> auxiliary<00:04:25.190> cable<00:04:25.970> and<00:04:29.020> power

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
stocked with auxiliary cable and power

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.700 
stocked with auxiliary cable and power
or<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.340> little<00:04:31.880> car<00:04:32.810> port<00:04:33.110> connector<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:34.100> there

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
or a little car port connector in there

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.580 
or a little car port connector in there
and<00:04:36.710> as<00:04:36.920> you<00:04:37.010> can<00:04:37.100> see<00:04:37.220> there's<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.210> little<00:04:38.360> hole

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
and as you can see there's a little hole

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.870 
and as you can see there's a little hole
that<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.830> wires<00:04:40.040> can<00:04:40.280> come<00:04:40.520> through<00:04:40.730> and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
that the wires can come through and

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.739 
that the wires can come through and
everything<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:42.880> think<00:04:43.880> that's<00:04:44.180> about<00:04:44.300> it

00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:47.749 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:51.699 

I<00:04:48.069> guess<00:04:49.069> we<00:04:49.219> can<00:04:49.369> show<00:04:49.809> the<00:04:50.809> stereo<00:04:51.229> and<00:04:51.499> stuff

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:51.709 
I guess we can show the stereo and stuff

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:55.449 
I guess we can show the stereo and stuff
I'm<00:04:52.009> into<00:04:52.309> the<00:04:52.819> motor<00:04:53.889> on<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:54.949> wall<00:04:55.279> I<00:04:55.309> was

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:55.459 
I'm into the motor on the wall I was

00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:06.479 
I'm into the motor on the wall I was
thinking<00:04:55.789> Styria<00:05:01.629> baby<00:05:02.629> mickey<00:05:03.339> has<00:05:04.339> a<00:05:04.399> 3.5

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
you probably can up them behind the

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.989 
you probably can up them behind the
wheel<00:05:26.839> well<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.499> behind<00:05:27.949> the<00:05:28.069> shock<00:05:28.279> and<00:05:30.999> goes
