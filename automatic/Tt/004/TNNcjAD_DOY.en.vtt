are<00:02:24.260> sort<00:02:24.530> of<00:02:25.000> accomplices<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.230> figuring<00:02:27.230> out

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
are sort of accomplices in figuring out

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.630 
are sort of accomplices in figuring out
how<00:02:27.800> healthy<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.900> together<00:02:30.010> our<00:02:31.010> landscapes

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
how healthy and together our landscapes

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.070 
how healthy and together our landscapes
really<00:02:31.970> are

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
really are

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.340 
really are
one<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.770> the<00:02:34.830> reasons

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
one of the reasons

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.000 
one of the reasons
I<00:02:36.440> like<00:02:37.160> being<00:02:37.460> out<00:02:37.580> with<00:02:37.760> be<00:02:37.970> assisted<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.830> do

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
like watching the early spring the first

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.160 
like watching the early spring the first
few<00:02:50.930> days<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.440> bees<00:02:51.770> coming<00:02:51.800> back<00:02:52.430> with<00:02:53.170> pollen

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
few days of bees coming back with pollen

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.500 
few days of bees coming back with pollen
and<00:02:54.410> just<00:02:55.250> sort<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.430> looking<00:02:55.820> at<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.090> pollen

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
see what color it is figuring out where

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.820

beautiful in that you get a sense of
their<00:03:08.630> indefatigable<00:03:09.470> ax<00:03:09.530> t<00:03:09.710> and<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.910> a

their indefatigable ax t and this is a

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.080 
their indefatigable ax t and this is a

at a time produce enough money to keep

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.060 
at a time produce enough money to keep
calling<00:03:18.080> you<00:03:18.200> alive<00:03:18.410> over<00:03:18.740> the<00:03:18.830> winter<00:03:19.040> and

calling you alive over the winter and

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.940 
calling you alive over the winter and
yet<00:03:19.280> they<00:03:19.430> do<00:03:19.490> it<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:21.320> there's<00:03:21.650> something

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
yet they do it and there's something

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.309

quite<00:03:22.130> beautiful<00:03:22.610> about<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:23.060> too

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
quite beautiful about that too

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:43.570 
quite beautiful about that too
you

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.480 

I<00:03:46.870> think<00:03:47.870> most<00:03:48.080> beekeepers<00:03:48.650> are<00:03:48.680> fascinated

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
I think most beekeepers are fascinated

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.990 
I think most beekeepers are fascinated
by<00:03:50.480> these<00:03:51.230> themselves<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:54.460> perfect<00:03:55.460> example

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
by these themselves this perfect example

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.200 
by these themselves this perfect example
of<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.900> idea<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.350> humans<00:03:57.980> could<00:03:58.790> cooperate

00:03:59.200 --> 00:03:59.210 
of the idea that humans could cooperate

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.840 
of the idea that humans could cooperate
with<00:03:59.990> another<00:04:00.290> species<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:01.160> both<00:04:01.430> of<00:04:01.640> their

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
with another species to both of their

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.300 
with another species to both of their
mutual<00:04:02.150> benefit<00:04:02.900> we<00:04:03.740> don't<00:04:03.890> have<00:04:03.980> very<00:04:04.040> many

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
mutual benefit we don't have very many

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.770 
mutual benefit we don't have very many
examples<00:04:04.820> of<00:04:05.180> that<00:04:05.420> in<00:04:05.690> our<00:04:07.330> society<00:04:08.330> but

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
examples of that in our society but

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:28.420 
examples of that in our society but
that's<00:04:08.990> what<00:04:09.170> Abby<00:04:09.770> harvest

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.620 

I<00:04:32.710> mean<00:04:33.710> honey<00:04:33.860> bees<00:04:34.130> are<00:04:34.280> like<00:04:34.630> everything

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
I mean honey bees are like everything

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.260 
I mean honey bees are like everything

duress I mean the world in that we

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.360 
duress I mean the world in that we

jointly inhabit is changing with
enormous<00:04:44.060> speed<00:04:44.630> so<00:04:45.620> none<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.220> patterns

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
enormous speed so none of the patterns

because<00:04:53.060> landscapes<00:04:53.810> keep<00:04:54.110> changing<00:04:54.650> we<00:04:55.340> get

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
because landscapes keep changing we get

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.060 
because landscapes keep changing we get
better<00:04:56.090> at<00:04:56.330> everything<00:04:56.810> we<00:04:57.199> do<00:04:57.380> and<00:04:57.530> take<00:04:57.740> more

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
better at everything we do and take more

time for clover to just sit there in the
field<00:05:04.120> life<00:05:05.120> speeding<00:05:05.630> up<00:05:05.750> for<00:05:06.020> them<00:05:06.199> just

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
field life speeding up for them just

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.490 
field life speeding up for them just
like<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.860> is<00:05:07.039> for<00:05:07.070> us<00:05:07.460> and<00:05:07.930> really<00:05:08.930> neither<00:05:09.229> of

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
like it is for us and really neither of

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.290 
like it is for us and really neither of
us<00:05:09.620> are<00:05:09.740> coping<00:05:10.099> very<00:05:10.160> well<00:05:10.400> with<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:10.849> results

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
us are coping very well with the results

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.420 
us are coping very well with the results
of<00:05:11.389> it

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
of it

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.330 
of it
so<00:05:14.030> I<00:05:14.330> mean<00:05:14.720> what<00:05:14.900> we<00:05:14.990> can<00:05:15.170> do<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.890> help<00:05:16.040> these

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
so I mean what we can do to help these

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.090 
so I mean what we can do to help these
is<00:05:17.240> exactly<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.260> same<00:05:18.440> thing<00:05:18.620> we<00:05:18.710> can<00:05:18.860> do<00:05:18.980> to

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
is exactly the same thing we can do to
