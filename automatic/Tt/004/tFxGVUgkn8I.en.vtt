where the pike are used to feeding on

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
where the pike are used to feeding on
Rudd<00:00:38.579> like<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.210> they've<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.079> rod

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
Rudd like this one they've got the rod

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
Rudd like this one they've got the rod
packed<00:00:40.590> into<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.070> corner<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.969> reckon<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
packed into this corner and I reckon a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.540 
packed into this corner and I reckon a
natural<00:00:42.840> dead<00:00:43.050> bait<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:43.920> could<00:00:44.370> do

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
natural dead bait like this one could do

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.740 
natural dead bait like this one could do
the<00:00:44.700> business<00:00:45.059> today<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> give

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the business today we're going to give

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
the business today we're going to give
it<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.960> go<00:00:46.170> now<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> working<00:00:47.610> pit<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it a go now this is a working pit so

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
it a go now this is a working pit so
that<00:00:48.690> accounts<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> bit<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> machinery

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that accounts for the bit of machinery

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.170 
that accounts for the bit of machinery
noise<00:00:50.309> we've<00:00:50.550> probably<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
noise we've probably got in the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
noise we've probably got in the
background<00:00:51.719> normally<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.739> lake<00:00:52.980> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
background normally this lake is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
absolutely packed with carp anglers but
we're<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> autumn<00:00:55.770> now<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.489> carp<00:00:56.760> anglers

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
either let's get this read out there

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.940 
either let's get this read out there
well<00:01:12.840> I'll<00:01:12.960> hook<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> rod<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.619> I'm<00:01:13.830> gonna

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
well I'll hook the rod up I'm gonna

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
well I'll hook the rod up I'm gonna
actually<00:01:14.130> drift<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:14.939> bait<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.869> wind

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
actually drift this bait on the wind

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
actually drift this bait on the wind
because<00:01:16.530> we've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> wind<00:01:17.490> behind<00:01:17.670> us

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
because we've got the wind behind us

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.429 
because we've got the wind behind us
which<00:01:18.240> means<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> give<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> bait<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> bit

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
which means we can give the bait a bit

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.740 
which means we can give the bait a bit
of<00:01:19.530> movement<00:01:19.740> I've<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.750> simple

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
of movement I've got it on a simple

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
of movement I've got it on a simple
sliding<00:01:22.110> float<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.250> running<00:01:23.580> on

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
sliding float actually just running on

the<00:01:23.820> line<00:01:23.970> you've<00:01:24.210> probably<00:01:24.420> seen<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.869> sort

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
the line you've probably seen this sort

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.890 
the line you've probably seen this sort
of<00:01:25.200> thing<00:01:25.409> before<00:01:25.610> we've<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> bead<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
of thing before we've got a bead and

above<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.860> float<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.520> there's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> stop

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
knot that controls the depth so I can

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.760 
knot that controls the depth so I can
fish<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.000> from<00:01:33.689> anywhere<00:01:34.020> from<00:01:34.079> sort<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.619> two

drifting<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.329> bait<00:01:39.479> around<00:01:39.689> doesn't<00:01:40.259> work

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
drifting the bait around doesn't work

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380

suspend<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> off<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.549> bottom<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.270> I'll

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
suspend it off the bottom then I'll

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.999 
suspend it off the bottom then I'll
probably<00:01:42.600> try<00:01:42.840> fishing<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> bottom<00:01:43.950> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
probably try fishing it on the bottom a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.260 
probably try fishing it on the bottom a
little<00:01:44.250> bit<00:01:44.369> later<00:01:44.610> on<00:01:44.759> but<00:01:44.970> let's<00:01:45.119> try

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
little bit later on but let's try

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
little bit later on but let's try
drifting<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> first<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.920> pike<00:01:47.159> may

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
drifting it first because the pike may

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.249 
drifting it first because the pike may
well<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.790> feeding<00:01:48.119> up<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> water<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
rod of this early time of the day let's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.550 
rod of this early time of the day let's
get<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> bay<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.229> see<00:01:52.439> what

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
get it out of the bay and see what

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.950 
get it out of the bay and see what
happens

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.240 

this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> nice<00:02:01.410> corner<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:01.980> the<00:02:02.070> lake

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
this is a nice corner of the lake

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.170 
this is a nice corner of the lake
actually<00:02:03.320> with<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> win<00:02:04.560> behind<00:02:04.980> me<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.940> easy

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
actually with a win behind me it's easy

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.109 
actually with a win behind me it's easy
to<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.890> love<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.130> bait<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.790> don't<00:02:08.940> need

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
to just love the bait out you don't need

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.270 
to just love the bait out you don't need
a<00:02:09.180> big<00:02:09.450> cast<00:02:09.780> quite<00:02:10.500> often<00:02:10.680> people<00:02:10.979> get

a big cast quite often people get

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.640 
a big cast quite often people get

and<00:02:33.270> that's<00:02:33.360> what<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.720> pike<00:02:33.900> they're<00:02:34.140> here

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
and that's what the pike they're here

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.100 
and that's what the pike they're here
they<00:02:34.470> use<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.980> corner<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.630> sides<00:02:36.930> of

the gravel pit to pen the Rudd in and

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.940 
the gravel pit to pen the Rudd in and
there<00:02:39.720> could<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:39.930> quite<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.200> few<00:02:40.290> fish<00:02:40.709> actually

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
there could be quite a few fish actually

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.980 
there could be quite a few fish actually
out<00:02:41.310> there<00:02:41.580> working<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.300> shoal<00:02:42.540> together

out there working the shoal together

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.800 
out there working the shoal together
making<00:02:43.650> repeated<00:02:44.220> forays<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.180> raids<00:02:45.420> into

making repeated forays and raids into
the<00:02:45.900> shoulder<00:02:46.320> road<00:02:46.470> bashing<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.040> hell<00:02:47.190> out

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
of them actually and that happens a lot

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.770 
of them actually and that happens a lot
in<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> winter<00:02:49.820> early<00:02:50.820> winter<00:02:51.209> but

in the winter early winter but

in the winter early winter but

which is the time we're in right now so
that's<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.250> theory<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.790> suppose<00:02:57.120> we'd<00:02:57.300> better

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
that's the theory I suppose we'd better

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
an old phrase in trout fishing about

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.720 
an old phrase in trout fishing about
matching<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.890> hatch<00:05:53.040> and<00:05:53.280> when<00:05:53.430> they<00:05:53.550> talk

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 
matching the hatch and when they talk

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.020 
matching the hatch and when they talk
about<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:54.270> what<00:05:54.480> they're<00:05:54.660> referring<00:05:54.780> to<00:05:55.200> is

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
about that what they're referring to is

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.490 
about that what they're referring to is
using<00:05:57.030> something<00:05:57.300> which<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.080> trout<00:05:58.320> are

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
using something which the trout are

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.020 
using something which the trout are
feeding<00:05:58.740> on<00:05:58.980> and<00:05:59.250> that's<00:05:59.430> what<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.610> did<00:05:59.880> this

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
feeding on and that's what I did this

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.770 
feeding on and that's what I did this
time<00:06:00.330> with<00:06:00.540> Pike<00:06:00.810> by<00:06:01.080> using<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:02.160> Rudd<00:06:02.760> when<00:06:03.660> it

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
time with Pike by using a Rudd when it

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.390 
time with Pike by using a Rudd when it
was<00:06:03.870> quite<00:06:04.080> obvious<00:06:04.500> that<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.770> pipe<00:06:04.980> will<00:06:05.190> fry

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
was quite obvious that the pipe will fry

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.240 
was quite obvious that the pipe will fry
feeding<00:06:05.910> on<00:06:06.030> Rudd<00:06:06.270> if<00:06:06.810> you<00:06:06.990> use<00:06:07.170> semi<00:06:07.740> barbless

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
feeding on Rudd if you use semi barbless

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.640 
feeding on Rudd if you use semi barbless
trebles<00:06:08.730> then<00:06:09.000> it's<00:06:09.180> much<00:06:09.750> easier<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:10.350> unhook

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
trebles then it's much easier to unhook

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.830 
trebles then it's much easier to unhook
fish<00:06:10.980> and<00:06:11.640> a<00:06:11.730> lot<00:06:11.850> of<00:06:11.880> people<00:06:12.270> are<00:06:12.360> nervous<00:06:12.600> a

three<00:06:41.940> distinct<00:06:42.480> bands<00:06:42.750> which<00:06:43.650> run<00:06:43.950> from<00:06:44.190> the

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
three distinct bands which run from the

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.050 
three distinct bands which run from the
front<00:06:44.460> of<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:44.820> jaw<00:06:45.770> in<00:06:46.770> almost<00:06:47.400> vertical

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
front of the jaw in almost vertical

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.420 
front of the jaw in almost vertical
lines<00:06:48.360> and<00:06:48.690> then<00:06:49.170> these<00:06:49.320> sharper<00:06:49.920> teeth<00:06:50.130> ear

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:50.430 
lines and then these sharper teeth ear

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.420 
lines and then these sharper teeth ear
which<00:06:51.330> cut<00:06:51.660> into<00:06:52.050> the<00:06:52.170> prey<00:06:52.430> obviously

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
which cut into the prey obviously

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.340 
which cut into the prey obviously
disabling<00:06:54.090> it<00:06:54.270> but<00:06:54.480> they're<00:06:54.960> very<00:06:55.140> delicate

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
disabling it but they're very delicate

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.650 
disabling it but they're very delicate
those<00:06:55.800> teeth<00:06:56.100> so<00:06:56.400> you<00:06:56.640> must<00:06:57.090> be<00:06:57.180> careful<00:06:57.270> when

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
those teeth so you must be careful when

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.510 
those teeth so you must be careful when
you're<00:06:57.900> unhooking<00:06:58.320> pike<00:06:58.560> not<00:06:58.800> to<00:06:58.950> damage<00:06:59.310> them

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
you're unhooking pike not to damage them

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.550 
you're unhooking pike not to damage them
because<00:06:59.850> that's<00:07:00.300> how<00:07:00.540> this<00:07:00.720> fish<00:07:00.960> feeds<00:07:01.290> it

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
because that's how this fish feeds it

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.590 
because that's how this fish feeds it
bites<00:07:02.160> other<00:07:02.490> fish<00:07:02.700> so<00:07:02.910> if<00:07:03.030> it's<00:07:03.180> teeth<00:07:03.420> are

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 
bites other fish so if it's teeth are

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.910 
bites other fish so if it's teeth are
damaged<00:07:03.900> then<00:07:04.080> obviously<00:07:04.230> they're

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920 
damaged then obviously they're

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.160 
damaged then obviously they're
inhibiting<00:07:05.490> it<00:07:05.610> but<00:07:05.820> what<00:07:05.970> a<00:07:06.170> magnificent

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.170 
inhibiting it but what a magnificent

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.680 
inhibiting it but what a magnificent
superb<00:07:08.070> fish<00:07:08.400> and<00:07:08.580> I<00:07:08.640> think<00:07:08.880> what<00:07:09.060> we'll<00:07:09.210> do<00:07:09.480> is

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
superb fish and I think what we'll do is

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.270 
superb fish and I think what we'll do is
we'll<00:07:10.320> take<00:07:10.560> a<00:07:10.590> look<00:07:10.860> at<00:07:10.950> that<00:07:11.100> before

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
we'll take a look at that before

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.730 
we'll take a look at that before
weighing<00:07:11.790> it<00:07:12.000> because<00:07:12.300> that<00:07:12.480> is<00:07:12.540> an<00:07:12.990> absolute

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
weighing it because that is an absolute

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.580 
weighing it because that is an absolute
