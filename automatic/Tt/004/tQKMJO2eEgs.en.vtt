I've<00:00:06.839> been<00:00:07.049> getting<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.379> lot<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.620> questions

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
I've been getting a lot of questions

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.419 
I've been getting a lot of questions
about<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:08.910> big<00:00:09.510> black<00:00:09.929> beetle<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:11.219> is<00:00:11.400> a

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
about this big black beetle this is a

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.759 
about this big black beetle this is a
native<00:00:12.150> beetle<00:00:12.509> called<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.840> blister<00:00:13.410> beetle

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
native beetle called a blister beetle

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.950 
native beetle called a blister beetle
and<00:00:13.980> they<00:00:14.639> get<00:00:14.790> their<00:00:15.000> name<00:00:15.030> because<00:00:15.330> they've

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
and they get their name because they've

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.950 
and they get their name because they've
reduced<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.560> toxin<00:00:17.250> cam<00:00:17.609> Theron<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.180> which<00:00:18.720> can

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
reduced it toxin cam Theron in which can

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.660 
reduced it toxin cam Theron in which can
cause<00:00:19.140> blisters<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.949> skin<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.520> that's

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
cause blisters on the skin and that's

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
cause blisters on the skin and that's
why<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.029> wearing<00:00:21.210> rubber<00:00:21.510> gloves<00:00:21.660> with<00:00:22.320> him

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
why I'm wearing rubber gloves with him

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.830 
why I'm wearing rubber gloves with him
but<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.640> most<00:00:23.820> gardeners<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.480> concerned

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
but what most gardeners are concerned

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.839 
but what most gardeners are concerned
about<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.740> damage<00:00:25.980> they<00:00:26.279> produce<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
about is the damage they produce in the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.570 
about is the damage they produce in the
garden<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.380> strip<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> plant<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.429> its

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
garden they can strip a plant of its

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.299 
garden they can strip a plant of its
leaves<00:00:29.880> if<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.359> found<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.800> square<00:00:32.099> foot

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
leaves if we found in our square foot

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.770 
leaves if we found in our square foot
garden<00:00:32.640> we've<00:00:32.820> completely<00:00:33.239> lost<00:00:33.570> our

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
garden we've completely lost our

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.139 
garden we've completely lost our
broccoli<00:00:34.260> plant<00:00:34.500> we'd<00:00:35.489> found<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.820> lot<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.000> them

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
broccoli plant we'd found a lot of them

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.940 
broccoli plant we'd found a lot of them
on<00:00:36.270> our<00:00:36.300> chard<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.260> they<00:00:37.350> feed<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.680> many

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
on our chard but they feed on many

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.010 
on our chard but they feed on many
different<00:00:38.340> plants<00:00:38.640> they<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> preference

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
different plants they have a preference

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.200 
different plants they have a preference
for<00:00:40.079> legumes<00:00:40.680> but<00:00:41.550> they'll<00:00:41.700> also<00:00:41.940> feed<00:00:42.120> on

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
for legumes but they'll also feed on

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.720 
for legumes but they'll also feed on
some<00:00:42.390> ornamentals<00:00:43.160> now<00:00:44.160> before<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> get

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
some ornamentals now before you get

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.150 
some ornamentals now before you get
ready<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.149> kill<00:00:45.629> off<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.079> beetles<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.950> might

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
ready to kill off the beetles you might

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.920 
ready to kill off the beetles you might
consider<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> larvae<00:00:48.420> are<00:00:48.450> Pradesh

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
consider that the larvae are Pradesh

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.170 
consider that the larvae are Pradesh
'san<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.680> feed<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.000> grasshopper<00:00:51.000> eggs

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
'san they feed on grasshopper eggs

'san they feed on grasshopper eggs
another<00:00:51.570> big<00:00:52.230> problem<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.800> us<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> suppose

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
another big problem for us but I suppose

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.850 
another big problem for us but I suppose
that's<00:00:54.629> not<00:00:54.750> enough<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.320> convince<00:00:55.500> most

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
that's not enough to convince most

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
that's not enough to convince most
gardeners<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> leave<00:00:56.760> them<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.510> can

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
gardeners to leave them be as they can

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.869 
gardeners to leave them be as they can
be<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> rather<00:00:58.230> problem<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.430> let's<00:00:59.640> look<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.850> a

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
be a rather problem so let's look at a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.569 
be a rather problem so let's look at a
few<00:01:00.210> little<00:01:00.600> management<00:01:01.260> strategies<00:01:01.859> one

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
few little management strategies one

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.390 
few little management strategies one
thing<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:04.170> knock<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
thing you can do is just knock the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.840 
thing you can do is just knock the
beetles<00:01:05.790> off<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.409> foliage<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> bucket

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
beetles off of the foliage into a bucket

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090 
beetles off of the foliage into a bucket
or<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> small<00:01:09.540> cup<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:10.020> soapy<00:01:10.380> water<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.890> just

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
or a small cup of soapy water you just

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
or a small cup of soapy water you just
knock<00:01:11.310> them<00:01:11.520> off<00:01:11.670> into<00:01:12.060> there<00:01:12.240> they<00:01:13.049> tend<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
knock them off into there they tend to

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.070 
knock them off into there they tend to
be<00:01:14.159> somewhat<00:01:14.580> gregarious<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.450> find<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.900> lot

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
be somewhat gregarious so you find a lot

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
be somewhat gregarious so you find a lot
of<00:01:16.110> them<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> single<00:01:17.280> leaf<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.060> knock

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
of them on a single leaf you can knock

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
of them on a single leaf you can knock
them<00:01:18.450> off<00:01:18.630> readily<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> their

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
them off readily but one of their

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
them off readily but one of their
defense<00:01:20.939> mechanisms<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.990> fall<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
defense mechanisms is to fall to the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
defense mechanisms is to fall to the
ground<00:01:22.590> when<00:01:23.310> they're<00:01:23.430> disturbed<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.150> you're

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
ground when they're disturbed so you're

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.539 
ground when they're disturbed so you're
gonna<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> come<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> pick<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> few<00:01:26.400> up

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
gonna have to come in and pick a few up

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.770 
gonna have to come in and pick a few up
off<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> ground<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> want<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> make<00:01:27.750> sure

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
off the ground so you want to make sure

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
off the ground so you want to make sure
that<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> wear<00:01:28.710> your<00:01:28.860> gloves<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.610> now

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
that you wear your gloves for that now

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.789 
that you wear your gloves for that now
if<00:01:30.479> you're<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.720> into<00:01:31.020> picking<00:01:31.170> them<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.560> off

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
if you're not into picking them up off

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.160 
if you're not into picking them up off
the<00:01:31.950> ground<00:01:32.130> there<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> chemical<00:01:32.909> option<00:01:33.479> we

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
the ground there is a chemical option we

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.080 
the ground there is a chemical option we
looked<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.470> spinosad<00:01:35.189> earlier<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.820> season

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
looked at spinosad earlier this season

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.020 
looked at spinosad earlier this season
that's<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.630> biological<00:01:37.130> insecticide<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
that's a biological insecticide and that

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's a biological insecticide and that
works<00:01:39.210> fairly<00:01:39.420> well<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.780> our<00:01:40.140> blister<00:01:40.619> beetles

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
works fairly well on our blister beetles

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.120 
works fairly well on our blister beetles
it<00:01:41.189> also<00:01:41.640> has<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> be<00:01:42.750> ingested<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
it also has to be ingested for it to

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.950 
it also has to be ingested for it to
work<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.000> doesn't<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.659> large

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
work so it doesn't have a very large

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.280 
work so it doesn't have a very large
effect<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.649> our<00:01:47.280> beneficial<00:01:47.909> insects<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.049> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
effect on our beneficial insects so this
