00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.320 
away after a little bit she said that
the<00:02:27.120> new<00:02:27.960> there's<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.470> new<00:02:28.710> formula<00:02:29.100> out<00:02:29.850> for

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the new there's a new formula out for

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.700 
the new there's a new formula out for
the<00:02:30.450> YSL<00:02:31.410> lipsticks<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.880> resistant

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
the YSL lipsticks so it's more resistant

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.170 
the YSL lipsticks so it's more resistant
but<00:02:34.710> anyway<00:02:34.950> this<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.250> not<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> wise<00:02:35.640> sell<00:02:35.940> video

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180
