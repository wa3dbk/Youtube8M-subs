of hearts so that's just the basic move

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430 
of hearts so that's just the basic move
it's<00:00:40.920> really<00:00:41.550> easy<00:00:41.850> well<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.570> thought<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.140> I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
it's really easy well I thought is not I

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.630 
it's really easy well I thought is not I
shouldn't<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.770> said<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.010> forget<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> said

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
shouldn't have said that forget I said

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.779 
shouldn't have said that forget I said
that<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.780> easy<00:00:46.170> once<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.590> learn<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.890> all

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that it's easy once you learn it all

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.750 
that it's easy once you learn it all
right<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:49.530> will<00:00:49.770> take<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> couple<00:00:50.280> days<00:00:50.520> of

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
right it will take a couple days of

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.979 
right it will take a couple days of
practice<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> don't<00:00:51.809> want<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
practice so if you don't want to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.400 
practice so if you don't want to
practice<00:00:52.410> don't<00:00:53.190> watch<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.520> video<00:00:54.410> anyway

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
practice don't watch this video anyway

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.560 
practice don't watch this video anyway

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
so here's the basic move on an

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.290 
so here's the basic move on an
undercover<00:00:58.399> undercover<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> looks<00:00:59.820> like<00:01:00.030> this

you've seen me all right and you just
the<00:02:28.120> move<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.510> it's<00:02:29.410> simple<00:02:29.800> once<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.100> learn

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
the move is it's simple once you learn

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.210 
the move is it's simple once you learn
it<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.180> will<00:02:31.390> take<00:02:31.420> practice<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.860> I<00:02:32.890> would

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it but it will take practice so I would

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.190 
it but it will take practice so I would
just<00:02:33.460> what<00:02:34.090> i<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.300> do<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.630> if<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.900> have<00:02:35.080> one

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
just what i would do is if you have one

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.130 
just what i would do is if you have one
of<00:02:35.230> those<00:02:35.380> mirrors<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:37.390> tilts<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:38.020> if

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
of those mirrors that like tilts like if

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.840 
of those mirrors that like tilts like if
your<00:02:38.260> sister<00:02:38.710> or<00:02:38.890> something<00:02:38.920> has<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.460> mirror<00:02:39.760> in

her room and it can like tilt and it's
big<00:02:42.330> definitely<00:02:43.330> practice<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.870> front<00:02:43.960> of<00:02:44.080> it

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
big definitely practice in front of it

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.000 
big definitely practice in front of it
you<00:02:44.260> can<00:02:44.350> practice<00:02:44.740> on<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.950> camera<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:47.320> just

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
defecate get the mirror say it tilts to

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.410 
defecate get the mirror say it tilts to
like<00:02:51.280> how<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.490> spectator<00:02:52.030> would<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:52.300> looking

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
