00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
go over that because he literally just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.080

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
went over it with the tires a little bit

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.549 
went over it with the tires a little bit
enough<00:00:51.300> even<00:00:51.629> hitting<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> bridge<00:00:52.379> or

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
enough even hitting the bridge or

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.400 
enough even hitting the bridge or

managed<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.130> recover<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.790> barrel<00:03:21.480> roll<00:03:21.600> and

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
managed to recover a barrel roll and

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.479 
managed to recover a barrel roll and
actually<00:03:22.260> end<00:03:22.380> up<00:03:22.440> holding<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.980> position<00:03:23.130> as

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
actually end up holding the position as

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.280 
actually end up holding the position as
well<00:03:23.610> as<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.910> pretty<00:03:24.180> cool<00:03:24.299> never<00:03:24.600> I<00:03:24.750> hit<00:03:25.140> that

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
well as is pretty cool never I hit that

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.810 
well as is pretty cool never I hit that
before<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.860> was<00:03:26.220> completely<00:03:26.670> unintentional

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
before I was completely unintentional

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.600 
before I was completely unintentional
but<00:03:27.330> it's<00:03:27.450> pretty<00:03:27.600> cool<00:03:27.900> at<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.170> same<00:03:28.410> time<00:03:28.799> so

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
but it's pretty cool at the same time so

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.979 
but it's pretty cool at the same time so
yeah<00:03:29.910> let's<00:03:30.090> watch<00:03:30.180> some<00:03:30.420> one<00:03:30.510> more<00:03:30.660> time<00:03:30.840> in

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
yeah let's watch some one more time in

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:31.670 
yeah let's watch some one more time in
slow<00:03:31.080> motion

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
slow motion

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.789 
slow motion
pretty<00:03:32.130> much<00:03:32.190> precise<00:03:33.230> approach<00:03:34.230> there<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
pretty much precise approach there to

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.009 
pretty much precise approach there to
that<00:03:35.010> corner<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> barrier<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.840> able<00:03:36.900> to

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
that corner of the barrier to be able to

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.110 
that corner of the barrier to be able to
do<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.320> perfect<00:03:37.680> barrel<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.130> landing<00:03:38.400> that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
do that perfect barrel and landing that

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.180 
do that perfect barrel and landing that
losing<00:03:39.450> control<00:03:39.780> attraction<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.440> then<00:03:40.950> number

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
losing control attraction so then number

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.949 
losing control attraction so then number
four<00:03:41.340> spot<00:03:41.459> man<00:03:41.790> I've<00:03:41.970> not<00:03:42.299> seen<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.540> take<00:03:42.750> heart
