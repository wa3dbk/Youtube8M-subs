working so hard to try and get this
game's<00:00:21.740> artificial<00:00:22.740> intelligence<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.820> work

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
game's artificial intelligence to work

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359 
game's artificial intelligence to work
right<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.140> being<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.619> biggest<00:00:26.010> pain

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
right and it's being the biggest pain

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.830 
right and it's being the biggest pain
and<00:00:26.760> I've<00:00:27.689> been<00:00:27.840> working<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.439> for<00:00:28.619> probably

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
and I've been working on it for probably

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
and I've been working on it for probably
seriously<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.050> week<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.740> half<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.279> just<00:00:32.790> on

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
seriously a week and a half now just on

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.270 
seriously a week and a half now just on
the<00:00:33.149> artificial<00:00:33.540> intelligence<00:00:33.870> engine<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.250> I

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the artificial intelligence engine so I

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.650 
the artificial intelligence engine so I
hope<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.700> worth<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:36.540> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
hope it's worth it when I get this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.420

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.020 
want to be aware of when you're doing
any<00:01:15.930> sort<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.320> pixel<00:01:16.710> art<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.460> want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.909> be

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
any sort of pixel art is you want to be

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
any sort of pixel art is you want to be
aware<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.360> how<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.930> character<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.770> your

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
aware of how your character and your

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
aware of how your character and your
enemies<00:01:20.460> are<00:01:20.670> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.090> stand<00:01:21.479> out<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.990> little

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
enemies are going to stand out a little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.649 
enemies are going to stand out a little
bit<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.890> background<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.479> want

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
bit from the background you don't want

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
bit from the background you don't want
them<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.020> mix<00:01:25.320> into<00:01:25.619> where<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.159> can't<00:01:26.460> see

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
them to mix into where you can't see

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.260 
them to mix into where you can't see
them<00:01:27.150> easily<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.280> one<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.000> I've

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
them easily and so one thing that I've

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.800 
them easily and so one thing that I've
done<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.009> if<00:01:32.009> you'll<00:01:32.220> come<00:01:32.460> into<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:33.060> color

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
done is if you'll come into my color

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.510 
done is if you'll come into my color
picker<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:35.479> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:37.040> anything<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.280> my

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
picker here you can see anything in my

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
picker here you can see anything in my
background<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.329> usually<00:01:39.990> down<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.860> lower<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
background is usually down here lower to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.219 
background is usually down here lower to
the<00:01:41.520> bottom<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:41.970> are<00:01:42.030> more<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.479> pastel

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
the bottom these are more like pastel

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.380 
the bottom these are more like pastel
colors<00:01:43.680> down<00:01:43.950> here<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.880> what's<00:01:45.270> called

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
colors down here they have what's called

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.420 
colors down here they have what's called
a<00:01:45.600> lower<00:01:45.810> saturation<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.280> their

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
a lower saturation you can see their

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.359 
a lower saturation you can see their
saturation<00:01:48.090> value<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:49.350> low<00:01:49.799> down<00:01:50.070> here

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
saturation value is really low down here

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.160 
saturation value is really low down here
so<00:01:50.820> my<00:01:50.970> background<00:01:51.210> colors<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.899> lower

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
so my background colors have a lower

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.789 
so my background colors have a lower
saturation<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:53.579> my<00:01:54.420> player<00:01:54.930> colors<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> my

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
saturation my my player colors and my

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.819 
saturation my my player colors and my
enemy<00:01:56.579> colors<00:01:56.939> have<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> slightly<00:01:57.570> higher

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
enemy colors have a slightly higher

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
enemy colors have a slightly higher
saturation<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.369> makes<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.729> stand<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.329> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
saturation and it makes them stand out a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.999 
saturation and it makes them stand out a
little<00:02:00.659> bit<00:02:00.869> more<00:02:01.049> against<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> background

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
little bit more against the background

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
little bit more against the background
so<00:02:02.579> that's<00:02:02.759> one<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.090> things<00:02:03.299> I've<00:02:03.479> done<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so that's one of the things I've done a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.719 
so that's one of the things I've done a
lot<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.049> people<00:02:04.259> use<00:02:04.409> outlines<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.310> whatever

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
lot of people use outlines or whatever

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.029 
lot of people use outlines or whatever
but<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.600> how<00:02:06.719> I've<00:02:06.930> chosen<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.619> do<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
but this is how I've chosen to do it and

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.460 
but this is how I've chosen to do it and
so<00:02:08.700> because<00:02:09.090> this<00:02:09.270> animate<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> little<00:02:10.289> bit

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
so because this animate is a little bit

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.540 
so because this animate is a little bit
you<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.610> gonna<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.209> want

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
you know it's gonna I want

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.860 
you know it's gonna I want
stand<00:02:12.820> out<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.000> little<00:02:13.150> bit<00:02:13.300> I'm<00:02:13.510> gonna<00:02:13.630> bring

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
stand out a little bit I'm gonna bring

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.030 
stand out a little bit I'm gonna bring
it<00:02:14.050> forward<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.760> I'm<00:02:16.240> thinking<00:02:17.080> here<00:02:17.290> I've<00:02:17.470> got

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040

like red enemies I've got purple enemies

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.490 
like red enemies I've got purple enemies

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
I've got blue enemies I don't think I

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.310 
I've got blue enemies I don't think I
really<00:02:23.830> have<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.010> green<00:02:24.340> enemy<00:02:24.820> yet<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.900> we're

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
legs kind of appear to come from the top

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.970 
legs kind of appear to come from the top
and<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:56.990> looks<00:03:57.170> like<00:03:57.320> it's<00:03:57.470> coming<00:03:57.680> from<00:03:57.770> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
and this looks like it's coming from the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.830 
and this looks like it's coming from the
bottom<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:59.950> haven't<00:04:00.950> changed<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.840> like

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840

one<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.450> reasons<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.840> like<00:05:01.020> this<00:05:01.260> enemy<00:05:01.680> is

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
one of the reasons I like this enemy is

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.659 
one of the reasons I like this enemy is
because<00:05:02.729> I'm<00:05:03.030> not<00:05:03.210> gonna<00:05:03.389> have<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:04.340> do<00:05:05.340> all

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
because I'm not gonna have to do all

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.120 
because I'm not gonna have to do all
four<00:05:06.210> directions<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.990> this<00:05:07.169> thing<00:05:07.410> because

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
four directions on this thing because

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.770 
four directions on this thing because
some<00:05:08.340> enemies<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:08.850> can<00:05:09.000> get<00:05:09.210> away<00:05:09.330> with<00:05:09.600> that

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
some enemies you can get away with that

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.469 
some enemies you can get away with that
like<00:05:10.020> my<00:05:10.169> bat<00:05:10.470> it<00:05:11.220> only<00:05:11.370> goes<00:05:11.700> two<00:05:11.970> directions

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
like my bat it only goes two directions

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.420 
like my bat it only goes two directions
some<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.900> them<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.169> can't<00:05:13.470> though<00:05:13.710> but<00:05:14.280> this

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
some of them you can't though but this

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.529 
some of them you can't though but this
one<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.639> can<00:05:14.970> which<00:05:15.720> is<00:05:15.960> fun<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.620> do<00:05:16.740> because<00:05:17.539> it

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
one I can which is fun to do because it

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.450 
one I can which is fun to do because it
makes<00:05:18.750> my<00:05:18.960> job<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.229> little<00:05:19.470> bit<00:05:19.680> easier<00:05:22.400> okay<00:05:23.400> so

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
makes my job a little bit easier okay so
