00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 the circumstances were ideal this morning 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.120
 the herdgang at sports park 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.309
 trained by the weather and the competition 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.160
 is coming and everyone has it 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.160
 psv meaning yes wherever we are at one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.540
 good preparation in spain 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.279
 can train and compete well 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.960
 played and then it is nice too 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.430
 that you go to the second half of the season 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 can work towards the first match 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.369
 and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.840
 iistraat him the door backed 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.250
 by two wins on it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.439
 training camp on the Canary Islands 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.240
 win against cell thick and win against 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.489
 sparta prague what those two say 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.719
 matches phillip cocu guess that 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.149
 two different teams replayed 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.730
 almost except for a few and where you 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.579
 nevertheless a selden with things the playing method 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 psv could see well back and that is 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.210
 good to see 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.370
 so for that matter I think that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.050
 everything clearly taco is a good one 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.570
 implemented and that will be important basis 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 are for the second half of the season 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.320
 listen to what he is not easy with 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.570
 a away match against vitesse and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.940
 I think vitesse is one of the better ones 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.640
 soccer team play position game 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.460
 attacking team set how you in many 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.229
 qualities so that is a good one right away 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
 opponent but I also see it 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.430
 be in trouble against such an opponent 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.850
 to be so sharp in everyone 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.939
 to make up for the state and that it 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.570
 a difficult match is a good one 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.970
 opponent 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 that's just plus we are one 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.150
 less successful winter campaign 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.159
 had five zero floors of all lay 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.960
 says something 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.430
 well you here you want those matches 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.270
 win but you must also have everything 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.619
 hang up and a practice match is also possible 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.390
 but make the training intensity 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.869
 have something or try something different 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
 unpacks 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.840
 but let us not there 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.790
 Infer we are must be very sharp 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
 against this team that should not 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.329
 giving too much space 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.590
 to play football and we have to take care of it 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.750
 that her absolute sharpness 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.990
 we have to again make a 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.670
 kind of own back 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.470
 and they had in the last year 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.299
 away match against vitesse when psv won 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.520
 namely with two one 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.899
 always a footballing team and vitesse 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.200
 then there also arise for psv 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.970
 options are also often open westra 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.369
 that go up and down 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.019
 they say soccer team that yes that 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.050
 that attack and play those pressures 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.300
 gives that also means that the space 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.459
 comes to play well with them but 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.720
 we must use that well and what 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.550
 so we can also still have ours 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.930
 qualities and as I just said it 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.069
 is the art to immediately get back to the thread 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.980
 to tackle 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.390
 certainly in such a beautiful set 3 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.950
 players are not employable stijn 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.930
 scarce and this morning as an own 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.519
 program but two other players 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.769
 were missing at the training 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.299
 Oscar Hiljemark and Jorrit Hendrix 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.670
 both absent 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.650
 oscar who plays with young psv who has 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.260
 then twice in a short short vÃ©ry 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.870
 smit training camp will today 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.459
 Playing a half 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.630
 yes should build up for him again 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.920
 has direction to not happen that will 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.650
 primarily at young PSV 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.700
 happen and young it hendriks 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.170
 which is neither any time unemployable 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.209
 how long that you do not know exactly and on 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.100
 engaged in some research what is good 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.470
 and get clear what 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.420
 what exactly the complaint is and where is the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.980
 complaint our abs and yes it is 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.049
 not so easy to exactly you 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.810
 so we put our finger on those aspects 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.250
 would now be busy taking them because yes there 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.140
 lie that must be pink so that we 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.660
 also routeum to how we can 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.730
 but that can take some time 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.440
 it's hard to say I would 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.030
 can say whether it is a two or three 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.739
 four weeks is that is that is with this 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.600
 kind of injuries difficult to estimate 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.549
 tomorrow evening at a quarter to nine it is 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.549
 weather ball vitesse against psv
