00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
movie has a really good show on him I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.060 
movie has a really good show on him I
thought<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.360> felt<00:00:51.750> his<00:00:52.020> in-game<00:00:52.260> stats<00:00:52.649> didn't

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
thought I felt his in-game stats didn't

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
thought I felt his in-game stats didn't
give<00:00:53.190> him<00:00:53.309> enough<00:00:53.399> well

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
give him enough well

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
give him enough well
like<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.960> says<00:00:55.170> 79<00:00:55.680> shot<00:00:55.949> power<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
like I think it says 79 shot power and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.430 
like I think it says 79 shot power and
it<00:00:56.640> felt<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.000> lot<00:00:57.210> stronger<00:00:57.539> than<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.260> his

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
it felt a lot stronger than that so his

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.439 
it felt a lot stronger than that so his
shooting<00:00:58.829> was<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.280> awesome<00:00:59.449> especially

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
shooting was pretty awesome especially

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.270 
shooting was pretty awesome especially
in<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> penalty<00:01:00.899> area<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.859> could<00:01:02.070> come

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
in the penalty area but that could come

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
in the penalty area but that could come
down<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.520> his<00:01:02.820> finishing<00:01:03.270> he<00:01:03.449> finished<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.019> lot

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
down to his finishing he finished a lot

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.840 
down to his finishing he finished a lot
of<00:01:04.350> opportunities<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:04.890> me<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.670> ones

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
of opportunities for me and the ones

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.969 
of opportunities for me and the ones
that<00:01:06.060> he<00:01:06.210> didn't<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:07.080> my<00:01:07.409> fault

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that he didn't it was my fault

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.500 
that he didn't it was my fault
I<00:01:08.100> could<00:01:08.250> definitely<00:01:08.400> see<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.880> as<00:01:08.970> being<00:01:09.270> my

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
I could definitely see it as being my

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.660 
I could definitely see it as being my
fault<00:01:09.900> Bunce<00:01:10.409> finishing<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> penalty

heading in this game but I'd even school
one<00:01:47.549> header<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:48.030> him<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:49.350> could<00:01:49.619> be

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
one header with him so it could be

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.060 
one header with him so it could be
actually<00:01:50.790> Oscar<00:01:51.360> scored<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.869> headers<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.560> my

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
actually Oscar scored more headers in my

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.359 
actually Oscar scored more headers in my
team<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.579> Falcao<00:01:54.259> seriously<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.380> Falcao<00:01:55.799> he

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
team that Falcao seriously and Falcao he

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.889 
team that Falcao seriously and Falcao he
just<00:01:56.700> wouldn't<00:01:56.969> sometimes<00:01:57.450> go<00:01:57.630> into<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
just wouldn't sometimes go into the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.630 
just wouldn't sometimes go into the
Pouncy<00:01:58.229> area<00:01:58.409> when<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.590> wanna<00:01:58.740> cross<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.189> he

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
Pouncy area when I wanna cross it he

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.399 
Pouncy area when I wanna cross it he
would<00:01:59.759> wait<00:01:59.969> outside<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.719> penalty<00:02:00.899> area<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
would wait outside the penalty area and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.530 
would wait outside the penalty area and
even<00:02:01.649> when<00:02:01.770> he<00:02:01.799> was<00:02:02.009> inside<00:02:02.369> he<00:02:02.880> would<00:02:03.090> miss<00:02:03.299> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
even when he was inside he would miss it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.969 
even when he was inside he would miss it
and<00:02:03.719> even<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.079> he<00:02:04.200> does<00:02:04.380> connect<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
and even if he does connect with the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
and even if he does connect with the
bullets<00:02:05.399> most<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.000> time<00:02:06.210> off<00:02:06.420> targets<00:02:07.020> so

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
bullets most of the time off targets so

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.169 
bullets most of the time off targets so
what's<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.710> point<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.280> don't<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
what's the point I don't think there is

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.600 
what's the point I don't think there is

anyone as an aerial threat in fifa15 so
um<00:02:19.560> week<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.910> was<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> huge<00:02:21.690> problem<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:22.230> mean

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
um week this was a huge problem I mean

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.400 
um week this was a huge problem I mean
with<00:02:22.800> Ibrahimovic<00:02:23.520> he<00:02:23.790> was<00:02:24.060> quite<00:02:24.390> slow<00:02:24.600> but

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
with Ibrahimovic he was quite slow but

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.230 
with Ibrahimovic he was quite slow but
he<00:02:25.500> has<00:02:25.680> strength<00:02:26.100> he<00:02:26.310> has<00:02:26.460> some<00:02:26.730> dribbling

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
he has strength he has some dribbling

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.450 
he has strength he has some dribbling
that<00:02:27.540> would<00:02:27.750> help<00:02:27.990> him<00:02:28.200> out<00:02:28.320> but<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.070> guy<00:02:29.250> was

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
that would help him out but this guy was

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.850 
that would help him out but this guy was
 slow<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.540> he<00:02:30.870> at<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.110> same<00:02:31.350> time<00:02:31.590> was

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
 slow and he at the same time was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.640 
 slow and he at the same time was
weak<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.520> what<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.210> means<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.690> even<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.500> you

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
weak so what this means is even if you

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.800 
weak so what this means is even if you
dribble<00:02:35.070> past<00:02:35.310> defenders<00:02:35.820> even<00:02:36.450> though<00:02:36.600> this

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
dribble past defenders even though this

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.890 
dribble past defenders even though this
guy<00:02:37.050> has<00:02:37.680> borderline<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:39.720> even

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
guy has borderline just I don't even

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.690 
guy has borderline just I don't even
know<00:02:40.170> his<00:02:40.320> dribbling<00:02:40.680> wasn't<00:02:41.070> good<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.580> be

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
know his dribbling wasn't good to be

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.330 
know his dribbling wasn't good to be
honest<00:02:41.910> with<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.150> guys<00:02:42.210> but<00:02:42.990> if<00:02:43.680> you're

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
honest with you guys but if you're

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.950 
honest with you guys but if you're
really<00:02:44.670> good<00:02:44.820> at<00:02:44.910> dribbling<00:02:45.150> you'll<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:45.780> be

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
really good at dribbling you'll just be

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.080 
really good at dribbling you'll just be
able<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.320> forget<00:02:46.590> past<00:02:46.890> defenders<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.580> I

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
