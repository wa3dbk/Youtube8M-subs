different<00:02:59.180> from<00:02:59.329> last<00:02:59.540> year<00:02:59.870> than<00:03:00.079> it<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.319> now

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
different from last year than it is now

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.940 
different from last year than it is now
so<00:03:01.459> what<00:03:02.060> NCLEX<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.599> actually<00:03:02.989> changing<00:03:03.769> is

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
so what NCLEX is actually changing is

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.369 
so what NCLEX is actually changing is
the<00:03:03.980> way<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.579> they're<00:03:04.730> asking<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.989> same

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
the way that they're asking you the same

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.270 
the way that they're asking you the same
information<00:03:07.040> over<00:03:07.519> and<00:03:08.180> over<00:03:08.690> again<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.650> that

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
information over and over again so that

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.430 
information over and over again so that
is<00:03:10.489> why<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.670> stress<00:03:11.269> knowing<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.840> core<00:03:12.109> content

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
is why I stress knowing the core content

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.819 
is why I stress knowing the core content
knowledge<00:03:12.920> okay<00:03:13.639> a<00:03:13.930> typical<00:03:14.930> site<00:03:15.139> drugs<00:03:15.470> if

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
knowledge okay a typical site drugs if

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.979
