it's called a plumber's pipe and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.099 
it's called a plumber's pipe and
basically<00:00:20.609> what<00:00:20.849> it<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> it's<00:00:21.449> three-quarter

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
basically what it is it's three-quarter

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.550 
basically what it is it's three-quarter
inch<00:00:22.320> PVC<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:23.580> an<00:00:23.730> end<00:00:23.939> cap<00:00:24.239> on<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
inch PVC with an end cap on it when a

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.100 
inch PVC with an end cap on it when a
bunch<00:00:25.770> of<00:00:25.919> holes<00:00:26.099> drilled<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:28.849> the

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
bunch of holes drilled in it the

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.770 
bunch of holes drilled in it the
big<00:00:31.740> mr.<00:00:32.310> seems<00:00:32.580> to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:33.000> where<00:00:33.240> to<00:00:33.390> put<00:00:33.600> these

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
big mr. seems to be where to put these

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
big mr. seems to be where to put these
holes<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:36.890> quite<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.280> figured<00:00:38.670> out

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
holes and I quite got that figured out

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.100 
holes and I quite got that figured out
yet<00:00:39.240> because<00:00:39.690> it's<00:00:39.870> kind<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.920> attitude<00:00:42.110> but

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
yet because it's kind of attitude but

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
yet because it's kind of attitude but
this<00:00:43.380> thing<00:00:43.650> definitely<00:00:44.010> has<00:00:44.640> potential<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
this thing definitely has potential and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.610 
this thing definitely has potential and
times<00:00:47.130> being<00:00:47.580> what<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:47.880> are<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> lot

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
times being what they are I can do a lot

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.869 
times being what they are I can do a lot
of<00:00:49.760> experimenting<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.880> PVC<00:00:51.390> pipe<00:00:52.550> for<00:00:53.550> what<00:00:53.760> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
of experimenting on PVC pipe for what it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.600 
of experimenting on PVC pipe for what it
would<00:00:54.059> cost<00:00:54.090> me<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.980> buy<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.520> leaves

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610

now<00:01:03.660> here's<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:05.190> demonstration<00:01:05.370> of<00:01:06.180> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
now here's a little demonstration of the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
now here's a little demonstration of the
difference<00:01:06.810> between<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.380> two<00:01:07.620> well<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.550> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
difference between the two well first of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.050 
difference between the two well first of
all<00:01:08.820> I'll<00:01:09.060> show<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:10.260> big<00:01:10.560> difference<00:01:11.060> as

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
all I'll show you one big difference as

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.370 
all I'll show you one big difference as
the<00:01:12.119> size

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.550 

see<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.130> size<00:01:19.430> of<00:01:19.460> that<00:01:20.140> three-quarter<00:01:21.140> inch

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.499 

that's<00:01:24.189> going<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.759> make<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:24.939> big<00:01:25.210> difference

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
that's going to make a big difference

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.230 
that's going to make a big difference
when<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.049> hear<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:27.250> sound<00:01:27.549> that<00:01:27.790> comes<00:01:28.000> out

key here's just a short sample of what
this<00:01:36.250> one<00:01:36.460> sounds<00:01:36.850> like

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.170

and a little time to punch some holes

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.259 
and a little time to punch some holes
and<00:02:39.890> here's<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.010> little<00:02:41.099> sample<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.909> what<00:02:41.970> it

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
I you can see the potential in this

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.320 
I you can see the potential in this
thing

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.330

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
hopefully that in overdrive the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.449 
hopefully that in overdrive the
microphone<00:03:31.660> on<00:03:32.080> this<00:03:32.290> little<00:03:32.560> camera<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.250> put

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
microphone on this little camera to put

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.430 
microphone on this little camera to put
too<00:03:33.760> bad<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.300> that<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.540> could<00:03:34.720> actually<00:03:34.750> hear

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
too bad so that you could actually hear

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.009 
too bad so that you could actually hear
it's<00:03:35.920> got<00:03:36.989> unbelievable<00:03:37.989> tone<00:03:38.769> I<00:03:40.019> I'm

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
it's got unbelievable tone I I'm

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.540 
it's got unbelievable tone I I'm
planning<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.709> doing<00:03:41.769> some<00:03:42.310> more

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
planning on doing some more

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.000 
planning on doing some more
experimenting<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:45.370> from<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:47.230> G

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
experimenting on this from from a G

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.670 
experimenting on this from from a G
whistle<00:03:48.519> which<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.090> from<00:03:49.420> a<00:03:49.510> GT<00:03:49.989> flute<00:03:50.410> but

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
whistle which the from a GT flute but

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.550 
whistle which the from a GT flute but
this<00:03:50.830> is<00:03:51.130> too<00:03:51.819> you<00:03:52.569> know<00:03:52.690> all<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.290> way<00:03:53.410> up<00:03:53.530> to

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
this is too you know all the way up to

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:03.240 
this is too you know all the way up to
low<00:03:54.069> deep<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:59.130> think<00:04:00.569> just<00:04:01.569> those<00:04:01.870> low<00:04:02.319> keys

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
low deep and I think just those low keys

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.130 
low deep and I think just those low keys
i'm<00:04:03.610> going<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.880> try<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.420> make<00:04:04.690> them<00:04:04.870> out<00:04:05.019> of

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
i'm going to try to make them out of

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.170 
i'm going to try to make them out of
three-quarter-inch<00:04:05.769> we're<00:04:06.760> trying<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.060> make

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
three-quarter-inch we're trying to make

all this this I like to play with the

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.290 
all this this I like to play with the
pads<00:05:13.229> of<00:05:13.530> my<00:05:13.590> fingers<00:05:13.740> on<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.610> flute<00:05:15.479> and<00:05:17.300> this

pads of my fingers on a flute and this

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.659 
pads of my fingers on a flute and this
is<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:19.260> only<00:05:19.440> way<00:05:19.710> I'm<00:05:19.830> going<00:05:20.010> to<00:05:20.130> get<00:05:20.340> there

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
is the only way I'm going to get there

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.779 
is the only way I'm going to get there
if<00:05:20.970> at<00:05:21.419> all<00:05:21.570> because<00:05:21.960> it<00:05:22.320> when<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.070> get<00:05:23.310> down<00:05:23.490> to

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
if at all because it when I get down to

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.540 
if at all because it when I get down to
the<00:05:23.820> low<00:05:24.090> deep<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:25.350> spacing<00:05:25.949> is<00:05:26.100> going<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.370> get

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
the low deep the spacing is going to get

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.690 
the low deep the spacing is going to get
even<00:05:26.760> worse<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:27.979> if<00:05:28.979> they're<00:05:29.280> all<00:05:29.430> in<00:05:29.610> a

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
even worse and if they're all in a

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.150 
even worse and if they're all in a
straight<00:05:30.060> line<00:05:30.090> I<00:05:30.690> doubt<00:05:31.560> if<00:05:31.740> I'd<00:05:31.860> even<00:05:32.039> be

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
straight line I doubt if I'd even be

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.969 
straight line I doubt if I'd even be
able<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.400> play<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.760> thing<00:05:33.620> because<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.770> see

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
able to play the thing because you see

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.210 
able to play the thing because you see
this<00:05:35.570> this<00:05:36.570> whistle<00:05:37.110> they're<00:05:37.800> all<00:05:37.979> in<00:05:38.190> a

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
this this whistle they're all in a

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.400 
this this whistle they're all in a
straight<00:05:38.550> line<00:05:38.580> and<00:05:39.120> that's<00:05:39.930> that's<00:05:40.260> pretty

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
straight line and that's that's pretty

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.150 
straight line and that's that's pretty
much<00:05:40.889> you<00:05:41.370> know<00:05:41.570> which<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:42.780> buy<00:05:42.990> nowadays<00:05:43.380> you

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.650 

it<00:05:51.720> does<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:53.190> only<00:05:53.460> way<00:05:53.580> to<00:05:53.640> really<00:05:53.910> make<00:05:54.450> one

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
it does the only way to really make one

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.080 
it does the only way to really make one
to<00:05:55.380> fit<00:05:55.650> yourself<00:05:55.920> is<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.430> either<00:05:56.760> make<00:05:57.030> it

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
to fit yourself is to either make it

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.420 
to fit yourself is to either make it
yourself<00:05:57.360> I'll<00:05:57.810> have<00:05:58.440> somebody<00:05:58.740> make<00:05:59.160> it<00:05:59.220> for

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
yourself I'll have somebody make it for

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.290 
yourself I'll have somebody make it for
you<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:01.850> at<00:06:02.850> 43<00:06:03.570> cents<00:06:03.870> I<00:06:04.400> can<00:06:05.400> make<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.640> few<00:06:06.000> T's

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
you and at 43 cents I can make a few T's

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.800 
you and at 43 cents I can make a few T's
and<00:06:06.720> figure<00:06:07.320> it<00:06:07.350> out<00:06:07.590> and<00:06:08.280> I'll<00:06:09.180> eventually

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
and figure it out and I'll eventually

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.210 
and figure it out and I'll eventually
get<00:06:10.230> it<00:06:10.410> in<00:06:10.560> tune<00:06:10.830> to<00:06:12.680> now<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.740> only

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
get it in tune to now the only

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.880 
get it in tune to now the only
difference<00:06:14.850> that<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:16.200> biggest<00:06:16.650> difference

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
difference that the biggest difference

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.620 
difference that the biggest difference
not<00:06:17.520> the<00:06:17.640> only<00:06:17.820> one<00:06:18.120> but<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.390> biggest

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
not the only one but the biggest

not the only one but the biggest
difference<00:06:18.990> between<00:06:19.860> this<00:06:20.130> and<00:06:20.510> this<00:06:22.520> is<00:06:23.520> this

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.030 
difference between this and this is this

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.580 
difference between this and this is this
will<00:06:24.660> only<00:06:24.840> play<00:06:25.170> in<00:06:25.590> one<00:06:26.280> and<00:06:26.490> a<00:06:26.550> half<00:06:26.580> octaves

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
will only play in one and a half octaves

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.620 
will only play in one and a half octaves
if<00:06:28.590> you<00:06:28.830> want<00:06:29.040> to<00:06:29.130> go<00:06:29.280> two<00:06:29.340> octaves<00:06:30.180> of<00:06:30.360> better

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
if you want to go two octaves of better

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.880 
if you want to go two octaves of better
you'll<00:06:31.530> have<00:06:31.710> to<00:06:31.890> get<00:06:32.070> something<00:06:32.430> like<00:06:32.730> this

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
you'll have to get something like this

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.760 
you'll have to get something like this
now<00:06:34.890> it's<00:06:35.430> possible<00:06:36.120> that<00:06:36.330> once<00:06:36.570> I<00:06:36.750> get<00:06:37.230> into<00:06:37.530> a

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
now it's possible that once I get into a

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.460 
now it's possible that once I get into a
half<00:06:38.280> inch<00:06:38.610> pipe<00:06:39.000> and<00:06:39.390> I<00:06:39.720> I<00:06:39.750> make<00:06:40.050> if<00:06:40.320> I

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
half inch pipe and I I make if I

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.120 
half inch pipe and I I make if I
can<00:06:40.650> make<00:06:40.860> a<00:06:41.520> deef<00:06:42.510> loop<00:06:42.870> with<00:06:43.290> half<00:06:43.560> inch<00:06:43.830> pipe

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
can make a deef loop with half inch pipe

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.490 
can make a deef loop with half inch pipe
with<00:06:44.490> a<00:06:44.520> you<00:06:44.880> know<00:06:45.000> or<00:06:45.150> reached<00:06:45.390> it<00:06:45.660> that's<00:06:46.020> you

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
with a you know or reached it that's you

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.790 
with a you know or reached it that's you
know<00:06:46.760> within<00:06:47.760> reason

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.739 

you<00:06:51.800> know<00:06:52.960> then<00:06:53.960> that<00:06:54.259> that<00:06:55.219> will<00:06:55.719> be<00:06:56.719> a

00:06:56.739 --> 00:06:56.749 
you know then that that will be a

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.249 
you know then that that will be a
possibility<00:06:57.319> of<00:06:57.619> Lee<00:06:58.209> until<00:06:59.209> then<00:06:59.449> you<00:06:59.749> know<00:07:00.080> I

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
possibility of Lee until then you know I

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.129 
possibility of Lee until then you know I
mean<00:07:01.179> you're<00:07:02.179> going<00:07:02.300> to<00:07:02.360> using<00:07:02.659> to<00:07:02.749> pay<00:07:02.869> a<00:07:02.899> lot

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:04.969 
of money for that extra octave in a

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:09.429 
of money for that extra octave in a
couple<00:07:05.479> of<00:07:05.569> notes<00:07:05.779> and<00:07:06.529> uh<00:07:08.050> I've<00:07:09.050> been<00:07:09.110> that

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
I've been just kind of noodling around

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.649 
I've been just kind of noodling around
with<00:07:12.409> this<00:07:12.529> thing<00:07:12.589> today<00:07:13.189> and<00:07:13.999> I<00:07:14.240> can<00:07:14.449> play

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:14.659 
with this thing today and I can play

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:18.129 
with this thing today and I can play
pretty<00:07:15.050> much<00:07:15.529> of<00:07:15.830> what<00:07:16.069> I've<00:07:16.219> been<00:07:16.369> playing<00:07:17.139> on

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 
pretty much of what I've been playing on

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:21.669 
pretty much of what I've been playing on
an<00:07:18.559> octave<00:07:18.919> and<00:07:19.039> a<00:07:19.159> half<00:07:19.399> you<00:07:20.240> know<00:07:20.479> so<00:07:20.809> it<00:07:21.349> got

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:21.679 
an octave and a half you know so it got

00:07:21.679 --> 00:07:23.439 
an octave and a half you know so it got
it's<00:07:22.099> going<00:07:22.369> to<00:07:22.429> really<00:07:22.610> be<00:07:22.759> dependent<00:07:23.389> on

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449 
it's going to really be dependent on

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:25.179 
it's going to really be dependent on
with<00:07:23.689> the<00:07:23.809> song<00:07:24.020> wants<00:07:24.529> and<00:07:24.709> I<00:07:24.770> think<00:07:25.009> this

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:25.189 
with the song wants and I think this

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:28.449 
with the song wants and I think this
whistle<00:07:25.669> has<00:07:26.270> a<00:07:26.300> place<00:07:26.809> or<00:07:27.319> keep<00:07:27.830> calling<00:07:28.249> it<00:07:28.369> a

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:28.459 
whistle has a place or keep calling it a

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:30.999 
whistle has a place or keep calling it a
whistle<00:07:28.879> but<00:07:29.029> it's<00:07:29.180> a<00:07:29.300> fluke<00:07:29.539> and<00:07:29.779> it's<00:07:30.740> going

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:31.009 
whistle but it's a fluke and it's going

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.059 
whistle but it's a fluke and it's going
to<00:07:31.069> have<00:07:31.339> you<00:07:32.270> know<00:07:32.360> a<00:07:32.389> place<00:07:32.839> somewhere<00:07:33.349> you

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:34.069 
to have you know a place somewhere you

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.600 
to have you know a place somewhere you
know<00:07:34.219> I<00:07:34.430> mean<00:07:34.669> it's<00:07:34.849> going<00:07:35.089> to<00:07:35.149> bible<00:07:35.899> as<00:07:36.610> an

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610
