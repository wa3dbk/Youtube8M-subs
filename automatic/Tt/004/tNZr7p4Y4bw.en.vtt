00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
you died really quick in this game

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.440 
you died really quick in this game
that's<00:03:01.830> one<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.310> biggest<00:03:02.460> complaints<00:03:02.970> my

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
that's one of the biggest complaints my

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.240 
that's one of the biggest complaints my
hope<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.590> complete<00:03:04.950> theory

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
hope and this is just a complete theory

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.700 
hope and this is just a complete theory
but<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.210> my<00:03:06.360> hope<00:03:06.570> here<00:03:06.810> is<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.290> they're

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
but this is my hope here is that they're

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.640 
but this is my hope here is that they're
using<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.550> new<00:03:08.970> playlist<00:03:09.630> as<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> beta<00:03:10.260> test

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
using this new playlist as a beta test

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.910 
using this new playlist as a beta test
to<00:03:11.280> do<00:03:11.490> an<00:03:11.610> over<00:03:12.000> a<00:03:12.030> whole<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.080> game<00:03:13.290> where

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
to do an over a whole of the game where

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.160 
to do an over a whole of the game where
they<00:03:14.100> go<00:03:14.490> ahead<00:03:14.820> and<00:03:15.030> just<00:03:15.450> change<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.870> health

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
they go ahead and just change the health

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.900 
they go ahead and just change the health
overall<00:03:16.590> throughout<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.070> game<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.280> make<00:03:17.580> it<00:03:17.640> a

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
overall throughout the game to make it a

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.570 
overall throughout the game to make it a
little<00:03:18.239> bit<00:03:18.390> more<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.870> black<00:03:19.080> ops<00:03:19.350> 2<00:03:19.620> alright

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
little bit more like black ops 2 alright

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.979 
little bit more like black ops 2 alright

you get melted when I first started
playing<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.530> game<00:03:37.770> I<00:03:38.010> honestly<00:03:38.430> feel<00:03:38.580> like<00:03:38.640> I

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
playing this game I honestly feel like I

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.640 
playing this game I honestly feel like I
was<00:03:38.910> being<00:03:39.000> sniped<00:03:39.450> every<00:03:39.900> time<00:03:40.140> but<00:03:40.560> I'm

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
was being sniped every time but I'm

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.840 
was being sniped every time but I'm
being<00:03:40.800> like<00:03:40.980> shot<00:03:41.220> with<00:03:41.370> an<00:03:41.459> assault<00:03:41.790> rifle

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
being like shot with an assault rifle

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.940 
being like shot with an assault rifle
across<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.600> map<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.050> felt<00:03:43.350> like<00:03:43.500> you<00:03:43.560> died

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
across the map and I felt like you died

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.560 
across the map and I felt like you died
so<00:03:43.980> quick<00:03:44.519> it<00:03:44.640> feels<00:03:44.790> like<00:03:44.910> he<00:03:45.030> had<00:03:45.150> snipe<00:03:45.360> and

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
so quick it feels like he had snipe and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.150 
so quick it feels like he had snipe and
everyone<00:03:45.989> who's<00:03:46.140> played<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.380> game<00:03:46.709> can<00:03:46.920> agree

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
everyone who's played the game can agree

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.870 
everyone who's played the game can agree
with<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.930> isn't<00:03:48.930> what<00:03:49.050> this<00:03:49.170> game<00:03:49.410> mode

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
with that and isn't what this game mode

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.979 
with that and isn't what this game mode
hopefully<00:03:50.880> my<00:03:51.030> idea<00:03:51.330> is<00:03:51.450> hopefully<00:03:51.630> they're

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
hopefully my idea is hopefully they're

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.780 
hopefully my idea is hopefully they're
kind<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.170> beta<00:03:52.410> testing<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:53.070> then<00:03:53.400> maybe<00:03:53.580> do<00:03:53.760> a

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
kind of beta testing it then maybe do a

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.910 
kind of beta testing it then maybe do a
complete<00:03:54.120> overhaul<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.260> health<00:03:55.470> system

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
complete overhaul of the health system

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.530 
complete overhaul of the health system
here<00:03:56.190> within<00:03:56.340> cod<00:03:56.519> ghosts<00:03:56.760> now<00:03:57.180> will<00:03:57.390> that

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
here within cod ghosts now will that

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.620 
here within cod ghosts now will that
happen<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:58.170> hope<00:03:58.800> so<00:03:59.070> but<00:03:59.280> probably<00:03:59.670> not<00:03:59.880> it's

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
happen I hope so but probably not it's

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.090 
happen I hope so but probably not it's
been<00:04:00.810> my<00:04:00.900> experience<00:04:00.930> that<00:04:01.380> niche<00:04:01.620> game<00:04:01.890> modes

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
been my experience that niche game modes

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.410 
been my experience that niche game modes
or<00:04:02.250> niche<00:04:02.430> playlists<00:04:02.880> like<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:03.239> don't

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.720 
or niche playlists like this don't
typically<00:04:03.930> actually<00:04:04.350> do<00:04:04.500> very<00:04:04.769> well<00:04:04.830> mainly

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
typically actually do very well mainly

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.699 
typically actually do very well mainly
because<00:04:05.880> look<00:04:06.330> at<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.600> just<00:04:06.660> melt<00:04:07.140> off<00:04:07.350> my

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
because look at this I just melt off my

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.280 
because look at this I just melt off my
street<00:04:07.980> but<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:09.420> didn't<00:04:09.750> really<00:04:09.840> do<00:04:10.080> well

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
street but it didn't really do well

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.560 
street but it didn't really do well
alright<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.860> black<00:04:11.070> ops<00:04:11.280> 1<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.880> lot<00:04:12.239> of<00:04:12.300> people

alright and black ops 1 a lot of people
were<00:04:12.660> calling<00:04:12.900> back<00:04:13.200> because<00:04:13.590> the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
were calling back because the

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.500 
were calling back because the
killstreaks<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.459> black<00:04:14.670> ops<00:04:14.880> 1<00:04:15.060> were<00:04:15.209> kind<00:04:15.450> of

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
killstreaks and black ops 1 were kind of

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.080 
killstreaks and black ops 1 were kind of

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
like I said they'll use this as kind of

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.700 
like I said they'll use this as kind of
a<00:05:55.800> beta<00:05:56.040> to<00:05:56.400> do<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.580> complete<00:05:57.090> overhaul<00:05:57.780> of<00:05:58.050> the

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
a beta to do a complete overhaul of the

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.740 
a beta to do a complete overhaul of the
game<00:05:58.860> itself<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.790> maybe<00:05:59.940> increase<00:06:00.600> the

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
game itself and maybe increase the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.050 
game itself and maybe increase the
health<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.230> make<00:06:01.800> everybody<00:06:02.340> happy<00:06:02.460> I<00:06:02.790> think

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060
