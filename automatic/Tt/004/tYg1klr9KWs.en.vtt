00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.470
 administrator 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:12.020
 now you will leave some folders after 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.870
 As you can see here, many 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.910
 games worth 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.270

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.450
 put the place 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.020
 or the blues we're going to the game code 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.869

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.959
