00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.909
 let's make it the new chassis 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.200
 so now I 'm going to cut it 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.420
 with the changes for example 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.890
 to appreciate 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.420
 The accelerator 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.740
 I have left 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.740
 outside the chassis 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.480
 in the chassis 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.480
 to cover it and to stay inside 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.370
 now with lime to give the whole form 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.009
 and with a fine animal 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.430
 the perforations good the chassis already 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.240
 is 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.240
 Perforated 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.670
 and have healed 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.220
 two 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.689
 obviously the son chassis is like mold 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.920
 and it's this longest part 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.000
 and I made it longer the chassis to win 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.030
 after there 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.730
 the bumper and not 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.300
 and not be below 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.300
 the difference 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.540
 there's the piece of reinforcement 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.580
 what is a l 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.210
 in which to bolt 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.210
 wide 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.450
 more endurance strength 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.400
 experience that is that what always 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.400
 break 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.090
 9 millimeters 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.680
 it 's nothing 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.120
 so I go 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.830
 the bagel 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.140
 let say 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.140
 these thick 5 millimeters 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.600
 it's infinite no need to scream but 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.600
 when the thick yes 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.250
 and very easy 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.470
 you have to take it out carefully 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.110
 with what's left of him 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.110
 then with time and a little more d 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.210
 look at a new bumper but now 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.210
 I have 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.940
 82 min on bush 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.940
 2 4 5 6 7 8 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.850
 aluminum bumpers 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.880
 two plates of 3 mm society 6 mm 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.790
 bumper 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.870
 5 millimeters 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.870
 and 11 millimeters 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.050
 install the bar 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.050
 We are strong 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.640
 until we know strong and 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.129
 that where it also grabs the reinforcement of 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:42.169
 chassis 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:42.169
 at the same see us good until then 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:52.699
 very cute scorpion blitz which 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.699
 I previously put him 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.770
 our dining room 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.119
 await stone in this case 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.480
 with push-ups 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.639
 it was very easy to put them directly to 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.650
 an iron 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.650
 Do not hit the cuts 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.180
 then I make sure he does not get in 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.380
 a ton of stones 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.380
 the rock that breaks all 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:35.759
 we convert 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.970
 in a truck 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.970
