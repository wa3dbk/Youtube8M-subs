it's from the Stone Age but it's been
through<00:00:19.000> things<00:00:19.510> like<00:00:19.630> a<00:00:19.750> monsoon<00:00:20.320> in

horizontal<00:00:28.930> range<00:00:29.140> of<00:00:29.230> a<00:00:29.619> monsoon<00:00:29.980> and<00:00:30.570> people

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
horizontal range of a monsoon and people

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.030 
horizontal range of a monsoon and people
have<00:00:31.660> been<00:00:31.750> there<00:00:31.960> all<00:00:32.080> day<00:00:32.110> standing<00:00:32.830> in<00:00:32.890> mud

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
have been there all day standing in mud

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.549 
have been there all day standing in mud
and<00:00:33.100> in<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.820> rain<00:00:34.000> and<00:00:34.870> we<00:00:34.930> just<00:00:35.260> said<00:00:35.410> you

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
and in the rain and we just said you

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.939 
and in the rain and we just said you
know<00:00:35.680> what<00:00:35.830> let's<00:00:36.820> play<00:00:37.000> and<00:00:37.390> I'm<00:00:37.570> I<00:00:37.870> love<00:00:38.739> that

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
know what let's play and I'm I love that

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.549 
know what let's play and I'm I love that
because<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.480> know<00:00:40.600> everybody's<00:00:41.110> got<00:00:41.140> are<00:00:41.500> you

because you know everybody's got are you

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:42.479 
because you know everybody's got are you
going<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:41.800> get<00:00:41.890> electrocuted

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
going to get electrocuted

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.320 
going to get electrocuted
no<00:00:43.030> I'm<00:00:43.150> not<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.530> cord<00:00:45.070> there's<00:00:45.909> a<00:00:46.000> wire<00:00:46.180> in

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330 
no I'm not the cord there's a wire in

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.540 
no I'm not the cord there's a wire in
the<00:00:46.420> cords<00:00:46.750> this<00:00:46.900> big<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.379> know<00:00:48.159> all<00:00:48.400> right

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
the cords this big I know all right

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.329 
the cords this big I know all right
I've<00:00:49.120> studied<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.570> lot<00:00:49.690> more<00:00:49.960> about<00:00:50.339> electric

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
I've studied a lot more about electric

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.479 
I've studied a lot more about electric
conductivity<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:53.769> small

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
conductivity and the the the small

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.579 
conductivity and the the the small
amount<00:00:54.760> of<00:00:54.879> amps<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:55.900> it<00:00:56.199> could<00:00:56.379> potentially

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
amount of amps that it could potentially

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.860 
amount of amps that it could potentially
take<00:00:57.070> if<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.400> was<00:00:57.519> raised<00:00:57.760> through<00:00:58.690> high

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
take if it was raised through high

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.910 
take if it was raised through high
enough<00:00:59.019> polish<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.010> uh<00:01:00.839> we<00:01:01.839> did<00:01:01.989> anyway<00:01:02.229> kept

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
enough polish so uh we did anyway kept

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.500 
enough polish so uh we did anyway kept
playing<00:01:03.129> at<00:01:03.370> television<00:01:03.909> everything

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
playing at television everything

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.620 
playing at television everything
short-circuited<00:01:05.350> the<00:01:05.729> b3<00:01:06.729> organ<00:01:06.909> when<00:01:07.420> John

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
short-circuited the b3 organ when John

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.820 
short-circuited the b3 organ when John
was<00:01:07.750> doing<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:08.080> rake<00:01:08.260> across<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.710> keyboard

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
was doing a rake across the keyboard

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.850 
was doing a rake across the keyboard
look<00:01:09.820> well<00:01:09.970> actually<00:01:10.150> with<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.450> red<00:01:10.630> knew

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
look well actually with the red knew

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.719 
look well actually with the red knew
there<00:01:11.860> was<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.040> be<00:01:12.130> a<00:01:12.159> trail<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.580> water<00:01:12.729> follow

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
there was to be a trail of water follow

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.910 
there was to be a trail of water follow
when<00:01:15.729> when<00:01:15.940> in<00:01:16.420> face<00:01:16.630> hit<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.020> floor<00:01:17.649> times

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
when when in face hit the floor times

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.779 
when when in face hit the floor times
because<00:01:18.579> he<00:01:18.729> keeps<00:01:18.880> him<00:01:19.090> level<00:01:19.299> just<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:20.079> huge

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
because he keeps him level just a huge

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.060 
because he keeps him level just a huge
symmetrical<00:01:21.789> like<00:01:21.969> ring<00:01:22.780> of<00:01:23.079> water<00:01:23.439> I<00:01:23.829> was

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
symmetrical like ring of water I was

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.950 
symmetrical like ring of water I was
praying<00:01:24.430> in<00:01:24.579> all<00:01:24.700> director<00:01:25.060> but<00:01:25.270> really<00:01:25.719> cool

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
praying in all director but really cool

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.779 
praying in all director but really cool
every<00:01:26.649> time<00:01:26.829> there<00:01:26.979> was<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.130> drum<00:01:27.340> I<00:01:27.579> turn

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
every time there was a drum I turn

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.569 
every time there was a drum I turn
around<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:28.179> look<00:01:28.329> and<00:01:28.920> with<00:01:29.920> garbage<00:01:30.520> bags

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
around and look and with garbage bags

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.800 
around and look and with garbage bags
over<00:01:31.000> my<00:01:31.210> pedalboard

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
over my pedalboard

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.440 
over my pedalboard
and<00:01:31.960> what<00:01:32.710> in<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:32.920> driving<00:01:33.130> rain<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:34.329> know

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
and what in the driving rain a you know

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.130 
and what in the driving rain a you know
plastic<00:01:35.140> is<00:01:35.710> slippery<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:37.060> sides<00:01:37.479> upon<00:01:37.810> that

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.599 

Rogers<00:01:41.140> doing<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.799> wireless<00:01:42.219> thing<00:01:42.429> and

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
Rogers doing the the wireless thing and

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.520 
Rogers doing the the wireless thing and
it<00:01:42.939> didn't<00:01:43.149> take<00:01:43.270> long<00:01:43.299> for<00:01:43.539> that<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:44.109> had<00:01:44.320> said

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
it didn't take long for that I had said

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.279 
it didn't take long for that I had said
let's<00:01:45.039> see<00:01:45.249> I<00:01:45.429> give<00:01:45.609> him<00:01:45.729> one<00:01:45.939> song<00:01:46.210> and<00:01:46.780> then

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
let's see I give him one song and then

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.859 
let's see I give him one song and then
pretty<00:01:47.499> soon<00:01:47.590> he's<00:01:47.859> got<00:01:48.039> a<00:01:48.070> cord<00:01:48.369> plugged<00:01:48.700> in

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
pretty soon he's got a cord plugged in

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.480 
pretty soon he's got a cord plugged in
when<00:01:49.869> all<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.079> spells<00:01:50.380> do<00:01:50.679> what<00:01:50.890> sounds<00:01:51.249> best

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
when all the spells do what sounds best

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.260 
when all the spells do what sounds best
like<00:01:52.090> in<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.630> court<00:01:52.929> right<00:01:53.140> so<00:01:53.820> yeah<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.149> he

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
like in the court right so yeah so he

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.880 
like in the court right so yeah so he
went<00:01:55.390> back<00:01:55.569> to<00:01:55.719> court<00:01:55.960> he<00:01:56.259> kept<00:01:56.439> playing<00:01:56.560> for<00:01:56.829> a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
went back to court he kept playing for a

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.709 
went back to court he kept playing for a
while<00:01:56.950> he<00:01:57.549> switched<00:01:57.789> bass<00:01:58.030> he<00:01:58.210> had<00:01:58.299> two<00:01:58.359> active

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
while he switched bass he had two active

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:01.859 
while he switched bass he had two active
basis<00:01:59.109> well<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> lot<00:02:00.100> bases<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.579> active<00:02:00.909> EQ<00:02:01.329> so

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
basis well a lot bases have active EQ so

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.039 
basis well a lot bases have active EQ so
he<00:02:02.469> was<00:02:02.590> changing<00:02:03.069> Qatar's<00:02:03.549> you<00:02:04.359> know<00:02:04.479> as<00:02:04.749> fast

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
he was changing Qatar's you know as fast

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.910 
he was changing Qatar's you know as fast
he<00:02:05.229> could<00:02:05.909> well<00:02:07.259> normally<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.319> played<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.590> YTD

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
he could well normally I played the YTD

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.120 
he could well normally I played the YTD
it's<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.429> three<00:02:10.060> pickup<00:02:10.330> model<00:02:10.710> that<00:02:11.710> I<00:02:11.740> sort<00:02:12.040> of

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
it's a three pickup model that I sort of

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.890 
it's a three pickup model that I sort of
designed<00:02:12.460> for<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.210> deeper<00:02:13.480> forgetting<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:13.870> I
