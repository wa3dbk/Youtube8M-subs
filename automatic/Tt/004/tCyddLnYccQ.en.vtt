 differences in gameplay game

 blood and hits a reboot of the game 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.480
 mortal kombat a great game its 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.220
 gameplay is not as complicated as 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.620
 the previous games and you can run 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.230

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.510
 for the ps3 version we will have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.489
 credits the god of war we also count 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.560
 with freddy krueger this game you the 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.069
 you will have a great time throwing straight lines with your 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.709

 great tourism 5 good there is not much that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.880
 say but it is one of the best games 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.980
 of cars we have a great variety 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.380
 of car scenarios no doubt the 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.110
 graphics are the best a game that you should 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.239
 have batman arkham city 'the game of 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.549
 bat return after assa and what 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.650
 they mark the game it's about that batman 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.569
 he has to face crazy once more 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.579
 that they escaped from the asylum of arkham and 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.579
 fighting against villains like hugo 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.349
 strange pain cat the good joker no 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.569
 I have a lot to say about this game 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.459
 because I still do not have it, but what 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.910
 little I played fascinated me since I am 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.760
 fan of 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.740
 batman soon calibur 4 this game is a 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.780
 great fighting game since it's from the 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.390
 same as the company that bring us tec 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.130
 in mechanics and gameplay it's the same 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.860
 to tekken only that here these subjects 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.140
 they fight with swords this game for me is 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.210
 better than 5 since we have the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.970
 star wars characters darth vader 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.460
 gioda and the apprentice a great game for 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.590
 have a good time of the universe versus 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.870
 deadly kombat good unlike 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.850
 mortal kombat 9 this is not very good at 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.100
 comparison with 9 because the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.560
 gameplay is somewhat difficult as much as 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.820
 execute fatalities but that does not rule out 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.770
 that is bad since to see the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.810
 DC Comics superheroes against 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.060
 bloodthirsty fighters of mortal kombat 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.090
 it's great characters that we have from 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.180
 that side like batman superman flash 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.400
 Green Lantern test truck shazam 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.500
 Wonder woman and others with this game 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.600
 you 'll spend hours entertaining good 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.010
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.010
 until the next loquendo bai
