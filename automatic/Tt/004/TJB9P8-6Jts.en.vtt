00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
really hard it's actually really easy to

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.980 
really hard it's actually really easy to
go<00:03:36.040> to<00:03:36.100> breach<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.000> clear<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.300> do<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.570> in<00:03:37.720> the

breach a name for that one enemy or like
you<00:04:01.680> get<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:01.890> point<00:04:02.870> like<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.170> pick<00:04:04.349> out

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
you get the point like you can pick out

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.190 
you get the point like you can pick out
four<00:04:04.709> shots<00:04:04.980> easy<00:04:05.250> enough<00:04:05.900> just<00:04:06.900> like<00:04:07.019> that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
four shots easy enough just like that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.470 
four shots easy enough just like that
and<00:04:07.860> able<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.400> do<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:11.209> but<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.390> probably

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
and able to do it but that is probably

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.089 
and able to do it but that is probably
the<00:04:12.690> easiest<00:04:12.989> place<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.260> do<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.769> don't<00:04:14.069> think

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
the easiest place to do it I don't think

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.619 
the easiest place to do it I don't think
I<00:04:14.280> got<00:04:14.430> at<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.579> time<00:04:14.879> if<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:15.450> would<00:04:15.569> have

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
I got at that time if I would have

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.650 
I got at that time if I would have
gotten<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.370> also<00:04:17.370> my<00:04:17.850> best<00:04:18.090> time<00:04:18.359> on

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
gotten it and also my best time on

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.110 
gotten it and also my best time on
breach<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.199> clear<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.530> 15.7<00:04:20.519> seconds<00:04:20.910> and

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
breach and clear is 15.7 seconds and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.000 
breach and clear is 15.7 seconds and
infinity<00:04:21.570> ward's<00:04:21.840> best<00:04:22.049> time<00:04:22.229> is<00:04:22.380> 17<00:04:22.800> side

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
infinity ward's best time is 17 side

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.310 
infinity ward's best time is 17 side
beaten<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.610> time<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.030> just<00:04:24.930> want<00:04:25.110> to<00:04:25.139> know<00:04:25.229> if
