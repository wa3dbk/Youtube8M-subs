00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.939
 whether during renovation or new construction owners 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 Today, sustainability is what we have 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.170
 Your property in view the house should 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 The building materials use little energy 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.680
 should be produced ecologically and 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.150
 enable a healthy living environment 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.410
 but where does he take the installation from 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.780
 certainty that his house is this 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.640
 criteria 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.050
 help certifications one 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.660
 of which for the boys the German 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.420
 society for sustainable construction dgnb 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.529
 there are different 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.480
 certification systems on the market in 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.520
 Essentially, the dgnb differs 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.040
 system in that there is one 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.379
 holistic consideration of the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.629
 entire life cycle of the property 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.300
 As one puts says from the cradle to the 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.059
 So from the planning to the time of the 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.970
 dismantling and disposal of the 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.950
 entire life cycle thus considered 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.600
 a building a certificate of dgnb 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.440
 There must be many criteria 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.750
 fulfill 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.190
 for the ecological quality are about 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.960
 the primary energy requirement or 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.610
 environmentally friendly building materials 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.140
 important for the economic 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.699
 Consideration will be the cost during 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.550
 the entire life of the house 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.560
 calculated in addition to technical qualities 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.500
 but also include comfort and functions 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.690
 How is the quality in Rome is the house 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.759
 Barrier-free and can be the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.300
 to adapt the floor plan 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.770
 we can talk about that 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.630
 sustainability rating very accurate 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.140
 see in which criteria a house is good 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.049
 is and where the house maybe less 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.430
 effective with respect to 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.650
 sustainability criteria is and these 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.710
 transparency that we have in the system 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.830
 now allows for all criteria 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.229
 40 50 criteria to look at behaves 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.610
 the house is ideal for the farmers 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.250
 from a not to be underestimated 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.470
 advantage you know you are in one 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.560
 the property permanently and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.950
 to operate economically is the order 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.320
 is environmentally friendly 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.720
 the good floor plans have the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.909
 also different life situations too 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.770
 Let's do that and how to do it like that 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.320
 Nice says is comprehensive sustainable 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.359
 at its congress, the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.280
 dgnb now has several projects for her 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.619
 sustainable construction award 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.660
 So far, the certificates were mostly 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.390
 for office buildings and large residential buildings 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.980
 For the first time, the dgnb also lent 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.080
 Certificate for small a bite 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.940
 multi-family houses the further development 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 our certification system on the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.360
 smaller housing was for us one 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.650
 quite logical step because we 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.849
 of course, the theme also the broad 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.250
 also want to bring the end user 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.110
 the opportunity to be with the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.569
 to deal with the topic and in the reason 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.060
 also to make the home sustainable 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.890
 is particularly in demand among builders 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.930
 of course, in the face of rising 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.810
 energy costs the question of energy 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.220
 that plays a central role, but we do 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 The other criteria should not 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.510
 forgot when I save energy and me 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.209
 do not live healthy no longer healthy 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.880
 then use me the best energy saving 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.579
 not me, of course, also to the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.590
 think what is required of us in the future 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.269
 where we where we might still be 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.310
 become more sensitive than we are today 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.780
 are also the environment 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.880
 that is above all things 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.489
 choice of materials that means the products 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.739
 be used to implement buildings 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.870
 how are they afterwards able to agree 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.609
 you can easily swap those and and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.470
 You had that knowledge until a few years ago 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.670
 years in the wise not yet 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.560
 you get the slow ones too 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.880
 Information you need and 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.200
 Accordingly, the people also catch 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.940
 to deal with it 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.800
 this need has some manufacturers 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.610
 recognized and their homes of the exam 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.860
 subjected 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.030
 and so will the new dgnb certificate 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.240
 also for the first time at one 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.670
 awarded to prefab manufacturers 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.920
 The model house is locally a brand of dfh 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.270
 German prefabricated house holding ag met 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.270
 the criteria for sustainable building 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.750
 who then build for sustainable 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.470
 Excellent sustainable building 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.790
 insofar as the whole process 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.310
 from the planning phase to the 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.960
 realization on the life cycle of 50 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.850
 Years will be considered in the future 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.860
 energy costs will be quite complete 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.360
 important roles are played in particular by the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.370
 I found entertainment costs 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.620
 houses very clearly the nose in front 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.240
 Of course, the building stands out 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.010
 very good energy efficiency from the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.990
 Energy concept is very good 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.820
 you have a lot of that there 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.740
 Emphasis on the topic of user comfort 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.930
 placed around that means it is barrier-free 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.730
 accessible the building materials are all 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.480
 been very consciously chosen very much 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.100
 low in pollutants so it was very 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.840
 We use valuable raw materials 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.690
 have a very low energy requirement 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.780
 we have a very well insulated 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.610
 building envelope and a plant engineering the 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.010
 the whole still supported 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.760
 the success of the prefabricated house manufacturer is 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.500
 no coincidence 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.120
 For some time, the 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.340
 houses in timber frame construction as 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.350
 ecological alternative besides the 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.220
 groups building design from one source is it 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.870
 especially the industrial one 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.590
 series production of which the buyers 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.850
 benefit from a prefabricated house 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.070
 Basically, this theme is the one 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.870
 Of course, serial production is very suitable 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.370
 this topic of sustainability is very 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.010
 consistently implement 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.860
 prefabricated houses are future-oriented us 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.130
 build with ecological building materials wood 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.600
 as our main component of the construction 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.210
 ideal co2 neutral 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:12.210
 The prefab house construction can be very good 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.630
 contribute to a house in the 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.700
 make qualities better testable 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.950
 that means we find the production 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.990
 under controlled conditions in 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.880
 a factory instead of a total I believe 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.550
 but that's just a higher measure 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.650
 to prefabrication with better quality 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.370
 proven quality comes with it 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.500
 can bring 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.910
 A sustainable construction pays off 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.040
 each case financially for the builder 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.169
 still for the resale value is 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.940
 all the better 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.490
 in the future, we expect that 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.620
 insurance and 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.520
 banks this accordingly 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.789
 a bonus like interest reduction 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.919
 reward 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.349
 and so it will be a series of 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.360
 ask questions where builders today 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.789
 maybe not so much appreciate 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.949
 that you have a certificate for the 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:59.169
 But sustainability has already become a reality 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.789
 by reading the certificate 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.770
 become 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:05.169
 man there I have something now that 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.440
 really better in many ways 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.539
 is a normal house itself 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.430
 practically finished without a precise 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.240
 description of the qualities of this 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.240
 get a building
