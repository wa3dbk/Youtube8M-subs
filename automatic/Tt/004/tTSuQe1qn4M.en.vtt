00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630 
spread a bit looks when you're using a
shotgun<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.620> just<00:00:43.770> one<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> be

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
shotgun it's just one so you have to be

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.910 
shotgun it's just one so you have to be
so<00:00:45.420> accurate<00:00:45.719> when<00:00:46.140> you're<00:00:46.230> using<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
so accurate when you're using it if you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340 
so accurate when you're using it if you
want<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> best<00:00:48.300> out<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.079> I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
want to get the best out of it so I

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
want to get the best out of it so I
would<00:00:50.100> recommend<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:50.879> later<00:00:51.480> say

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
would recommend that you use later say

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
would recommend that you use later say

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and long battle as I think these are the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.970 
and long battle as I think these are the
best<00:00:54.449> two<00:00:54.750> attachments<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.500> use<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.770> aisle

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
best two attachments to use on aisle

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.060 
best two attachments to use on aisle
over<00:00:56.190> shotguns<00:00:56.899> long<00:00:57.899> battle<00:00:58.350> basically

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
over shotguns long battle basically

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.459 
over shotguns long battle basically
self-explanatory<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.379> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
self-explanatory you just use it so you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.429 
self-explanatory you just use it so you
can<00:01:01.620> get<00:01:01.890> those<00:01:01.980> long<00:01:02.309> shots<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.110> later<00:01:04.110> say<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
can get those long shots and later say I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440
