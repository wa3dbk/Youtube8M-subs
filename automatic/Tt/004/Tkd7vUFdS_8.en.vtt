 once we are here I already have 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.590
 stuck copied the room on the sd card 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.350
 ok anticipate previously good then what 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.450
 what are we going to do is go to let's do 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.640

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.320
 there we are going to go 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.320
 I do not think so 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.579
 well let's do wefaq of the 7 reset 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.829
 we give him 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.310
 we go down to the yes option 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.190
 and we hope that 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.800
 you believe 9 then let's go to the second 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:11.040

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.130
 advanced 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.240
 is the option that we see jockey 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.090
 I think if you see it 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.890
 let's go in there and let's go to 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 where do you put walking h 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.439
 Well we will leave to our phone 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.079
 totally clean for an installation 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:35.460
 new good once we are here 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.460
 let's go to good bag 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:44.360
 and we're going to install from sd card 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.120

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.680
 here and we're going to 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.160
 good for those who missed this 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 step backward when we go to 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.470
 back another little 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.650
 We will install without front sd card and 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.900
 then here I look 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.150
 I'm looking for an internal phone card 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.820
 which is where I have if I had nothing 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.080
 of that he is normal up here when 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.470
 I have it here I know I have it here 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.100
 and as we can see here is see 4.2.1 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.930
 We give you to install and install 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.930
 we are seeing how it is being installed 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.180
 we are installing I do not know if you can see 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.180
 let's do a little zoom 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.290
 We are in the process of installing 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.090
 and as we can see it puts me and installs 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.349
 from sd card complete I do not know if they can 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.569
 see but good that's what it puts me 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.690
 then we are going to 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:59.130
 wood bat 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.130
 and we go to system new rebounds and dim 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.569
 is going to start the phone the first 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.609
 always always delay 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.370
 a little bit more than the start account 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.799
 but calm that the phone is going to 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.639
 start if they had any problem 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.680
 during installation to whatever 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.840
 just try again as 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.670
 we can see this is the logo as 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.040
 the one that says of the room 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.930
 good here we can see the screen 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.400
 Welcome screen that gives us 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.400

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.400
 Start 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.890
 for the moment we are going to skip this step of 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.819
 the 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.819
 of the wifi 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.160
 omit anyway is not us 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.170
 warning of 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.650
 that the data may charge a fee 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.670
 additional now not 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.340
 and now do not go on the march to 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:57.220
 what interests us 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.980
 ok when this later 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.940

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.940
 I can configure later 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.510
 end ok meanwhile we can see 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.130

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.630

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.670
 see here 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.120
 we are remembering that we are in a 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.730
 samsung galaxy s normalito for me this 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.970
 is the chuck norris of the range of the 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.820
 the galaxy range as we can see it goes super 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.100
 fluid as we can see we already have here 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.320
 we have also left the desks 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.440
 once it is finished installing 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.180
 everything we do not accept and here 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:47.550

 all sides of the galaxy range 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:58.059
 let's check all the 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.789
 functionalities that this 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:05:02.369

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.349
 we can go from here also 

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:08.349
 as we can see it goes super fluid this or 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:11.379
 this is going super fluid we are going to 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:15.479
 phone information and we're going to 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.479

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.289

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:30.490
 baseband version jv t ok as 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.300
 We can see 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.210
 this is going divinely let's go into 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.919
 menu for you to see when this 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.900
 I leave here the first time we always 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.729
 this is going to come out 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.920
 and as you can see the fluency is 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.520
 amazing 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.520

 download not adapted photo is to go in 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.480
 this version because it was not compatible 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.400
 the serious ones do not because they could not be 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.660
 compatible drivers but good the 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.480
 new camera so we have it 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.370
 what I like about the developers 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.470
 of this room is that if something is not going to 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.960
 work do not put it and it is the case of 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.500
