you're<00:00:42.989> saying<00:00:43.140> bass<00:00:43.440> notes<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.860> if<00:00:46.860> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
you're saying bass notes so if you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.860

haven't<00:00:47.370> seen<00:00:47.640> part<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:48.030> yet<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> draw<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
haven't seen part one yet I draw and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.569

encourage<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.559> see<00:00:49.920> part<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.520> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
encourage you to go see part one so you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.779 
encourage you to go see part one so you
can<00:00:50.700> learn<00:00:50.820> these<00:00:51.030> notes<00:00:51.270> first<00:00:52.370> but<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.610> so

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
can learn these notes first but it's so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.130 
can learn these notes first but it's so
simple<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:54.780> even<00:00:54.899> think<00:00:55.079> it

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
simple I don't really even think it

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.430 
simple I don't really even think it
matters<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.449> will<00:00:57.449> just<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> first

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
matters but I will just go to the first

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.040 
matters but I will just go to the first
part<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.420> avoid<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> little<00:01:00.840> cliff

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
