the<00:03:11.700> transitions<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.720> do<00:03:12.950> now<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the transitions I can do now that the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.470 
aggressive I can be and how much grip I
have<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.830> something<00:03:23.730> we<00:03:23.850> focused<00:03:24.180> on<00:03:24.300> what

try<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.510> out<00:04:01.660> today<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.410> a<00:04:02.740> few<00:04:02.920> improvements

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
try it out today with a few improvements

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.470 
try it out today with a few improvements
for<00:04:03.850> this<00:04:04.750> year<00:04:05.050> if<00:04:05.410> slightly<00:04:05.710> more<00:04:06.130> power<00:04:06.480> so

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
for this year if slightly more power so

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.480 
for this year if slightly more power so
all<00:04:08.700> positives<00:04:09.870> well<00:04:10.870> I'm<00:04:11.680> using<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.280> same

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
all positives well I'm using the same

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.290 
all positives well I'm using the same
curve<00:04:12.820> from<00:04:13.060> last<00:04:13.360> year<00:04:13.650> so<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:14.830> year<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:15.550> feel

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
curve from last year so this year I feel

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.070 
curve from last year so this year I feel
more<00:04:16.480> confident<00:04:16.989> going<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:18.250> long<00:04:18.610> beach<00:04:19.080> but

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
more confident going to long beach but

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.100 
more confident going to long beach but
because<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.310> Formula<00:04:21.760> D<00:04:21.910> regulation<00:04:22.840> change

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
because of Formula D regulation change

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.530 
because of Formula D regulation change
we<00:04:23.350> have<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.650> change<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:24.250> lot<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.880> stuff<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.420> the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
we have to change a lot of stuff to the

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.170 
we have to change a lot of stuff to the
car<00:04:26.460> so<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.700> car<00:04:27.730> feels<00:04:28.210> quite<00:04:28.510> different<00:04:29.020> and

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
car so the car feels quite different and

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.970 
car so the car feels quite different and
you<00:04:31.180> know<00:04:31.270> today<00:04:31.450> is<00:04:31.900> my<00:04:31.930> first<00:04:32.350> testing<00:04:32.860> day

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
you know today is my first testing day

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.870 
you know today is my first testing day
and<00:04:33.280> so<00:04:33.940> far<00:04:33.970> it's<00:04:34.240> going<00:04:34.540> pretty<00:04:34.690> good<00:04:35.050> but<00:04:35.880> we

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
and so far it's going pretty good but we

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.450 
and so far it's going pretty good but we
still<00:04:36.910> have<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.390> do<00:04:37.630> some<00:04:38.320> more<00:04:38.440> adjustment<00:04:39.040> to

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
still have to do some more adjustment to

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.960 
still have to do some more adjustment to
make<00:04:39.850> it<00:04:40.090> better<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:41.170> think<00:04:41.980> the<00:04:42.340> overall<00:04:42.610> track

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
make it better I think the overall track

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.580 
make it better I think the overall track
conditions<00:04:43.510> are<00:04:43.660> pretty<00:04:43.870> similar<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.380> what

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
conditions are pretty similar to what

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.220 
conditions are pretty similar to what
we'll<00:04:44.860> be<00:04:44.980> seeing<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.400> Long<00:04:45.610> Beach<00:04:46.200> there's<00:04:47.200> a

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
we'll be seeing in Long Beach there's a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.280 
we'll be seeing in Long Beach there's a
lot<00:04:47.380> of<00:04:47.500> different<00:04:48.060> surface<00:04:49.060> changes<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:50.050> and

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
lot of different surface changes and and

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.410 
lot of different surface changes and and
rough<00:04:50.590> bumps<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.490> you<00:04:51.790> know<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:51.910> lot<00:04:52.120> of<00:04:52.210> stuff

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
rough bumps and you know a lot of stuff

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.200 
rough bumps and you know a lot of stuff
that<00:04:52.450> you<00:04:52.690> gotta<00:04:52.870> tune<00:04:53.110> the<00:04:53.260> chassis<00:04:53.680> for<00:04:53.890> I

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
that you gotta tune the chassis for I

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.000 
that you gotta tune the chassis for I
feel<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.480> is<00:04:55.540> it's<00:04:56.140> a<00:04:56.170> good<00:04:56.350> good

throughout<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:50.020> testing<00:05:50.410> everything<00:05:50.800> seems

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
throughout the testing everything seems

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.100 
throughout the testing everything seems

we<00:05:56.590> got<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.740> pretty<00:05:56.950> solid<00:05:57.160> setup<00:05:57.610> in<00:05:57.790> in<00:05:58.090> the

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
we got a pretty solid setup in in the

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.360 
we got a pretty solid setup in in the
car<00:05:58.510> I<00:05:58.750> think<00:05:59.050> we're<00:05:59.410> getting<00:05:59.980> close<00:06:00.160> to<00:06:00.340> being

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
car I think we're getting close to being

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.830 
car I think we're getting close to being
ready<00:06:00.669> for<00:06:00.820> round<00:06:01.180> one

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
at Long Beach my style so to speak it

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.930 
at Long Beach my style so to speak it
was<00:06:04.810> just<00:06:05.050> not<00:06:05.260> 100%<00:06:05.650> and<00:06:06.340> that's<00:06:06.490> what<00:06:06.639> got<00:06:06.790> me

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
was just not 100% and that's what got me

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.480 
was just not 100% and that's what got me
where<00:06:07.060> I<00:06:07.180> am<00:06:07.330> but<00:06:07.990> now<00:06:08.200> I'm<00:06:08.380> 26<00:06:08.889> it's<00:06:09.160> fine<00:06:09.340> to

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
where I am but now I'm 26 it's fine to

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.000 
where I am but now I'm 26 it's fine to
stuff<00:06:09.760> you<00:06:10.360> know<00:06:10.480> maybe<00:06:11.050> taking<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.770> backseat

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
stuff you know maybe taking a backseat

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.950 
stuff you know maybe taking a backseat
and<00:06:12.340> looking<00:06:12.639> at<00:06:12.760> it<00:06:12.880> and<00:06:13.090> I<00:06:13.570> mean<00:06:13.690> there's<00:06:13.870> no

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
and looking at it and I mean there's no

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.629 
and looking at it and I mean there's no
substitute<00:06:14.440> for<00:06:14.470> experience<00:06:14.650> in<00:06:15.190> one<00:06:15.370> sense

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
substitute for experience in one sense

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.430 
substitute for experience in one sense
and<00:06:15.880> then<00:06:16.000> you<00:06:16.300> don't<00:06:16.780> get<00:06:16.900> experience<00:06:17.350> but

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
and then you don't get experience but

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.270 
and then you don't get experience but
open<00:06:17.650> your<00:06:17.680> own<00:06:17.830> for<00:06:18.070> a<00:06:18.100> while

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
open your own for a while

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.890 
open your own for a while
you<00:06:18.460> can't<00:06:18.669> just<00:06:18.880> be<00:06:19.000> experienced<00:06:19.540> as<00:06:19.690> a<00:06:19.720> young

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
you can't just be experienced as a young

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.620 
you can't just be experienced as a young
guy<00:06:20.110> so<00:06:20.669> you<00:06:21.669> know<00:06:21.760> here<00:06:21.910> we<00:06:22.030> are<00:06:22.060> pretty<00:06:22.480> much

we'll develop the car and it'll get I

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.520 
we'll develop the car and it'll get I
don't<00:06:40.210> see<00:06:40.419> why<00:06:40.540> it<00:06:40.600> can't<00:06:40.900> be<00:06:40.960> just<00:06:41.260> as<00:06:41.410> good

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
don't see why it can't be just as good

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.650 
don't see why it can't be just as good
as<00:06:41.680> it<00:06:41.770> was<00:06:41.889> last<00:06:42.160> year<00:06:42.370> you<00:06:43.150> know<00:06:43.240> common

yeah<00:07:07.660> this<00:07:07.840> is<00:07:08.110> actually<00:07:08.200> been<00:07:08.530> probably<00:07:08.950> the

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
yeah this is actually been probably the

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.830 
yeah this is actually been probably the
most<00:07:09.600> beneficial<00:07:10.600> test<00:07:10.900> we've<00:07:11.770> ever<00:07:12.070> done<00:07:12.400> as

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840 
most beneficial test we've ever done as

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.010 
most beneficial test we've ever done as
a<00:07:13.840> team<00:07:14.110> were<00:07:14.290> forming<00:07:15.419> the<00:07:16.419> the<00:07:16.630> facility

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:17.020 
a team were forming the the facility

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.580 
a team were forming the the facility
became<00:07:17.320> -<00:07:17.530> there's<00:07:18.190> a<00:07:18.280> flat<00:07:18.700> area<00:07:19.470> last<00:07:20.470> year

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
became - there's a flat area last year

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.750 
became - there's a flat area last year
which<00:07:20.740> is<00:07:20.800> that<00:07:20.980> loads<00:07:21.130> must<00:07:21.250> be<00:07:21.370> away<00:07:21.550> a<00:07:21.580> lot

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:21.760 
which is that loads must be away a lot

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.320 
which is that loads must be away a lot
of<00:07:21.790> undulation<00:07:22.180> and<00:07:23.340> that<00:07:24.340> sort<00:07:24.730> of<00:07:24.790> prevented

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
of undulation and that sort of prevented

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.400 
of undulation and that sort of prevented
us<00:07:25.450> from<00:07:25.510> learning<00:07:25.870> some<00:07:25.990> things<00:07:26.200> with<00:07:26.320> the

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410 
us from learning some things with the

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.990 
us from learning some things with the
cars<00:07:26.590> I'm<00:07:26.740> loading<00:07:27.010> and<00:07:27.130> loading<00:07:27.160> a<00:07:27.400> lot<00:07:27.430> and

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
cars I'm loading and loading a lot and

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.460 
cars I'm loading and loading a lot and
the<00:07:28.090> suspension<00:07:28.419> over<00:07:28.720> the<00:07:28.780> undulations<00:07:28.990> on

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
the suspension over the undulations on

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.500 
the suspension over the undulations on
that<00:07:29.590> infield<00:07:29.860> so<00:07:30.669> we<00:07:30.760> came<00:07:30.850> to<00:07:31.000> a<00:07:31.030> brief<00:07:31.270> flat

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:31.510 
that infield so we came to a brief flat

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.280 
that infield so we came to a brief flat
track<00:07:31.889> that<00:07:32.889> allows<00:07:33.100> a<00:07:33.130> lot<00:07:33.310> more<00:07:33.430> consistency

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:34.290 
track that allows a lot more consistency

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.390 
track that allows a lot more consistency
allowances<00:07:35.290> zero<00:07:35.500> and<00:07:35.710> a<00:07:35.770> lot<00:07:35.919> more<00:07:35.950> on<00:07:36.160> what

much fun for the drivers but certainly a

much fun for the drivers but certainly a
great<00:07:40.780> amount<00:07:41.590> of<00:07:41.710> information<00:07:41.919> came<00:07:42.310> out<00:07:42.460> of

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 
great amount of information came out of

it going into into the seasons fish for

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780 
tracks like long beach notoriously not a

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.740 
tracks like long beach notoriously not a
lot<00:07:46.900> of<00:07:46.990> grip<00:07:47.169> and<00:07:47.200> quite<00:07:47.710> flat<00:07:47.919> so<00:07:48.639> it<00:07:49.600> was<00:07:49.690> a

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:49.750 
lot of grip and quite flat so it was a

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:56.879 
lot of grip and quite flat so it was a
very<00:07:50.110> very<00:07:50.290> beneficial<00:07:50.500> test<00:07:50.979> for<00:07:51.130> us<00:07:55.770> when<00:07:56.770> we

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:56.889 
very very beneficial test for us when we

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:59.070 
very very beneficial test for us when we
are<00:07:57.100> when<00:07:57.520> we<00:07:57.639> get<00:07:57.790> going<00:07:57.820> up<00:07:58.240> to<00:07:58.750> go<00:07:58.900> ahead

are when we get going up to go ahead

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.570 
are when we get going up to go ahead
give<00:07:59.229> us<00:07:59.320> about<00:07:59.440> three<00:07:59.740> seconds<00:08:00.190> before<00:08:00.310> you

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:00.580 
give us about three seconds before you

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.240 
give us about three seconds before you
take<00:08:00.790> off<00:08:00.910> okay
