just because of his background in stunts

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.850 
just because of his background in stunts
worlds<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.170> he<00:01:16.290> would<00:01:16.440> try<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.590> capture

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
worlds that he would try to capture

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
worlds that he would try to capture
something<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.210> authentic<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.900> try<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
something you know authentic and try to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.410 
something you know authentic and try to
make<00:01:19.260> it<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.620> a<00:01:19.710> very<00:01:19.920> visceral

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
make it kind of a very visceral

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.450 
make it kind of a very visceral
experience<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.659> think<00:01:21.840> he<00:01:21.930> did<00:01:22.460> so

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
experience which I think he did so

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.190 
experience which I think he did so
knowing<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.820> Scott<00:01:24.780> wall<00:01:24.930> had<00:01:25.049> this

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
knowing that Scott wall had this

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.110 
knowing that Scott wall had this
extensive<00:01:25.860> background<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.430> stunts<00:01:26.729> did<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
extensive background in stunts did that

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.030 
extensive background in stunts did that
frighten<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> did<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.020> inspire<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.920> did

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
frighten you did it inspire you how did

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.609 
frighten you did it inspire you how did
he<00:01:29.070> feel<00:01:29.390> Davis<00:01:30.390> gave<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.229> us<00:01:31.440> I<00:01:31.590> think

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
he feel Davis gave all of us I think

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.910 
he feel Davis gave all of us I think
confidence<00:01:32.430> when<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:32.940> were<00:01:33.060> filming<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:34.260> think

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
confidence when we were filming I think

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.710 
confidence when we were filming I think
it's<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.240> been<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.390> different

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it's I think would have been a different

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.420 
it's I think would have been a different
experience<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.290> he<00:01:37.380> wasn't<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> stuntman<00:01:38.190> he

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
experience if he wasn't a stuntman he

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.920 
experience if he wasn't a stuntman he
was<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:38.880> guy<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.570> directing

out how to make it possible you know
yeah<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.340> big<00:02:15.520> movie<00:02:15.880> too<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.960> he<00:02:17.080> had<00:02:17.200> a

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
yeah it's a big movie too and he had a

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.010 
yeah it's a big movie too and he had a
very<00:02:17.500> specific<00:02:17.650> way<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.130> he<00:02:18.400> wanted<00:02:18.730> to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
very specific way that he wanted to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.660 
very specific way that he wanted to
execute<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.530> he<00:02:20.860> wanted<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.310> be<00:02:21.400> all

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
execute it and he wanted it to be all

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.460 
execute it and he wanted it to be all
live<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.540> I<00:02:22.600> think<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.900> lot<00:02:23.050> of<00:02:23.080> directors

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
live and I think a lot of directors

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.450 
live and I think a lot of directors
might<00:02:23.680> have<00:02:23.770> said<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:23.980> know<00:02:24.040> what<00:02:24.190> let's<00:02:24.400> just

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
might have said you know what let's just

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.190 
might have said you know what let's just
green-screen<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:25.540> green-screen<00:02:25.720> that

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
green-screen this and green-screen that

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.010 
green-screen this and green-screen that
and<00:02:26.850> that<00:02:27.850> wasn't<00:02:28.060> his<00:02:28.240> approach<00:02:28.540> he<00:02:28.750> wanted

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
and that wasn't his approach he wanted

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.150 
and that wasn't his approach he wanted
this<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.290> different<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.800> he<00:02:29.890> knew<00:02:30.040> in

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
this to be different and he knew in

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
this to be different and he knew in
order<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.670> make<00:02:30.820> that<00:02:30.970> happen<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.570> know<00:02:32.080> he

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
order to make that happen you know he

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.600 
order to make that happen you know he
had<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.320> put<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.620> cars<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:33.040> there<00:02:33.070> have<00:02:33.430> these

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.280 
had to put the cars out there have these
stunts<00:02:33.880> actually<00:02:34.330> happen<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.810> he<00:02:34.960> knew<00:02:35.170> how

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
chilling in the air and Scott's just up

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.600 
chilling in the air and Scott's just up
there<00:05:46.360> and<00:05:46.690> like<00:05:46.840> I<00:05:47.080> was<00:05:47.650> half<00:05:47.889> in<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.370> scene

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
there and like I was half in the scene

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.850 
there and like I was half in the scene
half<00:05:49.000> out<00:05:49.300> because<00:05:49.599> I<00:05:49.720> was<00:05:49.870> fearful<00:05:50.530> for<00:05:50.560> him

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
half out because I was fearful for him

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.290 
half out because I was fearful for him
because<00:05:51.130> I've<00:05:51.250> never<00:05:51.550> seen<00:05:51.849> anything<00:05:52.120> like

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
because I've never seen anything like

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.879 
because I've never seen anything like
that<00:05:52.509> I've<00:05:52.840> never<00:05:53.199> seen<00:05:53.500> someone<00:05:53.740> so

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
that I've never seen someone so

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.779 
that I've never seen someone so
dedicated<00:05:54.610> and<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:56.229> yeah<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:56.740> think<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.610> that

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
dedicated and so yeah I think and that

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.909 
dedicated and so yeah I think and that
was<00:05:57.940> like<00:05:58.120> in<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.360> middle<00:05:58.630> of<00:05:58.780> shooting<00:05:59.139> you

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
was like in the middle of shooting you

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.249 
was like in the middle of shooting you
know<00:06:00.330> seeing<00:06:01.330> Scott<00:06:01.659> do<00:06:01.840> that<00:06:02.020> though

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
know seeing Scott do that though

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:04.260 
know seeing Scott do that though
whatever<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:02.919> needed<00:06:03.159> to<00:06:03.250> do<00:06:03.460> after<00:06:03.820> that<00:06:03.849> scene

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
whatever I needed to do after that scene

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.899 
whatever I needed to do after that scene
whether<00:06:04.539> it<00:06:04.659> was<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:05.229> Utah<00:06:05.560> stuff<00:06:05.889> and<00:06:06.190> it

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
whether it was the Utah stuff and it

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:09.029 
whether it was the Utah stuff and it
just<00:06:07.000> really<00:06:07.539> really<00:06:07.930> even<00:06:08.349> boosted<00:06:08.919> the

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 
just really really even boosted the

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:11.820 
just really really even boosted the
confidence<00:06:09.490> even<00:06:09.639> more<00:06:10.169> so<00:06:11.169> it<00:06:11.259> seems<00:06:11.560> like

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
confidence even more so it seems like

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.189
