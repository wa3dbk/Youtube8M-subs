honestly<00:04:36.790> I<00:04:36.910> realized<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.750> after<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.260> end

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
honestly I realized it after the end

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.880 
honestly I realized it after the end
because<00:04:39.070> until<00:04:39.900> 150<00:04:40.900> meters<00:04:41.230> from<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.530> finish

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
because until 150 meters from the finish

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.720 
because until 150 meters from the finish
I<00:04:42.100> thought<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:43.090> would<00:04:43.210> be<00:04:43.600> second<00:04:44.020> then<00:04:44.890> when<00:04:45.700> I

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
I thought I would be second then when I

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.790 
I thought I would be second then when I
saw<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:46.030> mckaela<00:04:46.660> was<00:04:46.900> starting<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.440> let<00:04:47.620> go

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
saw that mckaela was starting to let go

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.310 
saw that mckaela was starting to let go
I<00:04:48.010> thought<00:04:48.400> he<00:04:49.270> can't<00:04:49.510> keep<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:49.990> rhythm

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
I thought he can't keep this rhythm

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.800 
I thought he can't keep this rhythm
until<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.100> end<00:04:51.250> and<00:04:51.400> I<00:04:51.700> said<00:04:51.910> off<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.300> great

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810
