00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.750
 gamescollection.it I am angel face 90 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.610
 and today I'll show you the video boxing 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.590
 of the limited edition of mario kart 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.080
 game for wii u along with bonuses 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.090
 preorder we go immediately to our worth 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 unboxing so this is how it goes well yes 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 send the pack now as all 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.990
 the classic nintendo ai limits 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.380
 now multilingual so it is no longer a 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 dedication let's say blue triangle but it is 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 European standard 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.920
 This pack includes the game is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.410
 simply a case a shell 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 not to accuse a shell that is a weapon 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.860
 let's say mario kart 8 a bonus from 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.539
 to be launched alone opponents here 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 then it is also there are also bonuses 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.829
 created for all three 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.739
 then I take it right away inside Mario 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.859
 kart 8 the game of course I've read 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.129
 even here it is multilingual 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.570
 triangle and the purple one to the less certain 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.420
 the blue stamp 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.729
 the game disc and then there is how to 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.460
 usually practically a ridiculous one 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.750
 sheet type similar instructions manual 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.100
 electronic 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.970
 but the real manual of 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.340
 instructions are no longer football for some time 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 in different Nintendo games 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.380
 then we have here the three bonuses between 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.990
 obvious that there are three little clear that not 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.250
 we have what clearly offered are 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.380
 one if you can see something bomb 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.790
 that which precisely follows i 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.979
 players and a bonus 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.520
 then we have a golden mushroom that that 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.030
 he did very well and then the classic 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.490
 that the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.119
 red shell the shell that what 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:06.009
 chases enemies when we launch it 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:09.399
 finally we have the pasta shell e 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.390
 its black base having grown closer 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.720
 was his body and then we have it here 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.540
 inside of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.130
 here is the shell that exhausts it 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.070
 quite small nature done well 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.140
 on the basis we read mario coat and here 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.310
 there are precisely those points because that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.459
 which is usually the first one 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.989
 player is not made it hurt so 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.360
 from show for this boxing of 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.550
 mario kart 8 is all a greeting of the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.200
 your angel face 90 and that gives you 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.200
