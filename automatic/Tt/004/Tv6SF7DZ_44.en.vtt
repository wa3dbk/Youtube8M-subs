00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.370
 Thank Hello 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:10.820
 It is introduction of line up of cross fight Bidaman April 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:14.980
 Subjected to a force drag bricks over model change 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.980
 It has evolved to Assault Dragen 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:28.240
 It has become the Assault of the name as mechanical design 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:34.980
 Sendai was popular for its easy-to-use and easy-to-use core of its styling 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 This assault dragen has been changed to a normal Japanese nail 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.539
 Instead the trigger is longer 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.980
 The trigger is long in the previous generation of cross fight Bidaman 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:54.160
 Marbles there was a thing called more Oshikomeru break core 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.960
 The structure of its break core new 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 It has taken over to Assault Dragen 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.420
 The corner of the head is movable and eliminates the fall of Sendai 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.480
 We change emblem shield which can be said to be the biggest feature 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.050
 Make a mode change 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.450
 Good Church mode stability can also be expected 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.430
 Site mode 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.320
 It would be unlikely to use 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:34.360
 I claim barrel mode ballistic correction , but the sticker attached to the core is scraped 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:40.150
 It is better not to put a sticker on that part 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:45.300
 Finally the stabilizer mode stability is enhanced, but it will be introduced later 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.300
 You will see in front of the dash stabilizer 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:57.119
 I was addicted to having a round body in the leg parts 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.119
 Head parts are barely attached 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.780
 Let's do a power check 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.780
 At first it is a normal shot without emblem charge 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.740
 I have given quite a lot of firepower with Norman 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.030
 Next is a shot of the emblem charge 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.050
 Only a few rows are powered 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.050
 It is an expectation that it is likely to become the mainstay in the tournament 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:07.660
 Next is the tune-up gear dash stabilizer 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:13.320
 The installation area is also considerable 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.320
 You can also put marbles behind the joint 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.780
 The joints are also flexible and can be changed into various shapes 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.410
 Region 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.700
 You can also reduce the number of joints 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:34.630
 It can be a backpack alone 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:36.730
 It can be attached to the past Cross Fight Bidaman, but I got it right away 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.730
 What did you think 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:45.489
 Stabilizer type movement can be added 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.489
 I hope to see you again
