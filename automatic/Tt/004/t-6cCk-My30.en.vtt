00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
five nights at Freddy's III didn't bring

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.140 
five nights at Freddy's III didn't bring
back<00:03:27.850> all<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.329> toy<00:03:29.049> animatronics<00:03:29.410> so<00:03:30.150> it's

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
back all the toy animatronics so it's

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.099 
back all the toy animatronics so it's
interesting<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:31.600> see<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.780> there's<00:03:32.049> a

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
interesting to see that there's a

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.190 
interesting to see that there's a
phantom<00:03:32.950> mangle<00:03:33.549> in<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.420> game<00:03:34.750> because

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
phantom mangle in that game because

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.140 
phantom mangle in that game because
folks<00:03:35.560> he<00:03:35.709> was<00:03:35.890> there<00:03:36.130> as<00:03:36.220> well<00:03:36.250> why<00:03:36.640> why<00:03:36.940> would

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
folks he was there as well why why would

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.090 
folks he was there as well why why would
he<00:03:37.209> have<00:03:37.390> both<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.930> don't<00:03:38.200> really<00:03:38.470> know<00:03:38.829> there

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
he have both I don't really know there

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.830 
he have both I don't really know there
maybe<00:03:39.280> maybe<00:03:39.819> he<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.120> hinting<00:03:40.660> towards

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
maybe maybe he is hinting towards

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.009 
maybe maybe he is hinting towards
something<00:03:41.290> again<00:03:41.850> mangle<00:03:42.880> likes<00:03:43.389> to<00:03:43.540> hang<00:03:43.810> on

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
something again mangle likes to hang on

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.170 
something again mangle likes to hang on
the<00:03:44.170> roof<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.799> maybe<00:03:45.069> is<00:03:45.430> why<00:03:45.850> we<00:03:46.030> don't

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
the roof and that maybe is why we don't

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.440 
the roof and that maybe is why we don't
see<00:03:46.600> her<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.500> this<00:03:48.040> image<00:03:48.280> in<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.670> upper<00:03:49.000> right

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
see her in this image in the upper right

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.569 
see her in this image in the upper right
and<00:03:49.480> it<00:03:49.720> was<00:03:49.810> really<00:03:50.109> dark<00:03:50.410> but<00:03:50.920> we<00:03:51.160> don't<00:03:51.340> win

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
and it was really dark but we don't win

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:52.860 
and it was really dark but we don't win
even<00:03:51.880> when<00:03:51.970> we<00:03:52.060> highlight<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.450> image<00:03:52.720> we

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
even when we highlight the image we

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.870 
even when we highlight the image we
don't<00:03:53.079> see<00:03:53.410> AC<00:03:53.920> mangle<00:03:54.519> there<00:03:54.670> let's

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
don't see AC mangle there let's

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.300 
don't see AC mangle there let's
highlight<00:03:55.299> it<00:03:55.769> nothing<00:03:56.769> in<00:03:56.889> the<00:03:56.950> background

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
highlight it nothing in the background

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.819 
highlight it nothing in the background
there<00:03:57.519> so<00:03:57.910> perhaps<00:03:58.180> if<00:03:58.630> mangle<00:03:59.350> is<00:03:59.470> hanging

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
there so perhaps if mangle is hanging

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.349 
there so perhaps if mangle is hanging
off<00:03:59.889> the<00:04:00.040> roof<00:04:00.220> maybe<00:04:00.670> that's<00:04:00.940> why<00:04:01.090> we<00:04:01.239> don't

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
off the roof maybe that's why we don't

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.920 
off the roof maybe that's why we don't
see<00:04:01.480> her<00:04:01.720> but<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.230> light<00:04:02.500> has<00:04:02.739> shone<00:04:03.510> in<00:04:04.510> the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
see her but the light has shone in the

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.020 
see her but the light has shone in the
reflection<00:04:05.319> if<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.829> lights<00:04:06.010> high<00:04:06.400> enough<00:04:06.760> it

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
reflection if that lights high enough it

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.449 
reflection if that lights high enough it
might<00:04:07.420> still<00:04:07.690> cast<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.049> reflection<00:04:08.620> which

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
might still cast the reflection which

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.759 
might still cast the reflection which
means<00:04:09.880> it<00:04:10.569> could<00:04:10.840> be<00:04:10.959> mangle<00:04:11.319> hanging<00:04:11.650> from

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
means it could be mangle hanging from

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:12.900 
means it could be mangle hanging from
the<00:04:11.920> roof<00:04:12.010> maybe<00:04:12.250> that's<00:04:12.459> why<00:04:12.549> we<00:04:12.670> don't<00:04:12.790> see

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
the roof maybe that's why we don't see

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.330 
the roof maybe that's why we don't see
anything<00:04:13.269> else<00:04:13.540> in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> image<00:04:14.109> but<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.950> don't

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
anything else in the image but I don't

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.099 
anything else in the image but I don't
know<00:04:15.459> maybe<00:04:15.940> maybe<00:04:16.269> mangle<00:04:16.690> isn't<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.019> the

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
know maybe maybe mangle isn't in the

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.469 
know maybe maybe mangle isn't in the
game<00:04:17.229> maybe<00:04:17.410> mangle<00:04:17.739> is<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.430> would<00:04:18.850> add<00:04:19.030> yet

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
game maybe mangle is it would add yet

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.020 
game maybe mangle is it would add yet
another<00:04:19.830> suspect<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:21.039> the<00:04:21.070> bite<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.400> 87<00:04:21.519> and

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
another suspect to the bite of 87 and

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.310 
another suspect to the bite of 87 and
most<00:04:22.510> people<00:04:22.780> already<00:04:22.930> believe<00:04:23.110> it<00:04:23.409> is<00:04:23.530> mangle

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
most people already believe it is mangle

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.620 
most people already believe it is mangle
so<00:04:24.440> maybe<00:04:25.100> it<00:04:25.220> would<00:04:25.310> be<00:04:25.520> an<00:04:25.580> obvious<00:04:25.790> choice<00:04:26.450> I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
so maybe it would be an obvious choice I

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.840 
so maybe it would be an obvious choice I
still<00:04:26.930> think<00:04:27.080> most<00:04:27.350> likely<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.950> is<00:04:28.160> going<00:04:28.460> to

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
still think most likely it is going to

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.330 
still think most likely it is going to
be<00:04:29.110> purple<00:04:30.110> Freddy<00:04:30.290> shadow<00:04:30.650> Freddy<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:31.190> is

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
be purple Freddy shadow Freddy that is

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.130 
be purple Freddy shadow Freddy that is
this<00:04:31.640> image<00:04:32.030> but<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.390> would<00:04:32.510> be<00:04:32.600> nice<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.840> add

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
this image but it would be nice to add

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.290 
this image but it would be nice to add
this<00:04:33.410> first<00:04:33.680> Scott<00:04:33.920> to<00:04:34.100> just<00:04:34.310> tease<00:04:35.090> is<00:04:35.270> a

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
this first Scott to just tease is a

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.370 
this first Scott to just tease is a
little<00:04:35.630> but<00:04:35.750> we're<00:04:35.870> looking<00:04:36.110> at<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.260> obvious

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
little but we're looking at the obvious

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.840 
little but we're looking at the obvious
here<00:04:36.770> we're<00:04:36.920> looking<00:04:37.010> at<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.280> obvious<00:04:37.460> we're

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
here we're looking at the obvious we're

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.950 
here we're looking at the obvious we're
saying<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.300> purple<00:04:38.600> Freddy<00:04:38.720> this<00:04:38.900> is

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
saying this is purple Freddy this is

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.750 
saying this is purple Freddy this is
shadow<00:04:39.230> Freddy<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.860> Scott<00:04:40.130> adds<00:04:40.280> in<00:04:40.430> something

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
shadow Freddy if Scott adds in something

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.980 
shadow Freddy if Scott adds in something
different<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.120> say<00:04:41.180> actually<00:04:41.750> it<00:04:41.900> was

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
different and say actually it was

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.320 
different and say actually it was
nightmare<00:04:42.230> mangle<00:04:43.160> that<00:04:43.820> would<00:04:44.000> be<00:04:44.090> very

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
nightmare mangle that would be very

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.700 
nightmare mangle that would be very
clever<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:45.020> would<00:04:45.170> be<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.410> we've<00:04:45.530> got<00:04:45.620> to

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
clever that would be so we've got to

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.280 
clever that would be so we've got to
look<00:04:45.800> at<00:04:45.950> every<00:04:46.250> avenue<00:04:46.790> here<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.990> think

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
look at every avenue here and I think

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.990 
look at every avenue here and I think
that's<00:04:48.410> why<00:04:48.560> we<00:04:49.280> love<00:04:49.490> this<00:04:49.610> game<00:04:49.790> so<00:04:49.970> much

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
that's why we love this game so much

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000 
that's why we love this game so much
because<00:04:50.480> of<00:04:50.570> all<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.840> extra<00:04:50.960> teasers<00:04:51.530> he<00:04:51.710> adds

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
because of all the extra teasers he adds

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.410 
because of all the extra teasers he adds
in<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:52.520> we've<00:04:52.670> got<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:52.820> combination<00:04:53.240> of<00:04:53.300> the

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
in so we've got the combination of the

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.820 
in so we've got the combination of the
teeth<00:04:53.630> we've<00:04:54.020> got<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.290> positioning<00:04:54.740> we've

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
teeth we've got the positioning we've

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.770 
teeth we've got the positioning we've
got<00:04:54.920> mangoes<00:04:55.220> jump-scare<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:56.030> we've<00:04:56.480> got

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
got mangoes jump-scare and we've got

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.650 
got mangoes jump-scare and we've got
mangle<00:04:57.140> and<00:04:57.200> finites<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.680> Freddy's<00:04:57.920> 3<00:04:57.950> as<00:04:58.580> a
