00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
here I'm going to ink it with the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
notice I'm bringing the pad to the stamp

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.960

it's<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:57.019> larger<00:02:57.380> stamp<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.579> is<00:02:58.700> going<00:02:58.850> to

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
it's a larger stamp so this is going to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.330 
it's a larger stamp so this is going to
be<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.180> best<00:02:59.390> way<00:02:59.600> to<00:02:59.660> ink<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.079> i'm<00:03:00.380> also<00:03:00.980> not

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
be the best way to ink it i'm also not

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.759 
be the best way to ink it i'm also not
pressing<00:03:01.850> very<00:03:02.060> hard<00:03:02.390> because<00:03:03.049> it's<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.560> nice

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
pressing very hard because it's a nice

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.940 
pressing very hard because it's a nice
and<00:03:04.540> highly<00:03:05.540> inked<00:03:05.900> pad<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.560> i<00:03:06.620> could<00:03:06.799> really

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
and highly inked pad and i could really

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.400 
and highly inked pad and i could really
make<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.220> mess<00:03:07.459> out<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.670> things<00:03:07.790> if<00:03:08.209> I<00:03:08.780> over<00:03:09.140> ink

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
make a mess out of things if I over ink

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.400 
make a mess out of things if I over ink
if<00:03:09.890> I<00:03:10.040> have<00:03:10.190> stray<00:03:10.610> marks<00:03:10.940> along<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.480> cut<00:03:12.200> edge

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
if I have stray marks along the cut edge

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.370 
if I have stray marks along the cut edge
of<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.650> rubber<00:03:12.829> and<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.250> on<00:03:13.400> now<00:03:14.329> I'll<00:03:15.140> take

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
of the rubber and so on now I'll take

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.180

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
basically into the positioning guide so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.470 
basically into the positioning guide so
that<00:03:21.560> I'm<00:03:21.829> lining<00:03:22.100> up<00:03:22.340> both<00:03:22.910> at<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.120> bottom

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
still showing through from the base

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.040 
still showing through from the base
which<00:07:40.389> is<00:07:40.719> okay<00:07:41.169> with<00:07:41.319> me<00:07:41.379> and<00:07:42.270> then<00:07:43.270> we<00:07:43.900> went

let it dry just a real small amount of
course<00:07:48.370> it<00:07:48.520> was<00:07:48.639> K<00:07:48.819> Z<00:07:48.879> idea<00:07:49.270> to<00:07:49.419> go<00:07:49.569> ahead<00:07:49.599> and

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:49.870 
course it was K Z idea to go ahead and

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.059 
course it was K Z idea to go ahead and
add<00:07:49.990> that<00:07:50.229> math<00:07:50.439> out<00:07:50.650> it<00:07:50.740> was<00:07:50.860> pretty

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:51.069 
add that math out it was pretty

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:54.390 
add that math out it was pretty
brilliant<00:07:51.460> he<00:07:51.909> asked<00:07:52.180> me<00:07:52.379> just<00:07:53.379> a<00:07:53.680> tiny<00:07:54.009> amount

of glitter glue well if you have a
position<00:07:58.360> at<00:07:58.800> get<00:07:59.800> it<00:07:59.889> out<00:08:00.009> and<00:08:00.159> give<00:08:00.280> it<00:08:00.340> a<00:08:00.430> try

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:00.699 
position at get it out and give it a try

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.300 
position at get it out and give it a try
