00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.800 
there often is in disney movies but this
guy<00:01:59.690> is<00:01:59.720> more<00:02:00.290> of<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.470> bumbling<00:02:00.920> sorcerer<00:02:01.810> you

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
guy is more of a bumbling sorcerer you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.340 
guy is more of a bumbling sorcerer you
know<00:02:02.930> less<00:02:03.320> evil<00:02:03.830> and<00:02:04.070> more<00:02:04.310> just<00:02:04.729> kind<00:02:05.120> of

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
know less evil and more just kind of

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.680 
know less evil and more just kind of
comic<00:02:06.350> relief<00:02:06.490> so<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.880> don't<00:02:08.239> think<00:02:08.420> either<00:02:08.539> of

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
comic relief so I don't think either of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.059 
comic relief so I don't think either of
my<00:02:08.780> daughters<00:02:09.170> found<00:02:09.440> him<00:02:09.649> particularly

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
my daughters found him particularly

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.430 
my daughters found him particularly
scary

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
scary

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.070 
scary
I<00:02:11.860> think<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.060> movie<00:02:13.330> taught<00:02:13.540> some<00:02:13.810> great

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
I think that the movie taught some great

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.260 
I think that the movie taught some great
morality<00:02:14.830> lessons<00:02:15.280> and<00:02:15.610> without<00:02:15.820> giving<00:02:16.150> away

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
morality lessons and without giving away

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.760 
morality lessons and without giving away
too<00:02:16.360> much<00:02:16.570> of<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.900> plot<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.470> know<00:02:17.590> I<00:02:17.620> think

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
too much of the plot you know I think

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.300 
too much of the plot you know I think
that<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:19.300> think<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.320> teaching<00:02:20.590> very<00:02:20.980> good

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
that I think it's teaching very good

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.310 
that I think it's teaching very good
age-appropriate<00:02:21.850> lessons<00:02:22.630> for<00:02:22.960> little<00:02:23.170> girls

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
age-appropriate lessons for little girls

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.730 
age-appropriate lessons for little girls
so<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.160> would<00:02:24.370> hardly<00:02:24.580> heartily<00:02:25.210> recommend

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
so I would hardly heartily recommend

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.010 
so I would hardly heartily recommend
Sofia<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.890> first<00:02:26.920> four<00:02:27.730> girls<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.360> any<00:02:28.600> ages

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
Sofia the first four girls of any ages

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.720 
Sofia the first four girls of any ages
and<00:02:29.230> i<00:02:29.290> also<00:02:29.470> think<00:02:29.800> while<00:02:30.070> it's<00:02:30.250> probably

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
and i also think while it's probably

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.210 
and i also think while it's probably
being<00:02:30.970> marketed<00:02:31.360> more<00:02:31.630> soda<00:02:31.870> girls<00:02:32.200> boys<00:02:32.920> will

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
being marketed more soda girls boys will

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.150 
being marketed more soda girls boys will
really<00:02:33.490> enjoy<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.910> movie<00:02:34.120> as<00:02:34.360> well<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.800> i

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
really enjoy this movie as well and i

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.130 
really enjoy this movie as well and i
think<00:02:36.490> that<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:37.270> know<00:02:37.390> most<00:02:37.660> parents

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
think that you know most parents

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.810 
think that you know most parents
shouldn't<00:02:38.500> have<00:02:38.620> any<00:02:38.860> concerns<00:02:39.340> about<00:02:39.550> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
shouldn't have any concerns about the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.350 
shouldn't have any concerns about the
content<00:02:40.390> of<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:41.410> movie<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> will<00:02:43.240> leave
