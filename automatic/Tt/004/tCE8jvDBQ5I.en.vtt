amazon.com I don't believe it's at that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.160 
amazon.com I don't believe it's at that
price<00:00:31.769> anymore<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> 8350<00:00:33.660> fit<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
price anymore but the 8350 fit in the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.840 
price anymore but the 8350 fit in the
budget<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> said<00:00:35.040> hey<00:00:35.190> why<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.610> you're

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
budget so I said hey why not you're

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.119 
budget so I said hey why not you're
getting<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> 4<00:00:36.360> gigahertz<00:00:36.660> processor<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.680> it's

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
getting a 4 gigahertz processor and it's

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.680 
getting a 4 gigahertz processor and it's
a<00:00:38.250> very<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.640> processor<00:00:39.270> for<00:00:39.450> things<00:00:39.629> like

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a very good processor for things like

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.479 
a very good processor for things like

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
guys do pick up a decent cpu cooler with

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.440 
guys do pick up a decent cpu cooler with
this<00:00:46.320> something<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> hyper<00:00:47.250> 212<00:00:47.520> would

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
this something like the hyper 212 would

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.350 
this something like the hyper 212 would
be<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.840> sufficient<00:00:49.289> not<00:00:49.890> necessary<00:00:50.399> set<00:00:51.030> not

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
be very sufficient not necessary set not

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.380 
be very sufficient not necessary set not
necessarily<00:00:51.960> okay<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.920> speak<00:00:53.390> not

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
necessarily okay if I can speak not

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
necessarily okay if I can speak not
necessarily<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.260> overclocking<00:00:55.800> purposes

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
necessarily for overclocking purposes

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
necessarily for overclocking purposes
but<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.449> keeping<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> CPU<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.410> know

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
but just for keeping the CPU you know

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.770 
but just for keeping the CPU you know
indecent<00:00:59.250> temperatures<00:01:00.030> because<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.690> know

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
indecent temperatures because you know

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.869 
indecent temperatures because you know
it<00:01:00.930> isn't<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> core<00:01:01.440> cpu<00:01:01.829> its<00:01:02.010> 4<00:01:02.219> gigahertz<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
it isn't a core cpu its 4 gigahertz and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.630 
it isn't a core cpu its 4 gigahertz and
ah<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.960> 125<00:01:04.619> watts<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.100> AMD<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:05.610> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
ah it is 125 watts and AMD has a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.750 
ah it is 125 watts and AMD has a
tendency<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.210> pack<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.229> pretty<00:01:07.500> shitty<00:01:07.860> uh<00:01:08.130> you

tendency to pack in pretty shitty uh you
know<00:01:08.850> stock<00:01:09.150> cpu<00:01:09.420> cooler<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.140> i<00:01:10.170> highly

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
cheap but just on the cpu alone it's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850 
cheap but just on the cpu alone it's
still<00:01:18.630> very<00:01:18.810> good<00:01:19.020> cpu<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:19.710> hundred

battlefield 4 and yeah highly recommend
the<00:01:28.650> CP<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.100> about<00:01:29.250> two<00:01:29.400> hundred<00:01:29.460> dollars

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
the CP for about two hundred dollars

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
the CP for about two hundred dollars
like<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.390> said<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> 8320<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.590> also<00:01:31.890> an<00:01:31.979> option

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
like I said the 8320 is also an option

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.219 
like I said the 8320 is also an option
which<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.490> about<00:01:32.790> forty<00:01:33.299> dollars<00:01:33.570> cheaper<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
which is about forty dollars cheaper and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.039 
which is about forty dollars cheaper and
it<00:01:34.320> comes<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.740> stock<00:01:35.369> clocked<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.049> believe

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
it comes a stock clocked at I believe
