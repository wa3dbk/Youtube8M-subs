a<00:00:49.890> tiny<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.280> X<00:00:50.520> there<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> also

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
a tiny little X there and then I also

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
a tiny little X there and then I also
draw<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.930> line

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
draw a line

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.369 
draw a line
this<00:00:55.770> pen<00:00:56.039> doesn't<00:00:56.070> work<00:00:56.780> between<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.020> first

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
this pen doesn't work between the first

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.680 
this pen doesn't work between the first
and<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> second<00:00:59.100> crease<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:02.160> between<00:01:02.690> these

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and the second crease so between these

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.070 
and the second crease so between these
two<00:01:03.750> middle<00:01:04.080> fingers<00:01:05.510> halfway<00:01:06.510> between<00:01:06.720> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
two middle fingers halfway between that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.320 
two middle fingers halfway between that
crease<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.770> crease<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.640> draw<00:01:09.299> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
crease and that crease so I draw a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.990 
crease and that crease so I draw a
little<00:01:09.510> horizontal<00:01:10.380> line<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:13.049> there

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
little horizontal line there and there

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.620 
little horizontal line there and there
that<00:01:15.000> didn't<00:01:15.270> come<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:17.270> just<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.509> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that didn't come out so just there and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.320 
that didn't come out so just there and
there<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:20.780> then<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.869> tell<00:01:22.110> them<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.409> touch<00:01:22.650> a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
there and then I tell them to touch a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.090 
there and then I tell them to touch a
pencil<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> those<00:01:24.659> lines<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:25.770> touch

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
pencil to those lines and then touch

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.980 
pencil to those lines and then touch
their<00:01:26.340> mark<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> other<00:01:27.600> side<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
their mark to the other side of the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.590 
their mark to the other side of the
pencil<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.869> little<00:01:31.110> curly<00:01:31.380> ears<00:01:31.619> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
pencil and have little curly ears and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.499 
pencil and have little curly ears and
then<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:34.159> point<00:01:35.159> out<00:01:35.280> these<00:01:35.520> creases<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.119> and

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
then I point out these creases here and

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.890 
then I point out these creases here and
tell<00:01:36.659> them<00:01:36.810> those<00:01:36.990> creases<00:01:37.729> should<00:01:38.729> touch<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
tell them those creases should touch the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.850 
tell them those creases should touch the
pencil<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.439> well<00:01:41.720> so<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> pretty<00:01:43.619> good

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
pencil as well so it's a pretty good

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.340 
pencil as well so it's a pretty good
easy<00:01:44.130> bow<00:01:44.369> hold

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
easy bow hold

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.050 
easy bow hold
and<00:01:46.620> then<00:01:47.479> have<00:01:48.479> them<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> same<00:01:48.930> thing

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
and then have them do the same thing

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.170 
and then have them do the same thing
over<00:01:51.060> here

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.260 

and<00:01:56.600> then<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.140> go<00:01:57.500> through<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:58.000> four<00:01:59.000> or<00:01:59.090> five

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.870 
find staples they're really squidgy and
some<00:02:24.590> are<00:02:24.680> better<00:02:24.800> than<00:02:24.950> others<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.370> kind<00:02:25.700> is

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
sort of the diagonal stripe but this one

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.270 
sort of the diagonal stripe but this one
and<00:02:29.870> they're<00:02:29.990> all<00:02:30.080> mixed<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.560> same<00:02:30.770> packet

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
and they're all mixed in the same packet

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.790 
and they're all mixed in the same packet
this<00:02:31.550> one<00:02:31.730> has<00:02:32.080> circles<00:02:33.080> going<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.470> way<00:02:33.620> I

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
this one has circles going that way I

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.280 
this one has circles going that way I
cut<00:02:34.220> these<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.610> half<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.840> they're<00:02:36.020> really

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
cut these in half and they're really

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.470 
cut these in half and they're really
easy<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.560> put<00:02:36.650> on<00:02:36.830> bows<00:02:37.130> everything<00:02:37.730> they<00:02:37.970> go

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
easy to put on bows everything they go

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.230 
easy to put on bows everything they go
on<00:02:38.630> really<00:02:38.959> fast<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.740> that's<00:02:40.640> an<00:02:40.820> advantage

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
on really fast so that's an advantage

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.160 
on really fast so that's an advantage
too<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:43.030> so<00:02:44.030> once<00:02:44.450> they<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.810> little

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
too and so once they have that little

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.980 
too and so once they have that little
for<00:02:45.620> about<00:02:45.770> a<00:02:46.090> centimeter<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> tiny<00:02:47.420> bit<00:02:47.660> about

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
for about a centimeter a tiny bit about

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.640 
for about a centimeter a tiny bit about
a<00:02:48.050> centimeter<00:02:48.530> a<00:02:48.620> bit<00:02:48.770> of<00:02:48.890> grip<00:02:49.100> there<00:02:50.650> they

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
a centimeter a bit of grip there they

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.350 
a centimeter a bit of grip there they
touch<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.190> if<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.490> mark<00:02:52.760> step<00:02:53.030> one<00:02:53.240> would

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
touch there if that mark step one would

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.290 
touch there if that mark step one would
be<00:02:53.510> touching<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.140> mark<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> grip<00:02:55.300> maybe

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
be touching the mark to the grip maybe

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.780 
be touching the mark to the grip maybe
they<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> bow<00:02:56.810> with<00:02:56.959> one<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.170> these<00:02:57.230> on

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.260 

yeah

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.820 

so<00:03:06.880> they're<00:03:07.880> going<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.270> touch<00:03:08.530> right<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.710> the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
so they're going to touch right in the

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.120 
so they're going to touch right in the
center<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.280> that<00:03:10.550> you<00:03:11.120> can<00:03:11.270> even<00:03:11.890> draw<00:03:12.890> on

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
center of that you can even draw on

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.730 
center of that you can even draw on
there<00:03:13.490> well<00:03:13.940> it's<00:03:14.120> not<00:03:14.330> that<00:03:14.570> easy<00:03:14.720> but<00:03:14.930> well

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
there well it's not that easy but well

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.410 
there well it's not that easy but well
you<00:03:15.830> could<00:03:16.010> even<00:03:16.190> cut<00:03:16.610> up<00:03:16.730> tiny<00:03:16.910> little<00:03:17.180> hole

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
you could even cut up tiny little hole

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.170 
you could even cut up tiny little hole
in<00:03:17.570> there<00:03:17.690> too<00:03:18.580> sometimes<00:03:19.580> I<00:03:19.700> do<00:03:19.760> that

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
in there too sometimes I do that

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.960 
in there too sometimes I do that
so<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.960> touch<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:22.040> mark<00:03:22.400> on<00:03:22.550> your<00:03:22.700> thumb

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
so you touch that mark on your thumb

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.570 
so you touch that mark on your thumb
right<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.420> there<00:03:23.600> that's<00:03:23.810> step<00:03:24.020> one<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:25.430> I<00:03:25.520> do

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
right to there that's step one and I do

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.700 
right to there that's step one and I do
this<00:03:25.850> holding<00:03:26.270> my<00:03:26.540> bow<00:03:26.720> backwards<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.500> they

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
this holding my bow backwards so they

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.090 
this holding my bow backwards so they
they<00:03:28.100> don't<00:03:28.220> have<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.660> reverse<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.870> step<00:03:30.770> one

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
they don't have to reverse it step one

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.970 
they don't have to reverse it step one
step<00:03:31.970> two<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.330> tell<00:03:32.660> them<00:03:32.720> to<00:03:32.870> put<00:03:33.080> their<00:03:33.320> two

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
step two I tell them to put their two

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.710 
step two I tell them to put their two
middle<00:03:34.250> fingers<00:03:34.280> right<00:03:35.000> sitting<00:03:35.540> on<00:03:35.630> top<00:03:36.190> nuts

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
middle fingers right sitting on top nuts

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.870 
middle fingers right sitting on top nuts
not<00:03:38.720> together<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.350> little<00:03:39.590> separation<00:03:40.160> but

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
not together a little separation but

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.310 
not together a little separation but
step<00:03:41.240> two<00:03:41.450> they're<00:03:41.660> on<00:03:41.780> top

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
step two they're on top

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.410 
step two they're on top
step<00:03:43.010> three<00:03:43.430> they<00:03:44.420> slide<00:03:44.840> down<00:03:46.420> fingertips

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
step three they slide down fingertips

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.130 
step three they slide down fingertips
touch<00:03:48.350> the<00:03:48.650> hair<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.370> then<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.640> metal<00:03:50.140> and

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
touch the hair and then the metal and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.820 
touch the hair and then the metal and
then<00:03:51.770> step<00:03:52.130> for<00:03:52.720> those<00:03:53.720> crease<00:03:54.140> those<00:03:54.380> outside

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
then step for those crease those outside

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.060 
then step for those crease those outside
creases<00:03:55.660> need<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.780> touch<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.650> wood<00:03:57.830> of<00:03:57.980> the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
creases need to touch the wood of the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.480 
creases need to touch the wood of the
stick<00:03:58.400> just<00:03:58.430> like<00:03:58.820> they<00:03:59.000> did<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.300> pencil

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
stick just like they did the pencil

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.430 
stick just like they did the pencil
sometimes<00:04:01.490> I<00:04:01.610> do<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.760> step<00:04:02.090> five<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.990> pronate<00:04:03.320> a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
sometimes I do a step five to pronate a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.550 
sometimes I do a step five to pronate a
little<00:04:03.740> bit<00:04:05.710> and<00:04:06.710> then<00:04:06.980> we<00:04:07.100> go<00:04:07.220> vertical<00:04:07.730> and

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
little bit and then we go vertical and

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.650 
little bit and then we go vertical and
then<00:04:09.560> we<00:04:09.740> do<00:04:09.920> finger<00:04:10.610> taps<00:04:10.880> I'll<00:04:11.270> do<00:04:11.390> this<00:04:11.480> with

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
then we do finger taps I'll do this with

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.450 
then we do finger taps I'll do this with
my<00:04:11.840> right<00:04:12.050> hand<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:14.330> you<00:04:14.390> tap<00:04:14.660> one<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:16.010> as<00:04:16.430> you

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
my right hand so you tap one and as you

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.760 
my right hand so you tap one and as you
tap<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.180> feel<00:04:17.510> that<00:04:17.750> same<00:04:18.049> place<00:04:18.380> where<00:04:18.650> it

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
tap you feel that same place where it

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:25.060 
tap you feel that same place where it
touches<00:04:19.010> each<00:04:19.460> time<00:04:21.880> do<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:22.910> few<00:04:23.060> taps<00:04:23.620> and<00:04:24.620> then

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
touches each time do a few taps and then

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.900 
touches each time do a few taps and then
we<00:04:25.340> tap<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.180> inside<00:04:26.600> fingers<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:28.580> if<00:04:28.730> they're

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
we tap the inside fingers not if they're

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.700 
we tap the inside fingers not if they're
really<00:04:29.150> good<00:04:29.300> they<00:04:29.540> can<00:04:29.840> try<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.110> tap<00:04:30.500> the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
really good they can try to tap the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.180 
really good they can try to tap the
outside<00:04:31.100> fingers

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.970 

so<00:04:36.280> that's<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.400> good<00:04:37.550> Bohol
