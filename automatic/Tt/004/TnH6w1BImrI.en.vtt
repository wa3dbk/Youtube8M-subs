00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.089
 hello and welcome to toy servers player should be especially fun 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.089
 but it is also really important for the development of one 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.989
 child 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.749
 therefore today a piece about role play can pretend in the 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:17.689
 kitchen 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.169
 for most families, the kitchen is an important place in the house and therefore 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.820
 also an important place for inspiration for the kids playing with one 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.999
 kitchen m pretending that you are a comment on the first steps in this 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.650
 direction 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.650
 X 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.469
 genk work 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.900
 cooking clerks change the law 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.000
 are things they see and that they play after and of course making coffee and 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 adding cozy chat to it 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.830
 kitchens from various price ranges are not available for various play kitchens 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.230
 most are plastic or wood 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.600
 it is often thought that a wooden kitchen is better than art or 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 However, whether or not that is always the case because a wooden kitchen is also one of them 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 poor quality can be made 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.720
 that means that depends on the brand and the product and not standard 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.720
 keep or plastic 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.170
 a complete player kitchen I provide plus all this need 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.400
 for example, this kitchen has a nice extra hob 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.120
 and the toaster 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.310
 in addition, the kitchen can always be expanded and made even more fun with 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.290
 various items such as a breakfast set and serbia set and wooden cutting board or 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.080
 some extra groceries 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.030
 if you don't have space or budgets for such a large kitchen there 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.810
 these accessories are sufficient for a great experience 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.380
 there is, of course, much more to say about kitchens there and another 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 more time for this time thanks for looking forward to next time
