00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.090 

all<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:52.510> we<00:01:52.630> know<00:01:52.900> about<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.710> people<00:01:54.010> who

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
all that we know about the people who

all that we know about the people who
build<00:01:54.310> these<00:01:54.400> monuments<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:55.120> what<00:01:55.450> we<00:01:55.630> can

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
build these monuments is what we can

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.750 
build these monuments is what we can
deduce<00:01:56.140> from<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.590> monuments<00:01:57.070> themselves<00:01:57.640> and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
deduce from the monuments themselves and

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.910 
deduce from the monuments themselves and
if<00:01:57.820> we<00:01:58.030> look<00:01:58.270> at<00:01:58.390> these<00:01:58.600> monuments<00:01:59.110> with<00:01:59.409> open

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
if we look at these monuments with open

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.460 
if we look at these monuments with open
minds<00:02:00.250> and<00:02:00.550> open<00:02:00.610> eyes<00:02:00.940> we<00:02:01.690> find<00:02:01.990> something

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
minds and open eyes we find something

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.219 
minds and open eyes we find something
very<00:02:02.650> interesting<00:02:03.300> firstly<00:02:04.300> that<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.869> level

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
very interesting firstly that the level

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.290 
very interesting firstly that the level
of<00:02:05.320> technology<00:02:05.770> involved<00:02:06.550> in<00:02:06.670> creating<00:02:07.150> them

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
of technology involved in creating them

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.630 
of technology involved in creating them
was<00:02:07.479> high<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:08.289> lifting<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:08.830> maneuvering<00:02:09.490> of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
was high the lifting and maneuvering of

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.940 
was high the lifting and maneuvering of
these<00:02:09.759> huge<00:02:10.240> blocks<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.840> stone<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.500> secondly

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
these huge blocks of stone and secondly

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.250 
these huge blocks of stone and secondly
that<00:02:12.490> they<00:02:12.640> incorporated<00:02:13.270> fantastically

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
that they incorporated fantastically

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.320 
that they incorporated fantastically
accurate<00:02:14.770> astronomical<00:02:15.209> alignments<00:02:16.209> which

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
accurate astronomical alignments which

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.000 
accurate astronomical alignments which
could<00:02:16.510> only<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:17.050> been<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.350> result<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.890> a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
could only have been the result of a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.960 
could only have been the result of a
very<00:02:18.550> accurate<00:02:19.110> observational<00:02:20.110> science<00:02:20.970> so

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
very accurate observational science so

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.729 
very accurate observational science so
this<00:02:22.150> is<00:02:22.300> what<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.720> monuments<00:02:23.200> tell<00:02:23.410> us<00:02:23.560> they

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
this is what the monuments tell us they

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.890 
this is what the monuments tell us they
tell<00:02:24.010> us<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.489> people<00:02:24.880> who<00:02:25.330> built<00:02:25.600> them

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
tell us that the people who built them

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.770 
tell us that the people who built them
were<00:02:26.200> serious<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.040> intelligent<00:02:27.790> people<00:02:28.000> with

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
were serious and intelligent people with

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.500 
were serious and intelligent people with
a<00:02:28.810> scientific<00:02:29.650> outlook<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.250> life<00:02:30.459> and<00:02:30.760> that's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
a scientific outlook on life and that's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.780 
a scientific outlook on life and that's
the<00:02:31.989> testimony<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.950> monuments<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:33.640> no

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the testimony of the monuments and no

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.430 
the testimony of the monuments and no
matter<00:02:33.970> what<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.510> historians<00:02:35.110> or<00:02:35.350> the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
matter what the historians or the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.460 
matter what the historians or the
archaeologists<00:02:36.070> say<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.850> monuments

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
archaeologists say the monuments

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.000 
archaeologists say the monuments
continue<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:39.100> tell<00:02:39.340> us<00:02:39.489> that<00:02:39.730> story
