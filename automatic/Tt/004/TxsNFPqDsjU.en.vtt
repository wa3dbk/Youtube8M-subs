1 Month with the Apple Watch!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.240
Hey what's up guys Keaton here so I've been
using the Apple Watch for the last past month

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.470
and there are some things that I really like
about it and then there are some things that

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.340
I don't so lets go ahead and get started.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.809
So the Watch that I've been using is the Apple
Watch Sport.

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.049
This is the 42mm one with the lime green band.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.270
The first thing that I noticed when I put
the Apple Watch on was just how nice it felt

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.380
on my wrist and I have a little bit of a comparison
there's really only two watches that work

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.820
with the iPhone.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.230
One's the Pebble with a black and white display
that is very square-like and it's kinda obtrusive

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.230
in my opinion and then there's the Apple Watch
which kinda feels nice and comfortable on

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.850
your wrist because of the curved sensor at
the bottom.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:01:28.070
I tried 
on 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:57.720
the Gold 
Apple Watch Edition and Apple Watch 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:11.569
Sport 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:41.170
and 
also 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:03:10.549
Water 
Test 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:23.999
and 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:04:37.060
Drop 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:05:43.030
Test 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:07:01.289
