00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
because it was so vivid and I realized

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.450 
because it was so vivid and I realized

elements of a good story and on

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.920 
elements of a good story and on
tonight's<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.060> night<00:01:48.270> I'm<00:01:48.450> finally

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
tonight's the night I'm finally

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.050 
tonight's the night I'm finally
listening<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> audio<00:01:50.100> recordings<00:01:50.820> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
listening to the audio recordings and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.069 
listening to the audio recordings and
I'm<00:01:51.390> beginning<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> put<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> out<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.950> paper

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
I'm beginning to put it out on paper

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.149 
I'm beginning to put it out on paper
because<00:01:55.079> I'm<00:01:55.619> not<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> typer<00:01:56.579> I'm<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.420> writer

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
because I'm not a typer I'm a writer

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.859 
because I'm not a typer I'm a writer
there<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> semantical<00:02:00.270> difference<00:02:00.689> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
there is a semantical difference I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.030 
there is a semantical difference I
suppose<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:03.750> really<00:02:03.990> rather<00:02:04.680> nice

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
suppose but so that's really rather nice

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.770 
suppose but so that's really rather nice
and<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.549> listening<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> wind<00:02:06.479> blow<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
and I'm listening to the wind blow and

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.610 
and I'm listening to the wind blow and
the<00:02:09.289> rain<00:02:09.619> pitter-patter<00:02:10.369> on<00:02:11.090> our<00:02:12.190> steel<00:02:13.190> roof

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
the rain pitter-patter on our steel roof

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.100 
the rain pitter-patter on our steel roof
I'm<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.860> pretty<00:02:16.580> stoked<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.569> be<00:02:17.600> down<00:02:18.080> here

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
I'm just pretty stoked to be down here

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.550 
I'm just pretty stoked to be down here
and<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:20.000> nice<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.270> everything's<00:02:21.050> shut<00:02:21.319> off

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
and it's nice that everything's shut off

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.330 
and it's nice that everything's shut off
because<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.100> gives<00:02:22.220> me<00:02:22.459> time<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:24.340> contemplate

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
because it gives me time to contemplate

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.400 
because it gives me time to contemplate
stuff<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.000> that's<00:02:26.150> what<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.600> phase<00:02:27.020> of<00:02:27.050> the

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
stuff and that's what this phase of the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.380 
stuff and that's what this phase of the
journey<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.800> about<00:02:27.920> is<00:02:28.280> contemplating<00:02:29.209> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
journey is about is contemplating the
