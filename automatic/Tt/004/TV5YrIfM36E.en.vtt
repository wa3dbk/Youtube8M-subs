like Paul George you kind of saw flashes
that<00:02:08.929> he<00:02:09.050> was<00:02:09.170> going<00:02:09.290> to<00:02:09.350> be<00:02:09.470> good<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.979> this<00:02:10.580> is

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
that he was going to be good and this is

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.000 
that he was going to be good and this is
going<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:10.940> come<00:02:11.150> regardless<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:12.620> those

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
going to come regardless that those

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.980 
going to come regardless that those
numbers<00:02:13.370> were<00:02:13.490> going<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.820> improve<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.420> when

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
numbers were going to improve so when

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.420
