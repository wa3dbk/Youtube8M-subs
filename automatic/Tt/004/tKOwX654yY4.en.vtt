00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.180 
favourite games but it's like I don't
care<00:03:50.329> for<00:03:50.480> 1v1<00:03:50.780> so<00:03:51.109> when<00:03:51.230> there's<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.410> 1v1<00:03:51.709> I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
care for 1v1 so when there's a 1v1 I

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.970 
care for 1v1 so when there's a 1v1 I
guess<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.090> people<00:03:53.450> especially<00:03:53.810> DPS<00:03:54.560> most<00:03:54.859> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
guess to people especially DPS most the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.099 
guess to people especially DPS most the
time<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.340> know<00:03:55.430> DPS<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.389> really<00:03:56.900> whoever

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
time you know DPS is really whoever

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.780 
time you know DPS is really whoever
catches<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.920> first<00:03:58.099> black<00:03:58.340> break<00:03:58.579> like

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
catches the first black break like

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.729 
catches the first black break like
whoever<00:03:59.690> gets<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.930> first<00:04:00.079> block<00:04:00.319> break<00:04:00.530> you

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
whoever gets the first block break you

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.080 
whoever gets the first block break you
basically<00:04:01.069> lose<00:04:01.340> cuz<00:04:01.639> the<00:04:01.730> person<00:04:02.000> already

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
basically lose cuz the person already

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.660 
basically lose cuz the person already
gonna<00:04:02.269> be<00:04:02.329> like<00:04:02.540> about<00:04:03.139> half<00:04:03.380> health<00:04:03.680> at<00:04:04.430> the

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
gonna be like about half health at the

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.020 
gonna be like about half health at the
average<00:04:05.120> DPS<00:04:05.569> hit<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.609> unless<00:04:07.609> they<00:04:07.790> black

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
average DPS hit and unless they black

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.699 
average DPS hit and unless they black
and<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.269> fall<00:04:08.540> then<00:04:08.780> that's<00:04:09.049> already<00:04:09.319> half

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
and you fall then that's already half

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.949 
and you fall then that's already half
off<00:04:09.889> again<00:04:10.299> so<00:04:11.299> that<00:04:11.510> this<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.840> only

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
off again so that this is the only

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.110 
off again so that this is the only
reason<00:04:12.139> I<00:04:12.230> don't<00:04:12.290> take<00:04:12.500> it<00:04:12.620> serious<00:04:12.950> like<00:04:13.160> it's

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
reason I don't take it serious like it's

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.469 
reason I don't take it serious like it's
really<00:04:14.359> based<00:04:14.569> off<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.989> r-1<00:04:15.319> button<00:04:16.329> but<00:04:17.329> then

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
really based off the r-1 button but then

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.569 
really based off the r-1 button but then
again<00:04:17.599> you<00:04:18.590> know<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.739> like<00:04:19.159> I<00:04:19.250> said<00:04:19.459> I<00:04:19.489> don't

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
again you know I like I said I don't

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.060 
again you know I like I said I don't
care<00:04:19.729> about<00:04:19.880> 1b<00:04:20.209> ones<00:04:20.359> I<00:04:20.479> lose<00:04:20.690> good<00:04:21.079> if<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.289> if<00:04:21.950> I

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
care about 1b ones I lose good if I if I

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.040 
care about 1b ones I lose good if I if I
went<00:04:22.310> go<00:04:22.970> it<00:04:23.090> away

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050
