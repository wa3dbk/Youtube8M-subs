00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
this is how I made mine well well we're

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
this is how I made mine well well we're
kind<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.439> lagging<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> made

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
kind of lagging here this is how I made

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.200 
kind of lagging here this is how I made
mine<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:07.100> you<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.220> customize<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.640> however<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
mine I you can customize to however you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.190 
mine I you can customize to however you
want<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.310> yeah<00:01:11.310> basically<00:01:12.119> how<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> works

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
want but yeah basically how it works

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
want but yeah basically how it works
I'll<00:01:13.680> show<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> how<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> make<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> later<00:01:14.760> but

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I'll show you how to make it later but

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.940 
I'll show you how to make it later but
I'll<00:01:15.119> tell<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.360> how<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.570> works

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
I'll tell you how it works

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.870 
I'll tell you how it works
um<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.909> oh<00:01:18.330> yeah<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> looks<00:01:19.619> like

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
um so oh yeah this is how it looks like

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.640 
um so oh yeah this is how it looks like
but<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.570> here's<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.840> lever<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.290> click<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
but right here's a lever you click that

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
but right here's a lever you click that
spam<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:23.670> ding<00:01:23.820> under<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.270> so

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
spam in your ding under your so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.670 
spam in your ding under your so
basically<00:01:25.880> when<00:01:26.880> redstone<00:01:27.450> powers<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
basically when redstone powers a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.160 
basically when redstone powers a
redstone<00:01:29.640> torch<00:01:29.759> through<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> block<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.869> turns

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
redstone torch through a block it turns

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.429 
redstone torch through a block it turns
it<00:01:31.320> off<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.520> there's<00:01:33.479> no<00:01:33.630> redstone<00:01:34.200> going

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it off so this there's no redstone going

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.960 
it off so this there's no redstone going
through<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> lever<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
through the lever right now because the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420 
through the lever right now because the
lever<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.270> not<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.439> it<00:01:37.560> did<00:01:37.680> go<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
lever is not on so if it did go on this

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.450 
lever is not on so if it did go on this
would<00:01:38.869> turn<00:01:39.869> off<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.740> would<00:01:40.950> turn<00:01:41.159> on

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
would turn off and this would turn on

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.899 
would turn off and this would turn on
because<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.890> because<00:01:43.890> no<00:01:44.159> redstone<00:01:44.670> will<00:01:44.790> be

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
because this because no redstone will be

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.090 
because this because no redstone will be
powering<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.390> since<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.140> be<00:01:46.290> off<00:01:46.439> so

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
powering it since this would be off so

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
powering it since this would be off so
this<00:01:47.820> would<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.899> then<00:01:48.990> this<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.320> be

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
this would be on and then this would be

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.139 
this would be on and then this would be
off<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.750> if<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:52.110> was<00:01:52.320> off<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.939> thing

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
off and if this was off then this thing

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.010 
off and if this was off then this thing
would<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.600> spammy<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.110> crazy<00:01:55.470> because

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
would go all spammy and crazy because

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.590 
would go all spammy and crazy because
right<00:01:58.020> now<00:01:58.430> since<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.240> there

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
right now since this is on right there

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.270 
right now since this is on right there
the<00:02:00.810> redstone<00:02:01.110> torch<00:02:01.140> under<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:02.009> block

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the redstone torch under this block
