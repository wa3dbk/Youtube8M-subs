00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.110
 32 these three dedicated videos some 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.020
 build in the bass lines a lot 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.220
 concrete series very effective 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.620
 video I called it theory in practice 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.060
 a first practical part and you are there after 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.820
 a theoretical part where I explain them 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.559
 exactly how to use on the bottom 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.550
 how to apply these concepts to the bottom 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.260
 to get into particular quarrels 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.600
 we dedicate this video to the use of 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.970
 colors all this material 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.980
 you will find very detailed explained 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.379
 in the smallest details within the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.089
 our contemporary stack two but you are 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.730
 contemporary two probably now 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.610
 the most effective method on the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.830
 market to learn the bass in this 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.010
 first part in listen and then look 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.060
 in the second part we find ourselves for 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.060
 step as applied 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.620
 the bass line is built by working 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.890
 on these three known topics 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.540
 of the known chords of the scales therefore 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.030
 it is necessary to understand from the agreements which they are 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.790
 the stairs to be used and the eventual ones 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.500
 chromatism when I use the notes of the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.049
 agreements I always have to know what kind of 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.109
 intervals just as we said 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.939
 the seventh major chord and therefore is 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:18.510
 fundamental third major fifth 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:21.090
 right seventh major and then know 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.859
 what are the notes and clear that having 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.049
 the shapes on the instrument this is a 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.650
 advantage but we must always understand 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.750
 the intervals know the intervals 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.329
 when I use the stairs notes 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.959
 I have to understand I need to know what the 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.760
 stairs that link certain agreements 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.159
 now instead we analyze the third 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.420
 possibility the one at the bottom 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:45.689
 interesting that is to use i 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.930
 use colors to use chromaticism means 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:50.280
 work using off-scale notes 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.620
 which therefore are also out of the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.690
 agreements but that they go to resolve of 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.370
 a semitone forward or backward and go to 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.590
 end up on a scale note or better 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.919
 still on a note of the agreement wants 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.099
 say that if I for example the minor king 7 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.099
 Tues. 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.290
 I the soul seventh after we already have 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.740
 having said that quotas can be used 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.740
 agreement 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.470
 these are the notes of the agreement only king 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.900
 lower 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.900
 I know 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.900
 is 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.039
 these are the notes of the agreement though 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.169
 we have said that king minor seventh in 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.180
 subjects but are also second and fifth 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.389
 so I can use the notes of the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:45.819
 minor scale then all 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:48.330
 natural notes but discussed at 3 when 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.330
 on the sol 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.880
 r 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.400
 son 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.910
 not me 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.510
 these are notes of the scale now 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.250
 instead we also add chromatism 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.330
 it means that it can reach the king 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:14.130
 through a semitone or so 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.320
 even in the sun through a semitone 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.720
 before or a semitone after it has 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.460
 in this case many have opened 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.980
 interesting possibilities re chromatism 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.980
 I go about his color scheme 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.280
 color on the sol 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.280
 r 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.979
 I know 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.730
 that is, I must have reference points 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.290
 that I am the miur is that dragon when 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:51.270
 I can say that in the world it is not a problem 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.440
 of the Roma who are here paulson empty and 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.120
 within the notes of the agreement which 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.770
 they are the most clear thing 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.370
 harmonica passes through the notes of the 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.660
 stairs 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.120
 then the eventual ones also arrived 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:08.410
 colors can vary a lot from ren 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.710
 I do a chromatism to go on 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.710
 sleep 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.960
 chromatism to go on the king 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.320
 chromaticism 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.320
