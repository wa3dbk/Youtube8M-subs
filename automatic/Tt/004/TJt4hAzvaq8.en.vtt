00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.010 
get advice from my opinion from other
people<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.530> believe<00:01:49.040> we<00:01:49.970> can<00:01:50.150> share<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:50.780> roads

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
people I believe we can share the roads

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.080 
people I believe we can share the roads
but<00:01:51.590> we<00:01:51.620> need<00:01:51.860> more<00:01:52.070> space<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.880> world

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
but we need more space on the world

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.070 
but we need more space on the world
perhaps<00:01:53.560> 2/3<00:01:54.560> more<00:01:54.950> on<00:01:55.490> our<00:01:55.940> side<00:01:55.970> there's<00:01:56.750> tea

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
perhaps 2/3 more on our side there's tea

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.070 
perhaps 2/3 more on our side there's tea
lanes<00:01:57.350> or<00:01:57.650> most<00:01:57.950> rivers<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:59.060> if<00:01:59.300> we<00:01:59.480> have<00:01:59.780> that

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
lanes or most rivers so if we have that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.650 
lanes or most rivers so if we have that
then<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.650> people<00:02:00.830> existence<00:02:01.550> is<00:02:01.940> in<00:02:02.180> viruses

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
then the people existence is in viruses

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.660
