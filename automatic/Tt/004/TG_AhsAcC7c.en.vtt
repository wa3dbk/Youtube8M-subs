this<00:02:45.010> they<00:02:45.310> would<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.640> plain<00:02:45.850> stop<00:02:46.209> but<00:02:47.170> not

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
this they would just plain stop but not

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.540 
this they would just plain stop but not
in<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.470> Jeep<00:02:47.650> we<00:02:47.800> need<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:48.010> make<00:02:48.160> sure<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.400> Jeep

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
in a Jeep we need to make sure the Jeep

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.330 
in a Jeep we need to make sure the Jeep
stays<00:02:48.959> moving<00:02:49.959> forward<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.530> that's<00:02:51.070> what<00:02:51.190> the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
stays moving forward and that's what the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.860 
stays moving forward and that's what the
four-wheel<00:02:51.640> drive<00:02:51.670> system<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.420> do<00:02:52.540> that's

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
four-wheel drive system can do that's

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.479 
four-wheel drive system can do that's
why<00:02:53.019> we<00:02:53.110> go<00:02:53.230> an<00:02:53.380> active<00:02:53.800> drive<00:02:54.010> because<00:02:54.340> it's

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
why we go an active drive because it's

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.759 
why we go an active drive because it's
actively<00:02:54.880> transferring<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.690> torque<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.620> the
