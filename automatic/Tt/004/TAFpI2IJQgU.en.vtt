00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.750 
and one of the major changes that we see
with<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:08.970> 6<00:02:09.179> v<00:02:09.330> a2<00:02:09.810> from<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> 16<00:02:11.190> is<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
with the 6 v a2 from the 16 is that it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.370 
with the 6 v a2 from the 16 is that it
has<00:02:12.000> a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
has a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.340 
has a
400<00:02:13.100> TV<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:14.390> anyway<00:02:14.630> let's<00:02:14.810> open<00:02:14.900> up<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> box

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
400 TV so anyway let's open up the box

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.580 
400 TV so anyway let's open up the box
here<00:02:15.740> right<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.700> top<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.330> device<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:18.260> has<00:02:18.560> a

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
here right on top is the device it has a

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.380 
here right on top is the device it has a
very<00:02:19.010> similar<00:02:19.280> build<00:02:19.580> quality<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:20.270> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
very similar build quality to the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.660 
very similar build quality to the
Micromax<00:02:20.900> canvas<00:02:21.020> turbo<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:22.280> aluminium

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
Micromax canvas turbo and all aluminium

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.990 
Micromax canvas turbo and all aluminium
back<00:02:23.350> there<00:02:24.350> are<00:02:24.470> two<00:02:24.620> plastic<00:02:24.890> parts<00:02:25.400> here<00:02:25.790> at

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
back there are two plastic parts here at

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.030 
back there are two plastic parts here at
the<00:02:26.240> top<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.600> bottom<00:02:26.690> two<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.350> you<00:02:27.920> know

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
the top and bottom two for you know

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.270 
the top and bottom two for you know
better<00:02:28.280> cell<00:02:28.670> reception<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:29.800> let's<00:02:30.800> keep<00:02:31.100> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
better cell reception and let's keep the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.700 
better cell reception and let's keep the
device<00:02:31.400> aside<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.120> take<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> look<00:02:33.080> at<00:02:33.320> other

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
device aside and take a look at other

00:02:33.710 --> 00:03:09.839 
device aside and take a look at other
box<00:02:34.160> contains<00:02:34.640> here

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.220 

so<00:03:10.849> there<00:03:11.000> we<00:03:11.090> go<00:03:11.239> these<00:03:11.540> are<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.900> box

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
so there we go these are the box

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.620 
so there we go these are the box
contents<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.400> Micromax<00:03:13.940> canvas<00:03:14.060> turbo

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
mini now about the device let's take a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.880 
mini now about the device let's take a
closer<00:03:18.830> look<00:03:19.010> at<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:20.209> Micromax<00:03:20.900> canvas<00:03:21.050> turbo

rocker<00:03:52.190> let's<00:03:53.030> focus<00:03:53.390> on<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:54.110> can<00:03:54.500> see

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
rocker let's focus on that you can see

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.220 
rocker let's focus on that you can see
that<00:03:54.920> this<00:03:55.310> part<00:03:55.700> is<00:03:55.940> indeed<00:03:56.750> made<00:03:57.049> of

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
that this part is indeed made of

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.880 
that this part is indeed made of
aluminium<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:59.150> not<00:03:59.600> the<00:04:00.170> usual<00:04:00.320> plastic

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
aluminium and not the usual plastic

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.880 
aluminium and not the usual plastic
metal<00:04:01.040> which<00:04:01.340> is<00:04:01.370> pretty<00:04:01.700> good<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:02.890> controls

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
metal which is pretty good the controls

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.190 
metal which is pretty good the controls
though<00:04:04.100> look<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.579> little<00:04:04.850> bit<00:04:05.090> wonky<00:04:05.390> as<00:04:05.780> you

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
though look a little bit wonky as you

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.910 
though look a little bit wonky as you
can<00:04:06.320> see<00:04:06.440> from<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.799> video<00:04:06.890> here<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:09.140> over<00:04:09.709> the

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
can see from the video here and over the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.610 
can see from the video here and over the
left<00:04:10.100> hand<00:04:10.280> side<00:04:10.579> we<00:04:11.209> have<00:04:11.540> a<00:04:11.810> micro<00:04:12.319> SIM<00:04:12.590> tray

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
left hand side we have a micro SIM tray

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.160 
left hand side we have a micro SIM tray
which<00:04:13.370> can<00:04:13.760> be<00:04:13.940> ejected<00:04:14.060> with<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.600> tool<00:04:14.780> again

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
which can be ejected with the tool again

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.860 
which can be ejected with the tool again
a<00:04:15.350> little<00:04:15.590> bit<00:04:15.799> wonky<00:04:16.039> here<00:04:16.220> it's<00:04:16.940> not<00:04:17.299> exactly

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
a little bit wonky here it's not exactly

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.340 
a little bit wonky here it's not exactly
perfectly<00:04:18.530> placed<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:20.359> coming<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.139> bottom

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
perfectly placed so coming to the bottom

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.650 
perfectly placed so coming to the bottom
we<00:04:21.829> have<00:04:22.010> just<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.490> primary<00:04:22.729> microphone<00:04:23.419> and

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
we have just the primary microphone and

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.350 
we have just the primary microphone and
coming<00:04:24.169> to<00:04:24.289> the<00:04:24.410> top<00:04:24.590> we<00:04:25.130> have<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.520> 3.5<00:04:26.150> mm

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
coming to the top we have the 3.5 mm

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.230 
coming to the top we have the 3.5 mm
audio<00:04:26.660> jack<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:27.200> microUSB<00:04:27.560> port<00:04:28.240> that's

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
audio jack the microUSB port that's

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.290 
audio jack the microUSB port that's
about<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:30.160> we<00:04:31.160> already<00:04:31.280> saw<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:31.700> left<00:04:32.030> and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
about it we already saw the left and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.360 
about it we already saw the left and
right<00:04:32.510> hand<00:04:32.720> side<00:04:32.930> so<00:04:33.289> let's<00:04:33.590> go<00:04:33.950> to<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.160> back

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
right hand side so let's go to the back

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.650 
right hand side so let's go to the back
the<00:04:34.610> back<00:04:34.760> has<00:04:35.030> a<00:04:35.060> 8<00:04:35.300> megapixel<00:04:35.990> camera<00:04:37.660> single

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
the back has a 8 megapixel camera single

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.719 
the back has a 8 megapixel camera single
LED<00:04:39.050> flash<00:04:39.080> which<00:04:39.620> looks<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.190> be<00:04:40.310> pretty

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
LED flash which looks to be pretty

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.100 
LED flash which looks to be pretty
powerful<00:04:40.940> from<00:04:41.389> the<00:04:41.510> looks<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:41.810> it<00:04:41.930> and

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
powerful from the looks of it and

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
powerful from the looks of it and
there's<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.889> new<00:04:43.070> micro<00:04:43.370> max<00:04:43.580> logo<00:04:43.970> and<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.660> bit

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
there's the new micro max logo and a bit
