you only get one single shot as so far
as<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.420> know<00:00:45.480> unless<00:00:45.750> there's<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.110> part<00:00:46.350> pro<00:00:46.620> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
as I know unless there's a part pro that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.729 
as I know unless there's a part pro that
gives<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.739> extremely

after<00:01:56.759> spawn<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.210> probably<00:01:57.420> your<00:01:57.509> best<00:01:57.570> chance

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
after spawn is probably your best chance

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.920 
after spawn is probably your best chance
to<00:01:57.990> throw<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> off<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.979> launch<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.939> randomly

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
to throw it off and launch it randomly

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.120 
to throw it off and launch it randomly
throw<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.409> off<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> middle<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> nowhere

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
throw it off in the middle of nowhere

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.819 
throw it off in the middle of nowhere
and<00:02:02.579> look<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:02.909> happens<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.680> was

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
and look what happens here and that was

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.249 
and look what happens here and that was
only<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.070> single<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.610> still<00:02:06.000> pretty<00:02:06.259> radical

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
only a single but still pretty radical

and
yeah<00:02:08.970> again<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.450> always<00:02:11.170> works<00:02:11.550> except<00:02:12.550> for

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
yeah again this always works except for

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
you think it's overpowered or whatever I

don't think it's overpowered you know I
only<00:02:53.860> get<00:02:53.980> one<00:02:54.190> shot<00:02:54.299> but<00:02:55.299> the<00:02:55.390> range<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:56.019> this

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
only get one shot but the range on this

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.830 
only get one shot but the range on this
thing<00:02:56.170> is<00:02:56.440> absolutely<00:02:56.950> amazing<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:58.360> range<00:02:58.629> of

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
thing is absolutely amazing the range of

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.530 
thing is absolutely amazing the range of
damage<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.500> damage<00:02:59.680> effect<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:01.000> just<00:03:01.180> launch

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
damage the damage effect you just launch

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.900 
damage the damage effect you just launch
it<00:03:01.690> off<00:03:01.780> no<00:03:02.170> nowhere<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.310> know<00:03:03.430> odds<00:03:03.730> are

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
it off no nowhere and you know odds are

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.339 
it off no nowhere and you know odds are
if<00:03:04.000> someone's<00:03:04.239> walking<00:03:04.360> by<00:03:04.690> or<00:03:04.870> even<00:03:05.110> kind<00:03:05.290> of

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
if someone's walking by or even kind of

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.770 
if someone's walking by or even kind of
close<00:03:05.560> way<00:03:05.799> close<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.640> well<00:03:07.450> that's<00:03:07.629> how

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
close way close to it well that's how

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.770 
close way close to it well that's how
the<00:03:07.840> math<00:03:08.079> boom<00:03:08.379> there's<00:03:09.010> another<00:03:09.190> double<00:03:09.780> so

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
the math boom there's another double so

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.050 
the math boom there's another double so
