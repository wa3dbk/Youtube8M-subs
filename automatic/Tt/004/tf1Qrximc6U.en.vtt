00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.410
 Good night, my name is 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.500
 jorge and this is from serviu tonight 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.620
 let's see an application called free 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.780
 video free video is an application that 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.640
 It serves to download videos from 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:22.060
 Youtube 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.739
 the emotion I drink bing google break 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.619
 infinite infinity of videos that you 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:30.529
 you may like it was served in case you get 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.750
 to watch a YouTube video that you like and 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.699
 for some reason, if you want 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.050
 show it to others simply 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.050
 enter often 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.340
 while you select any video by 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.340
 example 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.550
 let's see first what comes out here 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.250
 this video that immediately 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.250
 disappears 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.570
 man I'm going to lower the volume to 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.260
 download only the only thing they have 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.320
 what to do is to put in the button that 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.420
 here is very intuitive and you know 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.350
 once they are selected they can 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.900
 define the name 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.320
 I already told you how it's done 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.700
 can continue watching the video 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700
 they can minimize it 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.880
 in downloads we can see that the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.640
 video has a medium download we use 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.500
 they load and very fast the movement but 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.310
 the advantage of this application that has 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.080
 the same speed in 3g in weihai 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.240
 You could say that I am always 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.910
 work to me I'm not interested to download 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.610
 just like in 13 I want more speed 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.100
 but for me personally what I 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.290
 I used the 3g when he did download some 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.600
 video for a task just what 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.630
 and in less than two minutes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.329
 I have my video downloaded 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.470
 you can see that the process of 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.110
 Oblivion weighs 90 megabytes 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.910
 it is downloading 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.520
 at 670 650 kilobytes per second 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.970
 here are the videos the videos yo 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.560
 I have 4 in staff that I like a lot 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.560
 which is called the wasabi production 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.070
 you can increase lists 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.170
 what are the lists can you add lists 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.170
 of reproduction for example 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.120
 for example music 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.830
 music ok 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.050

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.290
 a video list 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.540
 in settings because you can see is to go 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.360
 directly to a place where it is 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.720

 remove something you find some bug some 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.600
 problem writing a review is a very 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.069
 intuitive for example and that's 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.170
 finished downloading the video 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.510
 what you have is that you can be 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.730
 watching a video 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:06.099
 example select the telecite 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.030
 You may be watching a video while 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.950
 you look for another 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.590
 for example here you are already 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.519
 reproducing and I can continue in the 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.040
 browser I can save this and the video 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.190
 this signal will continue to be reproduced 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.570
 in case you already know that you are going to download 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.340
 if you are going to download only music videos 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.780
 and you like a song can be 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.180
 listening to it while still downloading 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.800
 videos will not affect in any 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.479
 problem 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.960
 you can move the screen to where 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.860
 you want and if you just want to remove it have 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.500
 a power button 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.230
 to pay 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.630
 good 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.270

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.780
