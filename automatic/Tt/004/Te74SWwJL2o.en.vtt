00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.190 
will work as well and there are so many

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.160 
will work as well and there are so many
little<00:00:32.550> free<00:00:32.970> motif<00:00:33.330> kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> patterns<00:00:34.080> that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170

you<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.440> see<00:00:34.650> out<00:00:34.800> there<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.280> also<00:00:35.790> think<00:00:36.180> that

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you can see out there I also think that

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.840 
you can see out there I also think that
this<00:00:36.480> would<00:00:36.720> be<00:00:36.870> cool<00:00:37.170> if<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.830> put<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.309> year

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
this would be cool if I put the year

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
this would be cool if I put the year
right<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.559> haven't<00:00:40.800> done<00:00:40.949> on<00:00:41.130> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
right here which I haven't done on this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.560 
right here which I haven't done on this
but<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> think<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.850> might<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.329> think<00:00:42.360> that's

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
but I think I might do it I think that's

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.510 
but I think I might do it I think that's
a<00:00:42.720> pretty<00:00:42.840> good<00:00:42.960> idea<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.040> giving<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
a pretty good idea so I'm giving you

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.959 
a pretty good idea so I'm giving you
this<00:00:44.730> snowflake<00:00:45.300> design<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:46.340> this<00:00:47.340> Christmas

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this snowflake design and this Christmas

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.330 
this snowflake design and this Christmas
tree<00:00:48.120> design<00:00:48.540> but<00:00:49.170> really<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.829> technique<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
tree design but really the technique is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
tree design but really the technique is
the<00:00:50.430> same<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:51.030> any<00:00:51.270> design<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the same for any design that you want to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
the same for any design that you want to
embroider<00:00:53.130> on<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.640> knits<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.690> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
embroider on the knits on to the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.139 
embroider on the knits on to the
stockinette<00:00:55.260> stitch<00:00:55.379> now<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.670> we<00:00:56.850> embroider

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
stockinette stitch now when we embroider

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
stockinette stitch now when we embroider
on<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:58.230> stockinette<00:00:58.710> stitch<00:00:58.950> we<00:00:59.370> use<00:00:59.550> what's

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
on in stockinette stitch we use what's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.340 
on in stockinette stitch we use what's
called<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> duplicate<00:01:00.629> stitch<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:01.140> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
called the duplicate stitch because it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.799 
called the duplicate stitch because it
exactly<00:01:02.070> matches<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.879> look<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.629> knit

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
exactly matches the look of the knit

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.180 
exactly matches the look of the knit
stitch<00:01:04.080> kind<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.379> makes<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.589> look<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
stitch kind of makes it look like it's a

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.950 
stitch kind of makes it look like it's a
knit<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.880> that's<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.420> technique<00:01:06.750> I'm

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
knit in and that's the technique I'm

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.850 
knit in and that's the technique I'm

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
tight isn't gonna look right and I

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
should tell you I knit this swatch out

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.750 
should tell you I knit this swatch out
of<00:02:15.989> chunky<00:02:16.680> weight<00:02:16.800> yarn<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.310> I'm<00:02:17.370> using<00:02:17.579> a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
of chunky weight yarn and I'm using a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.490 
of chunky weight yarn and I'm using a
worsted<00:02:18.150> weight<00:02:18.360> yarn<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.049> duplicate

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
worsted weight yarn for a duplicate

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.809 
worsted weight yarn for a duplicate
stitch<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.159> never<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.670> look

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
stitch so this is never going to look

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.000 
stitch so this is never going to look
exactly<00:02:21.000> right<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:21.659> the<00:02:21.750> tech

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
exactly right but the tech

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.789 
exactly right but the tech
is<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.370> same<00:02:22.580> okay<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.689> I<00:02:23.810> pulled<00:02:24.260> my<00:02:24.319> pulled

V grab both legs of the stitch above it

V grab both legs of the stitch above it
pull<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:47.000> through<00:02:47.239> watching<00:02:47.480> my<00:02:47.720> tension<00:02:48.200> go

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
pull that through watching my tension go

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.619 
pull that through watching my tension go
back<00:02:49.129> down<00:02:49.400> into<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.700> same<00:02:49.909> hole<00:02:49.970> I<00:02:50.209> came<00:02:50.390> out

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
back down into the same hole I came out

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.140 
back down into the same hole I came out
of<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.290> tighten<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.010> up<00:02:52.159> now<00:02:52.849> I'm<00:02:52.939> not<00:02:53.120> sure

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
of and tighten it up now I'm not sure

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.580 
of and tighten it up now I'm not sure
what<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.720> going<00:02:53.959> on<00:02:54.140> here<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.440> actually

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
what I have going on here I actually

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.229 
what I have going on here I actually
think<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.010> might<00:02:55.040> have<00:02:55.280> come<00:02:55.489> in<00:02:55.609> too<00:02:55.819> low<00:02:56.030> on

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
think I might have come in too low on

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.660 
think I might have come in too low on
the<00:02:56.269> first<00:02:56.569> stitch<00:02:57.040> that's<00:02:58.040> easy<00:02:58.340> enough<00:02:58.430> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
the first stitch that's easy enough to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.270 
the first stitch that's easy enough to
fix<00:02:59.019> because<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.230> V<00:03:00.409> didn't<00:03:00.709> look<00:03:00.829> perfect

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
fix because that V didn't look perfect

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.930 
fix because that V didn't look perfect
and<00:03:01.400> they<00:03:01.519> really<00:03:01.760> should<00:03:01.819> look<00:03:02.120> perfect<00:03:03.940> that

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and they really should look perfect that

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.009 
and they really should look perfect that
looks<00:03:04.970> better<00:03:05.389> okay<00:03:10.659> now<00:03:11.659> I'm<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:11.930> to

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
looks better okay now I'm going to

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.690 
looks better okay now I'm going to
travel<00:03:12.409> a<00:03:12.500> little<00:03:12.650> bit<00:03:12.889> here<00:03:13.159> and<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.519> one
