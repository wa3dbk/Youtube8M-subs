I<00:00:28.710> mean<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.070> understand<00:00:29.760> people<00:00:30.150> hack<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.630> lot

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
I mean I understand people hack in a lot

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.260 
I mean I understand people hack in a lot
of<00:00:30.960> different<00:00:30.990> games<00:00:31.410> there's<00:00:32.399> no<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:33.090> know

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
you can't blame people hacking on the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.170 
you can't blame people hacking on the
developer<00:00:36.719> however<00:00:37.680> there<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.520> no<00:00:38.550> server

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
developer however there is no server

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.350 
developer however there is no server
browser<00:00:39.649> in<00:00:40.649> call<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.040> duty<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.270> actually

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
browser in call of duty so I actually

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.229 
browser in call of duty so I actually
left<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.260> server<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.040> searched<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
left this server and searched for a

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.880 
left this server and searched for a
different<00:00:45.809> ground<00:00:46.050> war<00:00:46.320> server<00:00:46.649> because

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
different ground war server because

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.150 
different ground war server because
that's<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.520> trying<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.879> play<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:49.160> I

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
that's what I was trying to play and I

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.479 
that's what I was trying to play and I
ended<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.750> same<00:00:51.930> server

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
ended up right back in the same server

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.130 
ended up right back in the same server
so<00:00:53.489> yeah<00:00:53.789> there's<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.300> mean<00:00:54.449> there's<00:00:54.600> no<00:00:54.809> server

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
so yeah there's I mean there's no server

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
so yeah there's I mean there's no server
browser<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.520> was<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> server<00:00:57.000> browser

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
browser so if there was a server browser

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
browser so if there was a server browser
I<00:00:57.510> could<00:00:57.719> see<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.469> was<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> server

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
I could see you know that was a server

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.099 
I could see you know that was a server
that<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.460> hackers<00:00:59.609> were<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.120> let<00:01:00.690> me<00:01:00.719> try<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that the hackers were in let me try a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.529 
that the hackers were in let me try a
different<00:01:01.590> server<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.030> no<00:01:03.210> server

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
different server but there's no server

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.969 
different server but there's no server
browser<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.350> call<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.070> duty<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.840> can't<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
browser in call of duty so you can't you

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
browser in call of duty so you can't you
know<00:01:08.130> join<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> different<00:01:09.119> server<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.840> to

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
know join a different server you have to

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.100 
know join a different server you have to
put<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.950> these<00:01:11.520> people's<00:01:12.090> ignorance<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this game max out the campaign was

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.410 
this game max out the campaign was
actually<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:59.219> lot<00:01:59.640> different<00:02:00.030> i<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.240> actually

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
actually a lot different i was actually

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.139 
actually a lot different i was actually
getting<00:02:00.750> very<00:02:01.079> good<00:02:01.350> frame<00:02:01.979> rates<00:02:02.250> throughout

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
getting very good frame rates throughout

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.059 
getting very good frame rates throughout
the<00:02:03.329> campaign<00:02:03.829> but<00:02:04.829> for<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:06.469> multiplayer<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the campaign but for the multiplayer the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.580 
the campaign but for the multiplayer the
I<00:02:08.459> mean<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> frame<00:02:09.209> rate<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.780> ridiculous

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I mean the frame rate is just ridiculous

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.190 
I mean the frame rate is just ridiculous
on<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.160> these<00:02:11.250> maps

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
on some of these maps

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.979 
on some of these maps
I<00:02:12.590> mean<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.069> would<00:02:13.160> drop<00:02:13.370> down<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.790> 45<00:02:14.420> frames

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
I mean it would drop down to 45 frames

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.690 
I mean it would drop down to 45 frames
per<00:02:15.319> second<00:02:15.650> that's<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> lowest<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.370> actually

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
per second that's the lowest I actually

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.729 
per second that's the lowest I actually
noticed<00:02:17.209> I<00:02:17.660> was<00:02:18.019> like<00:02:18.140> man<00:02:18.319> this<00:02:18.530> is

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
noticed I was like man this is

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.830 
noticed I was like man this is
stuttering<00:02:19.010> quite<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> bit<00:02:20.030> or<00:02:20.239> not<00:02:20.360> stuttering

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
stuttering quite a bit or not stuttering

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.680 
stuttering quite a bit or not stuttering
but<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.920> didn't<00:02:22.400> feel<00:02:22.610> right<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.660> know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
but just didn't feel right so I you know

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.199 
but just didn't feel right so I you know
checked<00:02:24.140> out<00:02:24.290> my<00:02:24.410> framerate<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:25.099> saw<00:02:25.340> 45<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.180> I

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
checked out my framerate I saw 45 and I

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.059 
checked out my framerate I saw 45 and I
was<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.510> oh<00:02:26.690> well<00:02:27.290> that<00:02:27.440> that's<00:02:27.709> probably

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
was like oh well that that's probably

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.940 
was like oh well that that's probably
has<00:02:28.340> something<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.760> do<00:02:28.940> with<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.650> mean

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
has something to do with it so I mean

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430 
has something to do with it so I mean
it's<00:02:31.819> just<00:02:32.090> not<00:02:32.269> a<00:02:32.300> good<00:02:32.390> experience<00:02:32.750> on<00:02:33.290> the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's just not a good experience on the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.770 
it's just not a good experience on the
pc<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.130> this<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.060> year<00:02:35.450> you're<00:02:35.630> actually

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
could not finish the job maybe he

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.380 
could not finish the job maybe he
stunned<00:02:53.390> himself<00:02:54.099> but<00:02:55.099> yeah<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.700> finally<00:02:56.000> found

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
stunned himself but yeah I finally found

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.199 
stunned himself but yeah I finally found
a<00:02:56.569> server<00:02:56.870> without<00:02:57.349> some<00:02:58.130> hackers<00:02:58.489> in<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.849> so

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
a server without some hackers in it so

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.740 
a server without some hackers in it so
and<00:03:00.370> yeah<00:03:01.370> I'm<00:03:01.489> kind<00:03:01.700> of<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.849> low<00:03:02.060> level<00:03:02.390> right

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
play on 60 fov unless you you know mess

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.259

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.750 
around with the files and all that stuff
but<00:04:17.630> why<00:04:18.109> couldn't<00:04:18.169> they<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:18.590> add<00:04:19.010> an<00:04:19.190> fov

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
but why couldn't they just add an fov

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.000 
but why couldn't they just add an fov
slider<00:04:20.150> in<00:04:20.419> there<00:04:20.599> people<00:04:21.409> don't<00:04:21.560> have<00:04:21.799> to

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.310 
slider in there people don't have to
play<00:04:22.220> with<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.640> but<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.849> should<00:04:23.210> give<00:04:23.479> players

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
play with it but you should give players

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.460 
play with it but you should give players
the<00:04:24.470> option

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
the option

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.650 
the option

to change their field of view especially
in<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.760> FPS<00:04:29.760> game<00:04:30.350> because<00:04:31.350> every<00:04:31.890> other<00:04:32.010> FPS

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
in a FPS game because every other FPS

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.700 
in a FPS game because every other FPS
game<00:04:32.820> has<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.210> field<00:04:33.660> of<00:04:33.750> view<00:04:33.870> slider<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.500> most

game has a field of view slider and most

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.860 
game has a field of view slider and most
people<00:04:34.950> end<00:04:35.340> up<00:04:35.460> adjusting<00:04:36.030> that<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:36.720> when

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
people end up adjusting that so when

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.190 
people end up adjusting that so when
they<00:04:36.960> come<00:04:37.200> back<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.590> call<00:04:37.770> of<00:04:37.890> duty<00:04:38.220> 60<00:04:39.150> fov<00:04:39.930> I

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.920 
mean it's just like a ridiculous
experience<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:44.130> somebody<00:04:44.490> who's<00:04:44.700> used<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.180> I

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
experience for somebody who's used to I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.710 
experience for somebody who's used to I

personally play on a 90 fov so that's

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.680 
personally play on a 90 fov so that's
quite<00:04:49.170> a<00:04:49.200> bit<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.620> a<00:04:50.490> difference<00:04:51.030> in<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.420> field

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
quite a bit of a difference in the field

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.550 
quite a bit of a difference in the field
of<00:04:51.840> view<00:04:52.160> so<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.660> mean<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.870> don't<00:04:54.930> know<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.530> just

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
of view so I mean I don't know it just

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.410 
of view so I mean I don't know it just
doesn't<00:04:55.860> seem<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.280> me<00:04:56.550> like<00:04:56.580> they<00:04:56.910> really<00:04:57.090> care

about<00:04:57.530> the<00:04:58.530> pc<00:04:58.920> community<00:04:59.370> because<00:04:59.670> it's<00:04:59.850> not
