00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
get 57% more runtime why is it funny it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.330 
get 57% more runtime why is it funny it
is<00:02:29.180> we<00:02:30.180> actually<00:02:30.210> test<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.050> did<00:02:31.290> we<00:02:31.500> did<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:32.220> got

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
so if you need some low speed precision

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.970

so check out the brushless three-speed

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.560 
so check out the brushless three-speed
impact<00:04:44.550> from<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.820> wall

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570
