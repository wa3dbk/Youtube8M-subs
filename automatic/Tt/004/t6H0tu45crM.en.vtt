but<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.530> heavy-handed<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.430> Sharpie

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
but I'm so heavy-handed that the Sharpie

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.479 
but I'm so heavy-handed that the Sharpie
looks<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.149> lot<00:01:00.270> better<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.309> with<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
looks a lot better with it and with the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
looks a lot better with it and with the
pencils<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.270> want<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:03.680> prismacolor

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
pencils you just want to use prismacolor

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.010 
pencils you just want to use prismacolor
pencils<00:01:04.920> because<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.760> are<00:01:05.880> loyal<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.790> these

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
pencils because they are loyal and these

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.719 
pencils because they are loyal and these
markers<00:01:10.020> are<00:01:10.320> alcohol-based<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.549> will

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
markers are alcohol-based so they will

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.880 
markers are alcohol-based so they will
mix<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.720> they<00:01:12.840> look<00:01:13.020> kind<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.380> watercolor

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
mix well so they look kind of watercolor

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
markers they come up like this they're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.670 
markers they come up like this they're
pretty<00:01:31.310> anyways<00:01:32.310> um<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.170> look<00:01:34.350> like<00:01:34.500> in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the box of 25 so this is a the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.080 
the box of 25 so this is a the
difference<00:01:39.930> between<00:01:40.280> they<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> lot<00:01:42.060> of

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
difference between they have a lot of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
one side which is this but because of

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.130 
one side which is this but because of
how<00:01:59.399> much<00:01:59.549> alcohol<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.689> worth<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
how much alcohol it is it's worth it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.219 
how much alcohol it is it's worth it
they<00:02:02.270> wouldn't<00:02:03.270> put<00:02:03.450> them<00:02:03.600> on<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> marker

people<00:02:55.410> can't<00:02:55.650> be<00:02:55.800> cooking<00:02:56.100> like<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.430> tips

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
people can't be cooking like the tips

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.479 
people can't be cooking like the tips
better<00:02:56.970> or<00:02:57.560> partially<00:02:58.560> because<00:02:58.709> it's<00:02:59.040> cheaper

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
better or partially because it's cheaper

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.710 
better or partially because it's cheaper
um<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:02.190> a<00:03:02.220> Kovac<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.690> a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
um so this is a Kovac and this is a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.460 
um so this is a Kovac and this is a
brush<00:03:04.050> thing<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.280> bends<00:03:06.019> with<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.440> it's

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
brush thing and it bends with it so it's

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.400 
brush thing and it bends with it so it's
like<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.769> brush<00:03:08.220> stroke<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.330> they<00:03:09.750> micros

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
like a brush stroke so like they micros

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.820 
like a brush stroke so like they micros
already<00:03:10.739> look<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:10.980> watercolor<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:11.910> paper<00:03:11.940> so

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
already look like watercolor on paper so

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.380 
already look like watercolor on paper so
that's<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.980> good<00:03:14.100> tool<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.430> make<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> even<00:03:15.090> look

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
that's a good tool to make it even look

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.850 
that's a good tool to make it even look
more<00:03:15.600> like<00:03:15.750> watercolor<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.319> then<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.650> have

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
more like watercolor and then you have

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.000 
more like watercolor and then you have
kind<00:03:17.069> of<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:17.610> straight<00:03:17.970> edge<00:03:18.150> cool<00:03:19.010> they

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
kind of a more straight edge cool they

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.090 
kind of a more straight edge cool they
range<00:03:20.280> between<00:03:20.519> like<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.420> think<00:03:22.380> these<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.980> how

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
range between like I think these and how

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.300 
range between like I think these and how
range<00:03:23.310> around<00:03:23.519> 550<00:03:24.390> if<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.410> remember<00:03:25.860> there<00:03:26.280> are

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
range around 550 if I remember there are

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.199 
range around 550 if I remember there are
72<00:03:26.730> all<00:03:27.180> together<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:29.280> they're<00:03:29.910> kind<00:03:30.180> of

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
72 all together so they're kind of

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.300 
72 all together so they're kind of
expensive<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.989> colors<00:03:31.440> are<00:03:31.620> beautiful<00:03:31.799> you

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
expensive but colors are beautiful you

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.850 
expensive but colors are beautiful you
can<00:03:32.489> mix<00:03:32.790> them<00:03:33.120> with<00:03:33.660> either<00:03:33.870> adder<00:03:34.170> prisma

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
can mix them with either adder prisma

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.190 
can mix them with either adder prisma
which<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.340> a<00:03:35.370> great<00:03:35.850> thing<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.780> can<00:03:36.900> link

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
which is a great thing so you can link

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.620 
overlap them the only bad thing is that

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
have a lot of their markers dead and

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.110 
have a lot of their markers dead and
then<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:53.430> have<00:04:53.729> a<00:04:53.759> thin<00:04:54.330> tip<00:04:54.690> which<00:04:55.349> that<00:04:55.710> is

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
then you have a thin tip which that is

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.629 
then you have a thin tip which that is
sole<00:04:57.120> reason<00:04:57.360> other<00:04:58.139> than<00:04:58.380> that<00:04:58.710> you<00:04:59.280> can<00:04:59.430> find

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 
sole reason other than that you can find

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.600 
sole reason other than that you can find
them<00:04:59.759> anywhere<00:05:00.590> these<00:05:01.590> are<00:05:01.770> linked<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.310> be

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
them anywhere these are linked and be

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.279 
them anywhere these are linked and be
like<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:02.970> can<00:05:03.150> find<00:05:03.360> them<00:05:03.479> they<00:05:04.020> range
