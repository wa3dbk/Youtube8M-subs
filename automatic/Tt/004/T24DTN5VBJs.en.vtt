00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
 well we have an advance of 95% almost 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.750
 the works on the platform are being finalized 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.509
 with the truth with a time of work that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.109
 we had eight months and we are 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 ending almost two months before 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.260
 obviously the work of the platform is a work 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.840
 of engineering different from the work of 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.640
 building header header building 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.859
 We have a 30 percent improvement and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.119
 we estimate that in the month of April 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.010
 They would also be finishing the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.990
 building works header in lady 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.989
 how much time also to give all the work 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.870
 how long are the term of works in 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.480
 general is the two stages was eight 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.800
 months this stage began this month 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.200
 before but this one 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.629
 much more advanced because the work is 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.360
 this different let's say as to your 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.210
 execution towards investment the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.070
 platform investment of 19 million 500 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.170
 thousand pesos and the investment of the building 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.150
 header of approximately 43 thousand 500 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.860
 I had to calculate that the train will start 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.519
 to roll around here from what time 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.080
 of 2015 I calculate good we are 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.810
 changing the ways that is doing it 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.100
 the people of the nation the ascending way 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.100
 I'm doing the third way where 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.950
 End the platform and once you are 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.509
 this the train can arrive let's say this 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 to the platform 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.799
 regardless of the header building 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.030
 it is finished when it can not be the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.829
 first quarter of next year 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.229
 and in the next few days the 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.789
 randazzo minister to monitor and see the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 advancement of works so that too 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.479
 calculation that will also give the date of 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.060
 arrival of the train 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.920
 commercial area too so it's 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.490
 is anticipating as for confectionery 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.649
 places 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.119
 the idea of ​​the head building is that it be 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.890
 a sector this comfortable for the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.860
 neighbors who come to take the 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.840
 train is going to have a confectionery 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.509
 no trade is planned in this 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.520
 building so the whole area east with 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.060
 this work with the work of the avenue san 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.799
 Martin that is about to start is going 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.049
 let's say to value and revitalize well 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.670
 that this is going to change the whole context 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.670
 let's say of this southern area
