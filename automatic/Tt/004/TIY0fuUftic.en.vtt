00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
her up to really play yeah I think one

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.690 
her up to really play yeah I think one
we<00:01:04.559> wanted<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.010> able<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.189> challenge<00:01:05.400> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.100 
we wanted to be able to challenge you
more<00:01:05.909> every<00:01:06.119> day<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.630> for<00:01:06.780> Amber<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
more every day I think for Amber to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.390 
more every day I think for Amber to
reach<00:01:07.260> her<00:01:07.409> full<00:01:07.470> potential<00:01:07.890> she<00:01:08.070> needs<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
reach her full potential she needs to be

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760 
reach her full potential she needs to be
challenged<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.689> think<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.439> enough

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
challenged so I think we have enough

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.590 
challenged so I think we have enough
depth<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.939> this<00:01:12.119> year<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.479> really

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
depth to do that this year and really

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.590 
depth to do that this year and really
push<00:01:12.869> her<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.140> practice<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> give<00:01:15.479> her

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
push her in practice and and give her

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870 
push her in practice and and give her
some<00:01:15.840> relief<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.380> some<00:01:16.530> help<00:01:16.740> as<00:01:16.979> well<00:01:17.189> I'm<00:01:17.640> in
