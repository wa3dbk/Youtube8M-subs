that the picker brick actually had a
bread<00:00:49.590> crowbar<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.370> sort<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> weird

bread crowbar so it's sort of a weird
piece<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.170> expect<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.039> can<00:00:53.250> add<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:54.260> so

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
with her except for her hair just

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.549 
with her except for her hair just
because<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.449> character<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> series<00:01:04.260> has

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
because that character in the series has

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.030 
because that character in the series has
very<00:01:05.070> unique<00:01:05.220> hair<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:06.650> think<00:01:07.650> she<00:01:07.890> actually

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
very unique hair I think she actually

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
Potter hair which is kind of weird but I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.080

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
that almost has has like the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.870 
that almost has has like the
it's<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> colors<00:01:29.370> to<00:01:29.550> it<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.790> she

head to crabs here and I do also have
sort<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.590> right<00:04:27.710> here<00:04:27.889> like<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.100> zombified<00:04:29.060> guy

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
sort of right here like a zombified guy

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.110 
sort of right here like a zombified guy
and<00:04:30.460> if<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.580> take<00:04:31.820> off<00:04:33.340> her<00:04:34.340> not<00:04:34.699> to<00:04:34.849> take<00:04:34.970> off

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
and if you take off her not to take off

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.790 
and if you take off her not to take off
um<00:04:35.419> if<00:04:35.599> you<00:04:35.690> put<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.139> head<00:04:36.259> crab<00:04:36.530> like<00:04:36.770> a

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
um if you put on the head crab like a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.170 
um if you put on the head crab like a
sort<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.280> sort<00:04:37.820> of<00:04:37.880> works<00:04:38.060> not<00:04:38.330> well<00:04:38.539> but<00:04:40.180> I'm

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
sort of sort of works not well but I'm

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.129 
sort of sort of works not well but I'm
actually<00:04:41.360> not<00:04:41.599> gonna<00:04:41.720> do<00:04:41.840> it<00:04:41.930> because<00:04:41.990> it

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
actually not gonna do it because it

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.960 
actually not gonna do it because it
doesn't<00:04:42.289> really<00:04:42.680> hold<00:04:42.979> that<00:04:43.190> well<00:04:43.430> but<00:04:43.729> you

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
doesn't really hold that well but you

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.350 
doesn't really hold that well but you
can<00:04:44.210> do<00:04:44.389> it<00:04:44.620> if<00:04:45.620> you'd<00:04:45.889> like<00:04:46.039> pinch<00:04:47.030> his<00:04:47.180> head

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
can do it if you'd like pinch his head

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.439 
can do it if you'd like pinch his head
pinned<00:04:48.320> his<00:04:48.470> body<00:04:48.680> well<00:04:48.919> enough<00:04:49.389> it's<00:04:50.389> very

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
pinned his body well enough it's very

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.570 
pinned his body well enough it's very
difficult<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:50.990> do<00:04:51.110> that's<00:04:52.039> why<00:04:52.220> it's<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.400> Mayan

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
difficult to do that's why it's a Mayan

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.439 
difficult to do that's why it's a Mayan
creation<00:04:52.759> and<00:04:53.060> not<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.180> real<00:04:53.389> set<00:04:54.009> so<00:04:55.300> those<00:04:56.300> are

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
creation and not a real set so those are

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:57.010 
creation and not a real set so those are
the<00:04:56.509> mini<00:04:56.660> foam

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
the mini foam

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.719 
the mini foam
lava<00:04:57.919> god<00:04:58.130> anyway<00:05:00.190> so<00:05:01.190> those<00:05:01.520> are<00:05:01.669> the

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
lava god anyway so those are the

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.230 
lava god anyway so those are the
minifigs<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:02.389> then<00:05:03.229> I<00:05:03.440> do<00:05:03.560> have<00:05:04.060> pretty<00:05:05.060> much

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
minifigs and then I do have pretty much

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.629 
minifigs and then I do have pretty much
the<00:05:06.110> most<00:05:06.590> beautiful<00:05:07.070> thing<00:05:07.190> at<00:05:07.310> all<00:05:07.460> of

when<00:05:46.300> I<00:05:46.330> say<00:05:46.540> he's<00:05:46.720> fragile<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.230> you

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
when I say he's fragile like you

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.080 
when I say he's fragile like you
actually<00:05:47.530> have<00:05:47.680> no<00:05:47.890> idea<00:05:48.160> it's<00:05:48.430> like<00:05:48.730> I'm

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
actually have no idea it's like I'm

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.170 
actually have no idea it's like I'm
knowingly<00:05:49.450> fragile<00:05:50.730> but<00:05:51.730> he<00:05:51.790> looks<00:05:51.940> menacing

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
knowingly fragile but he looks menacing

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.510 
knowingly fragile but he looks menacing
when<00:05:52.480> you<00:05:52.540> standing<00:05:52.810> up<00:05:52.930> so<00:05:53.320> yes<00:05:56.040> so<00:05:57.040> I'll<00:05:57.280> sort

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
when you standing up so yes so I'll sort

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.400 
when you standing up so yes so I'll sort
of<00:05:57.580> sort<00:05:58.210> of<00:05:58.300> give<00:05:58.480> him<00:05:58.630> a<00:05:58.660> look<00:05:58.870> give<00:05:59.290> you<00:05:59.380> a

of sort of give him a look give you a

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:12.180 
of sort of give him a look give you a
look<00:05:59.560> right<00:05:59.710> now<00:05:59.890> how<00:06:00.100> he<00:06:00.160> how<00:06:00.580> he's<00:06:00.700> designed

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.700 

and<00:06:13.190> he's<00:06:13.310> got<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.669> long<00:06:14.240> legs<00:06:14.630> I<00:06:14.990> tried<00:06:15.620> to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
and he's got the long legs I tried to

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.230 
and he's got the long legs I tried to
make<00:06:15.830> them<00:06:15.980> 100%<00:06:16.370> poseable<00:06:16.970> which<00:06:17.120> is

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
make them 100% poseable which is

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.570 
make them 100% poseable which is
probably<00:06:17.750> why<00:06:17.960> I<00:06:17.990> failed<00:06:21.100> but<00:06:22.100> then<00:06:22.250> he's<00:06:22.370> got

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
probably why I failed but then he's got

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.610 
probably why I failed but then he's got
the<00:06:22.699> nice<00:06:22.910> long<00:06:23.570> legs<00:06:23.930> sort<00:06:24.650> of<00:06:24.710> a<00:06:24.830> fork<00:06:25.250> to<00:06:25.400> eat

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
the nice long legs sort of a fork to eat

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.590 
the nice long legs sort of a fork to eat
and<00:06:27.620> he's<00:06:27.770> got<00:06:27.919> the<00:06:28.070> hinges<00:06:28.400> there<00:06:28.850> on<00:06:29.090> all

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
and he's got the hinges there on all

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.450 
and he's got the hinges there on all
three<00:06:29.780> of<00:06:29.870> his<00:06:29.930> legs<00:06:30.199> and<00:06:30.949> here's<00:06:31.190> where<00:06:31.370> it's

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
three of his legs and here's where it's

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.240 
three of his legs and here's where it's
falling<00:06:31.729> apart<00:06:31.850> is<00:06:32.150> just<00:06:32.330> the<00:06:32.479> stupid<00:06:33.250> stupid

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
falling apart is just the stupid stupid

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.310 
falling apart is just the stupid stupid
ball<00:06:34.460> and<00:06:34.610> socket<00:06:35.030> joints<00:06:35.360> that<00:06:35.510> I<00:06:35.570> decided<00:06:36.139> to

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.320 
ball and socket joints that I decided to

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.770 
ball and socket joints that I decided to
make<00:06:36.500> would<00:06:36.710> be<00:06:36.830> a<00:06:36.860> good<00:06:36.949> idea<00:06:37.070> to<00:06:37.280> make<00:06:40.600> so<00:06:41.600> he

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
make would be a good idea to make so he

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.210 
make would be a good idea to make so he
is<00:06:41.930> hundreds<00:06:42.500> and<00:06:42.620> potable

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
is hundreds and potable

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.120 
is hundreds and potable
he's<00:06:43.610> just<00:06:43.880> falls<00:06:44.870> apart<00:06:45.020> he's<00:06:45.350> posed<00:06:45.560> so<00:06:45.889> I'm

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:46.130 
he's just falls apart he's posed so I'm

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.420 
he's just falls apart he's posed so I'm
probably<00:06:46.610> gonna<00:06:46.820> redesign<00:06:47.180> him<00:06:47.479> but<00:06:48.370> when<00:06:49.370> you

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
probably gonna redesign him but when you

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.770 
probably gonna redesign him but when you
just<00:06:49.580> have<00:06:49.729> standing<00:06:50.180> there<00:06:50.360> and<00:06:50.540> you<00:06:50.630> have

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
just have standing there and you have

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.140 
just have standing there and you have
you<00:06:51.470> know<00:06:51.560> these<00:06:51.680> guys<00:06:51.889> sort<00:06:52.190> of<00:06:52.310> up<00:06:52.940> there

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
you know these guys sort of up there
