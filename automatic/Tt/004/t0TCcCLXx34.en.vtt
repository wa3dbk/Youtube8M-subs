00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.780
 our monster generator that if not 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.340
 You have seen the video I am going to put here 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.950

 head of the monolith by the link and you 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.420
 they click tele - click the monkey head 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.760
 there there exactly there and 'he wants to see the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 monster generator and good command of 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.420
 new many many thanks to them 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.670
 require subscribers that without them 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.750
 we would be nothing and good band here them 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.480
 I leave with the tutorial 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.840
 and having bands are already here as 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.540
 can see chicken is the same as it is 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.920
 back right now the man but this 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.750
 is what they are going to do to make them leave 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.730
 giving an idea of how it is that does not 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.530
 Please heed is one thing 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.170
 I built but do not listen to him because 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.790
 this generator will never use it but 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.980
 the closest I stayed so good 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.290
 The fact is that this is what they are going to do 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.130
 van gogh is going to have to make a 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.530
 square a square like this a square and 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.010
 for example these waters the walkie tal 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.349
 so that they see what wave 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.250
 here everything is done and as 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.200
 can see 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.200
 I already have my hot springs 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.800
 It's ok 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:01.230
 wow this is so good you'll have to 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.319
 make a cross a cross band as well as 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.680
 Look at it now, a 9 x 9 cross if they are 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:12.870
 find areas of thousand squares are 1 2 3 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.700
 4 5 6 7 8 and the wall and 9 that's why I say 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.250
 once then they will know what to do 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.239
 one of 9 a cross of 9 x 9 in each 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.489
 corner 9 for her and 9 for there and 9 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.170
 there and 9 there will have 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.600
 to do 3 space as you can see 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.310
 three of space and two of high by 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.290
 stay high band good because 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.330
 the monsters are going to appear 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.640
 in these areas where I am here and 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.799
 there is water there and then as the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.930
 samples are stupid are going to fall already 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.239
 the time the water falls, the water 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.280
 he's going to take them to not going to 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.840
 throw then after in a cube for 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.629
 example an example with that cube 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.579
 assuming that the two are going to fall and 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.170
 the water will carry them and 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.510
 he's going to tolerate it 's almost meter read me 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.519
 also but good and another thing very 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.999
 Important to send should not be 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.879
 lit up for nothing at all the more 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:06.409
 dark the darkest much better 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.239
 I enlightened here so that they would see well 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.129
 but good among less illuminated a lot 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.079
 better band I tell you not until the banking 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.419
 social this is something that I had done 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:17.060
 a little road I never lie that I have 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.650
 done as you can see over there this must 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.370
 be well well lit all right 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.500
 illuminated 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.510
 good the case is this bands have to 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.300
 be well lit forgive well 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.280
 dark everything dark well of helmet once 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.919
 that already have their children of 9 x 9 as 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.990
 You can see and 2 wide as that 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.760
 of 2 that tall friends since they 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.410
 I say that when the monsters fall 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.169
 is what is going to prevent our 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.490
 jump jump on like imbeciles then 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.830
 the only thing they are going to have to do is 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.229
 do this 9 x 9 and then do a 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.949
 square a square of 3 x 3 and they are given 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.080
 account 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 and that square goes to 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:54.800
 throw water and nothing else with their buckets 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.860
 of water they put it here and they put a 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.410
 then they can give him another and on average and they give 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.389
 account the water does not fall or you get up 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.410
 here but it does not fall down anymore that's the 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:08.449
 trick and here they put it last and it's 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.000
 the water currents is already perfect 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.190
 everything and that's how they have their 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.169
 generator one are pulling and do not 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.669
 they can do it from any material 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.870
 that you want if you do not want 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.860
 put wizard we are you 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.430
 putting pebble can you put this 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.530
 what is called iron can you put 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.939
 diamond to anything that you 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.490
 they want us we made him guitar 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:34.030
 because this made us easy and remember 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.610
 it has to be very very well dark everything 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.379
 there is that they are an edition of a game 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.960
 I have when something will show us that 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:44.139
 mini game is going to be a little bridge 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.349
 small bridge over here to break this 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.879
 to see how it should be and how 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.439
 Well, something like that must be left 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:54.129
 obviously much darker but 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:58.330
 well these fire these here 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:01.199
 rolling then turn off to try to 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.199
 ignore everything 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.840
 and see 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.860
 what it is that fails us how is 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.319
 failing here 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.509
 and what band is that far as you can see 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:15.300
 still much more light because down there 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.949
 I have a lot of light I get a lot of light and 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.569
 around here also studying those that do not 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:20.039
 you know what but good you have to 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.259
 be all very dark band is already going 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.819
 they know everything very dark and its beach 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.280
 to have a good sample generator 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.840
 and put in hard and alone are going to 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.370
 appear the monsters these us 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.870
 they will be appearing unlimitedly 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.150
 I say they are never ending in that 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.250
 dawn appear obviously is in the 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.719
 difficult they will appreciate much more there 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.340
 times when you are going to be falling 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.860
 so crazy there are times when they go to 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.620
 be here for 10 minutes so 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.930
 do not despair evil 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.910
 and well that's all that's all there 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.590
 they have to do their wall also has 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.199
 that being four here we did it 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.880
 picture as you can see one there no longer 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:58.580
 I have torches and nothing to buy 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.900
 coal not good but they are 1 2 3 and 4 and 4 and 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.540
 the wall milestones but it's going to be 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.510
 just there they were giving 4 to the 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:11.230
 height of 4 in height remember the 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:14.290
 crosses are 9 x 9 9 times 9 times 9 times 9 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:17.920
 and that's all that easy 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:20.470
 9 there and there and that's it 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.490
 they go to their little box of 3 by 3 good 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.370
 then I hope you liked it 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.470
