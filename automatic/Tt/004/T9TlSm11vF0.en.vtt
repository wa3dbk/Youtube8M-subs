00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
latest version from the internet it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.590 
latest version from the internet it
shows<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.520> on<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> side<00:02:10.940> after<00:02:11.060> burner<00:02:11.360> which

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
shows you on the side after burner which

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.350 
shows you on the side after burner which
is<00:02:11.720> there<00:02:11.930> very<00:02:12.920> easy<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.489> use<00:02:13.670> overclocking

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
is there very easy to use overclocking

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.300 
is there very easy to use overclocking
tool<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:15.380> we<00:02:15.530> have<00:02:15.680> a<00:02:15.950> DVI<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.610> VGA<00:02:17.390> adapter

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
then we have another dual molex to 6-pin

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.010 
then we have another dual molex to 6-pin
GPU<00:02:22.819> cable<00:02:23.830> adapter<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.880> here<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:26.870> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
GPU cable adapter and here we have the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.580 
GPU itself here it is the gtx 560 Twin
Frozr<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.840> looks<00:02:41.989> like<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.260> tape<00:02:42.440> is

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
Frozr and it looks like the tape is

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:51.330 
Frozr and it looks like the tape is
gonna<00:02:42.739> do<00:02:42.890> some<00:02:43.069> trouble<00:02:43.400> already

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.380 

alright<00:02:52.340> so<00:02:52.550> it's<00:02:52.670> got<00:02:52.790> some<00:02:52.819> plastic<00:02:53.120> wrap

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
alright so it's got some plastic wrap

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.509 
alright so it's got some plastic wrap
all<00:02:53.720> over<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.080> cooler<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:54.769> I'm<00:02:54.830> go<00:02:54.950> ahead<00:02:55.100> and

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
all over the cooler so I'm go ahead and

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.309 
all over the cooler so I'm go ahead and
take<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.000> off<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:59.420> is<00:02:59.660> a<00:02:59.690> pretty<00:03:00.019> insane

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
take that off this is a pretty insane

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.840 
take that off this is a pretty insane
looking<00:03:00.620> video<00:03:00.860> card<00:03:01.130> there<00:03:01.519> are<00:03:01.640> some

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
looking video card there are some

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.670 
looking video card there are some
crazier<00:03:02.510> looking<00:03:02.780> ones<00:03:02.930> out<00:03:03.080> there<00:03:03.290> but<00:03:03.500> this

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
crazier looking ones out there but this

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.520 
crazier looking ones out there but this
one<00:03:03.830> is<00:03:03.980> actually<00:03:04.130> on<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:05.810> upper<00:03:06.080> end<00:03:06.260> of

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
one is actually on the upper end of

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.030 
one is actually on the upper end of
crazy<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.290> seems<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.620> most<00:03:09.769> of<00:03:09.920> the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
crazy so it seems like most of the

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.949 
crazy so it seems like most of the
plastic<00:03:10.760> wrapping<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.299> off<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:11.630> here's<00:03:11.810> the

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
plastic wrapping is off so here's the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.020 
plastic wrapping is off so here's the
GPU<00:03:12.290> itself<00:03:12.680> here's<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.010> twin<00:03:13.220> frozen<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.760> the

there are two fans on the cooler here
you<00:03:19.070> can<00:03:19.190> see<00:03:19.310> some<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.700> fairly<00:03:20.540> thick

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
you can see some of the fairly thick

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.849 
you can see some of the fairly thick
heat<00:03:20.989> pipes<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.650> GPU<00:03:22.280> itself<00:03:22.609> is<00:03:22.760> down<00:03:22.970> there

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
heat pipes the GPU itself is down there

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.500 
heat pipes the GPU itself is down there
seems<00:03:24.859> like<00:03:25.010> there's<00:03:25.190> also<00:03:25.549> some<00:03:25.940> eat<00:03:26.090> sinks

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510

many the 560 s you could run it once I'm

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
I'm not too sure but I actually might

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.610 
I'm not too sure but I actually might

see there's a whole bunch of leftover
cables<00:05:05.080> should<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:05.830> gotten<00:05:05.980> a<00:05:06.100> modular

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
cables should have gotten a modular

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.880 
cables should have gotten a modular
power<00:05:06.730> supply<00:05:07.210> but<00:05:07.480> I<00:05:07.780> probably<00:05:08.320> will<00:05:08.620> in<00:05:08.800> the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
power supply but I probably will in the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.740 
power supply but I probably will in the
future<00:05:09.010> but<00:05:09.310> for<00:05:09.370> now<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.640> will<00:05:09.880> try<00:05:10.180> my<00:05:10.210> best<00:05:10.480> to

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
future but for now I will try my best to

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.010 
future but for now I will try my best to
work<00:05:11.200> with<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:11.530> cable<00:05:12.490> management<00:05:12.670> stuff<00:05:13.150> so

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
work with the cable management stuff so

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.920 
work with the cable management stuff so
that's<00:05:14.110> it<00:05:14.320> with<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:14.470> video<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:15.750> go<00:05:16.750> ahead

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
that's it with the video and go ahead

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.210 
that's it with the video and go ahead
and<00:05:17.140> end<00:05:17.440> this<00:05:17.560> so<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:17.770> could<00:05:17.830> go<00:05:17.980> ahead<00:05:18.100> and

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
and end this so I could go ahead and

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.900 
and end this so I could go ahead and
start<00:05:18.550> putting<00:05:19.360> everything<00:05:19.570> together
