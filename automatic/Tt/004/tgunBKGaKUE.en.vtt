00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
okay we have our whole delay you can see

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:45.199 
okay we have our whole delay you can see
the<00:02:40.319> speed<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.219> altitude<00:02:44.030> exchanging<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the speed and altitude exchanging the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.569 
the speed and altitude exchanging the
art<00:02:45.359> rate<00:02:45.629> is<00:02:45.749> not<00:02:45.870> changing<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.409> much<00:02:49.579> I'm

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
art rate is not changing that much I'm

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.339 
art rate is not changing that much I'm
going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.849> shorten<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.540> order<00:02:51.689> to<00:02:52.019> match

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
going to shorten this in order to match

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.089 
going to shorten this in order to match
the<00:02:54.019> video<00:02:55.019> on<00:02:55.109> the<00:02:55.230> back

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.190 

so<00:03:00.260> right<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:01.409> we<00:03:01.469> need<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:03.049> remove<00:03:04.049> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
so right now we need to remove the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.929 
so right now we need to remove the
background<00:03:04.379> on<00:03:04.739> this<00:03:04.950> one<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.769> this<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:07.980> this

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
background on this one so this is this

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.970 
background on this one so this is this
is<00:03:08.999> called<00:03:09.239> chroma<00:03:09.719> key<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.230> chroma<00:03:10.889> key

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
is called chroma key the chroma key

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.270 
is called chroma key the chroma key
feature<00:03:11.280> is<00:03:11.849> removing<00:03:12.689> background<00:03:13.560> color<00:03:13.799> and

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
feature is removing background color and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.300 
feature is removing background color and
usually<00:03:14.670> it's<00:03:14.999> green<00:03:15.500> it's<00:03:16.500> used<00:03:16.769> on<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
usually it's green it's used on the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.679 
usually it's green it's used on the
special<00:03:18.120> effects<00:03:18.889> you<00:03:19.889> might<00:03:20.670> have<00:03:20.790> seen<00:03:21.000> some

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:21.689 
special effects you might have seen some

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.440 
special effects you might have seen some
special<00:03:22.049> effects<00:03:22.519> some<00:03:23.519> actors<00:03:23.849> doing<00:03:24.060> some

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
special effects some actors doing some

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.360 
special effects some actors doing some
some<00:03:25.379> acting<00:03:25.889> with<00:03:26.639> a<00:03:26.669> green<00:03:27.120> background<00:03:27.540> and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
some acting with a green background and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
some acting with a green background and
basically<00:03:29.370> this<00:03:30.180> is<00:03:30.359> about<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.719> same<00:03:30.900> except

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
basically this is about the same except

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.990 
basically this is about the same except
in<00:03:31.469> this<00:03:31.620> case<00:03:31.889> we're<00:03:32.340> going<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.579> remove<00:03:32.849> it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
in this case we're going to remove it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.050 
in this case we're going to remove it
and<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.019> movies<00:03:34.469> they<00:03:34.980> add<00:03:35.189> things<00:03:35.849> they

and on the movies they add things they

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.140 
and on the movies they add things they

you can see I have green digits here if
I<00:04:39.240> set<00:04:39.539> this<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.990> too<00:04:40.229> much<00:04:40.409> they<00:04:40.680> will<00:04:40.860> start

we go back to the scene and we have our

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:59.360 
we go back to the scene and we have our
our<00:04:53.950> software<00:04:54.720> with

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
our overlay and with the chroma key it's

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.140 
our overlay and with the chroma key it's
very<00:05:04.740> very<00:05:04.980> simple<00:05:06.890> it's<00:05:07.890> not<00:05:08.370> hard<00:05:08.820> at<00:05:09.030> all

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
very very simple it's not hard at all

with this software it's very very very
easy<00:05:12.330> to<00:05:12.510> do<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.870> it's<00:05:13.800> free<00:05:14.070> that's<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.730> best

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
easy to do and it's free that's the best

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.570 
easy to do and it's free that's the best
part<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.920> once<00:05:16.920> again<00:05:17.190> I'm<00:05:17.340> going<00:05:17.490> to

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
part of it once again I'm going to

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.900 
part of it once again I'm going to
adjust<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.180> as<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:19.080> say<00:05:19.290> this<00:05:19.770> will<00:05:20.040> be<00:05:20.280> my

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
adjust this as I say this will be my

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.510 
adjust this as I say this will be my
playback<00:05:21.510> I<00:05:21.840> want<00:05:22.170> it<00:05:22.290> to<00:05:22.470> do<00:05:22.680> playback<00:05:23.370> from

playback I want it to do playback from

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.270 
playback I want it to do playback from
here<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.880> here<00:05:24.060> so<00:05:24.840> in<00:05:25.320> order<00:05:25.410> to<00:05:25.560> create<00:05:25.890> the

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
I changed the bitrate to 10,000 to avoid

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.230 
I changed the bitrate to 10,000 to avoid
losing<00:06:13.140> some<00:06:13.350> some<00:06:13.710> of<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:13.920> quality<00:06:14.310> and<00:06:14.490> then

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
losing some some of the quality and then

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.370 
losing some some of the quality and then
just<00:06:15.600> you<00:06:16.050> can<00:06:16.230> choose<00:06:16.440> the<00:06:16.730> file<00:06:17.730> type<00:06:18.380> and

since<00:06:28.260> this<00:06:28.470> software<00:06:29.100> it's<00:06:29.700> the<00:06:30.000> only<00:06:30.150> let's

since this software it's the only let's

since this software it's the only let's

say bad thing it's not a bad thing

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.060 
say bad thing it's not a bad thing
because<00:06:32.880> it<00:06:33.300> works<00:06:34.610> it<00:06:35.610> could<00:06:35.850> be<00:06:36.000> very<00:06:36.330> very

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
because it works it could be very very

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.030 
because it works it could be very very
very<00:06:38.070> very<00:06:38.190> good<00:06:38.580> if<00:06:38.790> it<00:06:38.910> had<00:06:39.710> the<00:06:40.710> graphic

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
very very good if it had the graphic

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.670 
very very good if it had the graphic
card<00:06:41.220> so<00:06:41.460> to<00:06:41.910> do<00:06:42.000> the<00:06:42.120> encoding<00:06:42.450> of<00:06:42.840> the<00:06:45.470> of<00:06:46.470> the

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
card so to do the encoding of the of the

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.560 
card so to do the encoding of the of the
of<00:06:46.980> the<00:06:47.130> videos<00:06:47.430> because<00:06:48.030> right<00:06:48.300> now<00:06:48.420> it's

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
of the videos because right now it's

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.290 
of the videos because right now it's
only<00:06:48.840> using<00:06:49.140> to<00:06:49.260> you<00:06:49.350> and<00:06:49.620> it<00:06:50.250> only<00:06:50.400> uses<00:06:50.730> CPU

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
only using to you and it only uses CPU

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.510 
only using to you and it only uses CPU
so<00:06:51.930> as<00:06:52.200> you<00:06:52.290> can<00:06:52.410> see<00:06:52.530> the<00:06:52.620> frame<00:06:52.830> rate<00:06:53.100> is<00:06:53.460> very

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
so as you can see the frame rate is very

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.830 
so as you can see the frame rate is very
very<00:06:54.000> slow<00:06:54.390> it's<00:06:54.630> 2.6<00:06:55.560> frames<00:06:56.430> per<00:06:56.760> second<00:06:57.210> so

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
very slow it's 2.6 frames per second so

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.660 
very slow it's 2.6 frames per second so
it's<00:06:57.870> rendering<00:06:58.410> at<00:06:59.150> 2.6<00:07:00.150> frames<00:07:00.480> per<00:07:01.200> second

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
it's rendering at 2.6 frames per second

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.450 
it's rendering at 2.6 frames per second
so<00:07:02.670> if<00:07:02.880> one<00:07:03.180> second<00:07:03.690> has<00:07:04.440> 30<00:07:04.800> frames<00:07:05.190> you<00:07:05.430> can

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
so if one second has 30 frames you can

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.340 
so if one second has 30 frames you can
imagine<00:07:05.940> how<00:07:06.060> long<00:07:06.300> that<00:07:06.600> is<00:07:06.810> going<00:07:07.110> to<00:07:07.170> take

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
imagine how long that is going to take

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.720 
imagine how long that is going to take
for<00:07:07.650> instance<00:07:07.980> in<00:07:08.220> 15<00:07:08.880> minutes<00:07:10.100> video<00:07:11.100> it

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730 
for instance in 15 minutes video it

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.410 
for instance in 15 minutes video it
takes<00:07:11.970> quite<00:07:12.180> a<00:07:12.270> while<00:07:13.970> so<00:07:14.970> as<00:07:15.180> you<00:07:15.270> can<00:07:15.360> see

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
takes quite a while so as you can see

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.990 
takes quite a while so as you can see
it's<00:07:15.870> very<00:07:15.900> easy<00:07:16.140> to<00:07:16.560> do<00:07:16.920> an<00:07:17.040> overlay<00:07:17.310> and<00:07:17.700> do<00:07:17.970> a

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
it's very easy to do an overlay and do a

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.850 
it's very easy to do an overlay and do a
chroma<00:07:18.300> key<00:07:18.570> I<00:07:18.750> hope<00:07:19.380> you<00:07:19.470> enjoyed<00:07:19.710> it

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
chroma key I hope you enjoyed it

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.240 
chroma key I hope you enjoyed it
