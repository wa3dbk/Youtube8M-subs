00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.410 
and that one end is going to have this
these<00:04:12.720> two<00:04:12.989> rings<00:04:13.260> on<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.590> tip<00:04:13.799> but<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.269> does

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
these two rings on the tip but so does

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.390 
these two rings on the tip but so does
the<00:04:15.600> other<00:04:15.720> end<00:04:15.959> it<00:04:16.590> doesn't<00:04:16.889> split<00:04:17.100> out<00:04:17.250> it

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
the other end it doesn't split out it

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.690 
the other end it doesn't split out it
isn't<00:04:17.549> why<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:18.090> just<00:04:18.799> has<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.979> same<00:04:20.190> connector

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
isn't why it just has the same connector

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.350 
isn't why it just has the same connector
so<00:04:21.860> very<00:04:22.860> easy<00:04:23.130> one<00:04:23.700> end<00:04:24.380> goes<00:04:25.380> into<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.950> RC<00:04:26.280> 3

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
so very easy one end goes into the RC 3

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.070 
so very easy one end goes into the RC 3
the<00:04:27.690> other<00:04:27.810> end<00:04:28.050> into<00:04:28.169> the<00:04:28.319> center<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:29.460> the<00:04:29.639> ff6

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
the other end into the center of the ff6

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.499 
the other end into the center of the ff6
and<00:04:31.080> now<00:04:32.009> we<00:04:32.069> have<00:04:32.400> on<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.759> side<00:04:32.970> this<00:04:33.270> time

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
and now we have on this side this time

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.119 
and now we have on this side this time
the<00:04:33.870> tap<00:04:34.080> tempo<00:04:35.930> alright<00:04:36.930> if<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.860> are

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:42.020 
the tap tempo alright if you are
recording<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.870> will<00:04:40.050> do<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.319> stop<00:04:40.789> if<00:04:41.789> you<00:04:41.849> are

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
playing back and do the stop holding it

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.439
