oversensitive and yeah then they made

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.469 
oversensitive and yeah then they made
some<00:01:40.430> some<00:01:40.790> changes

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
bit about that partnership look at

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.699 
bit about that partnership look at
battleships<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.209> technology<00:03:04.780> it<00:03:05.379> became

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
battleships and technology it became

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:14.460 
battleships and technology it became
mainstream<00:03:12.690> but<00:03:13.690> actually<00:03:14.019> we<00:03:14.140> took<00:03:14.290> it

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
mainstream but actually we took it

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.559 
mainstream but actually we took it
further<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:15.099> our<00:03:15.310> paddle<00:03:15.790> shifters<00:03:16.209> in

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
further on our paddle shifters in

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.330 
further on our paddle shifters in
infinity<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.650> material<00:03:18.099> is<00:03:18.220> from

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
infinity the material is from

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.580 
infinity the material is from
lightweight<00:03:18.849> magnesium<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:20.110> then<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.380> team

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
lightweight magnesium so then the team

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.410 
lightweight magnesium so then the team
came<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.980> us<00:03:21.069> and<00:03:21.280> said<00:03:21.370> how<00:03:21.610> can<00:03:21.640> we<00:03:21.849> apply

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
came to us and said how can we apply

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.930 
came to us and said how can we apply
that<00:03:22.510> on<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.620> car<00:03:23.799> that's<00:03:24.099> gold<00:03:24.459> once<00:03:24.730> that

it's just a stunt writers trying to
connect<00:04:56.780> what<00:04:57.140> are<00:04:57.200> your<00:04:57.290> thoughts<00:04:57.500> on<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.830> I

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
connect what are your thoughts on that I

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.130 
connect what are your thoughts on that I
think<00:04:58.400> it's<00:04:58.669> fair<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:59.060> would<00:04:59.270> be<00:04:59.450> skeptical<00:04:59.900> if

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
think it's fair I would be skeptical if

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.930 
think it's fair I would be skeptical if
I<00:05:00.200> say<00:05:00.380> yes<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:00.590> since<00:05:01.040> it's<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.520> show<00:05:01.700> I

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
I say yes and since it's just a show I

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.400 
I say yes and since it's just a show I
think<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.240> got<00:05:02.419> to<00:05:02.540> give<00:05:02.630> us<00:05:02.750> some<00:05:02.900> time

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
think you got to give us some time

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.080 
think you got to give us some time
to<00:05:03.560> prove<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:03.919> we<00:05:04.100> had<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.310> give<00:05:04.490> time<00:05:04.730> to<00:05:04.760> prove

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
to prove it we had to give time to prove

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.580 
to prove it we had to give time to prove
it<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.270> Sebastian<00:05:05.540> he<00:05:06.050> said<00:05:06.200> wait<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.500> minute

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
it to Sebastian he said wait a minute

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:07.650 
it to Sebastian he said wait a minute
you<00:05:06.800> just<00:05:06.890> use

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
you just use

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.470 
you just use
is<00:05:07.930> free<00:05:08.140> right<00:05:08.470> so<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.220> first<00:05:09.520> year<00:05:09.790> we've

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
is free right so the first year we've

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.450 
is free right so the first year we've
done<00:05:10.690> nothing<00:05:11.170> than<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.650> showing<00:05:12.100> him<00:05:12.220> how

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
done nothing than just showing him how

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.940 
done nothing than just showing him how
we<00:05:12.520> develop<00:05:12.970> broadcast<00:05:13.420> and<00:05:14.200> he<00:05:14.410> understands

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
we develop broadcast and he understands

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.010 
we develop broadcast and he understands
it<00:05:15.160> takes<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.460> little<00:05:15.580> longer<00:05:15.730> yeah<00:05:16.420> but<00:05:16.780> at<00:05:16.900> the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
it takes a little longer yeah but at the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.170 
it takes a little longer yeah but at the
same<00:05:17.200> time<00:05:17.440> once<00:05:17.920> he<00:05:18.040> now<00:05:18.280> sees<00:05:18.610> how<00:05:18.970> that

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
same time once he now sees how that

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.510

further<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:22.270> proof<00:05:22.450> is<00:05:22.630> in<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.750> pudding<00:05:23.080> now

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
further the proof is in the pudding now

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.140 
further the proof is in the pudding now
we<00:05:23.380> gotta<00:05:23.620> show<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:24.040> output<00:05:24.190> and<00:05:24.940> it's<00:05:25.090> a

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
we gotta show the output and it's a

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.300 
we gotta show the output and it's a
long-term<00:05:25.390> relationship<00:05:26.110> it's<00:05:26.860> not<00:05:27.010> just

long-term relationship it's not just
