paint<00:04:03.340> sought<00:04:03.549> solace<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:03.970> loads<00:04:04.329> a<00:04:04.450> little

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
paint sought solace this loads a little

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.160 
paint sought solace this loads a little
details<00:04:04.959> are<00:04:05.049> gotta<00:04:05.170> paint<00:04:05.379> on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.910> bodywork

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
details are gotta paint on the bodywork

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.690 
details are gotta paint on the bodywork
and<00:04:08.170> but<00:04:09.840> made<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.870> mock<00:04:11.200> up<00:04:11.379> of<00:04:12.930> mocked<00:04:14.459> I'm<00:04:15.459> not

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
and but made a mock up of mocked I'm not

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.449 
and but made a mock up of mocked I'm not
the<00:04:15.910> front<00:04:16.090> end<00:04:16.389> up<00:04:16.570> not<00:04:17.350> painted<00:04:17.859> not<00:04:18.699> fixed

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
the front end up not painted not fixed

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.460 
the front end up not painted not fixed
so<00:04:21.459> I<00:04:24.450> think<00:04:25.450> he<00:04:25.539> gives<00:04:25.750> some<00:04:26.020> kind<00:04:26.380> of

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
so I think he gives some kind of

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.730 
so I think he gives some kind of
impression<00:04:26.889> of<00:04:27.130> how<00:04:27.340> good<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.729> going<00:04:27.940> so

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740
