 johnny everyone hello today i want 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.240
 post a video about how I installed 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.970
 my leather jacket because when I 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.670
 went shopping i broke it in general 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.830
 hooked on anyone crazy hooks there 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.410
 specifically the same who hang themselves 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.390
 hangers here's the right jacket and it was full 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.250
 confusion what was the matter I was looking for 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.010
 videos on youtube or nothing 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.600
 found such a plan for that 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.269
 moment for me it really helped 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.460
 it may be useful to someone 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.670
 video so do not be alarmed 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.649
 life situation from different therefore so 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.170
 here and soon there will be a video I'll post a video about 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.160
 shopping so wait soon there will be a video 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 about shopping clothes today is a video 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.829
 video about how I restored my 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.350
 leather jacket all 10 which i do i 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.809
 filmed and someone may come in handy 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.940
 let's all all bye for now and why 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 did not happen I tore my jacket 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.660
 huge hole and here's how and so sorry 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.270
 the main thing is still very visible okay there somewhere 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.220
 I was there I donâ€™t know such inside 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.619
 trouble here is such a glue bought 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.810
 for you it is specially suitable for skin 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.880
 for rubber because it is suitable for skin for 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.380
 leatherette for rubber for fabric 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.509
 shoe materials and think should 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.880
 it's okay to just be ordinary glue 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.369
 taken all up a cola can create 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.920
 so I do not know that I get asked 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.650
 I started to steam this stitch on 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.130
 jacket inner lining a couple further 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.990
 will show 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.799
 from the front side I stuck such 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.140
 medical plaster normal recovered 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.220
 neatly and sealed now again 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.380
 with twisting from the inside and I will 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.270
 stick here such a case the same skin 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.479
 which was so internal to me 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.630
 hand looks that side of me here 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.250
 this adhesive taped keeps everything 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.040
 ok not hanging out nothing 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.049
 stretched cube but sticks today 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.170
 what's not scary don't know what will happen to me 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.060
 it seems the score will take a stick 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.939
 Of course at all on the world in terms of tear off 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.580
 this wire is all taken all 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.330
 finally and irrevocably but look 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.840
 what happened 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.209
 I pulled off this patch 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.280
 In principle, normal, but you can see it is clear 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.480
 It stands out that it can be seen that there was a cut 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.019
 and here you can see how you see yes 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:29.239
 this thing is that where it is visible in everything 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:32.750
 that here is a cut here at home to be needle 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.680
 water is considered rather because it is worth 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.650
 chocobo 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.959
 so legs bend a bunch can be seen remake 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.000
 I 'll try nine with a needle but all 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.880
 girls walked and needle all 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.250
 stuck of course calling with him nothing 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.400
 should we see a trace anyway 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.280
 like this blackness in a dozen 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:59.090
 kremlin shoe salamander professional 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.940
 dark brown dark brown now i'm 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.250
 probably not to paint a speck as if 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.079
 it didn't come to all the jackets I'm with this 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.840
 can he not carry it now i can seconds 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.360
 a bunch of paint here so I do not know what 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.340
 paint then show i got an hour i 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.260
 Here are her departments and it is not very clear that 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.900
 around here i have cuts if i know 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.549
 what I know of course, and someone probably hardly 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.489
 Does notice if will keep an eye out 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.120
 Of course he will notice, and in general, in principle, not 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:31.099
 seen in daylight probably will 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 I see it is normal in general I am ok 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:36.639
 I think you can walk 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.639
 principle ok
