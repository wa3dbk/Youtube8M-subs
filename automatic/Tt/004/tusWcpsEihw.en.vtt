00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
we are walking over here I'll say this

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.640 
we are walking over here I'll say this
way<00:02:38.730> I'll<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.570> u-turn<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.200> I'll<00:02:40.290> feed<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
way I'll do a u-turn and I'll feed the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.100 
way I'll do a u-turn and I'll feed the
dog<00:02:40.800> if<00:02:41.010> she<00:02:41.160> catches<00:02:41.370> up<00:02:41.780> we're<00:02:42.780> walking

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
dog if she catches up we're walking

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.500 
dog if she catches up we're walking
along<00:02:43.200> there's<00:02:43.710> something<00:02:43.980> up<00:02:44.100> there

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
along there's something up there

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.650 
along there's something up there
this<00:02:45.510> way<00:02:45.860> I'll<00:02:46.860> do<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> turn<00:02:47.390> feeding<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> dog

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
this way I'll do a turn feeding the dog

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.050 
this way I'll do a turn feeding the dog
out<00:02:48.960> my<00:02:49.110> left<00:02:49.350> leg<00:02:49.590> as<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.950> continue<00:02:50.520> traveling

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
out my left leg as I continue traveling

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.490 
out my left leg as I continue traveling
in<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.360> opposite<00:02:51.750> direction

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
in the opposite direction

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.890 
in the opposite direction
the<00:02:53.070> other<00:02:53.220> one<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.760> use<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.510> called

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the other one I like to use is called

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.430 
the other one I like to use is called
back<00:02:55.790> it's<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.880> quick<00:02:57.120> reverse<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.140> instead<00:02:58.380> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
back it's a quick reverse so instead of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.160 
back it's a quick reverse so instead of
turning<00:02:58.680> around<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.400> end<00:02:59.580> up<00:02:59.930> facing<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
turning around you end up facing the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.540 
turning around you end up facing the
same<00:03:01.320> direction<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:01.830> you're<00:03:02.160> backing<00:03:02.520> up

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
same direction but you're backing up

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.110 
same direction but you're backing up
back<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:07.740> just<00:03:07.770> backing<00:03:08.400> up<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.790> then

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
back that just backing up and then

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.600 
back that just backing up and then
feeding<00:03:09.480> your<00:03:09.570> dog<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.250> other<00:03:11.340> dog<00:03:11.580> was

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
feeding your dog if the other dog was

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.949 
feeding your dog if the other dog was
over<00:03:12.030> there<00:03:12.180> coming<00:03:12.600> my<00:03:12.720> way

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
over there coming my way

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.890
