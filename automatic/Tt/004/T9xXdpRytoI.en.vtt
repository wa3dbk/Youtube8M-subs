00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.060
 the french if missy five since 2006 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.390
 working on the site art project nice ass and 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.770
 and now the game came out and it became clear 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.650
 what 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.140
 art project of the French turned and here 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.239
 the game was strange if not to say 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.010
 that the game did not work oh let's do for 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.379
 I started to explain what is not 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.660
 the very beginning of the game you show that you 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.910
 protagonist girl lucy somewhere 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.190
 run then you fall somewhere when 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.989
 near flies incomprehensible reddish 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.989
 shaggy like frozen blood 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.350
 substance and find yourself in a very 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.170
 strange place is a maze such 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.600
 conditionally black and white labyrinth in which 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.520
 very strange game of light very strange 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.130
 arrangement of such brick prominent 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.020
 items in general is needed once 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.240
 see the good you are now on screen this 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.540
 see it so conformable sur which 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.520
 must turn your mind and understand 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.799
 what to do with it further because 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.750
 essentially nothing but these strange 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.350
 architecture and strange light 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.780
 items 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.780
 Unisoft probably what not 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.220
 yes there is some kind of gameplay basis lucy 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.690
 constantly moving so the maze to her 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.170
 need to move from room to room 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.890
 from corridor corridor follow 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.010
 luminous beacons 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.680
 jump from brick to brick platform on 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.580
 the platform is formally not it 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.130
 platformer 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.530
 but there are no items here except 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.479
 moving from the beginning to the end is not here 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.550
 there are no enemies here 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.649
 there are no serious puzzles 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.160
 serious tasks and there is only you 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.900
 strange architectural space and 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.750
 the need to move from point a to 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.830
 point b at first of course done 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.990
 the work is impressive 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.630
 architecture is really very unusual 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.130
 the track really plays very strange 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.550
 in some places in order to pass 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.860
 from the beginning to the end of the level you need to constantly 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.230
 watch out for light streams and not 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.600
 lose a point of light on fitting because 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.010
 chok plump moves forward to kiss 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.290
 need to move after him without letting him 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.239
 out of sight otherwise you will be pitch 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.920
 the dark and will not know where you 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.630
 generally need to move the earth 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.400
 roll back to previous and 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.080
 either move from time to time 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.030
 sticking the walls when you donâ€™t 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.800
 understand that you buried the wall well 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.840
 because there is no light at all around you the same 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.310
 not in reality you will be around dark 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.730
 you need to move up to the moment when 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:06.040
 dalika somewhere there will be some kind of environment 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:08.560
 and here it turns out a strange thing with 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.930
 one side do not care, this is an art project 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.909
 who could claim to level 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.440
 games being created let's say the same new member 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.660
 but when you create 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.489
 art project and a very simple game 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.860
 mechanics it is important that this game 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.849
 the mechanics were polished to shine 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.650
 madness of beauty 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.360
 there should be beautiful and movement 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.159
 here should be nice and moving 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.379
 from point a to point b here should be 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.900
 nice and and logical and interacting with 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.940
 gaming space and that's it just 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.190
 here it is down the ace unfortunately not 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.470
 movements are quite sharp jump 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.510
 platform to platform is not very convenient and 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.519
 the edges catching them from you in a wave and not 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.920
 pulls you forward step by step you 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.569
 despise the need for exactly 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.400
 you run past these platforms you 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.260
 push through need 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.670
 put up with stiff motions not 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.739
 where to catch the next moment 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.989
 jump and the only moment which 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.030
 sometimes in this game it sets the rhythm 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.190
 the need to adapt to breathing 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.109
 lucy when lucy goes running 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.180
 shiftom point appears that 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.889
 pulsates a certain conditioned so breath 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.389
 you need to click on the button to 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.310
 there is a breath in the game 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.290
 a few moments of which this one 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.239
 element is used as the base element 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.859
 gameplay and now at this moment do not wait 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.169
 becomes an interesting game but it 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.609
 occurs so rarely that the network 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.729
 moment can be counted literally by 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.729
 fingers 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.630
 the rest of the time they wait it 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.630
 pointless movement from point a to 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.710
 point b and pleasure in all visual 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.080
 near which game are you really 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.940
 outstanding very unusual very 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.919
 memorable it ends in 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.290
 minutes 20 30 gr and then begin 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.940
 solid repetitions and even when the game 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:50.120
 trying to change his visual style 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.030
 this is not impressive anymore 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.639
 that all the time while you play you 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.650
 do you understand how amazing the game is with 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.229
 the plot could be created in these 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.039
 scenery that these scenery 1 or 2 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.440
 even portal 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.970
 Well, it would seem more or less 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.889
 monotonous but what a terrific 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.180
 the gameplay on this was some 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.160
 sentimental what a touching 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.770
 the story was built in the first and second 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.780
 port and the same could be done in 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.639
 The scenery is nice ass moreover the local 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.910
 scenery they are in something more interesting and 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.740
 more unusual than the scenery portal but here 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.060
 no one added stories no one 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.070
 thought about what you can think of 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.960
 interesting plot no one bothered 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.490
 that the character might somehow be unusual 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.830
 interact with space and 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.599
 change it all this down ace to 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.820
 Unfortunately, no, I occasionally caught myself 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.680
 on the idea that if it was before the scenery 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.750
 nice ass create a game with a storyline 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.550
 film cube the same horror movie yes when 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.500
 people find themselves inside the incomprehensible 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.870
 inverted space which 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:48.039
 interacts with the person on his 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.990
 law so here's a nice ass scenery 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.180
 perfect playing environment 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.490
 cube on unfortunately there is no plot 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.320
 there is no hint of sodium choir 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.300
 In principle, the plot you can think of 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.940
 imagine what happened to lucy 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.910
 where she turned out why she moves 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.979
 forward what I need Well, how would 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.440
 turn on the fantasy and you yourself something 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.510
 think up developers not like this not 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.919
 cared it insanely hurt because 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.830
 Nah, this is a decoration which you can 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.960
 make an amazing storyline game on to 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.669
 Unfortunately, this game did not work my 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.669
 score 6 points
