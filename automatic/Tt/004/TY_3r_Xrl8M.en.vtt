00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.079
 youtube is a bit in a channel where 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.179
 other children 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.340
 from utrecht and kon region and thermal 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.190
 making it sporty and then it became one 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.909
 jury and well shows and then there is 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.780
 and winner so here has me 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.729
 inspired to own a little something 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.570
 logically checked neck and close 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:50.040
 drink 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.800
 that life is easier 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.250
 make today for you and 12 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.679
 live action randall number after this 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.350
 starting my first life hack is that 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:03.899
 if you go for another investigation or 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.789
 you are short for work 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.410
 all white at the bottom of the page 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:09.450
 do collars or maybe in this 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.200
 random in between so that we do not return 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.270
 stands out and well just being able to write 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.210
 and then make it white so that it doesn't 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
 you notice that there are standing there but imagine 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.880
 now and then if your teacher is the jack 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.289
 I am so upset hey then yes 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.909
 Then you state it could be there 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.320
 but actually your niche is too little me 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.299
 do you go to not for the if 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.860
 your 2000 then becomes two thousand words 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.350
 but then it was always very small 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.090
 bit on but I mean if you just 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.890
 tennis to have a green note 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.439
 no relationship for the green 100 to be 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.729
 number of nice types of pÃ¢tÃ© and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.759
 then 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.409
 j okay is almost there again 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.450
 not because it's only just spring and me 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.649
 mean come on with the bad weather 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.329
 let's all just believe me 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.460
 that it is already almost as often a miss 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.560
 go get ice cream so that you already do 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.500
 music then if you choose two then 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.670
 they close me two for two 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.619
 balls on top of each other and they are real 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.420
 half and of course 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.219
 so what you can do is first just one 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.130
 receipt that just nice pick up 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.049
 click and then after that you have finished 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.380
 say iphoto you get another sign 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:14.880
 that he has much more ice than if you just 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.980
 it so a little bit on each other there area 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.810
 but third live i is if you like your perfume 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.600
 and want to leave it all day 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.650
 let it sit well and put on my perfume 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.290
 the end of the green 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.489
 what you no longer smell so do one 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.579
 bit of sinen on your wrists and on this 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.709
 the place where you just do the profile 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.350
 and you talk to your person there 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.700
 across 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.680
 and so remains much longer 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.410
 because due to vaseline it's really in your skin 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 this draws that hands like you 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.770
 maybe i know i'm something very bad 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.080
 good for my nails 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.090
 they are really only a wonderfull 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.390
 I really want to let you go 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.250
 also pay more attention to monti je 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.380
 it is not super good I am not very 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.660
 very well kept listen this is not 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.090
 I mind every time I spree youtube 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.220
 so you have that any milgen but 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.380
 just a second evening as really very 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.210
 long youtube will watch then I say 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.480
 I'm going to file and I will do well hazard 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.670
 on and then I can do how the stalls on 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.150
 And then they are getting better 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.680
 actually so it works pretty well and if 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.200
 You normally just have all your nails 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.940
 well we love this in of course 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.830
 not entirely relevant to you but that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.960
 mine is not yet another tip 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.480
 for those nails my nails that sermon there 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.980
 constantly off and so if you don't want that 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.920
 You can avoid it at the top 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.360
 do a little nail women or just 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.000
 normal basis 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.220
 coach and then only to the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.080
 top final and then low for 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.370
 whole nail so that the top final 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.290
 extra hard he is crazy number 6 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.570
 my crusts always get tangled 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.100
 really not that annoying and carpentry 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.830
 mourned schers first 5 minutes 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.010
 before you talk the time button so if 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.750
 if you just kill them , your feather will come 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.280
 then a hair clip and John 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.170
 crisis 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.820
 and when you get out I have to you can 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.650
 you just have to order now without five minutes 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.420
 being busy with out of the way languages 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.810
 I still have this tip what you often hear 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.580
 but I often use this myself 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.990
 I thought hey I 'm going to share with you 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.090
 you will all know the duration 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.109
 is lipscrub from lush 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.520
 and yes it is super good and so on 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.610
 I really don't have that for 10 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.900
 name a little jar and do it like 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.810
 you just get normal from your clothes 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.689
 just baking paper with you just like that 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.269
 about you 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.099
 and then you just have to have one 

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:34.849
 bit with some texture in that little one 

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.860
 to be 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:38.149
 and then your things just stick 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.199
 in your clothes 

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:42.110
 it along that it might not be here 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.449
 tasty but if it just form it 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.099
 something is what you were already doing laundry 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.479
 enough for your water bottle there 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:51.019
 sit with you that little boy at the 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:54.439
 top if I can read you achieve 

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:56.119
 then your dry lips go away too 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.909
 names quite dry lips and last 

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:01.369
 time and yes this helps quite a lot 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:03.199
 so maybe that also I love you 

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:05.179
 very fond of candles now but I had them 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.459
 fast but not super fast but 

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:10.249
 relatively fast so if I save that or 

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:11.959
 then I just have a lid 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:15.229
 with each others and if you have no extra 

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:16.939
 you just have to put it on plate or something 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.759
 when you allow me to throw something on 

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:21.800
 hare from the lid that comes with it 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.389
 if no air is added, then it goes 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.800
 not so dirty your room smell like it 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.869
 look nice and next to that I'll go 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.129
 candle was not too bad because trucks then 

00:05:26.869 --> 00:05:30.439
 is not lost 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.849
 live act number 9 and I love it very much 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.649
 but if I have anything else it is eye shadow 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.169
 more intense monitoring that I am quite nice 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:38.689
 that is very metallic 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.199
 just very flashy then I make 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.459
 my brush a bit wet and settle with 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:46.369
 water by madam 

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.599
 the ditch use your saliva test and 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.699
 it a good it just in you 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.979
 eye shadow 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:54.739
 slide it over you too and you have 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.219
 gradual intense if go now so that is 

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:57.050
 nice 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:59.749
 I recently turned on the oriental with pale 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.059
 tampered with you but engage with you 

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:03.829
 buoys and to work the way you 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:06.979
 just use a stylus and water-resistant 

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:08.989
 and with this I just go over it 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.059
 piece one and make sure it's in the right 

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:12.139
 Color now I'm lucky that my our 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:13.459
 black loading 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:16.909
 so there will just be a black marker 

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:18.199
 so don't use my pink us 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:20.689
 you just got a black marker 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.699
 used but also in Belgium there 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:25.849
 also came after me and last tip 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:27.709
 if you match eyelashes because I want to be there 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.659
 you don't have to make a lot extra 

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:32.119
 Layers enable what will it be 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:34.009
 just a group smuggle but do one 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:36.800
 Layer me sheep trailer very small 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.280
 little baby powder and also go 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.900
 again 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.370
 weather I am also just normal 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.870
 use powder but baby powder 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.970
 finer for that 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.580
 and you just go a layer sorry you 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.460
 your eyelashes you now again stories a lot 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:54.050
 thicker so that's super cool and then the 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:55.760
 very last I poured when I drink 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.470
 it all went in all directions and so on 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.940
 but i was a late on it is on 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.990
 so watching it and I hope not against you 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.370
 so far behind and then I thought 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.660
 this very smart 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.700
 So here you see the picture of it 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.560
 place for your drink with this piece 

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.000
 you have to go up and down 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.710
 actually keep up the hole but 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.870
 good as stupid as you are wrong with you 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.060
 but it works now so that 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.190
 is nice that fish video again I hope 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.470
 that you now liked a bit 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:26.570
 make these lifehacks in it seemed to me 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.970
 very peter don't forget it 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.290

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.620
