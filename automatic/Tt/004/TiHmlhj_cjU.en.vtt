00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.879
 i 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.210
 one of the things that I would recommend 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.060
 is to use the bible more to pray 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.310
 the problem with us that we 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.619
 Sometimes we seem like this husband who 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.419
 get up in the morning says good day my 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.420
 love how you slept today you have good 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.070
 day until the morning good morning after my 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
 love like falling asleep today that has good 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.240
 day until then and so then we 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.060
 we come before sir on the same thing 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.730
 when one goes to writing and one now 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.220
 with the writing suddenly the prayer 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.520
 it gets very rich if you go to 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.270
 Psalm 1 and it says that I'm going to use the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.270
 Psalm 1 today 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.430

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.650

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.750
 to do it because yes no 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.970
 I have discovered myself especially in this 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.990

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.990

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.370

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.670
 this 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.040
 that bears fruit in its time and its leaf 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.480
 everything that he does will not prosper 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.000
 new sir I want to be a person 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.880
 fruitful I want but that the psalm 1 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.370
 and then you continue with all the psalms and 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.560
 is going to give you a lot of ideas to pray 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.260
 in a different way and it will enrich 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.510
 long duration 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.350
 that would be a first one that you do not already 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.690
 when you are tired 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.670
 and two that you try to convert the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.640
 writing in part of your prayer life 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.260
 let it be a conversation with God what 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.980
 he tells you in his word he follows 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.980
