00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
trying to make this as realistic as

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.810 
trying to make this as realistic as
possible<00:02:10.240> I'm<00:02:10.869> still<00:02:11.170> in<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.410> trade<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.980> have<00:02:12.790> a

profit target a little bit lower and
currently<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.900> trades<00:02:17.170> up<00:02:17.350> around<00:02:17.740> three

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
currently the trades up around three

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.310 
currently the trades up around three
times<00:02:18.340> when<00:02:18.610> I've<00:02:18.700> risked<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.050> short

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
times when I've risked to take the short

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.620 
times when I've risked to take the short
position<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.820> want<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.060> point<00:02:22.300> something

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
position I just want to point something

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.180 
position I just want to point something
out<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.700> 240<00:02:24.700> minute<00:02:25.000> chart

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
out on the 240 minute chart

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.220 
out on the 240 minute chart
it<00:02:27.190> was<00:02:27.310> actually<00:02:27.700> in<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.940> lovely<00:02:28.450> 240<00:02:28.990> minute

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
it was actually in a lovely 240 minute

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.520 
it was actually in a lovely 240 minute
pinbar<00:02:29.590> there<00:02:29.890> an<00:02:30.100> inside<00:02:30.850> bar<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:32.380> can

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
pinbar there an inside bar and you can

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.310 
pinbar there an inside bar and you can
see<00:02:32.710> this<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> setup<00:02:33.490> on<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.930> one<00:02:35.110> hour

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
see this is the setup on the one hour

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.440 
see this is the setup on the one hour
but<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.980> know<00:02:36.070> you<00:02:36.130> can<00:02:36.340> see<00:02:36.610> it's<00:02:36.790> much

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
but you know you can see it's much

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.420 
but you know you can see it's much
clearer<00:02:37.840> on<00:02:38.050> the<00:02:38.170> 240<00:02:38.680> minute<00:02:38.950> chart<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.340> we

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
clearer on the 240 minute chart so we

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.020 
clearer on the 240 minute chart so we
had<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.790> pin<00:02:40.540> bars<00:02:40.780> almost<00:02:41.560> inside<00:02:42.310> actually

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
had to pin bars almost inside actually

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.570 
had to pin bars almost inside actually
they<00:02:43.180> are<00:02:43.330> inside<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:44.050> green<00:02:44.950> candle<00:02:45.460> and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
they are inside that green candle and

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.280 
they are inside that green candle and
this<00:02:45.910> one's<00:02:46.150> inside<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.690> red<00:02:46.870> so<00:02:46.990> we<00:02:47.020> had<00:02:47.170> like

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
this one's inside the red so we had like

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.770 
this one's inside the red so we had like
a<00:02:47.350> whining<00:02:47.710> spring<00:02:48.430> pattern<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.060> then<00:02:49.750> a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
a whining spring pattern and then a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.680 
a whining spring pattern and then a
capitulation<00:02:50.590> lower<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:52.060> direction<00:02:52.450> of

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
capitulation lower in the direction of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.110 
capitulation lower in the direction of
the<00:02:52.780> trend<00:02:52.990> I<00:02:53.290> really<00:02:53.860> love<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.190> take<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.730> pin

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
the trend I really love to take the pin
