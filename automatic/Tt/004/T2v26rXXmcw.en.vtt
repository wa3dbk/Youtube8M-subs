00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 st unlike old boilers here 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.350
 solid fire goes well I will start very 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.920
 tightly 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.429
 Now it will light up and the second one 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.429
 burner 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.720
 it burned itself 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.720
 smash for 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.630
 the burner itself as we see the burners too 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.849
 have changed now they go completely 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.040
 metal case everything is closed 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.420
 no smell worth blowing fan 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.000
 blown through here these mines you will drown 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.580
 auto 1 2 in the boiler furnace in the smell of 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 waste oil which is water in 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.750
 the result of heating 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.500
 the toastmaster evaporates then the juice all goes away 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.140
 boiler room will not smell out 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.619
 us left that you air valve and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:01.110
 pressure regulator all sage closing 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:01.110
 boiler lead with burner 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.970
 everything 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.970
 turn on the herringbone to grow up there 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:27.180
 the word forsooy appoints is warming up 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.180
 the burner will now light up 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.350
 hand made successfully 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.350
 without complaints 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.830
 shutting down 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.350
 This boiler will go city Chelyabinsk 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.880
 heat a technical station 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.360
 service area of â€‹â€‹200 square 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.360
 meters 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.820
 now show off 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.149
 but don't need to let them up 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.149
 will be 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.120
 I'll show you how the settings change . 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.680
 water temperature set water 85 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.680
 degrees more less 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.430
 water temperature sensor built into the housing 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 then 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.480
 as we see now the temperature will rise 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.090
 wanted so without water for a long time not 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:44.849
 we can drive it on the screen the torch is burning 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:47.250
 This means that the boiler operation is in progress. 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.060
 reaching a temperature of 86 degrees 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.209
 the boiler will shut down now we put 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.209
 let's say 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:07.340
 all mined boiler heating see seven 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.340
 degrees now we put 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.430
 18 degrees roughly 20 now 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.430
 light up again 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.770
 that is, rudely, unfortunately, the house caught fire 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.230
 mode of operation is called start-stop as in 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.230
 conventional gas boilers 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.940
 we can see that no smoke 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.250
 there is no creator a little cardboard 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.629
 some scoop came in against 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.629
 white so the boiler does not smoke 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:54.710
 so now we put the port 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.710
 as we see there is no smoke; the boiler is quiet 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.310
 thanks to the purchase of the boiler 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.310
 can write to e-mail or 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.150
