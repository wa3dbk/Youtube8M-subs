the<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:42.630> had<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.170> run<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> lines<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.220> this

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
the way we had to run the lines for this

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.949 
the way we had to run the lines for this
seller<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:47.100> drain<00:02:47.550> line<00:02:47.790> could<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.510> go

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
seller the drain line could not go

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.800 
seller the drain line could not go
straight<00:02:49.019> down<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> drain<00:02:51.510> with<00:02:51.780> a

straight down to a drain with a
gravitational<00:02:52.739> flow<00:02:53.130> so<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.239> had<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.480> add<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
gravitational flow so we had to add a

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.850 
gravitational flow so we had to add a
condensation<00:02:56.069> pump<00:02:56.610> below<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.900> cooling<00:02:58.830> unit

condensation pump below the cooling unit

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.090 
condensation pump below the cooling unit
to<00:02:59.610> pump<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.150> condensation<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.170> before<00:03:01.980> it

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
to pump the condensation up before it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.410
