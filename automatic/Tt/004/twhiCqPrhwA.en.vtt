saved<00:03:15.099> there<00:03:15.780> when<00:03:16.780> we<00:03:16.930> resume<00:03:17.409> game<00:03:17.469> will<00:03:18.010> go

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
saved there when we resume game will go

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.369 
saved there when we resume game will go
straight<00:03:18.430> there<00:03:18.760> instead<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.480> having<00:03:19.900> Tuesday

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
straight there instead of having Tuesday

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.640 
straight there instead of having Tuesday
waypoints<00:03:20.920> that's<00:03:21.069> even<00:03:21.370> quicker<00:03:25.500> let<00:03:26.500> us

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
waypoints that's even quicker let us

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.800
