can you can rotate the camera just after
moving<00:00:30.390> forward<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.289> doesn't<00:00:31.650> let<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
particularly noteworthy except that you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.630 
particularly noteworthy except that you
can<00:00:40.140> interrupt<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.649> basic<00:00:41.040> melee<00:00:41.370> attack

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
can interrupt a basic melee attack
anywhere<00:00:42.480> during<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> animation<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.530> that's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
anywhere during the animation so that's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.290 
anywhere during the animation so that's
um

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
um

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.660

I'll show it to you right here so boom

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.840 
I'll show it to you right here so boom
boom<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.660> dodge<00:00:48.840> boom<00:00:49.829> mid<00:00:50.640> kick

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
boom then you can dodge boom mid kick

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
boom then you can dodge boom mid kick
you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> roll<00:00:51.690> away<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> add<00:00:57.539> ups<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.250> Slayers

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you can roll away so add ups and Slayers

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
you can roll away so add ups and Slayers
they<00:00:59.520> can<00:00:59.640> teleport<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.780> basically

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
they can teleport which is basically

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.590 
they can teleport which is basically
like<00:01:01.440> acrobatics<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> Jarell<00:01:03.239> except

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
like acrobatics with the Jarell except

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.289 
like acrobatics with the Jarell except
this<00:01:03.690> upgraded<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:05.790> better<00:01:06.030> all

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this upgraded just a lot better all

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.719 
this upgraded just a lot better all
around<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.320> can't<00:01:07.530> move<00:01:07.860> diagonally<00:01:08.549> but

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
around you can't move diagonally but

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.580 
around you can't move diagonally but
that's<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.360> huge<00:01:09.630> issue<00:01:09.840> sometimes

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that's really not a huge issue sometimes

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.219 
that's really not a huge issue sometimes
when<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.979> tell<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.540> teleport<00:01:12.540> forward<00:01:12.869> it's

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
when you tell for teleport forward it's

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.350 
when you tell for teleport forward it's
it's<00:01:13.650> kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.070> wonky<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.700> it'll<00:01:15.000> just<00:01:15.210> make

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's kind of wonky like it'll just make

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.780 
it's kind of wonky like it'll just make
you<00:01:15.420> run<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.080> lot<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.380> times<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you run a lot of the times but a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.820 
you run a lot of the times but a
masterful<00:01:18.420> add<00:01:18.600> up<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> move<00:01:19.500> very

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
masterful add up can they can move very

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.160 
masterful add up can they can move very
very<00:01:20.280> quickly<00:01:20.610> through<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.970> map<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.450> just<00:01:21.900> by

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
very quickly through a map I just by

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.630 
very quickly through a map I just by
teleporting<00:01:22.470> through<00:01:22.710> walls<00:01:22.950> especially<00:01:23.460> if

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
teleporting through walls especially if

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.910

around the map with with no delay so
instantly<00:02:02.040> after<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> use<00:02:03.270> your<00:02:04.049> rocket<00:02:04.350> pack

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
instantly after you use your rocket pack

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.870 
instantly after you use your rocket pack
you<00:02:04.829> can<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> again<00:02:05.369> boom<00:02:05.579> boom<00:02:05.759> boom

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.450 

when<00:02:09.840> used<00:02:10.020> properly<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.620> can<00:02:10.770> get<00:02:11.010> pretty

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
when used properly you can get pretty

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.890 
when used properly you can get pretty
much<00:02:11.670> everywhere<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.240> want<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.450> go<00:02:12.540> except

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
much everywhere you want to go except

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.120 
much everywhere you want to go except
most<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.410> time<00:02:13.590> you'll<00:02:13.770> get<00:02:13.950> there

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
most of the time you'll get there

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.010 
most of the time you'll get there
backwards<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.090> that's<00:02:15.300> because<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.780> can't

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
backwards and that's because you can't

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.470 
backwards and that's because you can't
move<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.710> camera<00:02:17.190> angle<00:02:17.520> at<00:02:17.670> all<00:02:17.760> unless<00:02:18.330> you

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
move the camera angle at all unless you

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.240 
move the camera angle at all unless you
stop<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.140> then<00:02:19.260> make<00:02:19.470> an<00:02:19.590> adjustment<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
stop and then make an adjustment and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.740 
stop and then make an adjustment and
that's<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.910> sort<00:02:21.120> of<00:02:21.150> thing<00:02:21.300> that'll<00:02:21.510> get<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
that's the sort of thing that'll get you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.160 
that's the sort of thing that'll get you
killed

for cheque can turn the camera as as
long<00:02:44.070> as<00:02:44.250> they're<00:02:44.340> not<00:02:44.370> moving<00:02:44.910> forward<00:02:45.240> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
long as they're not moving forward and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.230 
long as they're not moving forward and
if<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.170> move<00:02:46.350> forward<00:02:46.560> there<00:02:46.710> also<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.240> some

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
if you move forward there also is a some

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.410 
if you move forward there also is a some
hitch<00:02:48.450> after<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.050> but<00:02:49.830> they<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:51.120> could<00:02:51.240> turn

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
hitch after it but they they could turn

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.030 
hitch after it but they they could turn
corners<00:02:52.310> they<00:02:53.310> could<00:02:53.430> turn<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.670> camera<00:02:53.970> while

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
corners they could turn the camera while

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.730 
corners they could turn the camera while
moving<00:02:56.040> left<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.460> right<00:02:56.630> or<00:02:57.630> dashing<00:02:58.500> left
