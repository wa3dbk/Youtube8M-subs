so alternate formats are a relatively

the ocg has done a couple of alternate
formats<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:11.099> tag<00:00:11.429> duels<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.120> things<00:00:12.360> like

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
formats with tag duels and things like

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.140

that<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.530> TCG<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.280> don't<00:00:14.790> really

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that but in the TCG we don't really

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.300 
that but in the TCG we don't really
experiment<00:00:15.960> with<00:00:16.109> alternate<00:00:16.680> format<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.100> lot

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.429 
experiment with alternate format a lot
of<00:00:17.400> people<00:00:17.550> when<00:00:17.820> they<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.210> frustrated<00:00:19.020> with

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the meta they'll go to go format or

something of that sort but a lot of the

highlander is a format in which

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.340 
highlander is a format in which
according<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> name<00:00:42.360> highlighter<00:00:42.809> there

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
according to the name highlighter there

can be only one of each card in your

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.650 
can be only one of each card in your
deck<00:00:46.440> yes<00:00:46.920> everything<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.850> limited<00:00:48.210> in

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
deck yes everything is limited in

deck yes everything is limited in
Highlander<00:00:49.289> format<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> certain<00:00:50.399> extent

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
Highlander format to a certain extent

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.939 
Highlander format to a certain extent
I'll<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.600> second<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.530> that's

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
I'll get to that in a second so that's

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
I'll get to that in a second so that's
the<00:00:53.100> way<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.399> Highlander<00:00:53.850> format<00:00:54.239> works

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the way that a Highlander format works

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.939 
the way that a Highlander format works
there<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> couple<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.440> different<00:00:55.770> rules

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there are a couple of different rules

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.410 
there are a couple of different rules
depending<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.489> what<00:00:56.670> game<00:00:56.940> you're<00:00:57.120> playing

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
depending on what game you're playing

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.029 
depending on what game you're playing
and<00:00:57.629> magic<00:00:57.960> they<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.289> certain<00:00:58.649> rules<00:00:58.800> to

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and magic they have certain rules to

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
and magic they have certain rules to
highlighter<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.969> new<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.539> have<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> certain

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
highlighter but new go we have a certain

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
highlighter but new go we have a certain
set<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> rules<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> course<00:01:01.949> every<00:01:02.430> card<00:01:02.640> in

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
set of rules so of course every card in

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
set of rules so of course every card in
the<00:01:02.820> game<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> limited<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:04.019> except<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
the game is limited for except for a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.109 
the game is limited for except for a
couple<00:01:04.619> exceptions<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> once<00:01:05.939> again

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
couple exceptions get to that once again

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.600 
couple exceptions get to that once again
in<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> second<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.799> Vancouver<00:01:08.220> Portland

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
in a second in the Vancouver Portland

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.070 
in a second in the Vancouver Portland
area<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.939> way<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.540> highlighter<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
area the way that we do highlighter and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.450 
area the way that we do highlighter and
I<00:01:10.260> think<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.740> great<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> do

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
I think this is a great way to do

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.490 
I think this is a great way to do
highlighter<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.119> you've<00:01:12.270> done<00:01:12.450> I've<00:01:12.689> done<00:01:12.750> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
highlighter if you've done I've done it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070 
highlighter if you've done I've done it
before<00:01:14.000> maybe<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.119> want<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.450> experiment<00:01:15.869> with

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
before maybe you want to experiment with

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.899 
before maybe you want to experiment with
this<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.799> an<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.130> just<00:01:17.490> think<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.759> this

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
this this is an I just think that this

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.429 
this this is an I just think that this
is<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> best<00:01:18.270> way<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.720> highlighters<00:01:19.259> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
is the best way to do highlighters so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.929 
is the best way to do highlighters so
the<00:01:19.680> rules<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> band<00:01:20.369> cover<00:01:20.580> Portland

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the rules in the band cover Portland

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.200 
the rules in the band cover Portland
area<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.360> Highlander<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.100> that<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.759> once

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
area for Highlander is that you once

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.820 
area for Highlander is that you once
again<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.720> only<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.409> each<00:01:25.500> card

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
again you can only have one of each card

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.910 
again you can only have one of each card
in<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:25.979> deck<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.909> have<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.509> run<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.990> 60<00:01:28.650> card

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
in your deck you have to run a 60 card

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.030 
in your deck you have to run a 60 card
deck<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.970> 60<00:01:30.450> cards<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:30.930> deck<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
deck so 60 cards in your deck one of

each copy of each card and then the most
one<00:01:36.270> rule<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.780> opinion<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.619> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
one rule in my opinion is that you do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.499 
one rule in my opinion is that you do
not<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.189> an<00:01:38.340> extra<00:01:38.670> deck<00:01:38.820> not<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.360> you

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
not have an extra deck not that you

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.870 
not have an extra deck not that you
cannot<00:01:39.869> use<00:01:40.200> extra<00:01:40.680> deck<00:01:40.829> cards<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
cannot use extra deck cards but in that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
cannot use extra deck cards but in that
you<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> set<00:01:43.020> extra<00:01:43.439> deck<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.040> i

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
you don't have a set extra deck so if i

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280 
you don't have a set extra deck so if i
have<00:01:44.159> an<00:01:44.399> unknown<00:01:44.700> Synchron<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.899> photon

limited we figured that we shouldn't

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.680

just leave it at regular traditional

skill and to have more fun with it so if

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.060 
skill and to have more fun with it so if
you<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.570> classic<00:02:24.780> cards<00:02:25.350> create<00:02:25.740> loops

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
you have the classic cards create loops

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.490 
you have the classic cards create loops
and<00:02:26.490> locks<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.450> completely<00:02:27.780> wreck<00:02:28.290> the

and locks and just completely wreck the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.740 
and locks and just completely wreck the
game<00:02:28.710> then<00:02:29.700> that's<00:02:29.940> not<00:02:30.060> that's<00:02:30.420> kind<00:02:30.690> of

game then that's not that's kind of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.180 
game then that's not that's kind of
going<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.170> defeat<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.590> point<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.040> we've

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
going to defeat the point so we've

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.700 
going to defeat the point so we've
created<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.700> tentative<00:02:33.030> Highlander<00:02:33.810> format<00:02:34.530> in

which there a certain number of cars
that<00:02:36.390> are<00:02:36.510> banned<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:38.070> very<00:02:38.280> short<00:02:38.580> list

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
that are banned it's a very short list

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.150 
that are banned it's a very short list
and<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:39.840> so<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.680> cards<00:02:40.950> that<00:02:41.070> are

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
and here it is so the cards that are

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.100 
and here it is so the cards that are
banned<00:02:41.400> all<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.880> dragon<00:02:42.330> roars<00:02:42.540> including

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110

banned all the dragon roars including
the<00:02:43.230> babies<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.310> reason<00:02:44.580> why<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.850> did<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.060> is

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
the babies the reason why we did that is

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.750 
the babies the reason why we did that is
because<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.690> babies<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.130> dragon<00:02:47.520> roars

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
because the babies on the dragon roars

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.460 
because the babies on the dragon roars
create<00:02:48.030> recurring<00:02:48.360> boss<00:02:48.720> monsters<00:02:49.290> which

create recurring boss monsters which

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.500 
create recurring boss monsters which

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
completely contradict the point of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.120 
completely contradict the point of
Highlander<00:02:52.080> which<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.709> conserve

Highlander which is to conserve
resources<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:54.030> if<00:02:54.120> you've<00:02:54.270> got<00:02:54.510> reoccurring

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
resources and if you've got reoccurring

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
resources and if you've got reoccurring
boss<00:02:55.320> monsters<00:02:56.120> then<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.420> kind<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
boss monsters then that kind of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.190 
boss monsters then that kind of
completely<00:02:59.130> defeats<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.790> point<00:03:00.050> we<00:03:01.050> also

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
completely defeats the point we also

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.320 
completely defeats the point we also
just<00:03:01.380> didn't<00:03:01.980> none<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.400> us<00:03:02.550> like<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.970> babies

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
just didn't none of us like the babies

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.670 
just didn't none of us like the babies
we<00:03:03.540> think<00:03:03.750> they<00:03:03.900> should<00:03:03.930> never<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.500> existed

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
we think they should never have existed

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.560 
we think they should never have existed
in<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.190> first<00:03:05.250> place<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:05.700> we<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.150> happy<00:03:06.450> to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
in the first place so we are happy to

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.870 
in the first place so we are happy to
ban<00:03:07.110> those<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.830> dragon<00:03:08.190> roars<00:03:08.430> came<00:03:08.640> later

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
ban those the dragon roars came later
