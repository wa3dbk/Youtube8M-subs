 relatively new studio in the industry

 influence of Quentin Tarantino on the

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.100
 excessive violence 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.930
 stabbed scattered shootings and blood 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.840

 available on your pc and in the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.700
 arcade and playstation xbox live networks 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.210
 network check was part of a 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.430
 mercenary group that dominates the region 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.140
 known as the family but the 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.220
 killer was betrayed by his partners

 is the tchan in many ways shankly 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.820
 even seems to be a game 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.010
 the images on the screen remember a 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.909
 the king tartakovsky cartoon 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.759
 like samurai jack or star wars wars 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.310
 clone the soft animations together 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.979
 with the orchestrated soundtrack give more 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.170
 native emphasis on cut scenes and not 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.770
 lose a quality level during the 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.229
 action 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.030
 this is undoubtedly one of the most 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.039
 of this year 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.380
 mechanics try to rescue the spirit of 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.649
 old side games like ninja gaiden 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.050
 or super against merging body attacks 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.600
 a body with gun shots 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.460
 shotguns and machine guns 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.679
 after getting used to the provision 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.080
 the player will open a 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.050
 smile when you realize that you are doing 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.210
 combinations with more than 100 hits 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.670
 however, it is not easy to reach this 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.830
 mainly due to the animation of the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.319
 character that can not be interrupted 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.019
 by movements of defense and avoidance 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.510
 on certain occasions the hero is surrounded 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.360
 by various enemies and the choice of a 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.030
 wrong coup at the wrong time can 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.760
 the computer from coffers to the 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.160
 button layout also does not help 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.170
 combining in it commanding actions that 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.870
 could clearly be in others 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.519
 mainly in the case of collecting 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.280
 items and dodging 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.640
 the square button on playstation or x on 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.430
 xbox 360 for example serves both 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.250
 get a bottle to retrieve 'media 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.989
 how much to stab and heat 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.000
 battle usually player wants 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.640
 save that item for moments of 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.400
 emergency but may end up arriving without 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.350
 want to distribute punches already 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.299
 corner is made by holding down the 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.049
 defense and putting to the left or 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.910
 right 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.130
 but instead of bringing people to a 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.790
 sure place it can put it in a 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.280
 area infested with opponents as it is already 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.950
 custom games of the type at the end of 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.350
 each stage the player meets the boss 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.530
 while some are great challenges 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.830
 cassandra others are a test for 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.750
 patience 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.310
 mixing mini games that explores the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.710
 weakness of the opponent 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.920
 as happens with de potter the latter 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:30.410
 is one of the most annoying because it ignores 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.000
 moves defense dial leaving the 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.700
 player without many options 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.190
 besides running away and throwing the end 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.900
 but not least the way 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.660
 multiplayer that is limited from the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.970
 places without online option 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.310
 in the case of chen the feeling of loss and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.200
 expanded because the double campaign counts 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.260
 a different story of the solo adventure 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.900
 with new checks and scenarios and shows 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.570
 when she was kidnapped with a story 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.120
 of revenge violence without limits check 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.430
 It's a game that has lots of fun 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.290
 however, a common mapping of 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.810
 buttons and the absence of multiplayer 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.760
 are important factors that should 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.570
 be taken into consideration at the time of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.940
 purchase 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.190
 in general terms it is a fun and 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.070
 that keeps the player connected by one or 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:23.569
 two weekends
