what's up everybody nfx here with
another<00:00:02.970> tutorial<00:00:03.300> in<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.290> tutorial<00:00:04.350> I'm

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
another tutorial in this tutorial I'm

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.000 
another tutorial in this tutorial I'm
going<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.130> talk<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.370> doing<00:00:05.910> roles

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
going to talk about doing roles

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.780 
going to talk about doing roles
specifically<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.400> show<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.580> how

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
specifically I'm going to show you how

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.200 
specifically I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:08.849> do<00:00:09.030> a<00:00:09.059> hi-hat<00:00:09.599> roll<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.320> a<00:00:11.160> snare<00:00:11.639> build<00:00:12.000> up

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
to do a hi-hat roll and a snare build up

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.799 
to do a hi-hat roll and a snare build up
roll<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:14.059> what<00:00:15.059> I'm<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.660> I'm

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
roll and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.050 
roll and what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.049> basically<00:00:16.379> start<00:00:17.220> off<00:00:17.430> with<00:00:17.880> an

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
going to basically start off with an

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380 
going to basically start off with an
empty<00:00:18.830> pattern<00:00:19.830> here<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.490> actually<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.910> 2<00:00:21.150> bar

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
empty pattern here it's actually a 2 bar

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.380 
empty pattern here it's actually a 2 bar
pattern<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.320> I'm<00:00:23.039> just<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> lay<00:00:23.609> down<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
pattern and I'm just going to lay down a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.910 
pattern and I'm just going to lay down a
very<00:00:24.960> simple<00:00:26.119> 4<00:00:27.119> on<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.449> floor<00:00:27.480> type<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.380> kick

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
very simple 4 on the floor type of kick

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.650 
very simple 4 on the floor type of kick
and<00:00:29.250> clap<00:00:30.060> pattern<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.579> and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:33.149> I'll<00:00:33.450> also

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
and clap pattern and and then I'll also

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.770 
and clap pattern and and then I'll also
actually<00:00:34.440> put<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> snares<00:00:35.070> down<00:00:35.690> just<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
actually put the snares down just to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
actually put the snares down just to
keep<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.110> beefy<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:37.920> I'm<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.250> tell

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
keep it beefy and then I'm going to tell

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.880 
keep it beefy and then I'm going to tell
the<00:00:39.180> hi-hat<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.899> hit<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.620> every<00:00:41.219> two<00:00:41.430> steps<00:00:41.850> and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
the hi-hat to hit on every two steps and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.139 
the hi-hat to hit on every two steps and
just<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.250> where<00:00:44.460> I'm<00:00:44.550> starting<00:00:44.789> from

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
just so you know where I'm starting from

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.090 
just so you know where I'm starting from
this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:51.020> okay<00:00:52.020> that's<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.920> plain

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
this is it okay that's it just a plain

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.139 
this is it okay that's it just a plain
simple<00:00:53.640> beat<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.760> I'm<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> do

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
simple beat and what I'm going to do

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.250 
simple beat and what I'm going to do
first<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.190> hi-hat<00:00:59.190> roll<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.960> the<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.109> I'm

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
first is the hi-hat roll and the way I'm

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.569 
first is the hi-hat roll and the way I'm
going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.530> do<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.340> move

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
going to do that is I'm going to move

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.850 
going to do that is I'm going to move
this<00:01:02.820> data<00:01:03.180> that's<00:01:03.840> currently<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> step

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this data that's currently in the step

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.539 
this data that's currently in the step
sequencer<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> piano<00:01:06.600> roll<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.549> the

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
sequencer to the piano roll and the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.700 
sequencer to the piano roll and the
piano<00:01:08.880> roll<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.920> basically<00:01:10.920> showing<00:01:11.520> me<00:01:12.710> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
piano roll is basically showing me the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670 
piano roll is basically showing me the
note<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.850> duration<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.049> velocity

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
note and the duration and the velocity

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.800 
note and the duration and the velocity
and<00:01:16.890> that's<00:01:17.580> all<00:01:17.759> important<00:01:20.270> I'll<00:01:21.270> shrink

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and that's all important I'll shrink

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.149 
and that's all important I'll shrink
this<00:01:22.020> actually<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.890> leave<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
this actually I'm going to leave it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
this actually I'm going to leave it
zoomed<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.729> although<00:01:24.030> you<00:01:24.270> can't<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
zoomed in although you can't see the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.480 
zoomed in although you can't see the
entire<00:01:26.090> piano<00:01:27.090> roll<00:01:27.360> right<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:29.420> there<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:31.490> 16

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
entire piano roll right now there are 16

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.200 
entire piano roll right now there are 16
hits<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.650> particular<00:01:35.040> piano<00:01:35.820> roll

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
hits in this particular piano roll

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
hits in this particular piano roll
because<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> 2<00:01:37.200> bar<00:01:37.470> loop<00:01:37.829> which<00:01:38.579> means

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
because this is a 2 bar loop which means

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
because this is a 2 bar loop which means
each<00:01:39.150> one<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.630> these<00:01:39.720> hits<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.320> you're

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
each one of these hits that you're

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.830 
each one of these hits that you're
looking<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.159> an<00:01:41.310> eighth<00:01:41.520> note<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.659> we

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
looking at is an eighth note and what we

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
looking at is an eighth note and what we
want<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> bring<00:01:44.070> them<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
want to do is bring them down so that

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.440 
want to do is bring them down so that
they're<00:01:45.030> all<00:01:45.259> 32nd<00:01:46.259> notes<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.909> way<00:01:48.060> we<00:01:48.270> do

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
they're all 32nd notes the way we do

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.139 
they're all 32nd notes the way we do
that<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> first<00:01:49.680> we<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.250> zoom<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.700> way<00:01:50.850> in

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that is first we can zoom all the way in

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
that is first we can zoom all the way in
which<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.720> you're<00:01:51.869> looking<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.409> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
which is what you're looking at and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.700 
which is what you're looking at and
second<00:01:53.549> make<00:01:53.759> sure<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.390> your<00:01:54.659> snap<00:01:55.200> setting

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
second make sure that your snap setting

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.300 
second make sure that your snap setting
is<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:56.189> either<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:57.409> minimum<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.590> half<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:59.009> step

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
is at either a minimum of half a step

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160 
is at either a minimum of half a step
but<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.729> be<00:01:59.820> at<00:01:59.939> half<00:02:00.180> step<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.780> quarter

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
but it can be at half step or quarter

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.130 
but it can be at half step or quarter
step

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
step

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.800 
step
and<00:02:03.260> I'll<00:02:03.979> just<00:02:04.190> set<00:02:04.370> it<00:02:04.490> to<00:02:04.520> half-step<00:02:05.090> for

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
and I'll just set it to half-step for

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.309 
and I'll just set it to half-step for
now<00:02:06.550> but<00:02:07.550> what<00:02:07.760> that'll<00:02:08.060> allow<00:02:08.330> me<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.630> do<00:02:08.990> is

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
now but what that'll allow me to do is

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.100 
now but what that'll allow me to do is
if<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.250> select<00:02:10.700> all<00:02:10.880> my<00:02:11.060> notes<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.510> start

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
if I select all my notes and start

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.980 
if I select all my notes and start
shrinking<00:02:12.530> them<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.760> smallest<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.540> can<00:02:14.780> get

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
shrinking them the smallest I can get

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.520 
shrinking them the smallest I can get
them<00:02:15.110> are<00:02:15.290> one<00:02:16.270> square<00:02:17.270> which<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.870> in<00:02:18.380> this

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
them are one square which is in this

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.280 
them are one square which is in this
case<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:19.069> thirty-second<00:02:19.850> note<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:20.870> now<00:02:21.050> that<00:02:21.110> I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
case a thirty-second note so now that I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.199 
case a thirty-second note so now that I
have<00:02:21.350> everything<00:02:21.830> down<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.370> thirty-second

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
have everything down to a thirty-second

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.530 
have everything down to a thirty-second
note<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:24.070> can<00:02:25.070> put<00:02:25.370> a<00:02:25.400> fill<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.730> somewhere<00:02:26.360> and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
note I can put a fill in somewhere and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.960 
note I can put a fill in somewhere and
the<00:02:27.260> way<00:02:27.410> I'm<00:02:27.560> going<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.800> do<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.700> simply

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
the way I'm going to do that is simply

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.590 
the way I'm going to do that is simply
by<00:02:29.180> drawing<00:02:29.660> in<00:02:30.100> some<00:02:31.100> extra<00:02:31.489> notes<00:02:34.300> like<00:02:35.300> this

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
by drawing in some extra notes like this

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.460 
by drawing in some extra notes like this
a<00:02:35.920> fill<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.340> basically<00:02:38.030> just<00:02:38.180> a<00:02:38.930> bunch<00:02:39.260> of

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
a fill is basically just a bunch of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.509 
a fill is basically just a bunch of
notes<00:02:39.800> played<00:02:40.400> very<00:02:41.239> rapidly<00:02:41.810> within<00:02:42.739> a<00:02:42.950> part

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
notes played very rapidly within a part

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.590 
notes played very rapidly within a part
of<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.709> pattern<00:02:45.709> that's<00:02:46.430> all<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.269> here

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
of the pattern that's all it is and here

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.970 
of the pattern that's all it is and here
I've<00:02:47.720> drawn<00:02:48.019> them<00:02:48.140> in<00:02:48.320> yellow<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.890> to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
I've drawn them in yellow just to

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
I've drawn them in yellow just to
differentiate<00:02:49.640> them<00:02:49.940> from<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.870> normal<00:02:52.000> hat

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
differentiate them from the normal hat

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.400 
differentiate them from the normal hat
that's<00:02:53.360> keeping<00:02:53.810> time<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:55.489> on<00:02:56.209> every<00:02:57.170> beat<00:02:57.380> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
that's keeping time on on every beat and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.890 
that's keeping time on on every beat and
every<00:02:57.800> other<00:02:57.950> beat<00:02:58.280> or<00:02:58.760> in<00:02:59.030> between<00:02:59.120> every

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
every other beat or in between every

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.670 
every other beat or in between every
beat<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:02.140> then<00:03:03.140> what<00:03:03.260> I'm<00:03:03.350> going<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.500> do<00:03:03.620> is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
beat and then what I'm going to do is

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:14.850 
beat and then what I'm going to do is
I'll<00:03:03.769> play<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:04.459> you'll<00:03:05.090> hear<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.810> roll

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.710 

okay<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.340> there's<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.790> roll<00:03:17.000> happened<00:03:17.540> right

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
okay so there's the roll happened right

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.830 
okay so there's the roll happened right
there<00:03:17.750> where<00:03:18.049> those<00:03:18.200> yellow<00:03:18.530> notes<00:03:18.769> are<00:03:19.840> we

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
there where those yellow notes are we

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.150 
there where those yellow notes are we
can<00:03:21.019> do<00:03:21.110> a<00:03:21.140> little<00:03:21.380> bit<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.739> make<00:03:21.890> these<00:03:22.130> a

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
can do a little bit to make these a

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.819 
can do a little bit to make these a
little<00:03:22.519> more<00:03:22.730> authentic<00:03:23.290> sounding<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.500> what

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
little more authentic sounding and what

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.860 
little more authentic sounding and what
I'm<00:03:25.040> going<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.400> do<00:03:25.640> is<00:03:25.910> I'm<00:03:26.060> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.420> zigzag

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
I'm going to do is I'm going to zigzag

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.350 
I'm going to do is I'm going to zigzag
the<00:03:27.410> velocity<00:03:28.100> that<00:03:28.730> means<00:03:29.000> I'm<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.299> to

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
the velocity that means I'm going to

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.600 
the velocity that means I'm going to
take<00:03:29.600> this<00:03:29.750> velocity<00:03:29.930> we<00:03:30.920> have<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.250> green

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
take this velocity we have this green

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.759 
take this velocity we have this green
note<00:03:31.880> here<00:03:32.390> I'm<00:03:32.810> going<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.079> make<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.470> next

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
note here I'm going to make the next

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.120 
note here I'm going to make the next
note<00:03:34.100> less<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:36.010> volume<00:03:37.010> and<00:03:38.890> basically<00:03:39.890> kind

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
note less in volume and basically kind

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.360 
note less in volume and basically kind
of<00:03:40.220> almost<00:03:40.549> draw<00:03:40.760> W<00:03:41.360> here<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:42.200> way<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:42.680> you

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
of almost draw W here in a way and you

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.250 
of almost draw W here in a way and you
can<00:03:43.549> see<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.820> goes<00:03:44.000> high<00:03:44.209> then<00:03:44.630> low<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.900> little

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
can see it goes high then low a little

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.560 
can see it goes high then low a little
bit<00:03:45.410> higher<00:03:45.769> than<00:03:46.220> low<00:03:46.459> and<00:03:46.700> then<00:03:46.820> high<00:03:46.850> as<00:03:47.329> far

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
bit higher than low and then high as far

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.539 
bit higher than low and then high as far
as<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.840> velocity<00:03:48.440> goes<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.860> that's<00:03:49.220> going<00:03:49.489> to

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
as the velocity goes and that's going to

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.210 
as the velocity goes and that's going to
give<00:03:49.730> us<00:03:49.850> a<00:03:49.970> slightly<00:03:50.329> more<00:03:51.200> authentic<00:03:51.829> feel

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
give us a slightly more authentic feel

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:04.310 
give us a slightly more authentic feel
and<00:03:52.519> less<00:03:52.790> computerized<00:03:53.600> feel<00:03:54.019> take<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.680> listen

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.320 

okay<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.530> that's<00:04:05.950> basically<00:04:06.520> all<00:04:06.730> there<00:04:07.180> is

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
okay and that's basically all there is

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.140 
okay and that's basically all there is
to<00:04:07.600> making<00:04:07.840> a<00:04:08.200> hi-hat<00:04:08.710> roll<00:04:08.980> there<00:04:09.490> are<00:04:09.640> places

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
to making a hi-hat roll there are places

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.540 
to making a hi-hat roll there are places
where<00:04:10.360> it<00:04:10.570> sounds<00:04:10.990> better<00:04:11.170> than<00:04:11.920> others

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
where it sounds better than others

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.730 
where it sounds better than others
within<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.240> within<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.960> framework<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.560> the

within the within the framework of the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.069 
within the within the framework of the
beat<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.130> that's<00:04:15.850> all<00:04:16.180> up<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.390> your<00:04:16.660> ear<00:04:16.930> to

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
beat and that's all up to your ear to

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
determine where that where they should

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.610 
determine where that where they should
go<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:20.739> hear<00:04:20.980> this<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.190> lot<00:04:21.340> in<00:04:21.850> and<00:04:22.420> like<00:04:23.380> Dirty

South style music the hats play a very
important<00:04:28.840> role<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:29.410> in<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.430> style<00:04:31.860> let's<00:04:32.860> go

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
important role in in that style let's go

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.340 
important role in in that style let's go
to<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.970> snare<00:04:34.270> roll<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.230> is

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
to this to the snare roll and this is

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.840 
to this to the snare roll and this is
going<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.530> be<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> build<00:04:36.010> up<00:04:36.220> Earl<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:36.670> it's<00:04:36.790> a

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
going to be a build up Earl so it's a

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.120 
going to be a build up Earl so it's a

little bit different I'm going to send

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.570 
little bit different I'm going to send
the<00:04:39.310> snare<00:04:39.790> data<00:04:40.090> to<00:04:40.420> the<00:04:40.540> piano<00:04:40.840> roll<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:42.460> I'm

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.060 
the snare data to the piano roll and I'm
going<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.790> do<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.030> same<00:04:43.300> thing<00:04:43.630> where<00:04:43.900> I

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
going to do the same thing where I

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.530 
going to do the same thing where I
basically<00:04:45.070> shrink<00:04:45.490> everything<00:04:45.790> down<00:04:46.000> and

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
basically shrink everything down and

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.260 
basically shrink everything down and
make<00:04:46.600> it<00:04:46.780> into<00:04:47.080> a<00:04:47.770> 32nd<00:04:48.580> note<00:04:48.990> and<00:04:50.940> I'll<00:04:51.940> pick<00:04:52.240> a

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
make it into a 32nd note and I'll pick a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.440 
make it into a 32nd note and I'll pick a
spot<00:04:52.630> for<00:04:53.590> example<00:04:54.100> right<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:54.940> actually

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
spot for example right here actually

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.740 
spot for example right here actually
I'll<00:04:55.930> go<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.169> the<00:04:56.440> end<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:57.540> scroll<00:04:58.540> over

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
I'll go to the end of the scroll over

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.740 
I'll go to the end of the scroll over
and<00:04:59.050> I'll<00:04:59.320> do<00:04:59.500> it<00:04:59.590> right<00:04:59.740> here<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.630> what<00:05:01.630> I'm

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
and I'll do it right here and what I'm

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.610 
and I'll do it right here and what I'm
going<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.960> do<00:05:02.110> here<00:05:02.470> is<00:05:02.590> I'm<00:05:02.770> going<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:04.500> let<00:05:05.500> me

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
going to do here is I'm going to let me

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.510 
going to do here is I'm going to let me
show<00:05:05.800> you<00:05:05.860> another<00:05:06.520> method<00:05:06.640> of<00:05:07.150> doing<00:05:08.520> the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
show you another method of doing the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.870 
show you another method of doing the
role<00:05:09.760> of<00:05:09.790> if<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.960> just<00:05:11.169> stretch<00:05:11.530> out<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.010> note

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
role of if I just stretch out a note

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.210 
role of if I just stretch out a note
into<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.480> part<00:05:14.350> of<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.530> pattern<00:05:14.860> where<00:05:15.190> I

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
into the part of the pattern where I

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.590 
into the part of the pattern where I
want<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:15.669> data<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.000> go<00:05:16.300> I<00:05:16.570> can<00:05:17.530> use<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:18.600> thing

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
want the data to go I can use a thing

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.260 
want the data to go I can use a thing
built<00:05:19.840> into<00:05:20.260> FL<00:05:20.740> Studio<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:21.370> actually<00:05:21.970> chop

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
built into FL Studio to actually chop

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.740 
built into FL Studio to actually chop
that<00:05:22.510> up<00:05:22.750> and<00:05:22.990> go<00:05:23.200> to<00:05:23.260> file<00:05:23.650> or<00:05:24.479> this<00:05:25.479> is<00:05:25.660> the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
that up and go to file or this is the

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.550 
that up and go to file or this is the
keyboard<00:05:26.220> tools<00:05:27.220> and<00:05:27.669> then<00:05:28.660> say<00:05:28.840> chop<00:05:29.229> and

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
keyboard tools and then say chop and

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.920 
keyboard tools and then say chop and
then<00:05:30.370> by<00:05:30.550> default<00:05:30.760> it's<00:05:31.240> just<00:05:31.419> going<00:05:31.540> to<00:05:31.600> chop

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
then by default it's just going to chop

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.469 
then by default it's just going to chop
it<00:05:32.169> into<00:05:32.400> thirty-second<00:05:33.400> notes<00:05:33.580> but<00:05:34.210> I<00:05:34.240> could

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
it into thirty-second notes but I could

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.719 
it into thirty-second notes but I could
chop<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.200> much<00:05:35.380> finer<00:05:35.740> if<00:05:35.950> I<00:05:36.040> wanted<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.460> or

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
chop it much finer if I wanted to or

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:38.790 
chop it much finer if I wanted to or
much<00:05:36.940> less<00:05:37.210> I'm<00:05:37.900> going<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.110> leave<00:05:38.200> it<00:05:38.350> at<00:05:38.590> the

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
much less I'm going to leave it at the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.190 
much less I'm going to leave it at the
default<00:05:38.919> and<00:05:39.520> say<00:05:39.760> okay<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.330> now<00:05:40.750> you<00:05:40.780> can<00:05:41.050> see

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
default and say okay and now you can see

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.650 
default and say okay and now you can see
I<00:05:41.229> have<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:41.650> nice<00:05:41.890> chopped<00:05:43.770> snare<00:05:44.770> drum<00:05:45.660> if

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
I have this nice chopped snare drum if

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.840 
I have this nice chopped snare drum if
we<00:05:46.810> take<00:05:46.990> a<00:05:47.020> listen<00:05:47.290> to<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.560> now<00:05:47.710> it's<00:05:48.610> going<00:05:48.760> to

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
we take a listen to it now it's going to

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:59.170 
we take a listen to it now it's going to
sound<00:05:49.000> like<00:05:49.210> this

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.910 

okay<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.420> that's<00:06:00.900> kind<00:06:01.170> of<00:06:01.260> artificial

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
okay and that's kind of artificial

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.420 
okay and that's kind of artificial
sounding<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.430> doesn't<00:06:02.850> sound<00:06:03.000> exactly<00:06:03.420> like

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
sounding that doesn't sound exactly like

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.640 
sounding that doesn't sound exactly like
what<00:06:05.430> I<00:06:05.460> wanted<00:06:05.880> so<00:06:05.940> let's<00:06:06.330> change<00:06:06.750> it<00:06:06.990> what

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
what I wanted so let's change it what

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.630 
what I wanted so let's change it what
we're<00:06:07.770> going<00:06:07.890> to<00:06:07.950> do<00:06:08.130> is<00:06:08.310> we're<00:06:08.490> going<00:06:08.580> to

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.420 
we're going to do is we're going to
basically<00:06:09.030> build<00:06:09.330> it<00:06:09.600> up<00:06:09.690> and<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:11.100> way<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:11.280> do

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
basically build it up and the way I do

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.400 
basically build it up and the way I do
that<00:06:11.730> is<00:06:11.790> by<00:06:12.030> setting<00:06:12.450> the<00:06:12.570> velocities<00:06:13.170> to

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
that is by setting the velocities to

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.830 
that is by setting the velocities to
start<00:06:14.070> out<00:06:14.220> low<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.760> get<00:06:15.330> higher<00:06:15.540> and<00:06:15.780> higher

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
start out low and get higher and higher

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.240 
start out low and get higher and higher
and<00:06:16.020> higher<00:06:16.200> until<00:06:16.500> they<00:06:16.860> get<00:06:17.040> to<00:06:17.220> the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
and higher until they get to the

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.770 
and higher until they get to the
velocity<00:06:18.030> of<00:06:18.360> the<00:06:19.110> rest<00:06:19.440> of<00:06:19.680> them<00:06:20.390> of<00:06:21.390> the

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
velocity of the rest of them of the

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.910 
velocity of the rest of them of the
beats<00:06:22.550> but<00:06:23.550> what<00:06:23.730> I<00:06:23.760> do<00:06:23.910> is<00:06:24.390> I<00:06:25.290> take<00:06:25.500> every

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:25.920 
beats but what I do is I take every

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.910 
beats but what I do is I take every
other<00:06:25.950> beat<00:06:26.430> I<00:06:27.260> start<00:06:28.260> on<00:06:28.410> a<00:06:28.440> beat

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
other beat I start on a beat

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.500 
other beat I start on a beat
for<00:06:29.160> example<00:06:29.550> this<00:06:29.730> beat<00:06:29.940> here<00:06:30.180> and<00:06:30.330> then<00:06:30.420> I

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
for example this beat here and then I

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.020 
for example this beat here and then I
will<00:06:30.630> go<00:06:30.720> every<00:06:31.020> other<00:06:31.050> one<00:06:31.380> and<00:06:31.440> make<00:06:32.000> make<00:06:33.000> it

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
will go every other one and make make it

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.410 
will go every other one and make make it
a<00:06:33.240> little<00:06:33.480> bit<00:06:33.690> less<00:06:33.870> than<00:06:34.140> the<00:06:34.200> previous<00:06:34.740> one

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:35.420 
a little bit less than the previous one

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.330 
a little bit less than the previous one
just<00:06:36.420> like<00:06:36.600> this<00:06:36.870> and<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.620> me<00:06:37.770> that<00:06:37.800> gives<00:06:38.220> it

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
just like this and to me that gives it

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.760 
just like this and to me that gives it
the<00:06:38.460> more<00:06:39.180> natural<00:06:39.720> feel<00:06:40.020> let's<00:06:40.500> take<00:06:40.740> a

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
the more natural feel let's take a

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:53.810 
the more natural feel let's take a
listen<00:06:41.040> to<00:06:41.160> it<00:06:41.310> now<00:06:51.050> okay<00:06:52.050> and<00:06:52.170> then<00:06:52.290> finally<00:06:52.820> I

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
listen to it now okay and then finally I

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.990 
listen to it now okay and then finally I
like<00:06:54.450> to<00:06:54.600> throw<00:06:54.810> a<00:06:54.840> couple<00:06:55.080> of<00:06:55.700> fill<00:06:56.700> notes

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000 
like to throw a couple of fill notes

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.970 
like to throw a couple of fill notes
after<00:06:57.950> after<00:06:58.950> snare<00:06:59.340> rolls<00:06:59.690> I<00:07:00.690> commonly<00:07:01.560> do<00:07:01.830> it

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
after after snare rolls I commonly do it

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.460 
after after snare rolls I commonly do it
but<00:07:02.700> like<00:07:02.820> anything<00:07:03.300> with<00:07:03.420> music<00:07:03.600> there

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:04.470 
but like anything with music there

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:05.900 
but like anything with music there
really<00:07:04.650> are<00:07:04.890> no<00:07:05.040> rules<00:07:05.340> but<00:07:05.550> I'm<00:07:05.640> just<00:07:05.730> going

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
really are no rules but I'm just going
