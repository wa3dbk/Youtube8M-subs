00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.109
 the sport is definitely treated today 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.349
 does not go out of style 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.839
 skating may even look like a sport 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.119
 modern but do not fool yourself 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.550
 we're talking about three centuries 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.680
 registered existence 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.810
 and that not to mention the ice skates 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.270
 even older 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.150
 today I am practice is both a way 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.250
 of recreation as an organized sport 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.970
 for adult men and women and 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.970
 children 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.840
 I started to skate in 92 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.290
 I skateboarded amateur skateboarding and 84 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.080
 90 and 91 was inside a bus and a 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.509
 face passing on the white river avenue with 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:11.990
 pass free in the middle of the cars 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:15.289
 it hit me being an athlete of 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.390
 skates is liking freedom like the 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.899
 of freedom flo 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.530
 in addition to sport lifestyle is a 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:27.380
 Therapy is my ex-team even if I pass. 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:34.729
 like the 16 skateboard kits I say 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:37.969
 I 'm the skater, the guys who want to 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.249
 sharing skating is easy to move around 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.350
 you go all the time walking 

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:45.909
 if you feel like learning to skate 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.909
 learn is easy 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.100
 the first skates were made in the 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.110
 Holland in the 18th century that were modeled 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.350
 based on the ice skates with the wheels 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.420
 in a row it was only one hundred years after 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.690
 appeared in the united states the skates 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.200
 with four wheels but it was only 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.360
 in the 70's that the so-called 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.090
 inline skates that became popular 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.300
 immensely and will subdivide two 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.300
 street and vertical categories 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.850
 In Brazil the sporting fever only had 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.080
 beginning in the 90's but with certainty 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.080
 came to stay 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.940
 today we can say that we are very 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.120
