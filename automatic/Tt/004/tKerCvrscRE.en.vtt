00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
that back plate which covers some of the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.889 
that back plate which covers some of the
connectors<00:01:49.040> big<00:01:50.040> X<00:01:50.299> don't<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:51.810> I'm

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
connectors big X don't do that so I'm

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
connectors big X don't do that so I'm
gonna<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.200> move<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.970> see<00:01:53.970> how<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240

shows<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.960> move<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> don't

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
shows you to move it up so you don't

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.899 
shows you to move it up so you don't
block<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.509> ports<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.530> back<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:59.759> that's

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
another move the plate upwards and not

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.320 
another move the plate upwards and not
block<00:02:07.979> any<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> connectors<00:02:08.910> at<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.119> back

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
block any of the connectors at the back

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.220 
block any of the connectors at the back
I<00:02:10.050> also<00:02:10.800> found<00:02:11.129> these<00:02:11.340> washers<00:02:12.239> which<00:02:13.020> were

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
I also found these washers which were

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.010 
I also found these washers which were
included

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
included

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.610 
included
and<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:15.040> prevents<00:02:15.460> the<00:02:15.640> bolt<00:02:16.060> from<00:02:16.620> falling

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
and it prevents the bolt from falling

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.780 
and it prevents the bolt from falling
right<00:02:17.770> through<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.430> screw<00:02:18.670> holes<00:02:18.960> so<00:02:20.790> put

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
right through the the screw holes so put

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.960 
right through the the screw holes so put
the<00:02:21.880> washers<00:02:22.240> on<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.340> screw<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> down

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.170 

the<00:02:30.970> next<00:02:31.240> thing<00:02:31.360> I'm<00:02:31.450> using<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:33.180> stud

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
the next thing I'm using is a stud

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.460 
the next thing I'm using is a stud
finder<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:35.430> find<00:02:36.430> if<00:02:36.550> there's<00:02:36.730> any<00:02:36.850> studs

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
finder to find if there's any studs

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.260 
finder to find if there's any studs
behind<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.800> wall<00:02:38.980> it'd<00:02:39.640> be<00:02:39.760> great<00:02:39.910> if<00:02:40.030> there

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
behind the wall it'd be great if there

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.840 
behind the wall it'd be great if there
is<00:02:40.650> but<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:42.130> this<00:02:42.250> section
