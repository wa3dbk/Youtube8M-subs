00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so far but yeah so finally at the very

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
so far but yeah so finally at the very
very<00:00:55.620> end<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> episode<00:00:56.370> they<00:00:56.850> reveal<00:00:57.120> who

it<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> it's<00:00:58.140> ahsoka<00:00:58.680> tano<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.420> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
it is and it's ahsoka tano from the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.349 
it is and it's ahsoka tano from the
Clone<00:01:00.690> Wars<00:01:00.870> series<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.670> 15<00:01:03.329> years

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
Clone Wars series so it's like 15 years
