00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello how about youtube friends today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.910
 I'm going to teach how to play the bob song 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.560
 sponge and previously we had the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.809
 song of the pink panther ' also 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
 because he likes to check it and we're going to do 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.130
 Now I'm teaching you this topic 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.039
 step by step to get them a 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.779
 practical and fast way well let's 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.840
 start with the tutorial very well let's 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.310
 to start with the position of the fingers 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.830
 let's start by putting our finger 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.650
 one in what would be all the seventh 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.740
 chord after we're going to put our 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.930
 finger number three in what would be the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.930
 fourth string the ninth chord 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.710
 and the first arrangement that we must 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.710
 learn would be this 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:58.710
 okay 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:04.370
 we started fifth quarter simultaneously 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.370
 fourth and sixth and then fourth again 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.480
 because since we have dominated this 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.700
 part we can move on to the next fix 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.380
 ah 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.750
 Y 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:32.360
 ok we started playing the sixth air and 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.439
 we played first in what would be the 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.439
 seventh fret 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.370
 Y 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.620
 ok faster 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.879
 ok this is going to be our part of the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.879
 start later let's move on 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.490
 here we are going to start playing sixth 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.450
 the air for the first and second in the 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.450
 twelfth fret 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.530
 then we position in this way 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.530
 our fingers 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.840
 here it goes in them appear as 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.840
 is it so 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:54.880
 and we just touched the first one in what 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.880
 It would be the sixteenth fret 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.300
 nothing else the little one is the one that we move 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.050
 ah 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.650
 all right 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.650
 to me 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.590
 okay 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.590
 let's start assembling 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.050
 Y 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.019
 then we go to the next part 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.140
 it's going to be slower 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.689
 i 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.459
 and then we go back to the same arrangement that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.459
 teaches them from the beginning 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.740
 and now here for the end part 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.550
 let's play simultaneously sixth and 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.550
 first rope 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.270
 and nothing else here in what would be the 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.759
 eleventh fret we pull 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.759
 and this would be our slow ending 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.930
 or 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.290
 ok the whole song is going to stay 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:55.789
 do not 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.720
