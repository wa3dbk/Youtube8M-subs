00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
 welcome to 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.020
 Germany weather now for the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.060
 weekend and yet norm in small 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.350
 outlook for next week not even 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.540
 By the way, but we catch it 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.679
 quite chronologically with the saturday on 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.360
 because there are so many 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.309
 Restrictions are actually one 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.929
 bit two-quartered west gray us 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.609
 east sunny and dry 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.109
 That's because we still have Eastern Europe 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.730
 lie a high pressure area and of 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.590
 west now slips slowly but 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 sure more and more a deep runner purely 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.699
 but that does not really come against it 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.830
 but just because of this split 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.929
 that means the west has mainly on 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.820
 Saturdays quite a few clouds above 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.410
 the communes are still in the southwest 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.640
 There is always a bit of rain 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.649
 again that is not true 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.210
 but it's raining so long 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.540
 do not keep the rain breaks then 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.370
 on 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.750
 otherwise the sun is clear 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.280
 better chances especially in the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.649
 east half so that man still on 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.450
 High pressure area is on Saturday 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.129
 have a temperature around the 10 degrees 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.350
 On sunday it will be for the north and 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.090
 east a little bit colder 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 over five degrees are still 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.289
 otherwise certainly little changes in the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.449
 compared to saturday that is the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.440
 still cloudier the west 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.120
 clouds are still coming a bit 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.619
 further in the middle of germany 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.200
 but then you can be sure 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.700
 that it stays dry there too 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.500
 just not that any weekend 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.210
 is carnival or carnival 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 depending on what they say, look up 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.990
 exactly the three cities again something 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.720
 more exactly on it so the three boys 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.799
 düsseldorf cologne mainz of sunday so 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.750
 as already mentioned 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.159
 the day of the west half and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.590
 so that these three cities still 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.970
 many clouds brings a bit better 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 are the chances there maybe still in 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.460
 mainz that you can see the sun and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.950
 there is also the rain probability 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.990
 not quite as high as in düsseldorf and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.119
 cologne but it will not stop there either 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.530
 so much is just very sure 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.420
 you just can not be that it 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.100
 it stays dry until eight 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.360
 ten degrees 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.040
 actually just like on monday while you 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 Of course, that's what they have to say 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.430
 highest values ​​come in the afternoon 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.329
 The rose montagszüge is already called 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.740
 start in the morning 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.090
 there is still a bit in the morning 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.250
 colder so not directly that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.600
 donkey costume is still on 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.219
 a bit fresh but otherwise the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 chances for monday really very good 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.180
 that the sun comes out of it can 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.460
 stays dry yes and this comes out 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.530
 the sun can bring us directly 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.390
 to the next week how it goes then 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.030
 builds slowly but surely 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.800
 a new high-pressure area and makes 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.260
 then spread over germany 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 when 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.140
 thus, it is actually next week 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.230
 relatively similar to the last days 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.519
 that means you have sun but also 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.019
 just a lot of fog with it and on 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.480
 Some corners can also be back 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.640
 very persistent will not dissolve 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.569
 but if the sun comes out then has 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.120
 In any case, a bit already 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.810
 something like spring early spring 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.310
 spring 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.500
 the temperatures will go next 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.299
 Week rather mild as similar as 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.019
 now at ten degrees the sun 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.420
 comes out 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.069
 gray in the life course cold remains 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.060
 if you want to celebrate carnival then wish 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.730
 I have fun 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.730
 alaaf helau and arzu party come
