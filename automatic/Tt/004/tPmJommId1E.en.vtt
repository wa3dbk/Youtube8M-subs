25<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.799> older<00:01:02.159> model<00:01:02.579> they've<00:01:03.479> got<00:01:03.629> a

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
25 this is the older model they've got a

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.289 
25 this is the older model they've got a
near<00:01:03.839> bottle<00:01:04.289> out<00:01:04.440> that<00:01:04.680> has<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.299> fretboard

scoop<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:08.520> think<00:01:08.759> the<00:01:08.880> banjo<00:01:09.270> trim<00:01:09.539> is<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
scoop and I think the banjo trim is a

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.899 
scoop and I think the banjo trim is a
little<00:01:09.990> thinner<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.759> has
