00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.539
 typical musculitos with dignity sociologist 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.619
 scholar of popular cultures who went to live to jesus mari a 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.029
 time to rescue their symbolism and their stories the arrival of the Spaniards and 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.149
 the submission the foundation of a town of Christianized Indians are 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 topics that he masters and share with the team of untold stories 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.390
 we talked a little about 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.150
 of the origin of Jesus Mary is repeated is in all peoples 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.569
 which are founded by Spaniards 

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:47.060
 but what had 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.230
 I believe that the hypotheses and the archaeological works that we say 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.280
 they say it was before Mariah was accused and he jabbed but also an area 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 of warrior tribes castán this position muamar estimated efficient 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.150
 what is interesting is that within the ceramics found in all these 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.800
 zones because it is a ceramic very influenced by the Celtiberian culture 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.830
 and is characterized by a red ceramic 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.530
 that is called in terms let's say logical talent is called pseudo 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.950
 provisions has figures of origins that will later refer us to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.920
 Mexican television then from ceramics can be quoted that 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.430
 have that 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 do not give us that cultural influence 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.259
 jesus maria was the third indigenous community found in aguascalientes 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.729
 Its original name was Jesus Maria de los Dolores and was founded in a place 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.290
 known as with mac karthy that 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.430
 I like Westeros de la ville de aguascalientes 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.240
 that belonged to the mayorazgo of ciénega de mata for that purpose that 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.249
 comes from the expression are more expensive 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.170
 what does it mean 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.160
 onion 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.330
 and the goal that is the place where the onions exist I had the 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.569
 opportunity to meet with master lion porthole 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.479
 is one of the new terms and historians of indigenous culture 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.490
 min 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.859
 very prestigious our country 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:14.109
 he said to him allegorically Jonas Piatti which means the place where 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.850
 live the owners of the onions 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.119
 the sun 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:18.769
 founded by indigenous 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.809
 dechristianized sixth 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:25.369
 the reality because they would already neutralized the warrior tribes their 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:26.480
 northern goals 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.609
 where already the falsification of the signatures 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.509
 course of the united states and canada was founded 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.369
 because it is a group of non-amorous Indians 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:40.319
 efe did not find the exact and precise term that means not died 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.599
 burke itself this region 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.959
 belonging to the great Chichimeca because it was inhabited, which is why Chile is 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.809
 caxcanes 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.249
 fcc if there were still marauding assets but they were 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.469
 a group of indigenous people met and asked 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.839
 to one of the great 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.259
 potentates the time landlords

 Captain 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:03.639
 in with vallarta 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.629
 some land is requested so that this one that melts its town is a town of 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:09.369
 Indians

 josé corner gallardo 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:15.899
 owner of the link was given about two thousand hectares to smoke the town in

 1699 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:21.269
 the crew tried 1701 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.090
 It is very well documented in doing so the actual cedula of the delivery of land 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.399
 land table 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.269
 p was given in exchange for a job 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.849
 although I do not know how you do not understand that situation because I'll give you if not 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.579
 you work but well that's how it was 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.899
 believes that the current phase of his specialty 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.639
 December 2 of the same year 1701 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.449
 the town of jesus maría fountains the town that seconds after san 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.859
 jose de gracia and after the town of San Marcos and others that has already exposed to 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.169
 the problems already seem to the states 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.380
 which was precisely san jose from the island el monte grande 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.980
 in 1701 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.120
 week recognize where you should be founded in the central part first 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.449
 picture of the town 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:08.149
 whose main promoter was the indigenous cacique macías salcedo and moctezuma de 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.089
 fact there is a controversial Don Alejandro topete the church 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.590
 I have already laughed at him claimed that his deepest surname 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.590
 that were respected by the Spanish given that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.540
 because to some extent relatives descended from the king and he brought 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.509
 bystander the faith respect and why celestial 2 1 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.139
 your last name

 heras 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.400
 pichetto access some very interesting document how a town of 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.020
 Sudan and how to get how to create a town in which the king was asked 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.409
 is 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.620
 on the list of who were the ones who had 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.770
 chile would be the lands already when they were asked the doe night we are going to 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.720
 populate this new town and we are all Catholics from the sidewalk of the commission 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.719
 What is it 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.280
 Christianized once they were already 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.949
 its good people that all protocols are already 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.979
 they gave them possession and they came and took Kate 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.120
 this seated to the water towards means a rituals of in a summit which of the 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.710
 foundation of a village was not normal would come percentage divide 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.880
 the plots to the families you will start to create what for them was the most 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.680
 important 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.070
 which was his church if this serial structure of the colonial towns 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.080
 always the church comes from the main point and from there around 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.099
 sir with dante who are 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.050
 this one of the main 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.039
 hierarchs of the church but also of the Spanish government those of always is 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.589
 a Spanish textile plaza which we have as background 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.339
 in the place a bell had been placed to indicate 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:44.249
 did not tell me that the temple for jesus maria the temple was fundamental 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.189
 since until then the religious services had to go and in the 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:52.129
 administration of sacraments to the village of the assumption of the waters 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:57.089
 hot who also works to locate the affected the real couple 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.789
 besides the waters 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:04.810
 River San Pedro and the arsenal last Saturday night against 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.180
 The bridge of St. Ignatius is famously built 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.600
 people count and renal is an architectural work and really was the 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.330
 link that you could join 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.930
 al populated by name jesus maria 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.369
 with the villa of our lady of the assumption 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:25.069
 from the hot waters two after that bridge they finish temple restart it 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.219
 the works in 1735 

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.219
 zamora in 1750 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:37.520
 there is a 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.250
 question that many people do not know about 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.250
 we've mentioned enough is the challenger 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.559
 the altarpiece of san jose was originally designed by jara 

00:06:48.559 --> 00:06:52.159
 one of them the tall one of the sinister altars of him 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:54.389
 the parish of aguascalientes 

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.960
 but he predicted there was no problem because they looked for a place where 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.460
 accommodated where to install them and who was 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.419
 in the temple of our father jesus but all that part of history not 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.479
 It is very well written in English and the garden 

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.189
 I had real measurements 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:14.529
 that with the enlargement fashion and the remodeling that were erased those 

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:16.969
 measures but it was very good the bases of 

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:21.759
 sat the crown was very accurate from zaragoza to cope so much you know 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.780
 exactly 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.780
 with that day after the church 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.500
 they put a bell 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.499
 I imagine that in a music bell at that time 

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:33.009
 by the way that the torito where the temple is currently many people 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.999
 does not know that by activating we are sitting 

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:37.389
 It was a graveyard 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:40.110
 in the cemetery of the first settlers of 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.729
 the English village the sun 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:45.999
 we are all talking about the dgt months of this exercise 

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:55.839
 France
