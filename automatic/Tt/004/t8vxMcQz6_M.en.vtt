00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 whether it's a day you play in 

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.770
 advance to the Adriatic stadium is 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.450
 scene the challenge with the pescara one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
 positive series training designed by 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.290
 eight rounds and in the last three games has 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.380
 conquered three victories a challenge 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 impossible to win which bortolo 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 mutti relies on 4 3 3 with melchiori 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.150
 pasquato and boasted in the trident 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.740
 cupaioli osuji in midfield ceccarelli 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.779
 blessed legates and lasko in defense 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.519
 in front of the goalkeeper mazzoni mazzoni 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 you immediately see him in this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.599
 exit to anticipate no manor 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 problem for him this punishment 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.840
 beaten from pasquato there is an action with the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.430
 ball that is put back in between 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.350
 boasted and then on the second pole 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.640
 melchiorri fails to correct in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.710
 net the padua also protests for a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.050
 touch of hand of the defense of the pescara 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.640
 but the referee ghersini di genova says that 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.530
 however you can continue melchiorri 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.160
 I could certainly correct in 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.010
 network 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.360
 better this ball and take advantage of the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 better this time the cross from the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.469
 right by the pescara still in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.739
 forward with manor at the exit again 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.020
 providential of mazzoni 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.760
 on the attacker of the pescara still la 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 pescara who tries on the left with 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.900
 ragusa rossi arrives and collides connected 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.030
 for the referee it is a penalty kick 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 connected penalty kick that raises the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
 arms is also admonished says are 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.450
 I could not help but stop 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 to avoid it and the referee instead has 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.140
 identified the details for the football of 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.060
 rigor the contact is there could be given 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.369
 don't give the referee gave it but look 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 here san luca mazzoni what does that parade 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.860
 pulls his former partner onto his manor 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.450
 he knows the apparatus well at the arno 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.520
 this rigor really in a way 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.460
 exceptional intuition the direction of the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.850
 very powerful balloon very angled and is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.439
 managed to push him back 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.299
 opposite he threw himself on the right then he has 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.579
 pushed the ball away on the left the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.340
 balloon was then removed from the 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.720
 defense didn't even show up 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.820
 corner kick for the pescara really 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.710
 a paratissima at the twenty-third of the 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.680
 first time for mazzoni who saves so 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 the padua from the possible advantage of the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.799
 pescara still on the left tries 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.750
 with reds 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.399
 the pescara enters this cross area 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.680
 inside and a manor that is just missing 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.320
 engagement in the heart of the small area 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.320
 the ball goes out then in a foul 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.150
 between the opposite side still the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.130
 padova that tries to maneuver on the right 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.050
 merchiori takes the ball jump a man ne 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.209
 jump two and then left from the limit 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.430
 area really ends up out of a 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.880
 breath a good padua put well in 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.800
 field 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.930
 pescara keeps the ball of the game but the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.420
 padua then succeeds in some restart 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.690
 even with this punishment of pasquato a 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.610
 become a little dangerous to have its say 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.560
 very much in this game 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.080
 difficult a game so far 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.030
 it is balanced with the padua that precisely 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.220
 managed to neutralize the kick of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.540
 rigor with mazzoni in padua but it is 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.820
 also managed to create some danger 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.520
 in this first half in the second half 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.680
 bortolo mutti immediately makes a first 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.480
 replacement outside tied in perna 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.190
 at the center of the parma defense that falls 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.930
 after two months of injury you see it in 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.820
 field again the place of legates in the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.400
 first time already warned he had provoked 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.380
 the very nervous rigor really for him 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.610
 an evening to forget to forget 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.100
 also for melchioris than al 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.140
 fourteenth collapses on the ground a 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.580
 leg pain says bad or hurts me 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.620
 fails to continue trial for 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.080
 few minutes to continue the game 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.190
 but he can't do it 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.320
 doctor to help him ride nassuato it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.480
 helps to get out carrying it with arms 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.130
 hoping of course it's nothing 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.410
 serious for him right now we are at 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.880
 fifteenth enters then already at al 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.769
 second change goes so for the 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.459
 padova that has already replaced tied with 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.350
 perna and you see it's merchi out 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.049
 hug with the doctor and get in a bit 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.329
 in its place the pescara still from the 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.370
 right the cross is the ball touched by 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.680
 firm that ends up on the pole with mazzoni 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.150
 which in any case was also manor ready 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.940
 to correct on the net 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.010
 let's review this cross and then the ball 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.959
 touched at the center of the pin area that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.760
 ends up straight on the extremely dangerous pole 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.170
 the Pescara at this juncture you see 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.090
 that word manor run around on the net 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.260
 but he can't make it then he clashes with 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.720
 mazzoni that will remain on the ground some 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.350
 minute but then he will get up again struck 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.440
 hand the punishment still on which one 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.010
 overcomes mazzoni the punishment beaten by 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.959
 bloom at the edge of the area 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.310
 this parade is really incredible too 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.060
 with the barrier that had moved the 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.739
 trajectory of the amazzoni mazzoni ball 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.299
 which however managed to guess the same a 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.510
 reject it from this other part there 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.910
 try pasquato fil from pole 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.610
 nothing even this punishment beaten 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.060
 from the attacker from the striker of the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.919
 padova from the vigonza playmaker here 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.419
 here we also see it from the bottom e 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.060
 just shortly after beating this one 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.070
 punishment fas pact will be replaced there 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.630
 will finally be the debut of Tommaso 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.580
 rocchi with padova's shirt we had to 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.930
 long awaited and at the twenty-ninth e 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.360
 second time it also takes his 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.100
 moment out pasquato in tommaso 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.919
 rocchi that immediately enters with the look 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.860
 right away from his instructions 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.000
 comrades for the position he will take 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.680
 he is the one in the field 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.270
 take his around him and see 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.580
 that immediately becomes dangerous to 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.169
 thirtieth steals this ball the slaves 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.810
 conclusion to the belardi goalkeeper 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.699
 what a misfortune he had really done everything 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.440
 perfectly stealing time from slaves 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.729
 rocchi to where he had to end it was 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.330
 found in front of the goalkeeper however 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.400
 pescara 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.070
 let's see this ball again 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.500
 rocchi that really is good at stealing the 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.810
 time to slaves rivals the ball but then 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.010
 not so good as good belardi 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.199
 however to close the mirror of the 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.630
 door against recently entered the former goes to 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.090
 score the goal of the pescara al 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.820
 thirty-fourth really a mistake from 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.310
 part of the leg unforgivable the leg 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.960
 too soft put on this ball that 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.760
 had to be removed in all 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.740
 ways had to be swept away 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:44.099
 instead you will see that if it does bounce 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.250
 front once then widens to raise 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.720
 the cuff and leg loses it and ne 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.699
 take advantage of the cutolo that is found on 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.620
 comfortable comfortable balloon on the left puts 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.260
 to sit mazzoni and then thread it 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.330
 in the corner where he looks for rallies in the 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.669
 osuji who had tried to go 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.930
 the advantage can stop him 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.810
 del pescara really a frozen shower 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.360
 for the padua 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.910
 which you find below you see that not cutolo 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.490
 rejoices with respect to his former team 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.990
 the padua tries again to 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.030
 at least try to break even 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.470
 and here he could do it because 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.570
 the referee awards a two-in-one penalty 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.889
 area for this back pass of a 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.530
 defender of the pescara to the goalkeeper 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.330
 belardi and you see that we are furious 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.169
 protests by players of the 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.460
 pescara 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.600
 but actually the back pass 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.430
 there is and it is really of slaves for velardi 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.139
 the back pass is there so there is the 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.460
 punishment beaten just by the limit 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.139
 small area with all players 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.639
 del pescara in barrier beats it 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.389
 boasted and cloned mandates of what 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.169
 It happens 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:44.840
 on the repetition of iori there is a touch of 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:46.490
 hand and on the ball returned to the center by 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.960
 a little bit there is another touch of hand 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.190
 in the feeling of the players 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.050
 del pescara 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.720
 the referee sees nothing bortolo mutti 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:57.550
 enters the field to protest is really 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.479
 there is a group of paduan players 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.220
 unbelievers does not see from the look also 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.320
 of ceccarelli who goes to tom to the referee 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.669
 ghersini di genova to tell him that at least 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.020
 one of them had to be rigor 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.030
 the referee instead says no and 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.800
 indeed he actually goes to the 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.330
 padua bench goes to remove 

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.990
 bortolo mutti that had come out of his 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.580
 technical area to protest for this 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.440
 penalty not given double penalty 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.479
 let's review the action you see on the first one 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.490
 left there is already a touch of hand the 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.400
 ball rears up coming from this other 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:27.169
 part tried carla rocchi comes a little 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.690
 I was putting the touch of the hand in the middle 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.550
 it is really evident there was a kick 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.440
 of rigor also for the padua unfortunately 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.970
 for the referee it is not so and unfortunately for 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.380
 the padua ends 1 0 stops a 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.360
 five the strip of useful results 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.260
 the padua unfortunately not 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.260
