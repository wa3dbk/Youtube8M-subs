and so forth we can show you another one
here<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.960> would<00:01:52.380> give<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.100> an<00:01:53.220> idea<00:01:53.340> this

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
here that would give you an idea this

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.410 
here that would give you an idea this
one<00:01:54.560> would<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.590> let's<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> zoom<00:01:56.820> zoom<00:01:57.119> this

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
one would be let's do the zoom zoom this

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
one would be let's do the zoom zoom this
is<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.840> other<00:01:58.020> animated<00:01:58.619> version<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> other

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is the other animated version the other

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.590 
is the other animated version the other
one<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.610> custom<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.060> in<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.180> bottom<00:02:00.270> set

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
one just to custom see in the bottom set

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.319 
one just to custom see in the bottom set
so<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.100> zoom<00:02:02.549> zoom<00:02:02.820> which<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
so this one is the zoom zoom which is

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.130 
so this one is the zoom zoom which is
the<00:02:03.630> end<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.560> other<00:02:05.040> animated<00:02:05.640> version<00:02:06.149> of
