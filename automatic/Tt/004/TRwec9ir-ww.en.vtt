00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 Hi, today, I'll teach you with the nail 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.269
 turquoise mix with 11 and had zebra and to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:14.130
 just make super beautiful 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.550
 You will need to need 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.199
 white enamel does not turquoise than me 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.500
 I'm using turquoise but you can use 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.990
 color you want and acrylic paint 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.119
 using ink but you can 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.849
 replace with black enamel 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.980
 and to finish I'll use a little sparkle 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.890
 but you can also use only the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.079
 extra shine and to make the details of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.510
 I'm going to use a small scorer one 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.290
 fine wooden toothpick and a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.149
 nice decoration brush I already had 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.239
 commented on my the little pinkie and the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.539
 turquoise ring and indicator 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.710
 white and thumb also white 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.719
 had passed the nail polishes and Karen 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.840
 Medium I'll do the same I did in the little pinkie 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.600
 I'll make the zebra print with the ink 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 and the brush on the channel already has a video 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.490
 how to make a zebra nail 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.920
 I'll leave it in the information box but 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.790
 basically make lines on one side and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.790
 on the other of the nail 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.939
 now in the window I tried white and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.600
 I'll make a yes on every nail I 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.520
 I will make 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.920
 the blotches had not I will not put 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.990
 no color in the middle and here in the channel 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 also has specific video 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.350
 explaining how to make a yes is also 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.350
 I'll leave it there in the information box. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.319
 It's good and not thumb. I'm going to do it too. 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.090
 A yes, I'll just use the turquoise 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.340
 start making the spots with the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.500
 small goleador since I 'm going to make a 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.500
 side of the nail I will not do the whole nail 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.350
 and now with a toothpick and the ink I go 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.620
 around the stains with the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.620
 leopard 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.660
 good and last I 'll apply one 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.270
 layer of that bright 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.850
 where I used ink because if you mess with 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.920
 water, then if you do not 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.050
 past the star shine the statin goes 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.880
 leaving then it is very important to spend a 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.950
 extra brightness or some brightness to 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.950
 to finish decorated of you use ink 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.620
 Good guys, that's how I stayed I hope 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.810
 really that you enjoyed it 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.430

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.600

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.780

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.470
