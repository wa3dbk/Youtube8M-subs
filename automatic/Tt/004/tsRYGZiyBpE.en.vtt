the sr-71 from black ops is one of the
most<00:00:28.060> game-changing<00:00:28.869> kill<00:00:29.140> streaks<00:00:29.439> that

most game-changing kill streaks that
anyone<00:00:29.949> had<00:00:30.099> ever<00:00:30.279> seen<00:00:30.669> Trek<00:00:31.390> really<00:00:31.750> pulled

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020

out an ace in the hole at the last
second<00:00:34.059> a<00:00:34.180> lot<00:00:34.510> of<00:00:34.540> people<00:00:34.750> were<00:00:34.989> used<00:00:35.230> to

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
second a lot of people were used to

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.619 
second a lot of people were used to
seeing<00:00:36.100> high<00:00:36.610> killstreaks<00:00:36.940> stuff<00:00:37.420> like

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
seeing high killstreaks stuff like

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.049 
seeing high killstreaks stuff like
chopper<00:00:38.110> gunner<00:00:38.320> seeing<00:00:38.829> a<00:00:39.010> c-130<00:00:39.640> s<00:00:39.790> and

really<00:00:40.829> kill<00:00:41.829> streaks<00:00:42.100> that<00:00:42.309> would<00:00:42.489> get<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:42.850> a

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
really kill streaks that would get you a

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.700 
really kill streaks that would get you a
ton<00:00:43.180> of<00:00:43.210> kills<00:00:43.600> but<00:00:43.960> they<00:00:44.170> had<00:00:44.320> never<00:00:44.500> seen

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
ton of kills but they had never seen

ton of kills but they had never seen
anything<00:00:44.979> quite<00:00:45.280> like<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.670> sr-71<00:00:46.390> it<00:00:47.110> was<00:00:47.290> a

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
anything quite like the sr-71 it was a

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.630 
anything quite like the sr-71 it was a
kill<00:00:47.559> streak<00:00:47.680> that<00:00:47.860> allowed<00:00:48.129> you<00:00:48.250> to<00:00:48.370> see<00:00:48.519> the

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
kill streak that allowed you to see the

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.670 
kill streak that allowed you to see the
enemy's<00:00:49.000> movements<00:00:49.629> in<00:00:49.750> real<00:00:50.019> time<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:50.589> were

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
enemy's movements in real time so were

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.110 
enemy's movements in real time so were
able<00:00:50.739> to<00:00:51.040> sneak<00:00:51.280> up<00:00:51.430> behind<00:00:51.489> them<00:00:51.970> and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
able to sneak up behind them and

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.149 
able to sneak up behind them and
honestly<00:00:52.780> it<00:00:52.960> was<00:00:53.079> one<00:00:53.229> of<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.409> most<00:00:53.559> fun<00:00:53.860> kill

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:54.159 
honestly it was one of the most fun kill

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.920 
honestly it was one of the most fun kill

black ops 2 came around people were

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.320 
black ops 2 came around people were
super<00:01:00.100> excited<00:01:00.189> that<00:01:00.549> a<00:01:00.670> version<00:01:01.119> of<00:01:01.239> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
orbital vsat in black ops 2 was a really

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.110 
orbital vsat in black ops 2 was a really
awesome<00:01:35.170> scorestreak<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.130> use<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.580> it<00:01:37.000> was

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
awesome scorestreak to use and it was

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.460 
awesome scorestreak to use and it was
one<00:01:37.270> of<00:01:37.300> those<00:01:37.420> scores<00:01:37.720> to<00:01:37.870> excite<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.170> ended

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
one of those scores to excite you ended

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.960 
one of those scores to excite you ended
up<00:01:38.560> using<00:01:38.770> if<00:01:39.010> you<00:01:39.040> wanted<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.460> get<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.729> higher

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
up using if you wanted to get the higher

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.149 
up using if you wanted to get the higher
score<00:01:40.330> streaks<00:01:40.720> like<00:01:40.840> D<00:01:41.140> dogs<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.830> swarm

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
score streaks like D dogs and the swarm

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.640 
score streaks like D dogs and the swarm
now<00:01:42.880> although<00:01:43.120> the<00:01:43.540> orbital<00:01:43.930> vsat<00:01:44.080> did<00:01:44.530> the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
now although the orbital vsat did the

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.190 
now although the orbital vsat did the
exact<00:01:44.979> same<00:01:45.010> things<00:01:45.520> as<00:01:45.700> it<00:01:45.850> did<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:46.270> black<00:01:46.930> ops

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
exact same things as it did in black ops

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.800 
exact same things as it did in black ops
1<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:48.010> actually<00:01:48.310> costed<00:01:48.940> more<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.330> try<00:01:49.510> to<00:01:49.570> get

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
1 it actually costed more to try to get

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.390 
1 it actually costed more to try to get
well<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.260> increased<00:01:50.830> amount<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.190> kills

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
well this increased amount of kills

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.640 
well this increased amount of kills
needed<00:01:51.880> prevent<00:01:52.750> this<00:01:52.900> streak<00:01:53.260> from<00:01:53.440> being

your<00:03:28.500> road<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.400> next<00:03:29.730> orbital<00:03:30.180> vsat<00:03:30.360> your

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
your road to the next orbital vsat your

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.860 
your road to the next orbital vsat your
video<00:03:31.560> vsat<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.130> unlocked<00:03:32.520> at<00:03:32.670> level<00:03:32.700> 42<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.750> it

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
video vsat is unlocked at level 42 so it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.300 
video vsat is unlocked at level 42 so it
is<00:03:34.020> one<00:03:34.230> of<00:03:34.320> those<00:03:34.410> core<00:03:34.709> streets<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:35.100> you<00:03:35.160> have

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
is one of those core streets so you have

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.740 
is one of those core streets so you have
to<00:03:35.400> kind<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.610> struggle<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.120> get<00:03:36.330> again<00:03:36.720> I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
to kind of struggle and get again I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.180 
to kind of struggle and get again I
think<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.230> way<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.380> York<00:03:37.770> was<00:03:37.920> trying<00:03:38.130> to

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
think it's a way that York was trying to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.770 
think it's a way that York was trying to
balance<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.670> game<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.209> can<00:03:39.360> only<00:03:39.480> use<00:03:39.570> the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
balance the game you can only use the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.570 
balance the game you can only use the
vsat<00:03:40.140> once<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.620> once<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:40.980> call<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.370> in<00:03:41.490> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
vsat once so once you call it in you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.070 
vsat once so once you call it in you
gotta<00:03:41.760> really<00:03:41.970> take<00:03:42.239> advantage<00:03:42.390> of<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.870> as

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
gotta really take advantage of it as

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.750 
gotta really take advantage of it as
well<00:03:43.320> just<00:03:43.560> like<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.800> did<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.070> black<00:03:44.280> ops<00:03:44.459> one

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
well just like you did in black ops one

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.810 
well just like you did in black ops one
with<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.269> sr-71<00:03:46.019> in<00:03:46.440> order<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.310> unlock<00:03:47.610> the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
with the sr-71 in order to unlock the

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.150 
with the sr-71 in order to unlock the
orbital<00:03:48.239> vsat<00:03:48.420> you<00:03:48.810> had<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.110> get<00:03:49.260> 1200<00:03:49.920> points

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
orbital vsat you had to get 1200 points

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.640 
orbital vsat you had to get 1200 points
which<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.910> the<00:03:51.120> equivalent<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.720> 12<00:03:52.080> kill<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.560> it

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
which is the equivalent of 12 kill so it

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.020 
which is the equivalent of 12 kill so it
was<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:52.860> score<00:03:53.190> streak<00:03:53.430> that<00:03:53.550> you<00:03:53.640> had<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.850> kind

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
was a score streak that you had to kind

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.699 
was a score streak that you had to kind
of<00:03:54.090> struggle<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.630> get<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.200> man<00:03:55.470> was<00:03:55.680> it

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
of struggle to get to but man was it

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.850 
of struggle to get to but man was it
really<00:03:56.519> rewarding<00:03:57.209> like<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.660> sr-71<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.650> black

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
really rewarding like the sr-71 in black

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.280 
really rewarding like the sr-71 in black
ops<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.340> orbital<00:03:59.700> vsat<00:03:59.880> in<00:04:00.300> black<00:04:00.540> ops<00:04:00.750> 2<00:04:00.900> also

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
ops the orbital vsat in black ops 2 also

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.440 
ops the orbital vsat in black ops 2 also
lasts<00:04:01.680> 45<00:04:02.100> seconds<00:04:02.820> and<00:04:02.970> allows<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.360> to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
lasts 45 seconds and allows you to

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.360 
lasts 45 seconds and allows you to
clearly<00:04:03.720> see<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.050> enemy's<00:04:04.530> position<00:04:05.130> and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
clearly see the enemy's position and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.210 
clearly see the enemy's position and
location<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.360> one<00:04:06.930> steals<00:04:07.200> 45<00:04:07.769> seconds

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
location so one steals 45 seconds

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.949 
location so one steals 45 seconds
started<00:04:08.549> up<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.850> have<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.090> really<00:04:09.299> rush<00:04:09.630> in

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
started up you have to really rush in

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.780 
started up you have to really rush in
and<00:04:09.989> try<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.380> get<00:04:10.620> into<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.950> spawn<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.580> order

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
and try to get into the spawn in order

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.580 
and try to get into the spawn in order
to<00:04:11.910> try<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.090> build<00:04:12.390> up<00:04:12.600> to<00:04:12.750> get<00:04:12.900> another<00:04:13.140> v<00:04:13.350> set

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
to try to build up to get another v set

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.020 
to try to build up to get another v set
which<00:04:13.799> is<00:04:13.920> something<00:04:14.100> that<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.430> could<00:04:14.610> not<00:04:14.790> do

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
which is something that you could not do

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.780 
which is something that you could not do
in<00:04:15.269> black<00:04:15.900> ops<00:04:16.109> 1<00:04:16.260> again<00:04:17.010> just<00:04:17.220> like<00:04:17.370> its<00:04:17.580> black

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
in black ops 1 again just like its black

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.759 
in black ops 1 again just like its black
ops<00:04:18.000> 1<00:04:18.090> counterpart<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> orbital<00:04:19.290> vsat<00:04:19.440> is<00:04:19.739> a

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
ops 1 counterpart the orbital vsat is a

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.620 
ops 1 counterpart the orbital vsat is a
super<00:04:20.160> easy<00:04:20.190> score<00:04:20.760> suit<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.180> use<00:04:21.359> you

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
super easy score suit to use you

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.659 
super easy score suit to use you
basically<00:04:22.049> call<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.890> that's<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.310> you

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
basically call it in and that's it you

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.040 
basically call it in and that's it you
run<00:04:23.940> towards<00:04:24.180> the<00:04:24.240> enemy<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.660> do<00:04:24.780> as<00:04:24.900> much

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
run towards the enemy and do as much

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.200 
run towards the enemy and do as much
work<00:04:25.290> as<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.590> can<00:04:25.800> before<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.460> runs<00:04:26.640> out<00:04:26.880> so

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
work as you can before it runs out so

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.580 
work as you can before it runs out so
you<00:04:27.270> have<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.570> really<00:04:27.600> take<00:04:28.020> advantage<00:04:28.140> of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
you have to really take advantage of

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.370 
you have to really take advantage of
those<00:04:28.740> 45<00:04:29.310> seconds<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.810> which<00:04:30.990> one<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.229> these

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
those 45 seconds so which one of these

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.260 
those 45 seconds so which one of these
two<00:04:31.440> streaks<00:04:31.979> do<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.220> guys<00:04:32.370> think<00:04:32.700> was<00:04:33.030> better

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
two streaks do you guys think was better

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.540 
two streaks do you guys think was better
do<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.510> think<00:04:33.600> maybe<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.260> sr-71<00:04:35.010> from

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
do you think maybe that the sr-71 from

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.100 
do you think maybe that the sr-71 from
black<00:04:35.729> ops<00:04:35.940> one<00:04:36.150> was<00:04:36.300> better<00:04:36.479> because<00:04:36.900> you

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
black ops one was better because you

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.600 
black ops one was better because you
were<00:04:37.229> able<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.530> call<00:04:37.710> it<00:04:37.860> in<00:04:37.979> with<00:04:38.190> fewer

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
were able to call it in with fewer

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.490 
were able to call it in with fewer
amount<00:04:38.970> of<00:04:39.090> kills<00:04:39.330> or<00:04:39.570> do<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.050> think<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
amount of kills or do you think that the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.350 
amount of kills or do you think that the
orbital<00:04:40.890> vsat<00:04:41.040> from<00:04:41.460> black<00:04:41.640> ops<00:04:41.850> 2<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.150> better

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
orbital vsat from black ops 2 is better

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.270 
orbital vsat from black ops 2 is better
because<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.870> extra<00:04:43.229> perks<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.620> had<00:04:43.860> like

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
because of the extra perks it had like

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.460 
because of the extra perks it had like
being<00:04:44.580> able<00:04:44.729> to<00:04:44.880> get<00:04:45.030> multiple<00:04:45.270> V<00:04:45.720> sets<00:04:46.020> in<00:04:46.200> one

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.730 
which one you guys think is better maybe
you<00:04:51.570> just<00:04:51.720> think<00:04:51.870> that<00:04:52.050> one<00:04:52.200> was<00:04:52.350> just<00:04:52.620> an

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
you just think that one was just an

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.740 
you just think that one was just an
overall<00:04:53.070> better<00:04:53.310> streak<00:04:53.790> reward<00:04:54.210> or<00:04:54.570> maybe

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
overall better streak reward or maybe

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.300 
overall better streak reward or maybe
you<00:04:54.870> just<00:04:54.930> feel<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.290> one<00:04:55.590> was<00:04:55.770> just<00:04:55.980> more

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
you just feel that one was just more

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.430 
you just feel that one was just more
easier<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.330> use<00:04:57.540> or<00:04:57.750> maybe<00:04:57.900> one<00:04:58.110> was<00:04:58.260> just

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
easier to use or maybe one was just

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.020 
easier to use or maybe one was just
easier<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.860> get<00:04:59.100> leave<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.490> in<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.670> comments

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
see what you guys think which one of

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.030 
see what you guys think which one of
these<00:05:03.270> was<00:05:03.660> actually<00:05:04.110> the<00:05:04.260> better<00:05:04.470> streak

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
these was actually the better streak

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.070 
these was actually the better streak
reward<00:05:05.520> so<00:05:06.000> anyways<00:05:06.330> which<00:05:06.600> one<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:06.840> these<00:05:07.020> two

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
reward so anyways which one of these two

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.170 
reward so anyways which one of these two
streak<00:05:07.590> rewards<00:05:07.740> was<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> better<00:05:08.580> one<00:05:08.850> was<00:05:09.060> that

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
streak rewards was a better one was that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.680 
streak rewards was a better one was that
the<00:05:09.300> sr-71<00:05:09.990> or<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:11.070> orbital<00:05:11.490> V<00:05:11.640> set<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.180> the

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
the sr-71 or the orbital V set and the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.250 
the sr-71 or the orbital V set and the
winner<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.800> sr-71<00:05:14.520> from<00:05:14.970> black<00:05:15.180> ops<00:05:15.420> 1<00:05:15.540> now

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
winner is the sr-71 from black ops 1 now

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.840

this all-powerful kill streak that you
could<00:05:33.870> use<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.290> when<00:05:34.410> people<00:05:34.680> first<00:05:34.860> started
