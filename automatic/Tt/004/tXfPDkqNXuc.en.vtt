basically CF 37 pocket with a little bit
of<00:02:25.660> modification<00:02:26.110> because<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:27.760> head<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.120> a

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
of modification because the head is a

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.300 
of modification because the head is a
bit<00:02:28.239> wider<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> bit<00:02:29.080> longer<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.980> kind<00:02:30.250> of

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
bit wider and a bit longer so I kind of

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.540 
bit wider and a bit longer so I kind of
made<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.489> total<00:02:30.880> shift<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.209> bit<00:02:31.360> more<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:33.370> there's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
made a total shift a bit more so there's

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.650 
made a total shift a bit more so there's
that<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.819> think<00:02:34.150> that's<00:02:34.209> probably<00:02:34.390> all<00:02:34.599> the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
that I think that's probably all the
