back wheel off you can do it without
pegs<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:17.520> would<00:00:17.640> look<00:00:17.730> like<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:20.840> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

slide<00:01:10.030> got<00:01:11.030> to<00:01:11.120> get<00:01:11.210> a<00:01:11.240> lot<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.510> speed<00:01:11.780> or<00:01:12.650> a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
slide got to get a lot of speed or a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.730 
slide got to get a lot of speed or a
comfortable<00:01:13.310> amount<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.580> speed<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:15.290> think

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
comfortable amount of speed and I think

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.310 
comfortable amount of speed and I think
it's<00:01:15.860> easier<00:01:16.160> if<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:16.340> put<00:01:16.930> must<00:01:17.930> be<00:01:18.050> weight<00:01:18.170> on

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
it's easier if you put must be weight on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.630 
it's easier if you put must be weight on
the<00:01:18.410> back<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.070> then<00:01:19.220> yeah<00:01:20.170> you're<00:01:21.280> in<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.340> back
