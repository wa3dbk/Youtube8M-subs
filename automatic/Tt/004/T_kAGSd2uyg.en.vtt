here<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> typical<00:00:16.680> inline<00:00:17.220> fuel<00:00:17.580> pump

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
here we have a typical inline fuel pump

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.820 
here we have a typical inline fuel pump
assembly<00:00:18.170> we're<00:00:19.170> gonna<00:00:19.380> walk<00:00:19.560> through<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
assembly we're gonna walk through the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.779 
assembly we're gonna walk through the
steps<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.250> order<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.609> replace<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:25.670> before<00:00:26.670> we

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
steps in order to replace that before we

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.759 
steps in order to replace that before we
begin<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> repair<00:00:27.570> tool<00:00:28.080> or<00:00:28.199> remove<00:00:28.560> the
