 this is will miller 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.309
 from firaxis games one of the leading 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.640
 Designers of the game 7 are really looking for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.690
 Bender by older is a new game from the series. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.090
 civilization 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.949
 you will lead a colony of earthlings seeking a home 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.710
 in the alien world and discover a new 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.689
 chapter in the history of mankind in this 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.640
 the moment we play the alpha version in it 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.029
 not all graphics are ready and present 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 bugs 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.989
 to the exit of the game these problems will be 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 eliminated here on profits on blooming 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.430
 alien planet on it with full magma 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.100
 crevices and miasma are dangerous natural 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.829
 factors besides there is a nest 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.539
 aliens this manticore alien 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.789
 who can attack from afar 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.770
 our researcher is not intended to 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.649
 battle besides we do not want once again 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 angry aliens let's study better 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.140
 resource capsule resource capsule 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
 were sent to this planet in advance 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 opening them we get valuable resources 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.780
 let's send ours for them 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.780
 research 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.690
 now you can see how you are 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.520
 our colony we will go through the world and you 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.520
 see what awaits you in the game 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.130
 this ford miller military garrison if 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.990
 we will build a trade route to it 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.120
 we will receive siege weapons as a reward 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.460
 new alien creature siege 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.950
 a worm crawling around the cage he can 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.870
 destroy the improvements there built it 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.630
 almost impossible to kill with one unit 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.880
 okay let's go our way also here 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.430
 many alien artifacts for example 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.870
 this huge skeleton 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.240
 send our researcher to him 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.470
 take a look through several moves 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.830
 researchers will finish work and we 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.840
 get technology resources reward or 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.840
 alien unit under our control 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.340
 we move to the capital as you see our 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.340
 the colony flourishes in the new world 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.200
 the city is surrounded by fruit plantations and 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.020
 vegetables that feed the people still here 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.380
 there is an improvement node and miracle vault 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.380
 genes 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.080
 the task requires you to decide the task 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.630
 this is a unique feature be an der 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.730
 with their help, players can line up 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.819
 the narrative we just completed 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.980
 task gifts from home in the games series 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.650
 civilization story develops 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.060
 thanks to the actions of the players task 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.550
 bring additional context 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.980
 allows you to make a meaningful choice 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.459
 those bringing your faction 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.860
 benefits let's get down to new assignment 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.630
 under the name of confidentially we 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.670
 built in the capital take intelligence and 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.300
 ready to send an agent to the city central 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.220
 American relocation company 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.470
 our agent goes to central there he is 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.150
 will begin to increase the level of intrigue than 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.959
 the higher this level, the wider our 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.480
 opportunities 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.430
 from simple surveillance and smuggling operations 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.470
 we move on to more complicated ones for example 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.049
 install devices that will attract 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.540
 city siege worms secret operations 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.790
 play an important role in the relationship with 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.250
 the other factions will now talk about 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.769
 perfection perfection is possible 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.019
 human development paths and related 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.269
 There are three changes in the world 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.880
 perfect harmony righteousness and 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.280
 superiority we have chosen superiority 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.329
 the belief that people do not depend on the world 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.590
 who inhabit 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:51.600
 our civilization believes that technology 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.690
 augmentation and cybernetics will help us 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.150
 populate any world this is reflected and in 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.640
 the architecture of our cities and in the outer 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.890
 the form of our combat units can 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.840
 get different points of excellence 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.269
 find in resource capsules 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.540
 special objects to excavate 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.370
 ruins or develop technology last 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.620
 the way is most true 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.840
 we don't know which way will go 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.079
 humanity therefore created in the game 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.359
 technical network you start the middle and 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.440
 moving to more exotic 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.900
 technologies 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.240
 the network is divided into branches and leaves by 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.220
 perfection icons you can see which 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.680
 the leaves will allow him to approach 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.810
 let's start exploring another technology 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.910
 superiority now let's talk to 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.220
 leaders opted for 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.050
 perfection as you can see fielding dressed in 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.090
 free dress and laurel wreath 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.550
 referring to the classic past 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.890
 land she devoted herself to righteousness and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.290
 her faction believes that this world is needed 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.150
 to transform the habitual people into the new land 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.520
 fielding is in another part 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:59.040
 continent therefore excites us less 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:01.410
 than the rest of the leaders ator jama bars 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.810
 from the African Peopleâ€™s Union dressed in 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.970
 green clothes and a built in his head 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.920
 interface and its faction has chosen 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.410
 perfect harmony and wants 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.260
 be like the local creatures using 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.420
 genetic modification and splicing we 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.580
 as supporters of superiority we consider 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.370
 that being attached to one planet is very 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.290
 shortsighted bar and placed cities 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.630
 next to vital for us 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.669
 peroxide fraction resources 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.580
 excellence uses firaxis for 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:31.790
 creating powerful combat units and buildings 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.880
 at the bars refused to sell it to us 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:38.669
 I'll have to take our wars by force 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.800
 liberators their appearance reflect 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.990
 excellence excellence and more importantly 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.440
 all supported by tactical 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.050
 satellite we launched this tactical 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.570
 satellite into orbit to help units in 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.270
 attacking it will heal them and add 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:57.540
 barrel battle bonuses should be destroyed 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.850
 its primarily as we develop 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.550
 we can open other types of satellites 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:05.160
 not only the military with their help 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:11.060
 will scrub the miasm accelerate 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.060
 research and so on let's start the attack 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.430
 the suit killed he acted out 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.110
 cities bari freed and others early 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.910
 or later too will fall and we will continue 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:35.310
 its triumphant march 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.560
 thank you for watching the cid video at home 

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.070
 mars civilizations be in door will be released 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.070
 this autumn
