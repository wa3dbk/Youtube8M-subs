00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
overall performance like I said will go

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.469 
overall performance like I said will go
upwards<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.920> saying<00:01:23.340> has<00:01:23.640> always<00:01:23.909> stayed<00:01:24.330> in

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
upwards this saying has always stayed in

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.289 
upwards this saying has always stayed in
my<00:01:24.570> head<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.850> only<00:01:27.030> as

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
my head and it is that you're only as

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
my head and it is that you're only as
good<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.200> weakest<00:01:28.650> link<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:29.009> your<00:01:29.130> team

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
good as the weakest link on your team

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
now you can take this from a team

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
now you can take this from a team
perspective<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.950> as<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.220> trait<00:01:32.490> perspective<00:01:33.090> if

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299

really<00:01:44.549> bad<00:01:44.700> player<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.780> team<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.229> have

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
really bad player on your team you have

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
really bad player on your team you have
to<00:01:46.649> help<00:01:46.799> them<00:01:47.009> improve<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
to help them improve because then the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.090 
to help them improve because then the
worst<00:01:48.509> player<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.960> your<00:01:49.079> team<00:01:49.140> isn't<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:49.920> bad

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
worst player on your team isn't that bad

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.149 
worst player on your team isn't that bad
anymore<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.409> focus<00:01:52.770> on

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
anymore so you have to really focus on

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.190 
anymore so you have to really focus on
what<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.610> improve<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> what<00:01:54.570> am<00:01:54.659> i<00:01:54.780> doing

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
what can I improve and what am i doing

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.080 
what can I improve and what am i doing
that<00:01:55.530> way<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:56.040> overall<00:01:56.399> performance<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that way your overall performance is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.730 
that way your overall performance is
better<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.780> closer<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.320> where<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> want

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
better and your closer to where you want

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.130 
better and your closer to where you want
to<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> previous<00:02:00.149> video<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.450> spoke<00:02:00.689> to

you guys about scenarios this next part

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.300 
you guys about scenarios this next part
is<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.840> mastering<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.590> skill<00:02:04.860> which<00:02:05.189> is

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
is the mastering of that skill which is

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.300 
is the mastering of that skill which is
called<00:02:05.579> resiliency<00:02:06.420> being<00:02:07.259> able<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.829> flip<00:02:08.129> an

what<00:02:10.909> you<00:02:11.030> want<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.269> do<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.510> dissect<00:02:11.719> what<00:02:12.200> the

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
what you want to do is dissect what the

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.199 
what you want to do is dissect what the
other<00:02:12.469> players<00:02:12.709> are<00:02:12.860> doing<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.400> win<00:02:13.610> what<00:02:14.060> is

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
other players are doing to win what is

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.110 
other players are doing to win what is
working<00:02:14.420> for<00:02:14.569> them<00:02:14.840> now<00:02:15.739> each<00:02:15.890> strategy<00:02:16.430> has

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
working for them now each strategy has

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
working for them now each strategy has
weaknesses<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.140> can<00:02:18.379> exploit<00:02:18.769> and<00:02:19.129> you

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
weaknesses that you can exploit and you

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.069 
weaknesses that you can exploit and you
want<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.609> be<00:02:19.730> able<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:20.180> that<00:02:20.359> and<00:02:20.599> learn<00:02:20.870> how

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
want to be able to do that and learn how

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.009 
want to be able to do that and learn how
to<00:02:21.219> here<00:02:22.219> is<00:02:22.340> an<00:02:22.459> example<00:02:22.969> your<00:02:23.659> team<00:02:23.900> is

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
to here is an example your team is

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.630 
to here is an example your team is
getting<00:02:24.140> cornered<00:02:24.739> by<00:02:24.890> another<00:02:25.129> enemy<00:02:25.370> team

getting cornered by another enemy team

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.190 
getting cornered by another enemy team
because<00:02:25.939> they<00:02:26.090> are<00:02:26.209> being<00:02:26.390> offensive<00:02:26.780> and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
because they are being offensive and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.339 
because they are being offensive and

pushing up on you guys being able to go
around<00:02:30.470> flank<00:02:31.069> them<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.700> an<00:02:32.420> example<00:02:32.720> of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
around flank them is an example of

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.020 
around flank them is an example of
exploiting<00:02:33.829> a<00:02:34.010> disadvantage<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:34.879> their
