00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
even consciously but I think that

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.960 
even consciously but I think that
looking<00:05:13.580> back<00:05:13.790> at<00:05:14.030> this<00:05:14.660> period<00:05:14.990> of<00:05:15.140> my<00:05:15.229> life

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
looking back at this period of my life

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.550 
looking back at this period of my life
I've<00:05:16.970> taken<00:05:17.330> in<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.720> little<00:05:17.990> here<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.530> little

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
I've taken in a little here and a little

I've taken in a little here and a little
there<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:19.340> then<00:05:19.490> try<00:05:19.789> that<00:05:19.970> as<00:05:20.930> honestly<00:05:21.440> as<00:05:21.650> I

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
there and then try that as honestly as I

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.230 
there and then try that as honestly as I
can<00:05:22.100> mix<00:05:22.340> it<00:05:22.550> with<00:05:22.669> my<00:05:22.880> own<00:05:23.919> personal<00:05:25.539> kind<00:05:26.539> of

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
can mix it with my own personal kind of

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.190 
can mix it with my own personal kind of
experience<00:05:29.240> in<00:05:29.479> life<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:31.240> how<00:05:32.240> I<00:05:32.270> see<00:05:32.840> it<00:05:32.870> and

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
experience in life and how I see it and

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.940 
experience in life and how I see it and
how<00:05:34.240> whatever<00:05:35.240> my<00:05:35.539> skill<00:05:35.870> level<00:05:36.289> is<00:05:36.410> it<00:05:36.650> allows

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
how whatever my skill level is it allows

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.420 
how whatever my skill level is it allows
me<00:05:36.979> to<00:05:37.720> push<00:05:38.720> it<00:05:38.870> as<00:05:38.960> far<00:05:38.990> as<00:05:39.229> I<00:05:39.410> can<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:39.950> then<00:05:40.400> I

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
me to push it as far as I can and then I

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.779 
me to push it as far as I can and then I
come<00:05:40.729> up<00:05:40.760> with<00:05:40.910> my<00:05:41.090> ship<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:42.020> foods<00:05:42.500> it's<00:05:43.490> not

rudimentary kind of elements down of the

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.659 
rudimentary kind of elements down of the
water<00:05:51.260> is<00:05:51.410> going<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.650> go<00:05:51.770> like<00:05:51.979> this<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:52.430> boats

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
water is going to go like this the boats

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.670 
water is going to go like this the boats
going<00:05:52.970> to<00:05:53.030> be<00:05:53.120> tilted<00:05:53.660> because<00:05:53.780> I<00:05:53.990> originally

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
going to be tilted because I originally
