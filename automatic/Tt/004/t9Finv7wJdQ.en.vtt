00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
what's going on guys here's the protein

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.299 
what's going on guys here's the protein
skimmer<00:00:05.190> I've<00:00:05.520> built<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:05.970> month<00:00:06.270> ago<00:00:07.220> as<00:00:08.220> you

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
skimmer I've built a month ago as you

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.490 
skimmer I've built a month ago as you
can<00:00:08.490> see<00:00:08.670> it's<00:00:08.820> working<00:00:08.970> really<00:00:09.450> well<00:00:09.750> still

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.140 

see<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.620> pulling<00:00:13.889> out<00:00:14.130> stuff<00:00:14.340> there<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.790> can

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
see it pulling out stuff there I can

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.970 
see it pulling out stuff there I can
slow<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.450> down<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.780> little<00:00:16.049> bit<00:00:16.199> if<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.500> if<00:00:16.800> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
slow it down a little bit if I if I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.500 
slow it down a little bit if I if I
wanted<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.789> I'm<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.180> keep<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.480> like

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
wanted to but I'm going to keep it like

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.400 
wanted to but I'm going to keep it like
that<00:00:18.779> for<00:00:18.840> now

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.089 

now<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.669> kind<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.000> loud<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> did<00:00:25.829> some

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
now it can be kind of loud so I did some

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.490 
now it can be kind of loud so I did some
adjustments<00:00:28.489> if<00:00:29.489> you<00:00:29.669> look<00:00:29.820> at<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> cap<00:00:30.500> right

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
adjustments if you look at the cap right

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830 
adjustments if you look at the cap right
here<00:00:31.919> you'll<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.269> put<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.690> little

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
here you'll see that I put in a little

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.479 
here you'll see that I put in a little
air<00:00:34.199> cap<00:00:34.879> right<00:00:35.879> there<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.649> then<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.920> drilled<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
air cap right there and then I drilled a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.069 
air cap right there and then I drilled a
hole<00:00:38.519> right<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.360> side<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:39.839> cap

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
hole right here on this side of the cap

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.310 
hole right here on this side of the cap
and<00:00:42.589> connected<00:00:43.589> the<00:00:43.710> air<00:00:44.040> tube<00:00:44.339> there<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
and connected the air tube there and

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.009 
and connected the air tube there and
that<00:00:46.320> quieted<00:00:47.010> down<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:49.760> venturi<00:00:50.809> part<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
that quieted down the venturi part of

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.990 
that quieted down the venturi part of
the<00:00:52.470> pump<00:00:54.500> I'll<00:00:55.500> demonstrate<00:00:55.979> that<00:00:56.339> real<00:00:56.729> fast

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
the pump I'll demonstrate that real fast

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.079 
the pump I'll demonstrate that real fast
here<00:00:57.710> I'm<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.890> sure<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.339> can<00:00:59.460> hear<00:00:59.879> that

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
here I'm not sure if you can hear that

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.439 
here I'm not sure if you can hear that
very<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.869> it<00:01:01.619> got<00:01:02.580> significantly

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
very well but it got significantly

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.499 
very well but it got significantly
louder<00:01:04.189> when<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> took<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> air<00:01:06.060> cap<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
louder when I took up the air cap you

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.109 
louder when I took up the air cap you
can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.840> there's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.320> full<00:01:07.560> there

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.999 

and<00:01:10.960> they<00:01:11.710> got<00:01:11.890> way<00:01:12.219> quieter<00:01:13.829> also<00:01:14.829> put

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
and they got way quieter also put

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:22.639 
and they got way quieter also put
another<00:01:15.310> air<00:01:16.090> cap<00:01:16.479> here<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.909> air<00:01:19.329> too

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.410 

and<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> does<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.700> its<00:01:23.850> adjustments<00:01:24.329> this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and it does have its adjustments this

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.300 
and it does have its adjustments this
one<00:01:24.659> comes<00:01:24.929> with<00:01:25.109> the<00:01:25.560> air<00:01:26.310> tube<00:01:27.679> it<00:01:28.679> came<00:01:28.950> with

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
one comes with the air tube it came with

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.590 
one comes with the air tube it came with
the<00:01:29.549> actual<00:01:29.969> pump<00:01:30.420> itself<00:01:31.429> so<00:01:32.429> I<00:01:33.030> mean<00:01:33.420> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the actual pump itself so I mean that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.510 
the actual pump itself so I mean that
that's<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.140> already<00:01:34.679> there<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.250> use

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that's that's already there you can use

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.430 
that's that's already there you can use
that<00:01:35.729> immediately<00:01:36.569> pretty<00:01:36.869> much

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.670 

but<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.530> can<00:01:42.680> see<00:01:42.950> it's<00:01:43.130> working<00:01:43.310> really<00:01:43.730> well

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
but you can see it's working really well

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.120 
but you can see it's working really well
if<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:45.950> only<00:01:46.160> have<00:01:46.490> this<00:01:46.820> tube<00:01:47.300> in<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:48.740> only

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
if you only have this tube in it only

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.750 
if you only have this tube in it only
gives<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:50.210> know<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.860> small<00:01:51.860> percent<00:01:52.400> of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
gives you you know a small percent of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.700 
gives you you know a small percent of
the<00:01:53.180> bubbles<00:01:53.540> that<00:01:53.750> are<00:01:53.870> in<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.110> reaction

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
the bubbles that are in that reaction

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.940 
the bubbles that are in that reaction
chamber<00:01:55.040> right<00:01:55.280> now<00:01:56.200> but<00:01:57.200> once<00:01:57.470> you<00:01:57.680> add<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
chamber right now but once you add the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.250 
chamber right now but once you add the
other<00:01:58.510> air<00:01:59.510> -<00:02:00.910> you'll<00:02:01.910> get<00:02:02.260> significantly

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
other air - you'll get significantly

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.850 
other air - you'll get significantly
more<00:02:03.410> bubbles<00:02:04.720> so

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.670 

try<00:02:09.400> that<00:02:09.580> out
