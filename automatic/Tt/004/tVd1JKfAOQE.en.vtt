00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.250 
so in total I think it took me on and
off<00:05:10.270> but<00:05:10.720> a<00:05:11.580> month<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:13.060> do<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:15.960> whole<00:05:16.960> build

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.740 

it<00:05:21.550> could<00:05:21.760> have<00:05:21.880> taught<00:05:22.030> me<00:05:22.150> faster<00:05:22.600> what

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
it could have taught me faster what

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.430 
it could have taught me faster what
