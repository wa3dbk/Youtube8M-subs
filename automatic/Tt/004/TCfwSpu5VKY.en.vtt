00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hey, what's up, guys? 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.620
 I'm going to spend another night electro rock 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.959
 although it is one thing that many people have gone through badly 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.969
 I think there are still some people who do not know how to put a pm on the 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.619
 face with hair, eh 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.500
 style one thing so the look a different look on your computer 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.809
 It's way too simple for me, it's the easiest way to 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:29.809
 to put a tremendous amount of time your computer does not need any program 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.080
 it's a very easy thing you're going to lower 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.690
 in a donkey davi well on the site search any you search a pm 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.520
 What do you think, anything down there is cool? 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.710
 Sure it will come packed 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 have you make you draw 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.420
 in the premiere here 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.890
 the duckling line 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.220
 this sharing the session can both copy and cut and you know 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.150
 choose from you 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.150
 then those come here on the menu existed 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.460
 nor here and to test and since then this test here 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 This places here at the place in France it is better 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.439
 if it's two air points with the indus / reservations 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 and give it ok 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.430
 it's not open 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.770
 this atelier that year this screen she has all the pms you have of your 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.880
 computer 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.110
 then as you already will have run eight copied 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 the troops that were to stick here in this disease treated 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.100
 for what you do 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.240
 already the theme is recorded on your computer there so you can put it 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.060
 Click this folder 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.549
 and clicked on that icon which is a little brush 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.540
 Who will open the property right now? 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.550
 this is the style of the other 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.190
 of the term that I downloaded, attach an event to you, but the one that always goes 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.029
 style of the time you've downloaded 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.029
 I thought I came here to apply 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.039
 or charge 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.999
 Can you see that soon enough? 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:31.039
 will change since my start bar the buttons in the style of windows 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.979
 change the time on your computer 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.419
 relative and that exists today 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:44.419
 already changed buttons all too. 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.949
 and you're done, you just changed your 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:51.919
 cel pm if you want to go back to normal 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.469
 I ask you 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.469
 is to put the whole popping theme 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.509
 This is it people, to the air. 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:01.299
 has a small problem 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.449
 this case does not work 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.599
 It was not my turn to switch on your computer, which has a problem 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.230
 but when doing a second time of class that has another reason to do that 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.159
 missing is the program that there is 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.079
 in itself the liver system 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.250
 If you can do it for 100, we are concerned that your touch and 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.769
 Your theme is already fine 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.129
 now if you can not 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.339
 you 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.929
 watch next field video until teaching as holder and if they program 

00:03:30.929 --> 00:03:33.099
