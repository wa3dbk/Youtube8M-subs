00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
pretty similar to this it's called diva

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.780 
pretty similar to this it's called diva
and<00:03:54.360> it's<00:03:54.780> just<00:03:54.960> a<00:03:55.080> matte<00:03:55.290> lipstick<00:03:55.740> I<00:03:55.950> prefer

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790

a little bit of shine this time around

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.500 
a little bit of shine this time around
so<00:03:58.860> I'm<00:03:58.980> using<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.550> instead<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.940> diva<00:04:00.270> but

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
so I'm using this instead of diva but

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.120 
so I'm using this instead of diva but
otherwise<00:04:00.750> they're<00:04:01.140> pretty<00:04:01.650> close<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
otherwise they're pretty close to the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:08.930 
otherwise they're pretty close to the
same<00:04:02.220> color<00:04:06.950> so<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.070> is<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.280> finished<00:04:08.580> lip

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
same color so that is the finished lip

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.390 
same color so that is the finished lip
now<00:04:09.209> just<00:04:09.570> add<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> little<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.320> more<00:04:10.560> dramatic

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400
