today<00:01:35.650> pretty<00:01:36.520> well<00:01:36.760> I<00:01:36.790> think<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.300> we<00:01:37.390> could

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:37.510 
today pretty well I think that we could

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.030 
today pretty well I think that we could
have<00:01:37.630> done<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> little<00:01:38.020> bit<00:01:38.230> better<00:01:38.410> but<00:01:38.710> we<00:01:38.860> did

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
have done a little bit better but we did

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.530 
have done a little bit better but we did
our<00:01:39.160> program<00:01:39.550> when<00:01:39.730> we<00:01:39.820> tried<00:01:40.030> our<00:01:40.180> best<00:01:40.210> so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
our program when we tried our best so

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.630 
our program when we tried our best so
that's<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.870> main<00:01:41.050> thing<00:01:41.080> and<00:01:41.500> Australia<00:01:42.490> got

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
that's the main thing and Australia got

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.790 
that's the main thing and Australia got
bronze<00:01:42.910> today<00:01:43.300> how<00:01:43.540> does<00:01:43.690> that<00:01:43.840> feel<00:01:44.140> it<00:01:44.740> feels

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
bronze today how does that feel it feels

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.650 
bronze today how does that feel it feels
really<00:01:45.280> good<00:01:45.580> is<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.060> sum<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.240> us<00:01:46.420> is<00:01:46.570> that

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
really good is the sum of us is that

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.000 
really good is the sum of us is that
first<00:01:46.870> is<00:01:47.050> gelling<00:01:47.320> competition<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:47.890> it's

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
first is gelling competition so it's

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.380 
first is gelling competition so it's
really<00:01:48.160> good<00:01:48.370> to<00:01:48.400> walk<00:01:48.640> away<00:01:48.850> with<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.090> metal

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
really good to walk away with the metal

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.790 
really good to walk away with the metal
but<00:01:49.960> I<00:01:49.990> think<00:01:50.260> that<00:01:50.290> we<00:01:50.410> could<00:01:50.500> have<00:01:50.590> down<00:01:50.770> a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
but I think that we could have down a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.350 
but I think that we could have down a
little<00:01:50.950> bit<00:01:51.130> better<00:01:51.340> but<00:01:51.729> we<00:01:51.910> did<00:01:52.090> pretty<00:01:52.240> well

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
little bit better but we did pretty well

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.780 
little bit better but we did pretty well
over
