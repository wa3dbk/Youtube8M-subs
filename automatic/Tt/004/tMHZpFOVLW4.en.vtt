00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
this season he only played 54 games if

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.850 
this season he only played 54 games if
you<00:01:53.520> do<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> math<00:01:53.820> that's<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.680> 27<00:01:55.680> games

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
you do the math that's like 27 games

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.929 
you do the math that's like 27 games
miss<00:01:56.250> or<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.630> top<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.140> head<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.680> that

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
miss or so so up top of my head so that

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.730 
miss or so so up top of my head so that
honesty<00:01:59.939> is<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.840> caliber<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.439> were

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
honesty is not the caliber that were

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.800 
honesty is not the caliber that were

lived<00:02:14.159> in<00:02:14.370> too<00:02:14.489> much<00:02:14.670> damage<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.299> NBA

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
lived in too much damage in the NBA

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.920 
lived in too much damage in the NBA
Finals<00:02:16.230> was<00:02:16.769> primarily<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.459> LeBron<00:02:17.790> James<00:02:18.150> so

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
Finals was primarily on LeBron James so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.649 
Finals was primarily on LeBron James so
when<00:02:19.049> my<00:02:19.200> opinion<00:02:19.530> Dwyane<00:02:20.040> Wade<00:02:20.370> is<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:21.569> to

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
when my opinion Dwyane Wade is going to

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.479 
when my opinion Dwyane Wade is going to
have<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> decrease<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.560> raining<00:02:23.099> man<00:02:23.310> he's

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
have a decrease in raining man he's

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.030 
have a decrease in raining man he's
gonna<00:02:23.609> have<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.849> decrease<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.510> writing<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> 90

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
gonna have a decrease in writing to a 90

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.860 
gonna have a decrease in writing to a 90
I<00:02:26.310> think<00:02:26.730> he's<00:02:26.819> gonna<00:02:26.909> go<00:02:27.120> straight<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> 90

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
I think he's gonna go straight to a 90

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.929 
I think he's gonna go straight to a 90
he's<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.019> 91<00:02:28.469> you<00:02:29.069> know<00:02:29.159> it's<00:02:29.280> really<00:02:29.640> possible

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
he's a 91 you know it's really possible

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.170 
he's a 91 you know it's really possible
that<00:02:30.299> he's<00:02:30.569> gonna<00:02:30.689> stay<00:02:31.049> at<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.310> 91<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.060> my

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
that he's gonna stay at a 91 but in my

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.059 
that he's gonna stay at a 91 but in my
opinion<00:02:33.299> he<00:02:33.689> goes<00:02:33.870> down<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.439> 190<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
opinion he goes down to 190 a

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.920 
opinion he goes down to 190 a
straight-up<00:02:35.430> flat<00:02:35.760> night<00:02:36.000> calcium<00:02:36.659> going
