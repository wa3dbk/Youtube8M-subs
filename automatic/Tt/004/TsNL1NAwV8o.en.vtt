00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.410
 they are cookies with only three 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.420
 ingredients and very healthy let's see 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.700
 to make the cookies we will need 50 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.810
 grams of oatmeal a medium banana and 2 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.350
 spoonfuls of peanut butter 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.350
 natural 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.199
 we will start by crushing the banana 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.199
 until puree 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.110
 now we will add the two tablespoons of 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.980
 peanut butter and we will create them well 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.980
 together with the banana 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.140
 finally we add the 50 grams of 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.140
 oats 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.290

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 once ready after more cookies 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.579
 we will proceed to place it on a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.109
 baking tray covered by paper 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.500
 aluminum so they do not stick 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.500
 cookies 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.100

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.200

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.510
 at this point we can already put them 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.910

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.290
 with choco chips without sugar pieces of 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.290
 strawberries and dried cranberries 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.130
 now that they are decorated we will proceed to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.350
