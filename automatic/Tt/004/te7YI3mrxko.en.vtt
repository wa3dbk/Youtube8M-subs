gray rod or this gray rod let me put it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.760 
gray rod or this gray rod let me put it
this<00:00:38.610> way<00:00:39.950> just<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:42.120> have<00:00:42.390> the

this way just like this you have the
gray<00:00:43.770> rod<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.920> connects<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:48.050> light

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
gray rod and it connects to a light

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.150 
gray rod and it connects to a light
connector<00:00:50.129> then<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.730> are<00:00:53.730> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
and put it down now for the bottom yeah

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.109 
and put it down now for the bottom yeah
you'll<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.710> loose<00:01:22.950> ones<00:01:23.220> will<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.939> on

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you'll have to loose ones will get on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.120 
you'll have to loose ones will get on
the<00:01:24.479> shorter<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.049> you'll<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.710> red<00:01:25.890> one

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the shorter one you'll have the red one

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.550 
the shorter one you'll have the red one
with<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.200> black<00:01:28.250> white<00:01:29.250> connector<00:01:29.759> um<00:01:30.720> face<00:01:31.259> so

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
with a black white connector um face so

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.260 
with a black white connector um face so
that<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:31.979> snap<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> other<00:01:33.000> one

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that it will snap on to the other one

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.990 
that it will snap on to the other one
now<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.380> airlock<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.820> together

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
now to airlock to that put them together

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.520 
now to airlock to that put them together
you<00:01:36.570> make<00:01:36.990> two<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> them<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.869> what<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.900> did<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.229> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you make two of them and what I did is I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.710 
you make two of them and what I did is I
got<00:01:40.740> certain<00:01:41.430> points<00:01:41.790> where<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.970> got<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.390> white

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
got certain points where I got a white

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.139 
got certain points where I got a white
and<00:01:42.990> then<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:45.259> spacer<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.100> 11<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> top

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and then a spacer so I put 11 at the top

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.200 
and then a spacer so I put 11 at the top
one<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.200> blade<00:01:49.409> i<00:01:49.710> won<00:01:50.340> wait<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
one at the blade i won wait at the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.870 
one at the blade i won wait at the
bottom<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:52.040> fairly<00:01:53.040> easy<00:01:53.430> um<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> you<00:01:56.700> wanna

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
bottom it's fairly easy um so you wanna

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.249 
bottom it's fairly easy um so you wanna
build<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:58.969> recommend<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.960> also<00:02:01.049> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
build it I recommend and you also you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.990 
build it I recommend and you also you
could<00:02:01.380> put<00:02:01.439> some<00:02:01.649> oranges<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.549> makes<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
could put some oranges up here makes a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
could put some oranges up here makes a
little<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.299> stronger<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.680> these<00:02:04.979> don't<00:02:05.219> go

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
little bit stronger so these don't go

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.999 
little bit stronger so these don't go
fly<00:02:05.790> I've<00:02:06.360> done<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> lot<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.350> times<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.799> hit

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
fly I've done it a lot of times and hit

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.360 
fly I've done it a lot of times and hit
myself<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.610> face<00:02:08.700> when<00:02:09.440> sploded<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.340> just

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
myself in the face when sploded so just

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.100 
myself in the face when sploded so just
it's<00:02:12.519> better<00:02:13.330> if<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.780> put<00:02:14.730> um<00:02:15.780> stuff<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.930> keep

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
it's better if you put um stuff to keep

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.070 
it's better if you put um stuff to keep
it<00:02:17.319> sturdy<00:02:17.769> around<00:02:18.610> it<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.510> if<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.810> throw

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
it sturdy around it so that if you throw

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.589 
it sturdy around it so that if you throw
it<00:02:20.260> it<00:02:20.470> won't<00:02:20.980> necessarily<00:02:21.129> explode<00:02:21.970> pending

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
it it won't necessarily explode pending

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.690 
it it won't necessarily explode pending
on<00:02:22.840> what<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.620> throw<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.069> at<00:02:24.220> I've<00:02:24.459> done

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
on what you throw it at I've done

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.809 
on what you throw it at I've done
anything<00:02:25.060> hard<00:02:26.280> say<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.340> wanted<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.610> throw

anything hard say you wanted to throw
through<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.090> piece<00:02:28.269> of<00:02:28.299> paper<00:02:28.540> not<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.200> work

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
through a piece of paper not to work
