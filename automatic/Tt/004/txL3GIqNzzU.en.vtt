metals achieve corrosion resistance by

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.720 
metals achieve corrosion resistance by
two<00:00:04.110> mechanisms<00:00:05.210> the<00:00:06.210> first<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:07.250> that<00:00:08.250> they

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
two mechanisms the first is that they

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.410 
two mechanisms the first is that they
can<00:00:08.970> form<00:00:09.330> what<00:00:09.719> they<00:00:09.870> call<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.440> active

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
can form what they call an active

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.169 
can form what they call an active
corrosion<00:00:12.420> film<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.580> they<00:00:14.820> start

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
corrosion film that is that they start

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.529 
corrosion film that is that they start
to<00:00:15.420> corrode<00:00:15.870> they<00:00:16.410> build<00:00:16.770> up<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.160> layer<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
to corrode they build up a layer of

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.970 
to corrode they build up a layer of
corrosion<00:00:18.539> product<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.070> surface<00:00:20.720> that

corrosion product on the surface that

called active because some of the

develop either a green layer on top for

steel and over time they disappear why

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.620 
steel and over time they disappear why
because<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.560> active<00:01:11.310> corrosion<00:01:12.240> film

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
because it's an active corrosion film

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.109 
because it's an active corrosion film
and<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:14.369> eventually<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.320> second

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
and it eventually really now the second

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.810 
and it eventually really now the second
way<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.150> forming<00:01:18.990> corrosion<00:01:19.710> resistance<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
way of forming corrosion resistance is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.350 
way of forming corrosion resistance is
through<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.710> passive<00:01:22.710> layer<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:24.060> passive

have the have the chrome iron ratios in

the range of about point eight now if

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.129 
the range of about point eight now if
you<00:06:06.340> take<00:06:06.550> that<00:06:06.610> bright<00:06:07.120> and<00:06:07.330> Neal<00:06:07.479> tube<00:06:07.780> and

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
you take that bright and Neal tube and

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.980 
you take that bright and Neal tube and
dip<00:06:08.860> it<00:06:09.009> into<00:06:09.250> nitric<00:06:09.849> acid<00:06:10.330> and<00:06:10.449> let<00:06:10.630> it<00:06:10.659> sit

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
dip it into nitric acid and let it sit

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.200 
dip it into nitric acid and let it sit
there<00:06:11.020> for<00:06:11.289> 20<00:06:11.889> minutes<00:06:11.919> or<00:06:12.400> so<00:06:12.460> take<00:06:12.940> it<00:06:13.090> out

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
there for 20 minutes or so take it out

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.510 
there for 20 minutes or so take it out
water<00:06:13.539> rinse<00:06:13.870> and<00:06:14.050> dry<00:06:14.349> up<00:06:14.530> and<00:06:14.560> all<00:06:14.770> icon<00:06:15.099> then

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
water rinse and dry up and all icon then

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.029 
water rinse and dry up and all icon then
hey<00:06:15.729> then<00:06:15.759> you're<00:06:16.180> back<00:06:16.389> up<00:06:16.630> in<00:06:16.810> the<00:06:16.930> 1.5<00:06:17.710> range

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 
hey then you're back up in the 1.5 range

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.600 
hey then you're back up in the 1.5 range
so<00:06:18.340> your<00:06:18.520> your<00:06:19.300> your<00:06:19.990> chrome<00:06:20.620> iron<00:06:20.889> ratios<00:06:21.430> are

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
so your your your chrome iron ratios are

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.390 
so your your your chrome iron ratios are
high<00:06:21.789> and<00:06:22.060> your<00:06:22.690> corrosion<00:06:23.440> resistance<00:06:24.159> is

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
high and your corrosion resistance is

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.389 
high and your corrosion resistance is
significantly<00:06:25.270> better
