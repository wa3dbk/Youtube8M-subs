enjoy it I've got several sections one
of<00:01:03.610> them<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:03.910> how<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.089> tapered<00:01:04.570> stroke

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
of them is how the tapered stroke

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.740 
of them is how the tapered stroke
applies<00:01:05.199> to<00:01:05.530> drawing<00:01:06.130> realistic<00:01:06.700> hair<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:07.149> go

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
applies to drawing realistic hair I go

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.840 
applies to drawing realistic hair I go
through<00:01:08.079> step-by-step<00:01:08.409> of<00:01:09.100> showing<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:09.670> how

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
through step-by-step of showing you how

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.539 
through step-by-step of showing you how
to<00:01:10.090> make<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.720> strokes<00:01:11.049> how<00:01:11.440> to<00:01:11.500> maintain<00:01:12.040> the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
to make the strokes how to maintain the

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.030 
to make the strokes how to maintain the
spacing<00:01:13.119> this<00:01:13.270> time<00:01:13.540> whereas<00:01:14.200> before<00:01:14.590> we've

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
spacing this time whereas before we've

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.280 
spacing this time whereas before we've
been<00:01:15.220> trying<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.580> create<00:01:15.760> contours<00:01:16.390> but<00:01:17.080> this

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
been trying to create contours but this

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.320 
been trying to create contours but this
time<00:01:17.530> the<00:01:17.770> texture<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.369> extremely<00:01:18.850> important

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
time the texture is extremely important

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.700 
time the texture is extremely important
I'm<00:01:19.750> going<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:19.960> show<00:01:20.080> you<00:01:20.140> how<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.380> do<00:01:20.530> that

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
I'm going to show you how to do that

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.830 
I'm going to show you how to do that
with<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> tapered<00:01:21.220> stroke<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.760> how<00:01:22.479> to<00:01:22.540> do

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
with the tapered stroke and how to do

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.240 
with the tapered stroke and how to do
the<00:01:22.990> mechanics<00:01:23.560> so<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:23.979> can<00:01:24.130> be

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
the mechanics so that you can be

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.070 
the mechanics so that you can be
consistent<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:24.939> yet<00:01:25.390> have<00:01:25.600> some<00:01:25.810> wonderful

able to help you understand what we're

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.350 
able to help you understand what we're
actually<00:01:35.020> putting<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:35.979> hair<00:01:36.159> on<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.580> round

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
actually putting the hair on a round

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.870 
actually putting the hair on a round
head<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:38.680> structure<00:01:39.189> is<00:01:39.340> extremely

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
head that structure is extremely

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.940 
head that structure is extremely
important<00:01:40.270> because<00:01:40.390> we<00:01:41.140> want<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.530> know<00:01:41.650> how<00:01:41.890> to

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
important because we want to know how to

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.090 
important because we want to know how to
wrap<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.549> hair<00:01:42.820> around<00:01:43.119> how<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.200> conforms<00:01:44.860> as

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
wrap that hair around how it conforms as

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.060 
wrap that hair around how it conforms as
it<00:01:45.250> even<00:01:45.490> hangs<00:01:45.729> off<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.030> that<00:01:46.270> rounded<00:01:46.659> head

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
it even hangs off of that rounded head

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.100 
it even hangs off of that rounded head
the<00:01:48.070> way<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.430> wraps<00:01:48.670> around<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.360> going<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.720> also

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
the way it wraps around is going to also

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.280 
the way it wraps around is going to also
help<00:01:50.680> us<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.920> suggest<00:01:51.729> perspective<00:01:52.329> and<00:01:52.540> so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
help us to suggest perspective and so

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.630 
help us to suggest perspective and so
some<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:53.650> these<00:01:53.829> things<00:01:54.070> if<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.400> start

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
some of these things if you start

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.760 
some of these things if you start
thinking<00:01:54.970> about<00:01:55.060> them<00:01:55.450> will<00:01:55.990> automatically

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
thinking about them will automatically

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.310 
thinking about them will automatically
start<00:01:57.070> improving<00:01:57.729> how<00:01:58.659> it's<00:01:58.869> going<00:01:59.079> to<00:01:59.200> look

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
start improving how it's going to look

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.340 
start improving how it's going to look
when<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.590> draw<00:01:59.799> it<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:01.090> next<00:02:01.270> section<00:02:01.689> is<00:02:01.930> on

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
when you draw it the next section is on

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.510 
when you draw it the next section is on
textures<00:02:03.189> now<00:02:04.119> this<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.960> one<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:05.950> my<00:02:06.100> favorite

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
textures now this is one of my favorite

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.969 
textures now this is one of my favorite
things<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:07.000> love<00:02:07.450> textures<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:08.170> lot<00:02:08.739> of<00:02:08.890> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
things I love textures a lot of the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.009 
things I love textures a lot of the
principles<00:02:09.159> in<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.700> technique<00:02:10.119> apply<00:02:10.599> across

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
principles in the technique apply across

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.959 
principles in the technique apply across
the<00:02:11.079> board<00:02:11.500> whether<00:02:12.099> we're<00:02:12.370> drawing<00:02:12.579> straight

I want to be able to help you
maintain<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.879> texture<00:02:19.299> and<00:02:19.540> not<00:02:19.930> have

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
maintain the texture and not have

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.190 
maintain the texture and not have
something<00:02:20.560> just<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.890> flat<00:02:21.250> or<00:02:21.640> become<00:02:22.480> solid<00:02:23.079> I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
something just go flat or become solid I

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.740 
something just go flat or become solid I
want<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.769> able<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.189> have<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.700> do<00:02:25.360> some<00:02:25.629> of

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
want to be able to have you do some of

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.149 
want to be able to have you do some of
these<00:02:25.840> things<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.349> sometimes<00:02:26.590> are<00:02:26.950> so

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
these things that sometimes are so

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.460 
these things that sometimes are so
subtle<00:02:27.579> but<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:27.909> such<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> huge<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.290> profound

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
subtle but have such a huge and profound

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.610 
subtle but have such a huge and profound
effect<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.189> your<00:02:30.310> drawing<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.780> think<00:02:32.230> we<00:02:32.500> can

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
effect on your drawing so I think we can

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.720 
effect on your drawing so I think we can
really<00:02:32.829> do<00:02:33.040> something<00:02:33.280> here

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
really do something here

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.339 
really do something here
the<00:02:34.030> next<00:02:34.329> section<00:02:34.540> bong<00:02:34.840> edges<00:02:35.230> and

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
the next section bong edges and

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.860 
the next section bong edges and
transitions<00:02:35.920> this<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.879> really<00:02:37.360> important

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
transitions this is really important

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.630 
transitions this is really important
it's<00:02:38.440> something<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.069> want<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.519> be

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
it's something that I want you to be

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.250 
it's something that I want you to be
aware<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.360> think<00:02:40.390> will<00:02:40.720> really<00:02:40.989> help

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
aware of and I think will really help

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.800 
aware of and I think will really help
you<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:41.709> draw<00:02:41.920> hair<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.400> want<00:02:43.390> you<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.599> think

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you as you draw hair I want you to think

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.420 
you as you draw hair I want you to think
about<00:02:44.079> how<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.440> coming<00:02:44.769> out<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.129> scalp

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
about how it's coming out of the scalp

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.330 
about how it's coming out of the scalp
what<00:02:46.180> direction<00:02:46.510> is<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:47.069> again<00:02:48.069> how<00:02:48.280> is

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
what direction is it going again how is

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.000 
what direction is it going again how is
it<00:02:48.549> conforming<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.239> round<00:02:49.599> head<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:50.109> want

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
it conforming to that round head I want

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.610 
it conforming to that round head I want
you<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.659> be<00:02:52.659> able<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.900> think<00:02:53.170> about<00:02:53.230> how<00:02:53.409> the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
you to be able to think about how the

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.979 
you to be able to think about how the
outer<00:02:54.099> edge<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.579> the<00:02:54.700> hair<00:02:54.909> is<00:02:55.060> how<00:02:55.750> does<00:02:55.959> it

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
outer edge of the hair is how does it

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.699 
outer edge of the hair is how does it
end<00:02:56.260> how<00:02:57.069> does<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.340> go<00:02:57.430> around<00:02:57.579> behind<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
end how does it go around behind and

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.869 
end how does it go around behind and
some<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.799> these<00:02:59.889> things<00:03:00.190> again<00:03:00.340> are<00:03:00.700> going<00:03:00.790> to

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
some of these things again are going to

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.509 
some of these things again are going to
add<00:03:01.060> life<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.840> vibrancy<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.530> your<00:03:02.680> drawing<00:03:03.370> of

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
add life and vibrancy to your drawing of

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.460 
add life and vibrancy to your drawing of
hair<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.569> think<00:03:04.659> it's<00:03:04.959> going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.200> improve

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
hair and I think it's going to improve

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.740 
hair and I think it's going to improve
your<00:03:05.709> portraits<00:03:06.159> the<00:03:06.940> next<00:03:07.239> section<00:03:07.599> is

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
your portraits the next section is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.520 
your portraits the next section is
drawing<00:03:08.680> braids<00:03:09.720> very<00:03:10.720> structured<00:03:11.230> things

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
drawing braids very structured things

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.729 
drawing braids very structured things
like<00:03:11.769> dreadlocks<00:03:12.329> twists<00:03:13.329> things<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.590> are<00:03:14.709> a

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
like dreadlocks twists things that are a

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.530 
like dreadlocks twists things that are a
little<00:03:15.190> bit<00:03:15.400> unnatural<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:16.120> have<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.450> go

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
little bit unnatural you have to go

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.030 
little bit unnatural you have to go
ahead<00:03:16.659> and<00:03:16.900> make<00:03:17.049> it<00:03:17.170> into<00:03:17.379> a<00:03:17.409> form<00:03:17.829> of

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
ahead and make it into a form of

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.099 
ahead and make it into a form of
something<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:18.940> I'm<00:03:19.389> going<00:03:19.569> to<00:03:19.629> show<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:19.840> how

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
something but I'm going to show you how

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.710 
something but I'm going to show you how
to<00:03:20.170> still<00:03:20.889> make<00:03:21.099> it<00:03:21.250> look<00:03:21.400> realistic<00:03:21.760> add<00:03:22.239> some

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
to still make it look realistic add some

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.619 
to still make it look realistic add some
texture<00:03:23.079> have<00:03:23.859> it<00:03:24.040> dimensional<00:03:24.669> and<00:03:24.879> be<00:03:25.510> able

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
texture have it dimensional and be able

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:28.379 
texture have it dimensional and be able
to<00:03:25.780> take<00:03:26.079> in<00:03:26.260> consideration<00:03:26.440> lighting<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.579> want

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
to take in consideration lighting I want

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.939 
to take in consideration lighting I want
to<00:03:28.480> give<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> good<00:03:28.989> base<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.769> can

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:29.949 
to give you a good base so that you can

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:31.860 
to give you a good base so that you can
go<00:03:30.069> ahead<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.459> do<00:03:30.609> other<00:03:30.970> things<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.720> might

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
go ahead and do other things that might

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.379 
go ahead and do other things that might
be<00:03:31.900> very<00:03:32.199> structured<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:33.310> principles<00:03:34.209> are

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
be very structured the principles are

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.900 
be very structured the principles are
very<00:03:34.419> similar<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.349> I<00:03:35.829> want<00:03:36.040> you<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.340> start

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
very similar and I want you to start

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.490 
very similar and I want you to start
gaining<00:03:37.150> some<00:03:37.449> confidence<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.139> that<00:03:38.169> you<00:03:38.349> can

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
gaining some confidence so that you can
