original setup had the subwoofers in the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.670 
original setup had the subwoofers in the
rear<00:02:12.320> deck<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:13.700> actually<00:02:14.660> had<00:02:14.810> two<00:02:15.080> pairs<00:02:15.440> of

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
rear deck it actually had two pairs of

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.100 
rear deck it actually had two pairs of
them<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.370> we<00:02:16.490> removed<00:02:16.880> one<00:02:17.180> pair<00:02:17.450> for<00:02:17.480> bass<00:02:17.870> to

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
them so we removed one pair for bass to

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.990 
them so we removed one pair for bass to
penetrate<00:02:18.560> into<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.860> cabin<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.460> car<00:02:19.730> and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
penetrate into the cabin of the car and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.020 
penetrate into the cabin of the car and
a<00:02:20.630> six<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.500> half<00:02:21.530> inch<00:02:21.980> coax<00:02:22.490> in<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.820> rear

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
a six and a half inch coax in the rear

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.970 
a six and a half inch coax in the rear
so<00:02:23.630> we<00:02:23.780> actually<00:02:23.959> have<00:02:24.320> six<00:02:24.650> different

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
so we actually have six different

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.910 
so we actually have six different
channels<00:02:25.459> playing<00:02:26.060> our<00:02:26.270> highs<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.750> mids<00:02:26.920> it's

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
channels playing our highs and mids it's

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.980
