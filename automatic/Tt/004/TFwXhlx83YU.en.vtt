00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.860 
Hospitals Boston University and Tufts
many<00:03:27.609> of<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.819> leading<00:03:28.060> neurologists<00:03:28.840> and

many of the leading neurologists and

many of the leading neurologists and
psychiatrists<00:03:28.959> in<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.650> world<00:03:29.829> performed<00:03:30.730> the

psychiatrists in the world performed the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.210 
psychiatrists in the world performed the
research<00:03:31.120> blocks<00:03:31.840> from<00:03:32.349> our<00:03:32.530> Imaging<00:03:33.069> Center

research blocks from our Imaging Center

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.400 
research blocks from our Imaging Center
and<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.239> we<00:03:34.359> can<00:03:34.540> establish<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.290> have

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
and so we can establish and have

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.229 
and so we can establish and have
established<00:03:35.560> many<00:03:36.280> productive

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
established many productive

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.449 
established many productive
collaborations<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.739> take<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.069> very<00:03:39.370> best

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
collaborations that take the very best

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.580 
collaborations that take the very best
physician<00:03:40.209> researchers<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:40.900> tied<00:03:41.319> them<00:03:41.470> in

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
physician researchers and tied them in

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.020 
physician researchers and tied them in
with<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.769> strongest<00:03:42.160> imaging<00:03:42.549> we're<00:03:42.700> able<00:03:42.819> to

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
with the strongest imaging we're able to

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.420 
with the strongest imaging we're able to
do<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.690> rate<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.109> change<00:03:44.139> of<00:03:44.650> knowledge<00:03:45.069> how

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
do the rate of change of knowledge how

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.740 
do the rate of change of knowledge how
much<00:03:45.700> we're<00:03:45.910> learning<00:03:46.000> about<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.480> human

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
much we're learning about the human

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.330 
much we're learning about the human
brain<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.380> fantastic

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
brain is so fantastic

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.009 
brain is so fantastic
that's<00:03:48.940> hard<00:03:49.269> to<00:03:49.389> believe<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.750> we<00:03:49.840> won't

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
that's hard to believe that we won't

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.140 
that's hard to believe that we won't
make<00:03:50.169> great<00:03:50.709> insights<00:03:51.220> in<00:03:51.519> the<00:03:51.639> coming<00:03:51.910> years

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
make great insights in the coming years

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.309 
make great insights in the coming years
the<00:03:52.389> brain<00:03:52.810> turns<00:03:53.019> out<00:03:53.139> to<00:03:53.230> be

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
the brain turns out to be

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.599 
the brain turns out to be
extraordinarily<00:03:53.769> challenging<00:03:54.489> to

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
extraordinarily challenging to

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.400 
extraordinarily challenging to
understand<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.299> think<00:03:55.959> we<00:03:56.079> have<00:03:56.169> extraordinary

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
understand I think we have extraordinary

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.490 
understand I think we have extraordinary
tools<00:03:56.859> to<00:03:57.010> do<00:03:57.099> it<00:03:57.220> now<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.639> rate<00:03:57.910> of<00:03:58.060> knowledge

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
tools to do it now the rate of knowledge

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.990 
tools to do it now the rate of knowledge
accumulation<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.590> so<00:03:59.859> great<00:04:00.099> the<00:04:00.730> range<00:04:00.910> of

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
accumulation is so great the range of

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.150 
accumulation is so great the range of
novel<00:04:01.329> tools<00:04:01.540> are<00:04:01.720> so<00:04:01.870> wonderful<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:03.040> it's

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
novel tools are so wonderful that it's

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.080 
novel tools are so wonderful that it's
hard<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.400> believe<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.790> we<00:04:03.849> won't<00:04:03.970> do

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
hard to believe that we won't do

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.850 
hard to believe that we won't do
something<00:04:04.269> really

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
something really

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.800 
something really
I<00:04:04.890> think<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:05.580> that<00:04:05.730> moment<00:04:05.820> comes<00:04:06.030> as<00:04:06.390> the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
I think when that moment comes as the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.390 
I think when that moment comes as the
mystery<00:04:07.350> for<00:04:07.500> us<00:04:07.560> but<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:07.950> we<00:04:08.040> all<00:04:08.190> work<00:04:08.220> hard

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
mystery for us but if we all work hard

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.250 
mystery for us but if we all work hard
as<00:04:08.790> creatively<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:09.540> an<00:04:09.690> environment<00:04:10.200> as

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
as creatively in an environment as

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.680 
as creatively in an environment as
wonderful<00:04:10.710> as<00:04:10.860> MIT<00:04:11.220> in<00:04:11.460> the<00:04:11.490> govern<00:04:11.850> we<00:04:12.390> really

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
wonderful as MIT in the govern we really

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:22.940 
wonderful as MIT in the govern we really
think<00:04:12.930> we'll<00:04:13.530> make<00:04:13.680> major<00:04:14.070> breakthroughs
