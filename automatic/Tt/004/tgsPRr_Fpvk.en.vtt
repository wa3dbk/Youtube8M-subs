to play with

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.210 
to play with
I<00:01:12.000> prefer<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> soccer<00:01:12.869> ball<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.409> because<00:01:13.830> I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
I prefer the soccer ball just because I

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.300 
I prefer the soccer ball just because I
think<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> gets<00:01:14.760> them<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.299> active<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
think it gets them more active so you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.590 
think it gets them more active so you
leave<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> play<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:20.820> each<00:01:21.119> other<00:01:21.360> you

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
leave them to play with each other you

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.080 
leave them to play with each other you
