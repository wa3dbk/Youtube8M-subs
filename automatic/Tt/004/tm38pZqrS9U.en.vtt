the<00:05:35.509> park<00:05:35.720> itself<00:05:36.139> ie<00:05:36.410> I<00:05:39.160> haven't<00:05:40.160> been<00:05:40.280> on<00:05:40.460> any

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.700 
the park itself ie I haven't been on any
of<00:05:40.789> those<00:05:40.880> roller<00:05:41.150> coasters<00:05:41.180> since<00:05:41.900> like<00:05:42.050> 2002
