you're spent that are stepping back
towards<00:01:37.689> so<00:01:38.259> for<00:01:38.470> example<00:01:38.920> my<00:01:39.070> step<00:01:39.400> here<00:01:39.700> this

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
towards so for example my step here this

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.539 
towards so for example my step here this
one<00:01:40.540> comes<00:01:40.810> in<00:01:40.990> my<00:01:41.470> body<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:41.920> gonna<00:01:42.100> turn<00:01:42.340> this

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
one comes in my body is gonna turn this

one comes in my body is gonna turn this
way<00:01:42.790> it's<00:01:43.090> gonna<00:01:43.329> go<00:01:43.420> boom<00:01:44.320> okay<00:01:45.040> so<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.670> can

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
way it's gonna go boom okay so you can

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
when this happens this foot goes through

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.000 
when this happens this foot goes through
this<00:02:08.829> side<00:02:09.100> this<00:02:09.820> wood<00:02:10.030> comes<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.890> into<00:02:11.890> the
