00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
lack of discipline comes from a little

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.710 
lack of discipline comes from a little
bit<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> frustration<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:09.180> they're<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
bit of frustration that they're just a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.210 
bit of frustration that they're just a
yard<00:01:09.960> away<00:01:10.140> from<00:01:10.500> where<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.740> used<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> be

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
don't know it's just a little thought

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.469
