00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.629
 good is that such if tatis vÃ­ctor and this 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.120
 is another video of how to kill in this case 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.189
 how to kill zeal and well here I make a 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.689
 Little the fool with what I was looking at 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.790
 I was looking at a youtube thing 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.950
 precisely but good is not the case 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.169
 then what you have to have in 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.149
 account is to try if you have bunks 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.270
 put on a dodge trophy of pe 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:31.759
 carrot whatever sap for 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.230
 avoid those typical ones typical for 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.770
 that then in some play you can 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.000
 miss and you fuck life and half 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.680
 then you also have to have a 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.330
 little agility with the con man because 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.040
 if they take away from you and you can not do the 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.020
 combo you have to have another 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.030
 instantly or what you can 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.010
 improvise fast but hey this is not 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.750
 one of those zeros that go to sac a 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.489
 remove stickiness but rather it's from 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.770
 those that make you realization and then you 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.690
 crush here you have to go with a lot 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.220
 Beware of some key spells that are 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.890
 re dominamiento robot needle and against 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.590
 I lie on the one hand here as 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.870
 you could see I stayed next to the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.490
 glyph if I had not done that by doing 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.080
 liberation would have taken me away enough 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.550
 life but that I think there has been and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.470
 done that even because I knew that I could 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.900
 do liberation and all that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.420
 ryback because because maybe you do 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.580
 some glyph that is in the position 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.460
 where everything has started the fight and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.160
 then you just fall inside or also by 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.590
 example here that I already expected a turn 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.150
 easier the final combo and kill him and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 make beard that then goes away from 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.619
 the bombs try to play more or less by 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.970
 the zoom zone inti for the area and the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.979
 zone of your start 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.570
 then another thing that you have to have 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.479
 consider that needle needle 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.850
 the invocation the one in a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.190
 little corner the map playing and you're 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.220
 making needles and it already kills you and 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.830
 last against against is a very spell 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.700
 very annoying in that if you're going to do it already 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.070
 I already know it's better that you take turns 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.360
 because it's annoying because he has 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.710
 preference and this happens a lot in the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.629
 end of what has been fighting 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.209
 for example 7,200 the beat the two 200 and 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.640
 She attacks him with a spell against ba 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.110
 before what what the damages that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.330
 returns to a bullet before the ones you 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.640
 you do is to say that you die before you 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.069
 so you have to go with a lot 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.190
 Be careful with that sometimes there are many 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.239
 people who die first that 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.940
 we carry that dies only kill 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.950
 them and that's not good but good ya 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.500
 by author I died with the cabus already 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.760
 I was finishing and here I only have left 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.610
 give him the final touch I wanted to make him a 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.349
 like three pumps to finish well 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.620
 but the doctor does not put me in the middle 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.170
 and he does not let me do it then nothing this 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.910
 has been everything for the moment life favorite
