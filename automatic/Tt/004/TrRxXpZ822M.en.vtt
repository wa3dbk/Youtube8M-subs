00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
just been trying to figure out what was

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.240 
just been trying to figure out what was
going<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:22.050> with<00:00:22.109> everyone<00:00:22.710> getting<00:00:22.920> banned

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and I've read a couple things I've heard

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.859 
and I've read a couple things I've heard
a<00:00:26.220> lot<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.369> different<00:00:26.490> design<00:00:27.150> theories<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
a lot of different design theories and

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.900 
a lot of different design theories and
it<00:00:27.990> looks<00:00:28.170> like<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.590> guy<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.550> makes<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
it looks like the guy that makes the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.959 
it looks like the guy that makes the
extreme<00:00:30.510> firmware<00:00:31.109> or<00:00:31.520> one<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> people

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
extreme firmware or one of the people

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.350 
extreme firmware or one of the people
that<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:34.130> think<00:00:35.130> he's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> primary<00:00:35.790> creator<00:00:36.210> i'm

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360

that I think he's a primary creator i'm
not<00:00:36.540> sure<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:37.500> there's<00:00:37.710> different<00:00:38.040> teams<00:00:38.219> vs

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you download a game or you copy a game

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.080 
you download a game or you copy a game
and<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> bad<00:00:54.420> rip<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.820> run<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and it's a bad rip and if and you run it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.819 
and it's a bad rip and if and you run it
through<00:00:57.270> abgx<00:00:57.570> like<00:00:58.170> you're<00:00:58.320> supposed<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
through abgx like you're supposed to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.160 
through abgx like you're supposed to
sometimes<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.399> bj<00:00:59.730> cutie<00:01:00.239> false<00:01:00.510> readings<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
sometimes a bj cutie false readings and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.500 
sometimes a bj cutie false readings and
it's<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.789> verify<00:01:02.789> no<00:01:02.820> games<00:01:03.180> for<00:01:03.420> you

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it's not verify no games for you

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's not verify no games for you
correctly<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.979> games<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
correctly and so some of the games that

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
correctly and so some of the games that
we<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.670> playing<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.600> downloaded<00:01:07.229> or

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
we are playing or have downloaded or

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
we are playing or have downloaded or
have<00:01:08.010> ripped<00:01:08.250> ourselves<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:08.909> probably<00:01:09.659> bad

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
have ripped ourselves or probably bad

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.399 
have ripped ourselves or probably bad
rips<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.380> games<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.750> that's<00:01:12.750> being<00:01:12.960> detected

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
rips of games and that's being detected

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
rips of games and that's being detected
by<00:01:13.439> Microsoft<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.490> way<00:01:14.729> how<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
by Microsoft now the way how I

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.080 
by Microsoft now the way how I
understand<00:01:15.630> how<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> detect<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:17.759> for

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
understand how to detect it is so for

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
understand how to detect it is so for
every<00:01:18.450> infraction<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.590> may<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> flag<00:01:20.250> this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
every infraction you may get a flag this

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.630 
every infraction you may get a flag this
is<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.960> only<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.290> theory<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.799> let's<00:01:23.460> say

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
is this is only in theory so let's say

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.240 
is this is only in theory so let's say
your<00:01:23.880> consoles<00:01:24.330> modded<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.680> flag<00:01:25.950> you

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
your consoles modded you get a flag you

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.399 
your consoles modded you get a flag you
play<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> bad<00:01:26.790> game<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.420> another<00:01:27.720> flag<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
play a bad game you get another flag a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
play a bad game you get another flag a
new<00:01:29.100> game<00:01:29.310> comes<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> play<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.240> game

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
new game comes out to play that game

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.359 
new game comes out to play that game
earlier<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:31.020> another<00:01:31.320> flag<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> seems

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
earlier you get another flag so it seems

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.780 
earlier you get another flag so it seems
like<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:33.299> were<00:01:33.360> banning<00:01:33.780> people<00:01:34.579> based<00:01:35.579> on

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
like they were banning people based on

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.899 
like they were banning people based on
like<00:01:36.920> which<00:01:37.920> consoles<00:01:38.400> were<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.729> most

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
like which consoles were the most

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.350 
like which consoles were the most
egregious<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.439> worst<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.240> they<00:01:42.240> were

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
egregious are the worst and they were

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.880 
egregious are the worst and they were
working<00:01:42.689> their<00:01:42.780> way<00:01:42.810> down<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.409> some<00:01:43.619> people

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
working their way down so some people

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.760 
working their way down so some people
say<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.189> oh<00:01:44.399> I've<00:01:44.729> never<00:01:45.000> played<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.840> later

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
say that oh I've never played a later

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.560 
say that oh I've never played a later
game<00:01:46.890> before<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.610> got<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:48.090> console

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
game before and I just got my console

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
game before and I just got my console
modded<00:01:48.780> well<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.619> makes<00:01:49.770> sense<00:01:49.920> even<00:01:50.310> more

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
modded well that makes sense even more

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
modded well that makes sense even more
sense<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.090> knock<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.420> out<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.780> box<00:01:51.990> first

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
sense to knock you out of the box first

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
sense to knock you out of the box first
so<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.310> your<00:01:53.340> console<00:01:53.850> modders<00:01:54.210> you've

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
