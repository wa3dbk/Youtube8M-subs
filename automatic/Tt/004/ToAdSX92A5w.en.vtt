00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.260
 there is always some unknown 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.760
 day after a rest day it takes 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.070
 of course adapt again to the 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.330
 competition to the rhythm of the race and 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.590
 the hot weather that made their 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.390
 appearance for the first time on the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.560
 tower today strengthen precisely 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.730
 this uncertainty 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.710
 finally everything went well for 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.759
 thibaut pinot who finishes in time 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.159
 leading leaders 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.990
 and above all is the leader of 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.579
 the team fdj.fr wanted to pay tribute 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.859
 to the winner of the day 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.759
 another French who shines since the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.210
 beginning of the big loop 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.700
 ah yeah first heat so the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.240
 first for me I do not like so much 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.010
 I was not in a day 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.690
 outstanding chip and roads that 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.460
 I do not really like it 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.110
 that is to say, below 100 small 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.340
 road left right so that's right 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.320
 we're not used to the roads 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.150
 as on the turn and in the final cause 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.470
 of movements the punchers wanted 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.530
 absolutely this stage win and 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.470
 you were not afraid of breaks not that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.880
 go 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.580
 the descent was pretty good anyway 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.560
 so here it is but after I think that 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.630
 it's the 10 if he wins so a beautiful 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.770
 victory he was walking hard that I believe 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.450
 that he impressed everyone in 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.350
 two times I do not know if you do not know if 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.710
 how did you experience it from 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 interior 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.170
 yeah I saw that he attacked after 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.900
 surprise by the sagan group for 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.420
 welcome spell after so that's a beautiful 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.920
 number he did what a number of a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.120
 collective view of runners 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 What is a dynamic? 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.110
 in which everyone feels 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.140
 remains dynamic that's for sure 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.610
 we have a little we still continue on our 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.470
 first week so this is the second 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.640
 everything will continue like this and even the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.290
 third would even be paris 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.479
 if we could continue like that would 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.130
 well tomorrow step and for all a 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.420
 transition stage where it's more 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.710
 difficult than a transition stage 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 today we see is notable 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.410
 transition one of the hardest steps 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.850
 of the lap it rolled to block in the final so 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.580
 there is no state of transition or recovery of 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.350
 in the turn it's on me it was a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.940
 little hard at the beginning especially with the day of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.900
 yesterday's rest we decompress a little too much 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.680
 and then we have to get back in 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.119
 it's not easy and good after 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.950
 the final it suited us a little better 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.479
 with thibaut so it was a little bit more 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.800
 easy once they emanate skimming 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.720
 it's a bit easy to run in front of and 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.380
 it went pretty well how and and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.940
 thibaut pinot from your own eyes 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.510
 you'd have to ask him but he 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.709
 asked guys that's for sure it's 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.850
 not obvious for sure it is sometimes worth 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.640
 we think he's not good and then he 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.230
 will we make a big number so he 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.489
 hides his game well sometimes but hey 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.900
 think he had a good day there 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.790
 looked comfortable he ran placed and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.110
 then I did not do it 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.180
 of error at all during the day so 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.470
 I think it's pretty good 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.799
 day was not rosy for all the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.510
 world 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.220
 in any case since on the side of 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.230
 some teammates have lived this stage 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.810
 in pain and difficulty 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.350
 the reaction of the sports director of 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.980
 fdj.fr low it's always complicated and 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.090
 europe we wanted because the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.920
 organizations will be 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.230
 we were really none for the 24 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.370
 hours to take the forts where we 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.690
 had a little finish today that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.730
 was really hilly propitious to this 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.690
 that there is a movement race so 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.330
 it's always a bit difficult and we 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.300
 saw him today on the end that side a 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.230
 little everywhere so that's it for 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.019
 we like a day well mastered 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.970
 small beautiful everything is accompanied by adam 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.110
 youth we are mostly by cÃ©dric 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.310
 Pineau who did a very good step 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.290
 today because it was not 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.670
 really his playground 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.810
 unfortunately we miss him arthur 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.819
 who was only having a bad day 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.260
 which was not very good that harm to 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.120
 breathe and then especially jeremy roy 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.040
 quinqua punctured at the right time when the 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.750
 trucks sides start to roll so 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.430
 he really burst then climber what 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.650
 was not it was not conducive to 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.790
 get back behind tomorrow for you it's 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.410
 a step that is comparable to that 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.370
 present-day 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.480
 tomorrow it may be less and less 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.950
 tricky that today it's going to be 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.120
 the difficult step when we arrived at 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.129
 saint-etienne the mountains of the forest knows 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.299
 never always a little complicated but 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.680
 maybe less tricky than today 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.680
 we are 60 maybe more escaped from 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.299
 fighter indeed tomorrow there will be at 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.739
 again some ribs at the end of 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.170
 course but it will be much less 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.879
 tricky the last fix is located 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.510
 about twenty kilometers from 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.370
 the arrival 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.410
 so tomorrow a real step of 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.359
 transition where the main actor the 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.440
 difficulty in any case will probably 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.440
 again the heat
