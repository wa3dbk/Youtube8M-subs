00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.560 
I'm not using any claymores to camp
around<00:01:30.890> I'm<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.130> using<00:01:32.400> scavenger<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
around I'm just using scavenger for the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.499 
around I'm just using scavenger for the
book<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.290> clip<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.829> gun<00:01:35.100> because

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
book for the clip and this gun because

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.690 
book for the clip and this gun because
realistically<00:01:36.509> speaking<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.380> TMP<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.220> very

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
realistically speaking the TMP is a very

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.450 
realistically speaking the TMP is a very
dangerous<00:01:39.259> secondary<00:01:40.259> weapon<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.340> they

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
dangerous secondary weapon and they

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
dangerous secondary weapon and they
probably<00:01:41.729> realized<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.630> they<00:01:42.780> they

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
probably realized this and they they

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.350 
probably realized this and they they
basically<00:01:43.950> lowered<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.670> clip<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
basically lowered the clip and the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.780 
basically lowered the clip and the
weapon<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.990> doesn't<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.350> kill<00:01:46.860> you

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
weapon so it doesn't really kill you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.130 
weapon so it doesn't really kill you
really<00:01:48.060> can't<00:01:48.299> kill<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.479> many<00:01:48.720> people

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
really can't kill that many people

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.810 
really can't kill that many people
unless<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.890> scavenger<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.520> pick<00:01:50.670> up

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
unless you do have scavenger to pick up

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.910 
unless you do have scavenger to pick up
ammo<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.689> thing<00:01:51.720> probably<00:01:52.439> kill

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
ammo because that thing probably kill

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.319 
ammo because that thing probably kill
like<00:01:53.070> two<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.340> three<00:01:53.369> people<00:01:53.640> max<00:01:54.000> Matt

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
obviously things it could be just

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.809

little<00:04:25.789> pad<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.990> know<00:04:27.139> more<00:04:27.949> complicated<00:04:28.639> to

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
little pad you know more complicated to

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.520 
little pad you know more complicated to
get<00:04:29.000> there<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:31.460> know<00:04:31.900> ask<00:04:32.900> for<00:04:33.289> something

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
that is unique and different not

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.399 
that is unique and different not
something<00:04:36.289> that's<00:04:36.470> literally<00:04:37.150> impossible

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
something that's literally impossible

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:44.950 
something that's literally impossible
that<00:04:39.409> doesn't<00:04:41.650> grant<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:43.069> bunch<00:04:43.490> of<00:04:43.639> hate<00:04:44.000> video

stuck<00:05:39.770> in<00:05:39.889> a<00:05:39.979> corner<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.370> stuck<00:05:40.729> in<00:05:40.880> with<00:05:41.000> the

00:05:42.269 --> 00:05:42.279 
stuck in a corner I stuck in with the

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:45.339 
stuck in a corner I stuck in with the
syntax<00:05:43.279> it<00:05:43.550> didn't<00:05:43.880> kill<00:05:44.150> him<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.659> think<00:05:45.080> he<00:05:45.169> had

syntax it didn't kill him I think he had
a<00:05:49.330> shield<00:05:50.330> on<00:05:50.539> a<00:05:50.599> blast<00:05:50.930> shield<00:05:51.199> so<00:05:51.380> he<00:05:51.500> kills

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
a shield on a blast shield so he kills

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.820
