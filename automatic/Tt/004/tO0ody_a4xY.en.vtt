00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.900
 I do not have any water that is very easy 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.180
 of doing 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.500
 you need basic ingredients a 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.030

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.000

 tomatoes a little onion and that's what 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.410
 grind with a little salt also a 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.810
 little salt and pepper in this recipe and 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.210
 quesito you just have to put a check 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.470
 little olive oil in this house 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:23.930
 of ball to warm up our 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.960
 our onion and our our garlic the 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.960
 onion 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 there they are going 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.140
 and this is again one of those 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.799
 basic dishes not that of 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.170
 daily homemade food to heat the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.220
 really cold that then gets that 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.700
 the cold at 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.770
 12 at night that is to die no longer for 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.110
 3 o'clock in the morning there is no move 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.890
 of the bed because you're already like this reacted 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.500
 age 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.170
 but as it must be, they are precisely the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.220
 times I know very well know that grapes 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.860
 which is very good then it is already 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.540
 our little onion doradita citron adif a 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.670
 rich and now we are going to add 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.819
 garlic 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:18.010
 that all well be well throne 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.010
 nice pimp of beautiful 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.480
 Now let's add a little bit of 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.569
 squash the pumpkin aniseed in is a 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.220
 spectacular ingredient because it has 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.440
 true many properties apart 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.260
 It has so much water that makes it a 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.170
 food with very few calories has 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.260
 fiber has many vitamins have 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.750
 many minerals and we help ourselves to lower 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.760
 of weight to counteract a little bit yes yes 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.230
 December is coming, let's be now, so 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.489
 we have to take care of ourselves in November 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:54.620
 not because the guadeloupe-kings come with 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:58.730
 all that happened to 2013 came heavy 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.950
 not good then let's worship a little 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:06.530
 the pumpkin we are going to pepper 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:12.170
 so that it grabs our flavor 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:15.620
 stew and remove this from the path 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.440
 and now yes the lime below you have two 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.720
 base silver you do not have to let it be 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.690
 a lot of time there 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.690
 because quickies s is cooked 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.660
 is more have tasted the raw pumpkin is 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.940
 delicious feeds truth that is rich is 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.150
 very rich the pumpkin as you put it 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.730
 I like it a lot then we leave 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.740
 that is filter a little look and 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.860
 started to shine that means that already 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.680
 So he started to grab the flavor of all 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.950
 the onion and the garlic and all that rock and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.819
 roll and I 'm ready to add the 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.209
 next ingredient that will do 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.329
 the chile poblano that is already peeled or 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.540
 we already put it in the comal we had it 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.780
 very well we put it in bags so that 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.700
 up we peel it and since it is peeled what 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.159
 we cut off the vein and all the 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.829
 roll and cut it into julienne very 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:16.130
 small good nano slim and that's what 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:20.540
 what are we going to add 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.570
 then your poblano chile requirement does not 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.570
 remove it 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.570
 leave them 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.370
 You can do this dish 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.340
 a thousand things a thousand things can put more 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.740
 they can put corn they can put 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.830
 that can put a little flower 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.510
 of pumpkin can you pig hand 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.530
 of clear pig that can put you 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.000
 pork meat can you put this 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.400
 little fish can there put a steak 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.650
 can put it with shredded chicken or 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.300
 be you can play with this already 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.090
 Well, whatever you want, that's why I like it 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.550
 both the vegetable stews do not like that 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.470
 with that you already do wonders and are 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.650
 cheap products because I climbed up 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.690
 onion this little poblano poblano tomato 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.000
 they really are not going to spend much on 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.020
 cook this let's add a little bit of 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.020
 tomato puree 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:25.060
 there it goes and we are going to mix it 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:29.170
 and hear this smells really cool chilito 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.140
 because it does not give it that flavor that breaks 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.960
 the rose pasta 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:38.130
 he's rich, hey, do not hear what this is 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.800
 it is so a little taquito echale bean no 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.200
 Bean and you throw a little bit of this 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.210
 mixture 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.950
 If you make a toaster, you make a 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.570
 taquito 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.570
 milk chicks 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.160
 you have to give him because he's so hungry 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.630
 not who knows 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.020
 it will be because we are in the afternoon and not 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.790
 watching cooking just a little bit of 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.540
 such to verify reason 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.810
 and already recorded this roll 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.670
 because if you do not want to put the pumpkin 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.670
 very cooked I say that it is ready 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:17.270
