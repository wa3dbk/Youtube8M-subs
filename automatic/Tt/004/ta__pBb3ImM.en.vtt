00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.030 
top and you open up the bottom and so
you're<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> take<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.960> cup<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.710> food

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you're going to take one cup of food

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.830 
you're going to take one cup of food
grade<00:01:59.310> wood<00:01:59.610> pellets<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.210> you're<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
grade wood pellets and you're going to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.499 
grade wood pellets and you're going to
pour<00:02:01.170> them<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.490> chamber<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.299> smoke

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
pour them into the chamber of the smoke

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.210 
pour them into the chamber of the smoke
moisture<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.229> like<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.070> we're

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
moisture just like that and so we're

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.219 
moisture just like that and so we're
going<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> light<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.479> chips<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> smoke

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
going to light the chips and the smoke

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.469 
going to light the chips and the smoke
moisture<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.550> use<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> torch<00:02:09.149> and

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
moisture and I like to use a torch and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.309 
moisture and I like to use a torch and
so<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.140> just<00:02:10.410> simply<00:02:10.830> put<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.400> torch<00:02:11.670> down

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
so we just simply put the torch down

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.270 
so we just simply put the torch down
