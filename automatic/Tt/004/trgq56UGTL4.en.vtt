00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.910
 friends of unicarioca that I'm from 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.650
 and I'm going to talk again about 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.279
 verbal agreement 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.870
 in our last video tip I said that 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.900
 the correct is two accidents happened 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.559
 Problems arose missing 15 minutes 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.960
 that's it 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.940
 the verb agrees with the subject is 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.780
 wherever you are 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.840
 however if you choose the verb to have 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.000
 the story is another the verb to have the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.510
 source problem in Latin it is a 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.250
 verb a personal and does not have to soil and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.390
 consequently not temporal, it only 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.879
 uses in the singular 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.400
 nobody would say a lot of people in the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.089
 meeting we said that there are many 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.490
 people 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.310
 the detail that this verb does not have to 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.970
 in the past and in the future there will also be 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.299
 problems and there were accidents 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.820
 This is a detail because in the last video 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.000
 tip we saw that there were two 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.780
 accidents but under cover in the verb to have 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.940
 The correct one is there were two accidents and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.090
 damn the old 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.090
 this is an unacceptable mistake is this
