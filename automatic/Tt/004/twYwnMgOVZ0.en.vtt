a good friend Ron who was teaching us a
really<00:00:20.160> nifty<00:00:20.400> trick<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.710> how<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:23.510> grout

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
really nifty trick on how to make grout

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.800 
really nifty trick on how to make grout
samples<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:26.099> how<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> take<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> samples<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
samples so how to take the samples of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.919 
samples so how to take the samples of
the<00:00:28.019> grout<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.800> place<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.849> into<00:00:29.970> our<00:00:30.300> until

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the grout and place it into our until

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.950 
the grout and place it into our until
sample<00:00:31.470> forms<00:00:31.980> now<00:00:32.700> some<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.239> may<00:00:33.899> be

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
sample forms now some of you may be

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.920 
sample forms now some of you may be
wondering<00:00:34.710> why<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.940> need<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.480> samples

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
wondering why do we need to make samples

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470 
wondering why do we need to make samples
on<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> ground<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> answer<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.390> very

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
on the ground and the answer is very

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.660 
on the ground and the answer is very
simple<00:00:39.870> as<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.430> grout<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:43.260> concrete<00:00:44.160> mix

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
simple as the grout is the concrete mix

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.840 
simple as the grout is the concrete mix
that<00:00:45.300> will<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.920> creating<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.950> strength<00:00:47.550> in

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that will be creating the strength in

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.549 
that will be creating the strength in
the<00:00:48.030> wall<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.170> placed

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
the wall and it's going to be placed

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
the wall and it's going to be placed
inside<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.610> cells<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> have

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
inside of the cells it's going to have

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.340 
inside of the cells it's going to have
to<00:00:52.350> reach<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.920> certain<00:00:53.160> point<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:54.350> compression

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to reach a certain point of compression

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.709 
to reach a certain point of compression
per<00:00:56.070> square<00:00:56.430> inch<00:00:56.579> in<00:00:56.879> other<00:00:57.030> words<00:00:57.360> it's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
per square inch in other words it's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.380 
per square inch in other words it's
going<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> have<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.199> determined<00:00:58.829> psi<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.699> some

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
going to have a determined psi so some

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.349

have 1800 psi in our case since this is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.719 
have 1800 psi in our case since this is
a<00:01:14.490> retaining<00:01:14.970> wall<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.750> are<00:01:15.990> actually

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
a retaining wall we are actually

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.200 
a retaining wall we are actually
requiring<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.210> 3000<00:01:18.990> psi<00:01:19.369> so<00:01:20.369> anything

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
requiring to have 3000 psi so anything

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.230 
requiring to have 3000 psi so anything
that<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.360> above<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.020> standard<00:01:22.909> for<00:01:23.909> example

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
that is above the standard for example

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
that is above the standard for example
the<00:01:24.330> standard<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.780> 1500<00:01:25.470> psi<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the standard is 1500 psi it's going to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.580 
the standard is 1500 psi it's going to
be<00:01:26.729> requiring<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.659> compression<00:01:28.590> test<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:30.590> that

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
be requiring a compression test and that

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.810 
be requiring a compression test and that
is<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> reason<00:01:32.070> why<00:01:32.189> we're<00:01:32.400> making<00:01:32.549> these

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is the reason why we're making these

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.899 
is the reason why we're making these
cylinders<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.659> cylinders<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:35.100> test<00:01:35.640> on

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
cylinders this cylinders will test on

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.630 
cylinders this cylinders will test on
the<00:01:36.060> field<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:37.290> grout<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.220> are<00:01:38.280> using

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the field the grout that we are using

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.960 
the field the grout that we are using
and<00:01:39.090> we're<00:01:39.689> trying<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.290> match<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:41.400> conditions

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
and we're trying to match the conditions

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.620 
and we're trying to match the conditions
on<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.049> field<00:01:43.409> meaning<00:01:44.159> temperature<00:01:45.090> time

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
on the field meaning temperature time

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.530 
on the field meaning temperature time
that<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> concrete<00:01:46.680> was<00:01:46.860> poured<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:48.119> mixture

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that the concrete was poured the mixture

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.520 
that the concrete was poured the mixture
in<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.530> concrete<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.340> water<00:01:50.549> content<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
in the concrete the water content and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.649 
in the concrete the water content and
etc<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> reason<00:01:53.670> why<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.030> tests

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
etc that is the reason why this tests

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.590 
etc that is the reason why this tests
are<00:01:54.750> being<00:01:54.960> performed<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> field<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
are being performed in the field now the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.399 
are being performed in the field now the
inspectors<00:01:58.259> will<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.540> exactly<00:02:00.540> how<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.049> take

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
inspectors will know exactly how to take

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
inspectors will know exactly how to take
the<00:02:01.619> samples<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.820> giving<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.180> guys

the samples and I'm just giving you guys
the<00:02:03.420> contractor<00:02:04.200> perspective<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.979> why<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:06.420> has

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the contractor perspective of why it has

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.919 
the contractor perspective of why it has
to<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.990> done<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.530> why<00:02:07.829> we're<00:02:08.009> doing<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.929> as

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to be done and why we're doing it so as

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.180 
to be done and why we're doing it so as

take<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.350> samples<00:02:21.770> from<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:23.860> starting

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
take the samples from the starting

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.210 
take the samples from the starting
product<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.960> last<00:02:27.260> section<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.070> the

product or the last section of the
concrete<00:02:28.520> they<00:02:28.940> literally<00:02:29.240> take<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.660> from<00:02:30.070> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
concrete they literally take it from the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.250 
concrete they literally take it from the
middle<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.850> truck<00:02:32.270> you<00:02:32.510> know<00:02:32.630> as<00:02:32.780> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
middle of the truck you know as the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.700 
middle of the truck you know as the
conch<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.920> truck<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.460> good<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.820> as<00:02:35.030> a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
conch as the truck is good as as a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.130 
conch as the truck is good as as a
concrete<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:36.830> coming<00:02:37.160> out<00:02:37.310> of<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:38.140> bigger

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
concrete is coming out of the the bigger

he will way to where is on the middle
part<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.910> mix<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.480> pull<00:02:45.350> his<00:02:45.560> samples

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
part of the mix and pull his samples

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.500 
part of the mix and pull his samples
from<00:02:46.340> because<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.820> will<00:02:47.030> be<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.300> most

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
from because this will be the most

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.970 
from because this will be the most
accurate<00:02:47.780> reading<00:02:48.340> once<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.880> done<00:02:50.980> he

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
accurate reading once this is done he

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.640 
accurate reading once this is done he
will<00:02:52.100> start<00:02:52.340> placing<00:02:52.610> these<00:02:52.940> samples<00:02:53.650> inside

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
will start placing these samples inside

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.840 
will start placing these samples inside
of<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.040> cells<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:57.370> recreate<00:02:58.450> basically<00:02:59.650> the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
of the cells and recreate basically the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.920 
of the cells and recreate basically the
vibration<00:03:01.850> by<00:03:02.030> pushing<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.570> with<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.720> piece<00:03:02.900> of

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
vibration by pushing it with a piece of

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.020 
vibration by pushing it with a piece of
rebar<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.770> what<00:03:04.340> he's<00:03:04.520> trying<00:03:04.580> to<00:03:04.850> do<00:03:04.940> is

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
rebar and what he's trying to do is

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.740 
rebar and what he's trying to do is
trying<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.540> avoid<00:03:06.110> having<00:03:06.440> any<00:03:06.709> type<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.070> air

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
trying to avoid having any type of air

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.340 
trying to avoid having any type of air
gaps<00:03:08.750> on<00:03:09.490> his<00:03:10.490> sample<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.330> it's<00:03:12.050> trying<00:03:12.290> to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
gaps on his sample and it's trying to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.860 
gaps on his sample and it's trying to
make<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.590> as<00:03:12.680> even<00:03:12.860> as<00:03:13.100> possible<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.690> it's

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
make it as even as possible so it's

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.949 
make it as even as possible so it's
matching<00:03:15.140> what<00:03:15.470> we're<00:03:15.650> achieving<00:03:15.769> on<00:03:16.959> the
