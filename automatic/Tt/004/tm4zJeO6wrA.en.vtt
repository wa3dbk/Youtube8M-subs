00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:14.589
 now let's talk and over driver david gilmour always very much 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.739
 used in this if integrated touch tight different video hard drives 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:25.060
 a ts10 of the ibanez used by him in the period or 80 years 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.730
 and a high lace we say a then of course also to record on mail 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 the standard undo intelligence 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.780
 and used in this case to boost the baby 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.950
 and all 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.740
 second per drive integrated into the ulm soft system supported by peter frames 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.360
 technical historian of david gilmour 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.600
 eeeh who also builds pedals 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.469
 and edilmoro uses avantissimo storage driver from the 90s onwards so it will be 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.340
 the case, in short, to make its sounds heard 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.880
 also third nerd raibano workers, tube driver youtube in this case 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.130
 rea that not by foot like in the case of david gilmour 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.950
 However, I have a more transparent sound than the softsub stand 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.350
 that 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.740
 for its part 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.090
 it is very soft in its place 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.540
 and so maybe yeah we listen to shining examples or drive 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:47.469
 we finish the speech distortions with black the distortion pedals of the saint 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.009
 used by david gilmour 

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:53.249
 let us remember only the sporadic cases 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:58.319
 david gilmour I had a dream of high-gain amps maybe used in 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.729
 combination with pedals 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.929
 because the menu is input only 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:08.309
 otherwise it has always modeled its sound through real e 

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:09.319
 own 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.679
 and the pedals that most became famous linear song of the god moratti ehm 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:16.579
 I'm the fax machine 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.869
 and the big-match flat e 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:22.159
 in the last part of its variation rogora 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.949
 hey fasf she said 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.819
 let's say he used it of different ebay types with different technologies 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.529
 that obviously I can be heard in the first albums of the band 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:41.369
 bigmat which then became the true hallmark of david's distorted sounds 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:42.249
 gilmour 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.839
 eeeh the use of his first pedal in particular 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.170
 recordings 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.660
 which is a serve ram so-called just because auchan ram and that in 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.230
 reality is the jellyfish head of the electro-harmonix in the lower left and 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.230
 he practically has his new mortgage 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.999
 unusual dimensions 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.919
 and dell inspiron losone level giving it just like 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.050
 montaldo 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.420
 evidence to give more definition and more presence I have a sound that 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.379
 we could define gargantuan 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.379
 people from the 7 series high proxy 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.889
 estela 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.680
 let's not say his love a dolphin does only if a cross between a distortion a 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.599
 fox 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.620
 very transparent email 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.210
 and especially on sounds 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.470
 now and listen to relevant examples 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.449
 to these pedals 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.289
 keeping in mind that in my setup - inserted a fax feisol ma 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.169
 it is practically an artisanal veet belfast bayliss reconstruction 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:54.300
 imported in Italy
