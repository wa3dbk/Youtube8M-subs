 here already has pursued by Indian jones and 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.840
 now you're back to the future in 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.289
 true two right 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.050
 actually three ten or think and one here 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:11.300
 It's kind of like another movie, I'm going 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.300
 explain here, we see a 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.030
 character there being frightened by the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:20.240
 veteran odont get rid of this affection 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.220
 he is working there looks this one 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.179
 baby it's nobody else but nobody 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.849
 than marty mcfly the protagonist of 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:32.149
 back to the future is that lived there 

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:33.860
 by fox mico one of the favorite movies 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.140
 you did not see see 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.770
 Well, that would be an Easter egg well. 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.810
 cool if there was not one more cherry in the 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.239
 cake is a direct reference to ii 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.289
 the defeat for the future 2 in the part that 

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:51.319
 arrives in the far future of 2015 and 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.410
 there is a holographic cinema that 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.860
 turn in the film is a heretic of the 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.860
 shark movie 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.790
 let's activate this program and look at it 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:07.220
 what happens 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:12.950
 motivate and will become a hologram read one 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.920
 Tyrannosaurus also will devour the mu 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.140
 martin down there 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.590
 this scene is like I already said then it's a 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.330
 reference to this other scene here that 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.340
 was shown to us back to the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:46.010
 future 2 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:48.860
 the chief of the depec 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 very cool this guys this scene and 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.560
 like I said it 's an easter egg inside 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.640
 another, because this scene makes a 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:02.120
 mention to shark 19 which is another film 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.319
 steven spielberg was a success and the 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.000
 game in turn makes one another item 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.910
 thing also lets me go back makes a 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.709
 to the shark and there to stay 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.079
 yet clear that this reference them 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:21.290
 put a poster of the pteranodon here 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:23.750
 A poster is watching the veteran gift giving 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.120
 to understand the reference to the film of the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.670
 then the treason is a 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.269
 double west reference will have and double 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.549
 shark and also from back to the 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.680
 The future is still over 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.900

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:44.000

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.160
 overboard is there for sale in the store is not 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.840
 until there is a bar 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.040
 you can observe hoverboard 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.570
 hoverboard for those who do not know it too 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.370

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.950

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.400
 flying skateboard 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.079
 everyone believed that by 2015 and even 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.090
 really overboard 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.819
 but not rolled the only thing we had was 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.750
 an ad made in a play with 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.510
