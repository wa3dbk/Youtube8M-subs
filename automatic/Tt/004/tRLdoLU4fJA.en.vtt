00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.160
 Y 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.420
 The teachings of the Lord of the Rain 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.420
 african tale 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.750
 one day many years ago in the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.720
 hot lands of africa the saying 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.720
 he told the lord of the year he should be 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.699
 you very satisfied because with your water 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 has managed to cover all the land of 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.640
 green vegetation but what would happen if 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.519
 I tear all the grass to all 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.699
 trees the bushes plants do not 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:50.780
 there will be nothing green for you in that 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:54.960
 low and the rain lord answered 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 if it did not send rain it would not grow anymore 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.799
 plants everything green would disappear and not 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.870
 you would have nothing to eat daily in 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.540
 everyone 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.680
 but the elephant that was believed the animal 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.720
 stronger 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.260
 I wanted to challenge him and he started to start 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:20.620
 with its trunk all the grass the trees 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:23.200
 the plants and shrubs so the 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.510
 Lord of the offended rain made no 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.370
 it would rain again and the deserts would 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.370
 they spread everywhere 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.810
 time passed and the elephant was dying of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.270
 hunger and thirst tried to finish where 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.050
 They passed the rivers but could not find 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.580
 a single drop of water 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.970
 finally the elephant seeing that there was 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.050
 angry to the rain lord told him 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.990
 Mr. sorry I've misbehaved I 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.290
 been arrogant and I regret please 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.660
 or he lives I say the rain here 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.800
 but the rain lord ignored 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.009
 to the pleas of the elephant 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.510
 the days passed 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.120
 and every day was drier than the previous 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.739
 the elephant sent the rooster in its place 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.180
 to talk to the lord of the 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.180
 rain and it will convince you 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 the rooster sought the lord of the rain for 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.640
 everywhere 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.770
 until he found him resting in a 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.380
 cloud 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.930
 m 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.900
 He told her who he was and praised him for the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.360
 rain so eloquently that the lord 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.690
 of the rain decided to send some 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.690
 Water 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.380
 the rain fell just like the lord of the 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.510
 rain had promised the rooster and he 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.850
 formed a small puddle near where 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.870
 lived the elephant who did not take 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.540
 appropriate for him that day the elephant was 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.640
 to look for food and left the turtle 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.900
 responsible for protecting richard or with 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.200
 these turtle words if someone comes 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.670
 here to drink tell them that this is my 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.670
 personal puddle 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.590
 when the elephant went away many 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.360
 thirsty animals came to the puddle 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.240
 but the turtle did not let them drink 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.450
 saying this water belongs to your 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.959
 majesty the elephant I have to 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.030
 protect it and can not drink it but 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.670
 When the lion arrived he was not impressed 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.840
 the words of the turtle looked at her 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.840
 he said to leave with a roar 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.930
 and gave me water to quench his thirst 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.760
 then he left without saying a word 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.159
 when the elephant came back almost no 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.510
 there was water in the puddle the turtle 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:59.930
 tried to defend himself sir I'm just a 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.310
 animal and the other animals do not 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.280
 respect came the lion and I took me 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.829
 I could do all the animals after 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.840
 they freely drank the furious elephant 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.440
 he raised his leg over the turtle and the 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.370
 crushed 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.070
 fortunately the turtle is very strong 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.489
 and he could manage to survive 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.300
 but since then the turtles have 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.909
 its flat bottom 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.000
 and suddenly all the animals heard the 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:34.729
 voice of the rain lord who told you 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.310
 like the elephant do not challenge the more 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.160
 strong do not destroy what they can 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.830
 need in the future not to ask the 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.250
 weak who defend their property and not 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.039
 Punish the innocent but above all 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.490
 let the needy share 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:55.570
 your luck do not be arrogant and do not 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.570
 try to appropriate 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.280
 and after saying these words the Lord of the 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.220
 fasting made a knot in the trunk of the 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.380
 elephant punishing him like that without drinking water 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.380
 for ten long years
