00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 the fox fi group in big football 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.730
 the methane car in this strategy the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.430
 brand seat is the first to arrive on 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.990
 market with leon why this new 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.949
 motor will customers choose 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.369
 methane for me there are two advantages 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:28.800
 big pollution first because the 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.890
 methane offers many more possibilities than 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.500
 be a clean engine 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 Now with this here there are only 94 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.430
 grams of co2 per kilometer but the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 second is that this becomes a consumption 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.149
 less 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.620
 and then if we take the cost of methane 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.840
 we did the calculation that we can 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.059
 to arrive from Rome to Milan with only 20 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.770
 consumption euro 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.960
 the seat mark is also linked 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.239
 especially to a young clientele 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 leon then is a very similar machine for 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.020
 construction quality lagosta but monti 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 like most of the German is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.519
 winning new customers for himself when 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 let's look at the customers they bought 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.530
 a leo or have not bought the leon 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.229
 we see that most are 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 customers outside the volkswagen group 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.130
 then for example the ford took the 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.740
 renault are the customers they consider 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.590
 we as an alternative brand are there 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.420
 there is little within the group of choice one 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.960
 other side of the seat mark and the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.090
 sportiness 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.130
 you are passionate about driving a man 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 that comes from the racing world 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.049
 do you think methane is at odds with the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.270
 driving pleasure one might think 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.939
 that there is a conflict but in this case 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.939
 absolutely no, I drove it 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.340
 the other day and I have to say this 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.189
 car has its own and this engine in 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.740
 particular leads to the sert all 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.049
 things we expect from a brand 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.469
 sporting them enough for me the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.840
 methane from the economy but does not detract from it 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.000
 nothing the joy of driving before we spoke 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 of costs and facts methane costs less 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.020
 of LPG diesel fuel but i 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.640
 distributors are still few and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.550
 especially in Italy it is not possible 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.350
 almost nowhere to refuel 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.610
 self service 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.530
 the important doctor as volkswagen 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.890
 can do something to improve 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.530
 the infrastructure two things this 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.920
 machine first is a bi-fuel then 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.650
 it means that we have 400 km of 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.370
 autonomy with methane but also 900 with 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.980
 the gas 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.280
 then the second on the supply I think 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.920
 that will grow must grow because the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.620
 the future of not only us the group 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.380
 volkswagen of the other manufacturers will be 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.220
 in the direction of methane to reduce 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.790
 pollution 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.670
 then that in the same way that the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.360
 gpl brought this infrastructure 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.550
 will happen with methane on the safe side 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.320
 the last joke about Italy in our 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.140
 methane country is above all synonymous 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.880
 of fiat according to you how much from net 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.790
 annoyance to the national builder for 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.880
 for me there is space for that for everyone 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.650
 methane is only 7 percent of the market 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.750
 It is growing 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.070
 now we are one of the first to arrive with 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.290
 a safe solution that we will pull 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:22.250
 customers from brands of all types 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.250
 including fia
