00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 in today's experiment a cat sitting 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.970
 today's video is very special because 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.770
 is dedicated to cyclists what 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.290
 let's do it is a support for the 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.040
 wall with pieces that we have a 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.040
 old bicycle 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.910
 or what we're going to need is going to 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.950
 can find on this side in the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.170
 screen some things can 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.700
 get from an old bicycle and other 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.820
 must visit a hardware store 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.890
 tlapalerÃ­a to get it as it 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.170
 call this I forgot what it was called 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.500
 lost lost to get the bridle 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.940
 and the three-quart tube and the packages 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.860
 of expansion the only thing that we have to 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.809
 to do is to take our handlebar post 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.820
 of a bicycle and we're going to put it in a 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.830
 end of our 3/4 tube remember 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.680
 that the length of your three-quart tube 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.430
 will depend on the length of the handlebar 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.080
 his bike 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.030
 I am using a tube of 30 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.879
 centimeters but I'm sure many 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.800
 of you will use one of 25 or 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.659
 even smaller all forms with the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.790
 pole can adjust the distance one 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.740
 Once inside we just adjust it and 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.600
 now we take our handlebar and what 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.190
 we insert in the same way as 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.830
 we would do to put it in our 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.560
 bike 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.090
 and we fix it in this way to the boss 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.840
 we put the flange 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.119
 at the other end 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.560
 and we have practically finished our 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.200
 support the only thing we have to do 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.240
 now it is to decorate it a little with ribbon and 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.759
 place it on the wall with the packages 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.569
 of expansion and now we only mark it in 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.569
 your position 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.120
 and we will fix card 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.120
 expansion of a room 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.350
 and ready they have their support to hang 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350
 his bike 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.990
 they can get creative and they can 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.570
 add a star to paint it from some 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 color in this other support that I made him 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.740
 I put a star and painted it white 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.780
 well I hope you liked this 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.220
 support that we made for the bicycle already 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.840
 you know if you liked this video comment 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.510

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.700
 those who have not done it and see you in 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.700

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.340
