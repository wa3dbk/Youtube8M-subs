itself<00:03:09.360> powering<00:03:09.990> this<00:03:10.310> makes<00:03:11.310> things<00:03:11.580> quick

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
itself powering this makes things quick

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.280 
itself powering this makes things quick
and<00:03:12.150> that's<00:03:12.300> a<00:03:12.390> 1<00:03:12.540> point<00:03:12.810> 2<00:03:12.959> gigahertz

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290

dual-core<00:03:13.980> processor<00:03:14.970> it<00:03:15.120> has<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.540> gig<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.990> ram

dual-core processor it has a gig of ram

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.770 
dual-core processor it has a gig of ram
that's<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.280> processor<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.910> use<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.300> then

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
that's for the processor to use and then

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.330 
that's for the processor to use and then
you<00:03:18.900> have<00:03:19.080> 32<00:03:19.590> gigabytes<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.190> internal

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
very nice as far as that goes I'm not

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.830 
very nice as far as that goes I'm not
going<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:24.989> talk<00:03:25.110> about<00:03:25.290> Android<00:03:25.890> 4.2<00:03:26.489> much<00:03:26.850> but

going to talk about Android 4.2 much but

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.360 
going to talk about Android 4.2 much but
I<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:28.050> want<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.290> say<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.950> it<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.160> lot

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
I just want to say that I like it a lot

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.240 
I just want to say that I like it a lot
and<00:03:29.640> in<00:03:30.120> fact<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.570> makes<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:31.560> phone<00:03:31.860> feel

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
and in fact it makes this phone feel

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.540 
and in fact it makes this phone feel
more<00:03:32.610> like<00:03:33.140> the<00:03:34.140> smoothness<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.590> an<00:03:34.860> iPhone<00:03:35.340> or

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
more like the smoothness of an iPhone or

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.520 
more like the smoothness of an iPhone or
Windows<00:03:36.120> Phone<00:03:36.540> 7<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:36.989> think<00:03:37.200> that's<00:03:37.380> what

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
Windows Phone 7 I think that's what

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.710 
Windows Phone 7 I think that's what
Android<00:03:37.890> was<00:03:38.040> lacking<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.550> most<00:03:38.760> they<00:03:39.510> did<00:03:39.690> a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
Android was lacking the most they did a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.320 
Android was lacking the most they did a
great<00:03:40.050> job<00:03:40.190> as<00:03:41.190> far<00:03:41.430> as<00:03:41.610> what<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.000> did<00:03:42.150> and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
great job as far as what it did and

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.180 
great job as far as what it did and
functionality<00:03:43.110> wise<00:03:43.260> but<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.650> design<00:03:43.980> just

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
functionality wise but the design just

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.580 
functionality wise but the design just
wasn't<00:03:44.580> as<00:03:44.670> good<00:03:44.850> as<00:03:45.450> far<00:03:45.780> as<00:03:45.870> smoothness<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
wasn't as good as far as smoothness and

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.740 
wasn't as good as far as smoothness and
things<00:03:46.860> interacting<00:03:47.459> in<00:03:47.670> some<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.540> touch

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
things interacting in some of the touch

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.080 
things interacting in some of the touch
sensitivity<00:03:49.110> sometimes<00:03:49.890> and<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.820> know<00:03:50.880> that

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
sensitivity sometimes and I know that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.120 
sensitivity sometimes and I know that
can<00:03:51.269> be<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.480> phone<00:03:51.690> too<00:03:51.959> but<00:03:52.170> in<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.650> case<00:03:52.860> it

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
can be the phone too but in this case it

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.870 
can be the phone too but in this case it
they've<00:03:53.820> just<00:03:53.850> really<00:03:55.370> tweaked<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:56.730> made

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
they've just really tweaked it and made

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.850 
they've just really tweaked it and made
things<00:03:57.180> nicer<00:03:57.630> they<00:03:58.140> came<00:03:58.380> up<00:03:58.410> with<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.709> new

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
things nicer they came up with a new

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.400 
things nicer they came up with a new
font<00:03:59.130> called<00:03:59.400> Roboto<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.230> a
