00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.029
 media I bring white gameplay 2 like 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.940
 you are watching a gameplay the map of 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.830
 raid to vary we are in raid study 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.680
 study raid good the case is that 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.070
 I come to talk about games and other 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.570
 things that there are for this e3 and you know that 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.640
 I started a kind as I do not know if a 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.199
 series one let's say that miniseries a 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.820
 sort of a series of videos in the 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.680
 which was going to talk a little about each 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.850
 village etcetera but good as of these 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.279
 two games in which I will talk 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.129
 neither do you have too much to 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.069
 make two separate videos and there's also no 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.239
 a lot of what to teach at the moment 

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:39.280
 I'm just going to talk about them like that 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.389
 above are these two games the deep 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.800
 down and the one of the online corts that are 

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:47.879
 the games that personalize a desire 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.010
 incredible that the truth comes out 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.829
 can first in the scroll because it is 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.440
 a saga that I love being seen played 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.420
 and that's something that I love and the truth 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.829
 is that I do not know the only bad thing that happens to me 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.429
 with this kind of games for those who do not 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.260
 know him 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.440
 surely you will know skyring by 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.840
 example that is the 5 that they pulled out are a 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.750
 series of games that are 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.060
 very long style you alone and go 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.460
 advancing and practically like you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.750
 weapon and adventure above all a little 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.179
 medieval magic roll 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.460
 basically it's usually like that not then 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.020
 good the one of the online courses is a 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.149
 game that already preparing many years 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.390
 the truth is another one game that is going to be 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.280
 online multiplayer style 901 equal 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.929
 character a bit so you see yourself more or 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.399
 less how it's going to be is and then the 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:35.759
 more guards follows a multiplayer 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.979
 massive with a lot of things and going to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.450
 be bestial and once good I've 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.130
 got me invited to see 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 superman gala the girl here of times 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.270
 Spain has achieved something for me 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.989
 go to e3 just to enter a thing 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.509
 of three 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.709
 detests and can play this game well 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.020
 which is a few things I'll do I'll 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:59.399
 be able to try elder scrolls online that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.929
 I really want to go there and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.730
 are the games that I want most afterwards 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.280
 On the other side is the 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.630
 the deep down is a game that called me 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.910
 very much attention if some 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.590
 remember the trailer of let's say that 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.240
 they took out of play 4 that is the only thing that 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.760
 so many people have been seen so far 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.170
 he said that the rest of companies this is 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.630
 impossible to be so not because they 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.090
 basically, it would be too much 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.610
 well the center that was beastly and its 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.850
 thematic family that medieval style 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.200
 orcs goblins and things like archers magicians 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.330
 so, as I am very much called 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.640
 attention and imagine that it is something that a 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.710
 everybody likes me and they usually take me out 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.530
 games so it's all as well as 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.660
 set in that environment is not magic 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.710
 etc 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.030
 personally as I tell you I like them 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.970
 very much and images and videos and parts 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.680
 of the trailer and others but they are as I say 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.510
 games that I really want 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.970
 I decided to put together these two games the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.960
 same video because they are pretty games 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.340
 similar so more or less speaking in 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.680
 Regarding the theme of games and so on 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.000
 and I think personally for those 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.310
 games to get a lot of attention 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.610
 first because they are about two games that 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.080
 they are very long or they are not games and 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.480
 take out like every year like that 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.010
 written or maybe it's to be so that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.530
 take out every two years etc 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.690
 or a chair but they are games like that 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.310
 and much more elaboration than when 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.810
 they take them out and if they have to 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.970
 delay three months late then 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.520
 it's simply because it's going to be better 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.190
 the game or that the priority 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.480
 highlight it government then that's why 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.820
 so I'm really looking forward to that 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.310
 come out I'm super happy that there's 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.380
 a lot of new games and about 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.320
 all because you already know that they will see 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.790
 novas let's say that new sagas let's say 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.250
 that what I also have more desire not 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.610
 played 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:52.270
 assassin's creed 819 a city ​​color 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.220
 200,000 I mean I do not want to be called 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.050
 different simply that they are not what 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.610
 same as always does not mean that because 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.620
 have the next number plus the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.450
 previous but nevertheless it is something that 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.130
 we have met not what you get 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.790
 by surprise it is more the surprise of before 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.739
 to play it 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.989
 neighbor game and then the game if you 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.890
 like absolutely the same as 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.819
 obviously the name but these guys 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.379
 are the games that I have so many 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.389
 desire are two games that I will be 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.799
 trying to cover during this stress and 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.100
 the truth is that it is something that as 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.350
 I say I will want to go yes or yes I will be 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.930
 let's say that lieutenant those days before 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.090
 that the e3 starts there are a series of passes 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.370
 in those hostile past days 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.130
 previous for press passes for 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.289
 passes of people who have accreditations 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.610
 invitations etc and surely 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.460
 many of them I will be able to be of 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.620
 Indeed even before it begins 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.780
 e3 in if I will be able to be playing at 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.210
 xbox one 9 because for a series 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.889
 invitations and so on or so I think that 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.180
 that there is no type of embargo is 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.520
 say everything that can be recorded there 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.470
 you can upload to YouTube the only bad thing 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.520
 is that not everything can be recorded ie 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.840
 if it tells you that if you manage to record 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.490
 something you can upload but if they tell you 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.349
 that you can not record obviously is 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.330
 that you can not go up because you can not 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:05.949
 record clear so good are these two 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.449
 games tell me what sensations you have 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.669
 above all, I really want the 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:10.689
 deep down because it's bestial to increase 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.729
 hardly anything has been seen 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.729
 it is clear they are line in terms of gameplay 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.549
 but they are like I follow two games that yes that 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.749
 I'm going to be very excited about 

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:21.039
 cinema that is what disappears and on 

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:21.549
 I want your opinion below in the 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.739
 comments 

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:25.599
 and nothing to subscribe to be attentive to 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:28.799
 more videos and see you next one 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.799
 greetings and goodbye 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.720
