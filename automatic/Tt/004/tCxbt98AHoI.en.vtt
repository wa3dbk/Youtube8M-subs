00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.300 
grind around until we it resembles that
nice<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.610> nice<00:01:56.820> fine<00:01:57.740> spice<00:01:58.740> mixture<00:01:59.159> like

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
nice of a nice fine spice mixture like

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.770 
nice of a nice fine spice mixture like
we<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.180> nice<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.420> easy<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
we have here so it's nice and easy to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.190 
we have here so it's nice and easy to
spread<00:02:01.020> across<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.500> meat<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.960> next

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
spread across it on meat so the next

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
spread across it on meat so the next
part<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.950> rocket<00:02:05.280> science<00:02:05.579> and<00:02:05.759> we're

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
part is not rocket science and we're

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.510 
part is not rocket science and we're
gonna<00:02:06.270> season<00:02:06.719> our<00:02:07.140> meat<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.069> we've<00:02:08.220> trimmed

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
gonna season our meat that we've trimmed

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
some Allen before father across crimp

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.199 
some Allen before father across crimp
the<00:02:48.860> edges<00:02:48.980> as<00:02:49.280> tight<00:02:49.520> as<00:02:49.640> possible

to me so I've decided provide an
alternative<00:03:16.370> own<00:03:16.580> way<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:16.820> cooking<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.239> simply

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
alternative own way of cooking it simply

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.410 
alternative own way of cooking it simply
stick<00:03:18.140> it<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.350> your<00:03:18.500> oven<00:03:18.709> at<00:03:19.070> 115<00:03:20.000> degrees

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
stick it in your oven at 115 degrees

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.050 
stick it in your oven at 115 degrees
Celsius<00:03:21.080> for<00:03:21.320> around<00:03:21.950> five<00:03:22.400> hours<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.940> this

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
Celsius for around five hours and this

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.820 
Celsius for around five hours and this
will<00:03:23.209> cook<00:03:23.360> absolutely<00:03:24.019> perfectly<00:03:24.470> it'll<00:03:24.739> be
