rough<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.890> stuff<00:00:38.640> during<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> Squier<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
rough on my stuff during the Squier and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.520 
rough on my stuff during the Squier and
it<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.739> mean<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.219> looks<00:00:41.460> pretty<00:00:41.579> new<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.530> I

it is I mean it looks pretty new so I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.470 
it is I mean it looks pretty new so I
think<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.070> totally<00:00:44.489> worth<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> price<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
think it's totally worth the price I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.970 
think it's totally worth the price I
usually<00:00:45.930> buy<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.739> cute

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
usually buy like the really cute

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
usually buy like the really cute
backpacks<00:00:47.520> or<00:00:47.760> like<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> cute<00:00:48.239> fabric<00:00:48.450> ones

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
backpacks or like the cute fabric ones

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.170 
backpacks or like the cute fabric ones
and<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.200> never<00:00:49.289> last<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.670> always<00:00:50.820> end<00:00:50.910> up

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and they never last and I always end up

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
and they never last and I always end up
buying<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.719> new<00:00:51.840> backpack<00:00:52.050> each<00:00:52.530> year<00:00:52.770> anyways

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
buying a new backpack each year anyways

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.279 
buying a new backpack each year anyways
so<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> long<00:00:54.510> run<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.050> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
so I think in the long run this is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
so I think in the long run this is
definitely<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.920> better<00:00:56.070> option<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
definitely the better option so so like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.370 
definitely the better option so so like
