catalytic<00:02:18.990> reduction<00:02:19.370> technology<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.610> it's

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
catalytic reduction technology and it's

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.650 
catalytic reduction technology and it's
used<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:21.840> produce<00:02:22.380> Knox<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.970> diesel<00:02:24.360> engines

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
used to produce Knox so diesel engines

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.720 
used to produce Knox so diesel engines
used<00:02:24.960> for<00:02:25.200> emergency<00:02:25.740> or<00:02:26.010> primed<00:02:26.460> power

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.570 
used for emergency or primed power
applications<00:02:27.630> often<00:02:27.930> need<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.770> or<00:02:29.130> all<00:02:29.520> of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
applications often need one or all of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.030 
applications often need one or all of
these<00:02:30.060> technologies<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.290> meet<00:02:31.470> emission

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
these technologies to meet emission

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.180 
these technologies to meet emission

process diagram showing SCR technology

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.480 
process diagram showing SCR technology
and<00:02:38.970> how<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.600> works<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.710> part<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
and how it works this part of the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.030 
and how it works this part of the
diagram<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:42.330> I've<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.960> circled<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
diagram that I've just circled is the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.670 
diagram that I've just circled is the
SCR<00:02:44.400> portion<00:02:45.060> so<00:02:45.750> here<00:02:45.960> we<00:02:46.110> have<00:02:46.260> incoming

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
SCR portion so here we have incoming

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.680 
SCR portion so here we have incoming
exhaust<00:02:47.580> gas<00:02:47.940> with<00:02:48.780> NOx<00:02:49.350> emissions<00:02:50.690> what

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
exhaust gas with NOx emissions what

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.600 
exhaust gas with NOx emissions what
first<00:02:51.990> happens<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.860> interacts<00:02:53.310> with<00:02:53.460> a

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
first happens is it interacts with a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.750 
first happens is it interacts with a
urea<00:02:54.030> injection<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.960> urea<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:55.830> harmless<00:02:56.550> and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
urea injection a urea is harmless and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.270 
urea injection a urea is harmless and
easy<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.450> handle<00:02:57.660> that's<00:02:58.290> why<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:58.770> used<00:02:59.040> in

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
easy to handle that's why it's used in

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.550 
easy to handle that's why it's used in
this<00:02:59.610> process<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.330> what<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.140> does<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.440> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
this process and what it does is it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.720 
this process and what it does is it
interacts<00:03:02.130> with<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.180> NOx<00:03:03.860> exhaust<00:03:04.860> gas<00:03:05.310> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
interacts with this NOx exhaust gas and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.070 
interacts with this NOx exhaust gas and
it<00:03:06.660> mixes<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:08.610> ideal<00:03:09.090> situation<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.870> it's

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
it mixes and the ideal situation is it's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.520 
it mixes and the ideal situation is it's
evenly<00:03:10.500> mixed<00:03:11.130> by<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.030> time<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.510> hits<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.080> SCO

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
evenly mixed by the time it hits the SCO

included<00:03:37.980> but<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.430> is<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> good<00:03:38.940> idea<00:03:39.300> is<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
included but it is a good idea is is a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.620 
included but it is a good idea is is a
NOx<00:03:40.320> sensor<00:03:41.310> feedback<00:03:41.520> we<00:03:41.940> do<00:03:42.120> include<00:03:42.450> this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
NOx sensor feedback we do include this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.449 
NOx sensor feedback we do include this
on<00:03:42.780> our<00:03:42.900> Bock<00:03:43.140> line<00:03:43.440> what<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.280> basically

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
on our Bock line what this basically

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.360 
on our Bock line what this basically
does<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.330> senses<00:03:45.959> the<00:03:46.530> output<00:03:46.950> here<00:03:47.130> to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
does is it senses the output here to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.550 
does is it senses the output here to
make<00:03:47.550> sure<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:48.090> where<00:03:48.660> you<00:03:48.810> want<00:03:49.020> to<00:03:49.080> be<00:03:49.290> and

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
make sure it's where you want to be and

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.180 
make sure it's where you want to be and
if<00:03:50.490> the<00:03:50.970> NOx<00:03:51.209> levels<00:03:51.870> aren't<00:03:52.670> low<00:03:53.670> enough<00:03:53.910> or

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
if the NOx levels aren't low enough or

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.800 
if the NOx levels aren't low enough or
it'll<00:03:56.190> basically<00:03:56.340> adjust<00:03:57.090> your<00:03:57.330> urea

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
it'll basically adjust your urea

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.230 
it'll basically adjust your urea
injection<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:58.860> get<00:03:59.100> the<00:03:59.790> desired

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
injection so that you get the desired

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.930 
injection so that you get the desired
output<00:04:00.620> now<00:04:01.620> there's<00:04:01.800> also<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:02.040> urea<00:04:02.400> control

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
output now there's also a urea control

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.949 
output now there's also a urea control
tank<00:04:03.740> the<00:04:04.740> urea<00:04:05.130> tank<00:04:05.760> usually<00:04:06.180> about<00:04:06.600> three

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
tank the urea tank usually about three

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.930 
tank the urea tank usually about three
percent<00:04:08.360> by<00:04:09.360> volume<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:10.320> urea<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.220> used<00:04:11.670> when

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
percent by volume of urea is used when

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.090 
percent by volume of urea is used when
compared<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.450> fuel<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.050> it's<00:04:13.320> a<00:04:13.440> very<00:04:13.650> small

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
compared to fuel so it's a very small

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:20.090 
compared to fuel so it's a very small
percentage<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:16.230> overall<00:04:16.489> fuel<00:04:18.739> so<00:04:19.739> what

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
percentage of the overall fuel so what

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.969 
percentage of the overall fuel so what
kind<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.600> reductions<00:04:21.600> can<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.020> see<00:04:22.410> with<00:04:22.800> this

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
kind of reductions can you see with this

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.200 
kind of reductions can you see with this
