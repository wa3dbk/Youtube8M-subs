00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.410
 good to all to 1 good video seems to be 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.480
 that we continue with the supposed 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.480
 leaks of black ops 3 and good of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.010
 pretty pretty interesting pep in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.990
 this time is that all this 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.450
 information because it comes from the same 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.699
 person basically as a person who 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.550
 he calls himself the long sensation and good 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.650
 basically because it supposedly has a 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.329
 document of seven pages and others and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.939
 Well, it seems to be true, not in 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:28.280
 first instance is to say that this is 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.870
 he has given it 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:35.000
 cj 76 days ago leaked a lot of information 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.920
 of black ops everything if you read the is the 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.230
 same or something like that but good 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.300
 seems to be successful enough 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.650
 things for the moment you have to say it 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.030
 neither should we take everything at the foot of 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.330
 the letter because you can a bitch lie 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.160
 quite huge not in that sense not 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.870
 we are spending a lot on example a 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.489
 more east of this man and the truth 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.170
 is that we can guide her a lot but 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.330
 Well for now, I bring it, I say 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.570
 that you be careful with the things that 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.190
 we are eating whatever he says he is 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.170
 confirmed is confirmed and what he says 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.280
 that comes from this person 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.159
 take it with tweezers do not take it true 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.200
 everything at face value because it is what 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.540
 there's me I will not decide or super 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.159
 awesome butt-fucked cocks 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.190
 Share this video everywhere 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.810
 because this is sensational not what 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.300
 I want you to take the information 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.979
 as it is and point that each one because then 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.170
 draw your conclusions and for now 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.430
 the channel is going quite like this in this 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.659
 Traveler's time not to miss 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.560
 the trust between me and you not 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.690
 basically we have not been four years 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.160
 doing exactly the same 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.200
 with video game information and other 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.080
 no, I 'm very happy with the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.730
 welcome good let's go there seems to be 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.350
 this man filter the names of all 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.940
 the maps a bit of the descriptions and 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.010
 but first let's go to what 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.990
 important not basically then in a 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.420
 section where it says that good others 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.790
 details of other maps in which 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.480
 they mention oct even as I would go back 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.000
 it is still known as a reservation still 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.130
 reserve bonds for a future of lc or 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.720
 how would it be but good that I would go back 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.580
 supposedly then you are also 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.860
 considering doing a remake the right 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.630
 high jacket 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.640
 being basically one of those three 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.400
 not the three characters ride jacket or 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.900
 standoff so well basically basically 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.670
 supposedly, he would ask the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.000
 plus a community survey would 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.770
 and all this then very much seems to be that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.570
 would unveil with two of the 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.500
 zombies and it seems that this time 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.690
 in a way to play normal no no a 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.970
 map with a map of zombies but a map 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.070
 so we can play in the 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.070
 space and others not that it would be like a 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.450
 kind of jump to something new but 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.950
 good now comes the important thing and what 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.480
 interesting 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.860
 I told him a long time ago what I 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.590
 I'm going to say now that we would move 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.870
 quite watch it or at least imagine 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.370
 a level like that in the multiplayer of 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.830
 call of duty ghosts imagine if you have 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.930
 rained cloth from the world better grow 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.900
 dot and ghost so far not but always 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.989
 said I would like a map in 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.849
 the one that I left everything then under 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.230
 of water I will fly to a lot of theory 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.480
 quite handsome little we seem to be 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.150
 you're thinking and you're working on 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.569
 a map that is one hundred percent below the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.760
 Water 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.799
 this would be basically in the city 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.530
 inspired good the city of Lyon city 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:21.230
 in china that is below the water 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.840
 search it in google google google 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.220
 search google the ians and pti is 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.910
 pretty cool long that would molar 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.500
 quite honestly a map of under the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.720
 water exploring a bit the mechanics 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.069
 that they have introduced over the shot and 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.459
 the rest 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.260
 from underwater again so 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.389
 would explode he would take full advantage of what 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.129
 I do not know is how the movement continues if 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.989
 we would be sunk all the time and 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.810
 jump we would jump much more or how 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.430
 would be this and also in spaces in 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.159
 mechanical about changing them a lot and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.709
 maybe this would hinder quite 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.989
 certain things I do not know I do not know I do not know 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.340
 how will it be honestly if it ends 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.109
 putting this and if all this is true 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.510
 also the clear can also be a 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.969
 super mega trola then the names of 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.719
 the others are haunted laberint bonnier 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:11.120
 from stronghold really convert overboard 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:15.409
 block block block I do not know what it is that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.870
 you really click combat construction 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.820
 storage and reactor by a certain reactor 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.769
 reactor we've talked about before 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.400
 also according to certain rumors that 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.419
 would be the Chernobyl reactor in a 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.240
 nuclear reactor abandoned in fact 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.060
 mobile you know 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.740
 disaster that caused all this too 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.630
 some map out there the real one and I think 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.340
 that will also be a museum and so on 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.490
 but good maps are also 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.490
 quite 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.410
 they are not the crumb the mega 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.940
 surprise are not smaller others are 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.620
 biggest global for example is for 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.120
 snipers as indicated and others 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.920
 but good basically because they are 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.860
 different 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.120
 Neither is nothing support before but 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.040
 well what I told you before I 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.230
 I imagine that it is called that was with the 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.150
 heart in the chest is doing many 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.670
 things logically this happens without filter 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.760
 the filter many times I have to be 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.950
 me and how I like to be the filter, but I do not 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.990
 I say what they have more 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.120
 force to be true and what it has 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.220
 less strength to be true obviously 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.610
 Well, this is not very sure if it is 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.320
 truth or I do not know how to say it in 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.780
 Heat sources and especially charly 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.060
 intel for me is one of the most in how 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.430
 say it the most Mexican as I go 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.700
 to repeat and I repeat all the fucking 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.800
 call of duty videos are people who 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.960
 is that it works closely with the 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.390
 activision and receive information 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.589
 privileged and the rumors that tend to 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.600
 going out there is 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:48.760
 you take a 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.160
 true that for example these that are 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.810
 they filter out that by the way all the 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.490
 rumors that have been leaking all the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.340
 crap that has passed without filters and 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.620
 other then almost all is over 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.710
 confirming no or very many of it the 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.290
 90% of the unheard-of saved is the saga of 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.060
 call of duty always 6 that is filtered not 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.560
 I do not know what the names of the streak in the 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.510
 names of I do not know what I do not know how much this 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.760
 game will be like that teaching because this time 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.920
 has worked quite well enough we 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.510
 we have had everything 2015 quite with 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.650
 leaks removing the wallace 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.650
 agreements well enough 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:25.849
 all true as you already know so 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.229
 nothing more nothing but to tell you 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:31.419
 cnooc you also know from speakers 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:33.649
 they detect 2065 of how it could be and so on 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.719
 but good the guy this I do not know how much 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:38.899
 we are about to filter but it takes five 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:41.509
 seven pages where you are going to go 

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:43.309
 saying or that there are many people already 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.439
 they are letting insult and everything else 

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:48.110
 people, well, I do not, I do not really know 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:50.360
 I do not know what to think me so with 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.849
 the news of like- minded people with all 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.849
 passion without filters and others and many have 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.139
 finished being a whore lie of 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:59.329
 shit you have to know how to filter things 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:01.039
 that 's something quite quite done 

00:06:59.329 --> 00:07:03.439
 a goal but good is a rumor will continue 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.660
 being a rumor and it is simply 

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.330
 well 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.460
 because we see in an era then the 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.220
 internet that you can not hardly believe 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.750
 nor the news that comes out in the 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.260
 news many times in 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:19.120
 newspapers well good no and well no what 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.730
 I know I do not know if that will be true if it will be 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.590
 lie or that simply as I say by 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:26.290
 your important probable is sincerely 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.390
 to float the mechanics and so on 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.400
 quite likely so nothing guys 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.760
 see you in the next half video 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.760
 until next time
