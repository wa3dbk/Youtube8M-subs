suggestions on how i could pull that

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.159 
suggestions on how i could pull that
thread<00:03:22.699> out<00:03:22.879> so<00:03:23.150> obviously<00:03:23.629> i<00:03:23.720> had<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.959> drain

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
thread out so obviously i had to drain

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.890 
thread out so obviously i had to drain
all<00:03:24.349> the<00:03:24.379> fluid<00:03:24.739> out<00:03:24.859> but<00:03:25.190> i<00:03:25.280> just<00:03:25.489> put<00:03:25.669> in

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
all the fluid out but i just put in

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.969 
all the fluid out but i just put in
which<00:03:26.900> wasn't<00:03:27.139> necessarily<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.739> bad<00:03:27.919> thing

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
which wasn't necessarily a bad thing

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:29.619 
which wasn't necessarily a bad thing
because<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.609> was<00:03:28.760> kind<00:03:28.970> of<00:03:29.030> acted<00:03:29.359> kind<00:03:29.569> of

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
because it was kind of acted kind of

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.039 
because it was kind of acted kind of
like<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.780> flush<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:32.510> know<00:03:32.599> i<00:03:32.629> put<00:03:32.900> new

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.759 
like a flush you know i put new
synthetic<00:03:33.349> fluid<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.629> and<00:03:35.629> when<00:03:36.199> i<00:03:36.229> drained<00:03:36.650> it

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
synthetic fluid in and when i drained it

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.759 
synthetic fluid in and when i drained it
out<00:03:37.900> it's<00:03:38.900> actually<00:03:39.079> i<00:03:39.319> don't<00:03:39.379> think<00:03:39.560> he<00:03:39.620> can

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769

dark fluid came out with it some of the

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.759 
dark fluid came out with it some of the
remaining<00:03:54.979> fluid<00:03:55.459> that<00:03:55.549> was<00:03:55.699> inside<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
remaining fluid that was inside the

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.699 
remaining fluid that was inside the
inside<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.829> primary<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.549> also<00:03:58.819> some<00:03:59.060> small

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
inside the primary and also some small

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.869 
inside the primary and also some small
pieces<00:04:00.709> they<00:04:01.069> weren't<00:04:01.250> metallic<00:04:01.669> they<00:04:01.790> were

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
pieces they weren't metallic they were

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.809 
pieces they weren't metallic they were
very<00:04:02.000> soft<00:04:02.389> like<00:04:02.659> like<00:04:03.699> carbon<00:04:04.699> or<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:05.650> rubbery

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
very soft like like carbon or a rubbery

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.589 
very soft like like carbon or a rubbery
type<00:04:07.819> of<00:04:09.129> material<00:04:10.129> I<00:04:10.459> didn't<00:04:11.209> strike<00:04:11.389> me<00:04:11.419> as

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
type of material I didn't strike me as

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.080 
type of material I didn't strike me as
being<00:04:11.629> anything<00:04:12.379> I<00:04:12.889> should<00:04:13.430> be<00:04:13.639> alarmed<00:04:14.000> about

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
being anything I should be alarmed about

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.460 
being anything I should be alarmed about
it<00:04:14.329> looked<00:04:14.840> like<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:15.019> was<00:04:15.139> tough<00:04:15.259> that<00:04:15.349> was

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
it looked like it was tough that was

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.440 
it looked like it was tough that was
probably<00:04:15.680> pretty<00:04:15.949> common<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.639> just<00:04:17.209> little

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
probably pretty common just just little

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.719 
probably pretty common just just little
teeny<00:04:17.690> chunks<00:04:17.779> of<00:04:18.919> you<00:04:18.950> know<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.250> was

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
teeny chunks of you know that was

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:20.830 
teeny chunks of you know that was
inside<00:04:20.000> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
inside the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.550 
inside the
casing<00:04:21.290> there<00:04:21.520> so<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.550> all<00:04:22.820> came<00:04:23.030> out<00:04:23.210> when<00:04:23.360> i

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
casing there so that all came out when i

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.230 
casing there so that all came out when i
drained<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.650> out<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.889> second<00:04:25.190> time<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.580> maybe

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
drained it out the second time so maybe

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.689 
drained it out the second time so maybe
the<00:04:26.449> fact<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.810> i<00:04:26.960> had<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.680> drain<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:28.010> was<00:04:28.190> not

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
the fact that i had the drain it was not

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.100 
the fact that i had the drain it was not
a<00:04:28.730> bad<00:04:28.940> thing<00:04:29.180> because<00:04:29.330> i<00:04:29.570> was<00:04:29.690> able<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.930> flush

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
a bad thing because i was able to flush

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.650 
a bad thing because i was able to flush
it<00:04:30.169> out<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.410> bit<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:34.580> like<00:04:34.940> i<00:04:35.060> said<00:04:35.090> it's<00:04:35.510> just

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
it out a bit but like i said it's just

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.480 
it out a bit but like i said it's just
just<00:04:36.139> kind<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.350> sucks<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.770> head<00:04:36.949> all<00:04:37.250> together

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
just kind of sucks the head all together

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:44.640 
just kind of sucks the head all together
ready<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.360> go<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:38.889> then<00:04:39.889> that<00:04:40.070> happened<00:04:40.280> so

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650

limited tool selection to get that thing
out<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.460> there<00:05:10.580> because<00:05:11.389> that's<00:05:11.690> that<00:05:11.900> threat

as you saw his way inside there so

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.240 
as you saw his way inside there so

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
that's it I haven't got a whole lot

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.409 
that's it I haven't got a whole lot

other than that I've got it I've got

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.750 
other than that I've got it I've got
plenty<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.900> things<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.470> do<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.430> bike<00:05:22.580> I've

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
plenty of things to do to the bike I've

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.560 
plenty of things to do to the bike I've
got<00:05:22.910> parts<00:05:23.210> here<00:05:23.419> I've<00:05:23.570> got<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:25.760> know<00:05:25.850> wires

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
got parts here I've got you know wires

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.930 
got parts here I've got you know wires
to<00:05:26.870> solder<00:05:27.110> up<00:05:28.900> so<00:05:30.400> that's<00:05:31.400> all<00:05:31.669> going<00:05:31.850> to

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
to solder up so that's all going to

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.080 
to solder up so that's all going to
happen<00:05:32.090> but<00:05:33.070> right<00:05:34.070> now<00:05:34.220> my<00:05:34.250> concern<00:05:34.729> is<00:05:35.030> just

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
happen but right now my concern is just

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.020 
happen but right now my concern is just
getting<00:05:35.450> this<00:05:35.600> often<00:05:36.080> I<00:05:36.289> just<00:05:37.250> I'm<00:05:37.669> a<00:05:37.789> kind<00:05:37.970> of

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
getting this often I just I'm a kind of

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.550 
getting this often I just I'm a kind of
type<00:05:38.180> of<00:05:38.270> person<00:05:38.539> where<00:05:38.630> I<00:05:38.690> can't<00:05:39.110> leave<00:05:39.320> this

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
type of person where I can't leave this

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.409 
type of person where I can't leave this
and<00:05:39.800> move<00:05:39.889> on<00:05:40.099> to<00:05:40.130> something<00:05:40.430> else<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:40.940> just

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
and move on to something else I just

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.379 
and move on to something else I just
this<00:05:41.900> would<00:05:42.080> drive<00:05:42.289> me<00:05:42.470> nuts<00:05:42.910> you<00:05:43.910> know<00:05:44.000> the

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
this would drive me nuts you know the

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:45.640 
this would drive me nuts you know the
whole<00:05:44.510> time<00:05:44.690> I'm<00:05:44.840> working<00:05:45.139> on<00:05:45.200> something<00:05:45.260> else

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
whole time I'm working on something else

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.469 
whole time I'm working on something else
I'll<00:05:45.770> be<00:05:45.860> thinking<00:05:46.010> about<00:05:46.250> this<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:46.849> I<00:05:46.880> have<00:05:47.360> to

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
I'll be thinking about this so I have to

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.170 
I'll be thinking about this so I have to
get<00:05:47.599> this<00:05:47.630> fixed<00:05:47.990> first<00:05:48.729> once<00:05:49.729> I<00:05:49.849> get<00:05:50.030> this

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
get this fixed first once I get this

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.969 
get this fixed first once I get this
fixed<00:05:50.419> that<00:05:50.660> I<00:05:50.720> can<00:05:50.870> move<00:05:50.960> on<00:05:51.169> to<00:05:51.410> something

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
fixed that I can move on to something

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.830 
fixed that I can move on to something
else<00:05:52.220> so<00:05:52.520> that's<00:05:53.120> where<00:05:53.270> I'm<00:05:53.330> at<00:05:53.450> with<00:05:53.479> a<00:05:53.599> bike

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
else so that's where I'm at with a bike

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.640 
else so that's where I'm at with a bike
the<00:05:54.410> April<00:05:54.800> first<00:05:55.810> goal<00:05:56.810> of<00:05:57.080> riding<00:05:57.440> it<00:05:57.560> is

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
the April first goal of riding it is

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.250 
the April first goal of riding it is
probably<00:05:57.979> not<00:05:58.099> going<00:05:58.220> to<00:05:58.310> happen<00:05:59.260> not

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
probably not going to happen not

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.469 
probably not going to happen not
necessarily<00:06:00.710> because<00:06:00.830> of<00:06:01.220> this<00:06:01.430> more<00:06:02.300> so

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
necessarily because of this more so

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:04.029 
necessarily because of this more so
because<00:06:02.630> i<00:06:02.810> order<00:06:03.200> some<00:06:03.410> exhaust<00:06:03.710> pipes

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
because i order some exhaust pipes

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.029 
because i order some exhaust pipes
they're<00:06:04.400> being<00:06:04.639> made<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:06.110> custom<00:06:06.500> pipes<00:06:06.710> that

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
they're being made the custom pipes that

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.430 
they're being made the custom pipes that
are<00:06:07.370> made<00:06:07.639> to<00:06:07.760> order<00:06:08.030> i<00:06:08.210> don't<00:06:09.169> think<00:06:09.229> i'm

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
are made to order i don't think i'm

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.779 
are made to order i don't think i'm
going<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.620> have<00:06:09.740> those<00:06:09.950> until<00:06:10.370> the<00:06:10.490> middle

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
going to have those until the middle

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:13.960 
going to have those until the middle
part<00:06:11.000> of<00:06:11.150> april<00:06:11.419> anyway<00:06:12.220> but<00:06:13.220> unless<00:06:13.820> they

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970 
part of april anyway but unless they

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.279 
part of april anyway but unless they

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
surprised me getting to me early but i

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:20.950 
surprised me getting to me early but i
