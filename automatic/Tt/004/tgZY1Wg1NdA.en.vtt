00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.540
 thermaltake play even better all hello 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.059
 I am Arina and with you techno-kitchen MSB 85 m 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.849
 g43 second board from our test 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 the stand it costs not 5000 as gigabytes 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.779
 sl a2 800 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.300
 it was she who was supposed to be a breakthrough and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.220
 a good example why pay 5000 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.500
 if you can get two times cheaper 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.010
 same cross with intel processor again 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.880
 on board 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.399
 In fact, alas, the formula 16 4 failed 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.669
 what we have dedicated a separate review alas and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.469
 Oh 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 can't get a cheap platform for 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 bundles 2 290 for example otherwise it turned out 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.260
 would just be a bomb in the price segment with 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.440
 On the other hand, this board pleased us 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.539
 flawless overclocking 4770 key processor 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 on it overclocked to 4 point 3 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.210
 gigahertz exactly as on the board from 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.020
 gigabyte and the first time 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 voltage we raised vsegoda 1.25 volts 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.469
 I will tell you the truth 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.710
 our system was extremely unstable 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.040
 when we run on it before overclocking 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.290
 4770 key 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.510
 it turned out everything was just not enough system 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 stress we raised it a little and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.070
 marveled at the stability of the board keeps 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.040
 processor overclocking with ease because we 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.320
 Not all tests have been tortured by the formula 16 4 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.950
 also by bus but by only three 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.869
 percent 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.150
 You can overclock the processor and without an index 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.330
 ok but itâ€™s all a matter of processor and 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.430
 they are the motherboard anyway for 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.350
 use one video card from again 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.350
 or i7 processor system is good 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.330
 otherwise we have micro and tx solutions 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.680
 ports under expansion slot unsoldered 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.680
 maximum is 4 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.760
 by the way use 2 video cards 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.710
 difficult in micro and Trix case it 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.960
 it just won't fit there so 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.490
 forget you already color and second slot for 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.860
 video cards can be used for any 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.110
 write express boards whether sound 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.540
 cards and cards with tuner controllers and 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.920
 capture devices and things like that on 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.620
 this time we have a good location 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.240
 batteries and if you're wrong with overclocking 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.179
 no need to shoot a video card to 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.310
 update bios note that 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.150
 CPU power through 4 pin only 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.700
 but we had them for 4770 Kay in overclocking 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.060
 usb ports are also 6 although version 30 is only 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.220
 two 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.620
 for so available three video board 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.600
 displayport added 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.709
 network this time not intel but realtek 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.450
 sound is not 1150 and 892 but in general 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.760
 exception to full support cross 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.530
 and sl and additional ports are the same 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.070
 the most functional and build game 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.900
 the machine can be paid even for 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.790
 two and a half thousand rubles and buy 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.160
 yet the old stock at the old rate 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.230
 dollar could talk about 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.299
 disadvantages of the board but again this is only 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.400
 no external bios reset button 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.380
 of course we would like but on such 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.459
 she would have looked defiant 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.160
 and out of place 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:01.000
 still we have six 100 versions 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.040
 30 and inner and esbe 30 pad in 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.410
 overall our reward is silver for its 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.440
 money is an excellent basis for inexpensive but 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:12.390
 say a powerful computer with a 290 r9 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.390
 and with you was arina see you
