you probably know that in AutoCAD now
you<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:18.810> easily<00:00:19.020> create<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.529> view<00:00:19.890> by<00:00:20.220> simply

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
you can easily create a view by simply

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.420 
you can easily create a view by simply
placing<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.270> camera<00:00:21.810> into<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.199> model<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.769> then

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
placing a camera into the model and then

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
placing a camera into the model and then
telling<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.029> camera<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.900> want<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
telling the camera what you want the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
telling the camera what you want the
camera<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.949> looking<00:00:26.250> at<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.820> lot<00:00:27.029> like

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
camera to be looking at it's a lot like

camera to be looking at it's a lot like
the<00:00:27.240> analogy<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> taking<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:28.890> camera<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the analogy of taking a camera and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.400 
the analogy of taking a camera and
holding<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.000> up<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.359> eye<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.779> taking<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
holding it up to your eye and taking a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.650 
holding it up to your eye and taking a
picture<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.830> something<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.329> create<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
picture of something so I can create a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.100 
picture of something so I can create a
new<00:00:33.750> view<00:00:34.350> by<00:00:35.250> simply<00:00:35.790> selecting<00:00:36.270> my<00:00:36.660> camera

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
new view by simply selecting my camera

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.920 
new view by simply selecting my camera
tool<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> placing<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> camera<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.540> model

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
tool and placing the camera in the model

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
tool and placing the camera in the model
and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.170> AutoCAD<00:00:40.950> will<00:00:40.980> prompt<00:00:41.340> me<00:00:41.370> where<00:00:41.610> do

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and then AutoCAD will prompt me where do

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.479 
and then AutoCAD will prompt me where do
I<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> camera<00:00:42.450> located<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:44.100> what

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
I want the camera located and then what

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.279 
I want the camera located and then what
do<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.610> want<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> camera<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.480> look<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.079> we'll

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
do I want the camera to look at so we'll

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.200 
do I want the camera to look at so we'll
say<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.770> want<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> camera<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> look<00:00:47.640> over<00:00:47.940> here

notice<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> AutoCAD<00:00:49.530> adds<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.600> icon

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
notice that AutoCAD adds a little icon

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
notice that AutoCAD adds a little icon
that<00:00:51.629> represents<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.530> camera<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.070> call<00:00:53.250> this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
that represents that camera we call this

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.180 
that represents that camera we call this
a<00:00:53.430> glyph<00:00:53.989> each<00:00:54.989> camera<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.680> I've<00:00:55.770> placed<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
a glyph each camera that I've placed in

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.979 
a glyph each camera that I've placed in
the<00:00:56.280> model<00:00:56.579> now<00:00:56.730> has<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> glyph<00:00:57.270> associated

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the model now has a glyph associated

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.950 
the model now has a glyph associated
with<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.949> since<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.030> camera

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
with it and then since that camera

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
with it and then since that camera
behaves<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.440> any<00:01:01.739> other<00:01:02.010> object<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.730> AutoCAD

the same location in the model if I want
to<00:01:44.759> render<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.630> camera<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.200> seeing<00:01:46.500> but

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
to render what that camera is seeing but

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.310 
to render what that camera is seeing but
here's<00:01:47.759> an<00:01:47.909> interesting<00:01:48.270> point<00:01:48.540> because<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
here's an interesting point because I

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.859 
here's an interesting point because I
can<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:49.680> only<00:01:49.950> control<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.970> displayed

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
can not only control what is displayed

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.440 
can not only control what is displayed
by<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.530> view<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> can<00:01:53.790> also<00:01:53.939> control

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
by that view but I can also control

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.380 
by that view but I can also control
various<00:01:54.899> aspects<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> view<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.210> this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
various aspects of the view so in this

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.359 
various aspects of the view so in this
case<00:01:57.659> where<00:01:58.079> I've<00:01:58.229> placed<00:01:58.500> my<00:01:58.649> camera<00:01:59.159> I'm

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
case where I've placed my camera I'm

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.830 
case where I've placed my camera I'm
looking<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.360> window

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
looking right out the window

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560 
looking right out the window
of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.469> back<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:01.920> house<00:02:02.159> right<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:03.180> I'm

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
of the back of this house right now I'm

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
of the back of this house right now I'm
just<00:02:03.689> looking<00:02:04.049> out<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.439> window<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> blank

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
just looking out this window at a blank

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.089 
just looking out this window at a blank
background<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.930> let's<00:02:07.110> say<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> went<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:07.950> on

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
background but let's say I went out on

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.460 
background but let's say I went out on
the<00:02:08.280> site<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:09.090> example<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.750> represents<00:02:10.379> an

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the site for example this represents an

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.350 
the site for example this represents an
actual<00:02:10.830> house<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.310> there's<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.879> view<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.330> I

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
actual house well there's a view that I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.670 
actual house well there's a view that I
can<00:02:12.569> see<00:02:12.810> out<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.200> back<00:02:13.230> when

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
can see out the back when

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.550 
can see out the back when
no<00:02:13.859> of<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.670> house<00:02:14.849> well<00:02:15.719> just<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.140> happens

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
no of the house well just so happens

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.559 
no of the house well just so happens
that<00:02:16.650> I've<00:02:16.859> already<00:02:17.370> taken<00:02:17.549> a<00:02:17.760> photograph<00:02:18.299> of

view ok now when I restore that view

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.649 
view ok now when I restore that view
AutoCAD<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.129> not<00:03:02.280> only<00:03:02.459> going<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.669> restore<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
AutoCAD is not only going to restore the

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.390 
AutoCAD is not only going to restore the
location<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.379> camera<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.980> what<00:03:05.189> it<00:03:05.280> was

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
location of the camera and what it was

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.429 
location of the camera and what it was
looking<00:03:05.579> at<00:03:05.939> but<00:03:06.209> notice<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.959> can<00:03:07.290> now

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
looking at but notice that I can now

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.490 
looking at but notice that I can now
also<00:03:07.769> see<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:09.090> lake<00:03:09.359> right<00:03:09.840> out<00:03:10.079> through<00:03:10.319> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
also see the lake right out through the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.280 
also see the lake right out through the
window<00:03:10.889> so<00:03:11.639> now<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:11.849> can<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.359> what's<00:03:12.959> out<00:03:13.230> there

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
window so now I can see what's out there

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.220 
window so now I can see what's out there
and<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.700> course<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:15.599> haven't<00:03:15.840> done<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.169> yet

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and of course we haven't done this yet

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.199 
and of course we haven't done this yet
but<00:03:16.560> let's<00:03:16.709> click<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.250> render<00:03:17.489> button<00:03:17.669> and

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
but let's click on the render button and

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.899 
but let's click on the render button and
we'll<00:03:18.599> let<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.750> render<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.919> you<00:03:20.489> know<00:03:20.609> I'm

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
we'll let that render and you know I'm

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.460 
we'll let that render and you know I'm
gonna<00:03:21.060> speed<00:03:21.359> this<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:21.599> let's<00:03:21.989> look<00:03:22.199> at<00:03:22.349> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
gonna speed this up let's look at the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.170 
gonna speed this up let's look at the
final<00:03:22.769> results<00:03:23.340> because<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.729> just<00:03:23.819> takes<00:03:24.000> a

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
final results because it just takes a

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.759 
final results because it just takes a
long<00:03:24.359> time<00:03:24.419> to<00:03:24.659> render<00:03:25.229> but<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.590> can<00:03:25.709> see

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
long time to render but as you can see
