00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.800
 In today's tip I would like you 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.320
 like to show how to make currants 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.300
 can multiply itself 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.860
 in the case of a cuttings 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.890
 multiplication that one can actually completely 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.759
 great mid-August make 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.950
 you can see here at the currants the 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.920
 young wood the one-year wood that is 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.420
 still very bright here and you will see 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.380
 it is a bit darker again 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.600
 the old wood and the currant 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.829
 is best rooted in very young wood 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.320
 and that's why we cut now 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.320
 up here about the same height as one 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.239
 Pruning shears directly under one eye 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.310
 So say where the leaf comes from 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.600
 you cut off here 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.600
 his sharp scissors 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.359
 The cuttings must now from the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 leaves are freed 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.829
 except for a few above you can leave 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.399
 you still have the lower ones removed 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.209
 Carefully without the drive here too 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.299
 hurt 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.859
 you just do it with the plant 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.390
 not all her strength in the now 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.000
 leaves stuck but just ever 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.599
 enough energy has roots around below 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.599
 expel 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:04.640
 so now are the cuttings in the reason 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:07.159
 already optimally prepared you can 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.009
 Now either in a flowerpot 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.800
 sink or get a nice one 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.489
 light shady place in the garden 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.959
 If possible, do not look so far away from 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.640
 done so that you also in the next 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.000
 Summer always remembers that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.190
 must be poured regularly 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 and basically everything should be fine 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.440
 The skin should then die a year later 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.290
 Plant so many roots have formed 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.250
 that you get them to their final location 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.250
 can plant out 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.730
 the floor should be as one 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.670
 be crumbly fine earth even if you 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.250
 that planted in the pot then took the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.410
 fine roots simply the possibility 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.300
 spreading out into the earth too hard 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.470
 is 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.660
 they do not succeed and mostly 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.340
 then rot the cuttings now 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.030
 you basically take the cuttings and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:36.860
 sunk it until you turn to the leaves 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.860
 comes in the earth
