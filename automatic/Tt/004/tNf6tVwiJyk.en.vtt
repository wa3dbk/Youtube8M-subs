00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:10.169
 it is very common to think that ethics is 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.900
 a large table of human behaviors 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:17.560
 would be all possible actions of the 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.529
 man in two columns in two columns 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:25.240
 can not can not can not fair or 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:28.779
 right or wrong wrong and so and so 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.890
 ethical person is one who respects the 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.500
 table 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.559
 the professor of ethics might be the one 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.140
 who knows the whole table decor 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.340
 because we are very well here to 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.989
 demonstrate that this is not so and why 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.239
 not because this table is not enough for us 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.070
 after all, at every moment of our 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:57.480
 shared life of our coexistence 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:01.780
 we have to face unprecedented situations 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.439
 situations for which we have no value 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.330
 we have no solution we have no 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:14.500
 so that ethics becomes 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:17.680
 a necessary debate is a debate on 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.170
 we want to respect the principles 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.170
 that we want our northern 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.960
 coexistence ethics so it becomes 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.049
 a window to the future a window 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.170
 open to becoming and less a respect 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:36.310
 to universal principles enshrined in the 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.130
 so be ethical today is before 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.530
 nothing else will be open and willing to 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.430
 participate in a large space of 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.140
 argument a large polyphonic space 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.509
 where each one 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.329
 raise his arm to defend his 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.540
 principles their views and how to 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.619
 I would like the coexistence to be like this 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.350
 my friends 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.649
 imagine a discussion about the use of 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.530
 facebook child for example all 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:09.820
 We recognize on facebook 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.770
 its in range and reach is 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.530
 of its usefulness 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.580
 however, facebook used 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.880
 in children's public can produce 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.880
 disasters 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.670
 the electronic bullying potentiated in 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.220
 global scale leading to suicide and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.950
 disgrace to the destruction of identities 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.530
 still incipient and that is why the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.110
 discussion about using facebook is 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.830
 for being made and no use consulted 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.050
 past 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.290
 it is useless to scour the plains 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.660
 aristotle christ man buddha none 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.840
 of them talked about facebook this 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.860
 pineapple is a pineapple we have to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.050
 to peel 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.120
 very well so is the 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.110
 television advertising for the public 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.540
 childlike 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.390
 after all this discussion depends 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.489
 of television that is a recent phenomenon 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.030
 It depends on a television funded in 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.640
 Business Advertising Banking 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:09.450
 also depends on companies that produce 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.470
 products and foodstuffs for 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.650
 children 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.100
 and there the existence of advertising for 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.010
 this type of consumer and of course it is 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.230
 Of course, as it's up to us to discuss 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.840
 about what interests us and what 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.049
 we do not care how everything will be 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.180
 contradictory appetites like everything else will 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.910
 points out that it is contrary to 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.880
 that ethics are excluded. 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.310
 precisely this great space for debate 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.530
 those who participate in it raises the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.040
 and say how they would like the 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.980
 society to live together prays or alana 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.220
 Holland does not get past this debate 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.019
 your flags have your preferences 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.570
 would like society to be a 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.940
 and not from another but always accepted 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.049
 the existence of points of view 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.900
 different as well in this debate 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:07.890
 in this great discussion about aaa 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.380
 legality and the feasibility of 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.049
 advertising for children of your 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.959
 justice and its relevance alana 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.519
 always expressed himself with clarity to 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.579
 whole society 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.550
 this is a political force that participates 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.700
 the part of the debate and confrontation 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.150
 tells you clearly how you would like it 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.330
 society is to live together because 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.710
 very well in this debate and in this discussion 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.380
 alana achieved victories victories 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.600
 important acknowledgments 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.830
 significant of its flags and is 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:50.010
 of course the discussion that today 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:54.270
 we undertook is the norm of the conanda 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.900
 which determines the end of advertising for 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.280
 children's public on television 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.260
 of course this is 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:07.980
 victory is a big step towards 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.760
 triumph an idea triumph one 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:17.040
 way of living at the expense of 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:21.830
 another one that watches until then it is clear that 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:25.800
 there will be voices discordant voices edis 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.710
 hot voices beaten in their 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.100
 pretensions in your appetites 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.880
 but when we talk about ethics it's always 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.970
 like this 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.740
 ethics is the victory of coexistence over 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.350
 the singular interests 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.660
 is the victory of the general will over the 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.130
 the will of each one is the 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:49.250
 public interest over the interests is 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.320
 particular is the interests of 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.680
 circumstance and that is why, of course, 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.190
 We are here to refer you to a 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.760
 rules that the end of the day is a 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.400
 certain recognition of the justice of a 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.430
 form of coexistence to the detriment of 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.910
 another hegemonic until then that this 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.340
 debate is carried out and that this 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.200
 normative is respected 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.120

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.570
 complexity and of the relevance of the 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.570
 being debated thank you very much
