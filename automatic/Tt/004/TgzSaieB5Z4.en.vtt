00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.160 

you

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.070 

I<00:00:12.400> think<00:00:13.400> probably<00:00:14.180> the<00:00:14.450> most<00:00:14.600> common<00:00:15.020> mistake

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
I think probably the most common mistake

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.840 
I think probably the most common mistake
is<00:00:15.500> overcrowding<00:00:16.100> the<00:00:16.219> grill<00:00:16.369> putting<00:00:16.730> too

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
is overcrowding the grill putting too

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.120 
is overcrowding the grill putting too
much<00:00:17.029> food<00:00:17.240> at<00:00:17.360> one<00:00:17.510> time<00:00:17.750> I<00:00:18.050> always<00:00:18.500> work<00:00:18.950> on

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
much food at one time I always work on

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.550 
much food at one time I always work on
what<00:00:19.279> I<00:00:19.310> call<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.550> 30%<00:00:20.270> rule<00:00:20.439> 30%<00:00:21.439> of<00:00:21.500> the

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
what I call the 30% rule 30% of the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.339 
what I call the 30% rule 30% of the
grill<00:00:21.740> no<00:00:22.099> food<00:00:22.400> so<00:00:22.700> that<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:23.000> have<00:00:23.300> room<00:00:24.110> and

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
grill no food so that you have room and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.620 
grill no food so that you have room and
space<00:00:24.890> to<00:00:25.490> maneuver<00:00:25.580> so<00:00:26.300> if<00:00:26.360> you<00:00:26.480> get<00:00:26.599> a

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
space to maneuver so if you get a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.960 
space to maneuver so if you get a
flare-up<00:00:26.930> hot<00:00:27.349> spot<00:00:27.650> you<00:00:27.800> move<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.220> food

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
flare-up hot spot you move that food

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.790 
flare-up hot spot you move that food
bill<00:00:29.180> cooler<00:00:29.539> bottom<00:00:30.140> of<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.260> grill<00:00:30.440> of

bill cooler bottom of the grill of
course<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.130> other<00:00:31.279> thing<00:00:31.369> is<00:00:31.760> a<00:00:31.970> shift<00:00:32.750> in

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
course the other thing is a shift in

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.810
