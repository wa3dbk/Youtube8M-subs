00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
out if you want your hair to be more

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.319 
out if you want your hair to be more
bleached<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> more<00:01:49.979> blonder<00:01:50.549> than<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.820> suggest

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
bleached and more blonder than I suggest

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
bleached and more blonder than I suggest
that<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> keep<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.930> bleach<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:52.530> longer

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that you keep the bleach in for longer

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.880 
that you keep the bleach in for longer
but<00:01:53.430> as<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.329> my<00:01:54.570> hair<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.530> really

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.090 
but as you can see my hair is not really
that<00:01:56.659> bleached<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.530> completely

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that bleached it's not like completely

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
straight lines I cannot stress that

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.700 
straight lines I cannot stress that
enough<00:05:02.100> like<00:05:02.730> I<00:05:02.880> took<00:05:03.390> so<00:05:03.840> long<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.110> ombre<00:05:04.500> my

enough like I took so long to ombre my

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.010 
enough like I took so long to ombre my
hair<00:05:04.890> because<00:05:05.070> I<00:05:05.220> would<00:05:05.490> take<00:05:05.700> like<00:05:06.300> little

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
hair because I would take like little

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.950 
hair because I would take like little
thin<00:05:07.500> pieces<00:05:07.920> like<00:05:08.340> this<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:08.940> one<00:05:09.240> by<00:05:09.480> one<00:05:09.510> do

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
thin pieces like this and one by one do

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.750 
thin pieces like this and one by one do
them<00:05:10.140> so<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.830> it<00:05:11.100> would<00:05:11.190> put<00:05:11.340> put<00:05:11.610> them

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
them so that and it would put put them

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.060 
them so that and it would put put them
in<00:05:11.880> all<00:05:12.060> different<00:05:12.090> like<00:05:12.690> levels<00:05:13.170> of<00:05:13.500> where

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
in all different like levels of where

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.950 
in all different like levels of where
the<00:05:14.250> ombre<00:05:14.700> was<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.270> where<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.390> put<00:05:15.600> the<00:05:15.750> bleach

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
the ombre was and where I put the bleach

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.480 
the ombre was and where I put the bleach
because<00:05:16.170> I<00:05:16.350> didn't<00:05:16.680> want<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:16.920> to<00:05:16.980> be<00:05:17.160> just<00:05:17.190> a

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
because I didn't want it to be just a

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.280 
because I didn't want it to be just a
straight<00:05:17.850> line<00:05:18.030> because<00:05:18.330> I<00:05:18.420> see<00:05:18.630> so<00:05:18.990> many

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
straight line because I see so many

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.110 
straight line because I see so many
girls<00:05:19.770> who<00:05:20.310> they'll<00:05:20.520> own<00:05:20.700> braid<00:05:20.910> their<00:05:21.090> hair

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
girls who they'll own braid their hair

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.330 
girls who they'll own braid their hair
and<00:05:21.330> it's<00:05:21.570> literally<00:05:21.840> just<00:05:22.140> a<00:05:22.260> flat<00:05:22.650> line<00:05:22.980> and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
and it's literally just a flat line and

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.820 
and it's literally just a flat line and
it<00:05:23.430> just<00:05:23.610> looks<00:05:23.790> so<00:05:24.120> silly<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.900> at<00:05:25.320> least<00:05:25.500> mine

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
it just looks so silly so at least mine

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.740 
it just looks so silly so at least mine
is<00:05:26.130> just<00:05:26.370> different<00:05:26.580> levels<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.360> then<00:05:27.480> on<00:05:27.600> top

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
is just different levels and then on top

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.870 
is just different levels and then on top
of<00:05:27.810> that<00:05:27.990> since<00:05:28.320> I<00:05:28.410> curl<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.950> it<00:05:29.190> just<00:05:29.370> looks

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
of that since I curl it it just looks

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.640 
of that since I curl it it just looks
like<00:05:30.150> it's<00:05:30.330> naturally<00:05:31.020> put<00:05:31.230> in<00:05:31.320> there<00:05:31.500> it

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
like it's naturally put in there it

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.020 
like it's naturally put in there it
doesn't<00:05:31.830> just<00:05:32.010> look<00:05:32.310> like<00:05:32.370> a<00:05:32.520> straight<00:05:32.880> line

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030 
doesn't just look like a straight line

doesn't just look like a straight line
