00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
really really cool I mean it's not like

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.630 
really really cool I mean it's not like
an<00:01:21.180> actual<00:01:21.479> kingdom<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:21.990> houses<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> it's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
an actual kingdom with houses but it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340 
an actual kingdom with houses but it's
got<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> ton<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> stuff<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.990> as<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> see

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
got a ton of stuff and as you can see

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
got a ton of stuff and as you can see
over<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.640> just<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> normal<00:01:27.299> world

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
over there that is just the normal world

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.440 
over there that is just the normal world
he's<00:01:27.840> placed<00:01:28.140> snow<00:01:28.890> blocks<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.520> top<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.909> every

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
he's placed snow blocks on top of every

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.050 
he's placed snow blocks on top of every
single<00:01:31.130> piece<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.189> grass<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.820> think<00:01:32.970> he<00:01:33.030> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
single piece of grass I think he just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.350 
single piece of grass I think he just
replaced<00:01:33.540> them<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.610> let<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.880> graphs<00:01:36.180> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
replaced them with let the graphs of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.080 
replaced them with let the graphs of
snow<00:01:36.600> blocks<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:38.130> he's<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.579> course<00:01:38.610> out

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
snow blocks and then he's of course out

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.810 
snow blocks and then he's of course out
of<00:01:39.180> these<00:01:39.299> huge<00:01:40.100> towers<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.250> he's<00:01:41.340> used<00:01:41.579> iron

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
of these huge towers and he's used iron

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.780 
of these huge towers and he's used iron
blocks<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> cool<00:01:42.930> way<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.579> like

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
