00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.900
 Well, here we have our precious 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.410

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.730
 take it out of the house 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.260
 the people who always come with those 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.260
 fine 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.490

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.480
 there is inside 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.480
 as if we did not already know 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.100
 good and not just on the console because 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.100
 also from the institutions 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.209
 the typical not the instructions 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.480
 warnings the cards then 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.110
 augmented reality 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.110
 good 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.640
 not really what I wanted to tell you is that 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.610
 apart from the console do a moment 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.610
 please I can not get it out 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:02.700

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.700
 the physical version of monster hunter 4 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.069
 here is the box ladies and gentlemen 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.459
 where 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.660
 In the back 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:29.010
 and I do not think it's a little legal hair 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.200
 and good the physical version neither more nor 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.340
 less 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.350
 greece draw from one side 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:39.060
 Yes now 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.060
 now comes the moment 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.419
 for us the first 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.660
 and the console 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.689
 you can already see it through the 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.830
 facilitator 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.830
 the symbol 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:09.009
 I do not understand 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.009
 how beautiful how beautiful is 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.860
 believe in parties 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.680
 you can see here 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.250
 definitely 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:29.380
 I think 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.380
 the drawing of the monster 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.120
 and good and for the back 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.650
 well here 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.650
 the light is making me a bit 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:47.509
 ditch 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.509
 that is reflecting logic 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.240
 It is an idea 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:05.410
 here it looks good, well, this is 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:11.820
 our japanese console edition 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:11.820
 special monster hunter 4 wood 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.010
 here the doubts are resolved waiting for 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.070
 future people who watch the video the 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.620
 ask us 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.660
 how can we play our cancer 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:31.220
 4 well 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.060
 and you have to take a Japanese console 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.490
 why 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.889
 the game has region limitations 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.410
 and from there, you can ask that 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:43.990
 the game will obviously be Japanese or 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.409
 you can download it from the edition to 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.729
 through 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:53.279
 of the table 

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:55.729
 very good we have stabilized and you know 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:58.919
 that we learn used the concoction 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:01.949
 monster monjack or we have simply 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:04.759
 used a constant sharp object 

00:07:01.949 --> 00:07:04.759
 important 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.610
 and same without upcoming videos
