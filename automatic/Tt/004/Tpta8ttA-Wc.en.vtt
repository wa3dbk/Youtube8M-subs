00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
inside so comes with the diverter valve

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:40.930 
inside so comes with the diverter valve
spring<00:00:25.010> and<00:00:26.010> yeah<00:00:26.490> board<00:00:26.970> sticker<00:00:37.460> that's<00:00:38.460> it

comes in black comes with the yellow
piss<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.520> inside

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:58.410 

some<00:01:47.110> solutions<00:01:47.799> and<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.100> package<00:01:57.420> comes

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
some solutions and the package comes

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.380 
some solutions and the package comes
with<00:01:58.569> a<00:02:00.780> blue<00:02:01.780> spring<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:05.020> green<00:02:05.289> spring

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
with a blue spring and a green spring

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.120 
with a blue spring and a green spring
now<00:02:07.390> if<00:02:07.509> you<00:02:07.630> get<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.959> spring<00:02:08.560> tuning<00:02:08.920> kit

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
now if you get the spring tuning kit

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.780 
now if you get the spring tuning kit
that<00:02:09.399> actually<00:02:09.729> comes<00:02:09.970> with<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.239> red<00:02:10.450> spring

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that actually comes with a red spring

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.440 
that actually comes with a red spring
basically<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.440> need<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:18.120> go<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.269> put

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
basically if you need to go and put

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:36.059 
basically if you need to go and put
those<00:02:21.239> shims<00:02:22.239> on<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> inside<00:02:35.069> obviously

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
those shims on the inside obviously

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:43.330 
those shims on the inside obviously
makes<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.489> tighter

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.259 

higher<00:02:44.340> spring<00:02:44.760> compression<00:02:47.000> only<00:02:48.000> by<00:02:48.239> a

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
higher spring compression only by a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.270 
higher spring compression only by a
little<00:02:48.599> bit<00:02:48.720> just<00:02:48.959> depends<00:02:49.799> on<00:02:49.890> what<00:02:50.099> your

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
little bit just depends on what your

00:02:50.280 --> 00:03:00.649 
little bit just depends on what your
application<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:59.000> you<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.120> I'll<00:03:00.239> show<00:03:00.420> you<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
application is you get I'll show you the

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.460 
application is you get I'll show you the
inside<00:03:04.010> that's<00:03:05.010> what<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.310> piston<00:03:05.700> looks<00:03:05.879> like

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
inside that's what the piston looks like

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:15.890 
inside that's what the piston looks like
it's<00:03:07.470> all<00:03:07.620> aluminum<00:03:14.299> two<00:03:15.299> rubber<00:03:15.540> owing

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
it's all aluminum two rubber owing

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:25.480 
it's all aluminum two rubber owing
o-rings<00:03:16.470> on<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:16.739> inside

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:42.060 

ah<00:03:32.980> put<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.070> spring<00:03:34.340> back<00:03:34.370> in<00:03:34.730> how<00:03:34.880> about

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070
