00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
hieroglyphics all over the place and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.209 
hieroglyphics all over the place and
it's<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.030> absolutely<00:01:54.659> nuts<00:01:54.720> right<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.470> so

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
it's just absolutely nuts right and so

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.969 
it's just absolutely nuts right and so
this<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.450> mean<00:01:57.630> this<00:01:57.689> map<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> has<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> couple<00:01:58.799> of

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this I mean this map it has a couple of

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.980 
this I mean this map it has a couple of
cool<00:01:59.100> things<00:01:59.310> one<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> cool<00:02:00.060> things<00:02:00.090> is

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
cool things one of the cool things is

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
cool things one of the cool things is
the<00:02:01.530> field<00:02:01.740> order<00:02:01.950> as<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> guys<00:02:02.460> know<00:02:02.490> there's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the field order as you guys know there's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.910 
the field order as you guys know there's
a<00:02:02.939> special<00:02:03.180> field<00:02:03.540> order<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.409> think<00:02:04.829> it's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
a special field order on I think it's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.740 
a special field order on I think it's
every<00:02:05.219> DLC<00:02:05.700> map<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.119> then<00:02:06.210> most<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.689> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
every DLC map and then most of the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.389 
every DLC map and then most of the
regular<00:02:07.229> maps<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.590> come<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> game<00:02:08.160> I

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
regular maps that come with the game I

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.699 
regular maps that come with the game I
don't<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> gameplay<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.560> it's

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
don't have the gameplay of it but it's

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.690 
don't have the gameplay of it but it's
just<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.310> easy<00:02:11.459> thing<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.940> describe

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
just a really easy thing to describe

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.210 
just a really easy thing to describe
the<00:02:13.030> field<00:02:13.330> order<00:02:13.540> is<00:02:13.810> called<00:02:14.230> blessing<00:02:15.010> of

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the field order is called blessing of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.619 
the field order is called blessing of
Anubis<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.970> there's<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.150> special<00:02:16.360> care

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.900 
single perk in the game at one time and
I<00:02:22.150> believe<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.140> kind<00:02:23.890> of<00:02:23.920> really<00:02:24.220> figure<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.670> out

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
I believe I kind of really figure it out

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.460 
I believe I kind of really figure it out
perfectly<00:02:25.629> while<00:02:25.900> we<00:02:26.019> were<00:02:26.110> there<00:02:26.170> but<00:02:26.440> i

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
perfectly while we were there but i

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.250 
perfectly while we were there but i
believe<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.980> for<00:02:27.190> free<00:02:27.430> live<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.269> you<00:02:28.870> get<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
believe it's for free live so you get it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.420 
believe it's for free live so you get it
and<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.530> have<00:02:29.650> every<00:02:29.830> single<00:02:29.980> park<00:02:30.280> and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
and then you have every single park and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.860 
and then you have every single park and
it's<00:02:30.519> not<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.730> oh<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:30.940> died<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.630> then<00:02:31.720> it's

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
it's not like oh I died and then it's

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.660 
it's not like oh I died and then it's
that's<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.410> that's<00:02:32.590> all<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.830> god<00:02:33.069> I<00:02:33.099> don't<00:02:33.340> get

anything<00:02:33.849> else<00:02:34.000> um<00:02:34.870> that's<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.590> thought<00:02:35.830> that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
anything else um that's I thought that

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.199 
anything else um that's I thought that
was<00:02:36.040> pretty<00:02:36.220> cool<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.580> thought<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.030> was<00:02:37.150> just

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
was pretty cool I thought that was just

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.000 
was pretty cool I thought that was just
really<00:02:37.720> interesting<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.290> they<00:02:38.380> do<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
really interesting that they do that and

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.770 
really interesting that they do that and
I<00:02:39.069> think<00:02:39.099> tmartn<00:02:39.849> was<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.239> of<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.390> guys<00:02:40.540> that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
I think tmartn was one of the guys that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.479 
I think tmartn was one of the guys that
got<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.380> he<00:02:41.500> said<00:02:41.680> he<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:41.860> felt<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.430> a

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
got it and he said he just felt like a

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.330 
got it and he said he just felt like a
freaking<00:02:43.379> unstoppable<00:02:44.379> beast<00:02:44.680> which<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.130> can

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
freaking unstoppable beast which I can

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.860

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.560 
really like different things like that
when<00:04:45.620> they<00:04:45.710> do<00:04:45.770> that<00:04:45.950> it's<00:04:46.310> definitely<00:04:46.760> up<00:04:47.300> my

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
when they do that it's definitely up my

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.210 
when they do that it's definitely up my
alley<00:04:47.840> i<00:04:48.050> think<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.530> just<00:04:48.740> adds<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.190> little

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
alley i think that just adds a little

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.710 
alley i think that just adds a little
bit<00:04:49.460> of<00:04:49.550> something<00:04:49.730> to<00:04:49.970> do<00:04:50.300> while<00:04:50.570> you're

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
bit of something to do while you're

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.680 
bit of something to do while you're
playing<00:04:50.870> on<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.440> mad<00:04:51.590> pharaoh<00:04:51.830> so<00:04:52.540> anyways<00:04:53.540> I
