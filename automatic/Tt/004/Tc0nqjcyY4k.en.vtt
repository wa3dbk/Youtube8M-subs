00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
from a local farmer and when it comes to

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.980 
from a local farmer and when it comes to
cooking<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:28.110> nice<00:00:28.619> quality<00:00:29.279> steak<00:00:29.610> what<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> like

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
cooking a nice quality steak what I like

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.920 
cooking a nice quality steak what I like
to<00:00:31.200> do<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.250> take<00:00:32.490> some<00:00:32.520> kosher<00:00:33.450> salt<00:00:33.780> and

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to do is just take some kosher salt and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.130 
to do is just take some kosher salt and
I<00:00:33.990> like<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:34.650> salted<00:00:35.310> at<00:00:35.940> least<00:00:36.420> 45

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
I like to get these salted at least 45

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.910 
I like to get these salted at least 45
minutes<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.860> an<00:00:38.010> hour<00:00:38.190> beforehand<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.920> what

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
minutes to an hour beforehand and what

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.290 
minutes to an hour beforehand and what
salting<00:00:41.700> does<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.829> it<00:00:43.829> essentially<00:00:44.340> pulls

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
salting does is it essentially pulls

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.650 
salting does is it essentially pulls
moisture<00:00:46.079> from<00:00:46.740> inside<00:00:47.130> of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> steak<00:00:47.790> but

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
moisture from inside of the steak but

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.870 
moisture from inside of the steak but
then<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:48.930> salt<00:00:49.320> melts<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.220> top<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.790> the

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
then the salt melts on top of the

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.690 
then the salt melts on top of the
surface<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.720> then<00:00:52.560> that<00:00:52.830> gets<00:00:53.130> reabsorbed

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
surface and then that gets reabsorbed

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.820 
surface and then that gets reabsorbed
back<00:00:54.360> into<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.810> meat<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.230> essentially<00:00:55.680> what

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
back into the meat so essentially what

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.370 
back into the meat so essentially what
we're<00:00:55.980> doing<00:00:56.220> here<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.700> kind<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:58.380 
we're doing here is kind of like a you

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.350 
we're doing here is kind of like a you

search and you'll see various methods
some<00:01:07.590> people<00:01:07.890> salt<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.640> before<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.150> cook

better<00:01:23.520> after<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.060> reabsorbed<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
better after it's reabsorbed all that

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.800 
better after it's reabsorbed all that
salt<00:01:26.190> into<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.610> meat<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.420> we're<00:01:27.540> gonna<00:01:27.630> go

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
salt into the meat so we're gonna go

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
salt into the meat so we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.380> let<00:01:28.620> these<00:01:28.830> sit<00:01:29.190> for<00:01:29.220> about

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.510 
an hour maybe an hour and a half and
then<00:01:32.940> we'll<00:01:33.090> pick<00:01:33.300> back<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:34.280> all<00:01:35.280> right<00:01:35.340> guys

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I'm gonna walk you through my setup for

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.469 
I'm gonna walk you through my setup for
this<00:01:37.500> reverse<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.550> I've<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.670> got<00:01:39.450> my

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
this reverse here so I've just got my

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.690 
this reverse here so I've just got my
little<00:01:39.720> lighter<00:01:39.990> cubes<00:01:40.409> started<00:01:40.920> we're<00:01:41.610> gonna

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
little lighter cubes started we're gonna

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.210 
little lighter cubes started we're gonna
get<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> fire<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.900> so<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> first

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
get the fire going here so the first

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.210 
get the fire going here so the first
step<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.880> reverse<00:01:45.479> sear<00:01:45.870> is<00:01:46.220> cooking

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
step of this reverse sear is cooking

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.300 
step of this reverse sear is cooking
over<00:01:47.580> indirect<00:01:48.270> heat<00:01:48.560> until<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> internal

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
over indirect heat until the internal

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.100 
over indirect heat until the internal
temperature<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.000> steaks<00:01:51.299> gets<00:01:51.659> up<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.990> about

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
temperature the steaks gets up to about

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.050 
temperature the steaks gets up to about
95<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:54.090> 100<00:01:54.570> degrees<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> when<00:01:56.790> we<00:01:56.880> go<00:01:57.000> ahead

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
95 to 100 degrees so when we go ahead

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.420 
95 to 100 degrees so when we go ahead

man I'm so good guys so definitely check
out<00:07:37.460> this<00:07:37.610> method<00:07:37.849> and<00:07:39.430> again<00:07:40.430> you<00:07:41.150> know<00:07:41.270> this

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:41.509 
out this method and again you know this

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:43.209 
out this method and again you know this
is<00:07:41.629> a<00:07:41.659> little<00:07:41.840> bit<00:07:41.930> more<00:07:42.110> advanced<00:07:42.469> method<00:07:43.009> but

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:43.219 
is a little bit more advanced method but

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:44.980 
is a little bit more advanced method but
just<00:07:43.400> try<00:07:43.580> it<00:07:43.639> a<00:07:43.729> couple<00:07:43.940> times<00:07:44.240> and<00:07:44.629> then<00:07:44.719> this

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:44.990 
just try it a couple times and then this

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:47.200 
just try it a couple times and then this
will<00:07:45.139> probably<00:07:45.409> become<00:07:45.530> your<00:07:45.919> go-to<00:07:46.210> method
