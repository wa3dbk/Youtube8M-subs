00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.590 
quadrant right so when you go to school
in<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.160> academic<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.910> professional<00:02:24.000> go<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
in this academic and professional go to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.880 
in this academic and professional go to
school<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.140> my<00:02:25.200> mother<00:02:25.410> want<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> maybe<00:02:25.740> a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
school and my mother want to maybe a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.340 
school and my mother want to maybe a
doctor<00:02:26.400> if<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.970> had<00:02:27.150> following<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.840> footsteps

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
doctor if I had following that footsteps

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.770 
doctor if I had following that footsteps
I<00:02:28.560> be<00:02:28.800> paying<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.190> highest<00:02:29.430> tax<00:02:29.880> possible<00:02:30.570> and

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
I be paying the highest tax possible and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.480 
I be paying the highest tax possible and
they<00:02:31.200> make<00:02:31.410> them<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:31.800> make<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:31.980> lot<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.310> money

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
they make them they make a lot of money

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.190 
they make them they make a lot of money
but<00:02:32.850> they<00:02:33.000> pay<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.270> highest<00:02:33.540> percentage<00:02:33.840> of

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
but they pay the highest percentage of

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.200 
but they pay the highest percentage of
taxes<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:35.130> that's<00:02:35.310> why<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.580> this<00:02:35.760> relates<00:02:36.060> back

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
taxes so that's why it this relates back

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.630 
taxes so that's why it this relates back
to<00:02:36.270> go<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.020> school<00:02:37.320> that's<00:02:38.100> right<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.550> they

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
to go to school that's right and they

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.400 
to go to school that's right and they
actually<00:02:38.820> have<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.240> fewest<00:02:39.480> options<00:02:40.140> of

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
actually have the fewest options of

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.770 
actually have the fewest options of
reducing<00:02:41.370> their<00:02:41.490> taxes<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.330> tax<00:02:42.570> laws
