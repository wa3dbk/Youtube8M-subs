this<00:02:24.510> guy's<00:02:24.720> actually<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:26.010> about<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.370> right

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
this guy's actually just about the right

this guy's actually just about the right
size<00:02:26.730> uses<00:02:27.269> long<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:28.890> pushing<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.400> limit<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
size uses long just pushing the limit to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.899 
size uses long just pushing the limit to
be<00:02:29.819> able<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> do<00:02:30.239> that<00:02:31.129> so<00:02:32.129> this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.519> Easton

this just pays to be hunted and the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.780 
this just pays to be hunted and the
habitats<00:02:50.040> being<00:02:50.420> pretty<00:02:51.420> much<00:02:51.599> destroyed<00:02:52.470> a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
habitats being pretty much destroyed a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.569 
habitats being pretty much destroyed a
pro<00:02:53.790> station<00:02:54.269> stuff<00:02:54.569> but<00:02:55.379> in<00:02:55.530> this<00:02:56.160> part<00:02:56.489> of

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
pro station stuff but in this part of

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.740 
pro station stuff but in this part of
Indiana<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.209> process<00:02:57.480> actually

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
Indiana and this process actually

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.569 
Indiana and this process actually
they're<00:02:57.989> doing<00:02:58.170> pretty<00:02:58.349> good<00:02:58.620> when<00:02:59.549> a

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
they're doing pretty good when a

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.599 
they're doing pretty good when a
population<00:03:00.060> sustained<00:03:00.739> pretty<00:03:01.739> high<00:03:01.980> that's

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
population sustained pretty high that's

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:03.949 
population sustained pretty high that's
really<00:03:02.879> one<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.060> only<00:03:03.329> places<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.930> find

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
really one of only places you can find

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.330 
really one of only places you can find
them<00:03:04.609> but<00:03:06.079> you<00:03:07.079> can<00:03:07.230> see<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> stands<00:03:08.069> down

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
them but you can see the stands down

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.009 
them but you can see the stands down
here<00:03:08.489> like<00:03:08.670> these<00:03:08.819> Vichy<00:03:09.150> bands<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.780> go<00:03:09.810> over

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
here like these Vichy bands that go over

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.259 
here like these Vichy bands that go over
his<00:03:10.230> body<00:03:10.379> and<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:11.459> they<00:03:11.579> don't<00:03:11.909> connect

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
his body and it that they don't connect

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.000 
his body and it that they don't connect
by<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.450> head<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.379> see<00:03:13.530> they're<00:03:13.650> kind<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.890> like

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
by the head you see they're kind of like

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.460 
by the head you see they're kind of like
little<00:03:14.760> spots<00:03:15.090> right<00:03:15.329> here<00:03:15.390> they<00:03:16.109> connect

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
little spots right here they connect

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.569 
little spots right here they connect
when<00:03:16.709> they<00:03:16.799> connect<00:03:17.069> my<00:03:17.159> hair<00:03:17.310> but<00:03:17.400> there's

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
when they connect my hair but there's

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.089 
when they connect my hair but there's
always<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.879> little<00:03:18.030> spot<00:03:18.299> where<00:03:18.450> they<00:03:18.540> don't

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
always a little spot where they don't

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.610 
always a little spot where they don't
the<00:03:20.099> mississagua<00:03:20.579> has<00:03:20.970> spots<00:03:21.440> so<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> can

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
the mississagua has spots so you can

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.259 
the mississagua has spots so you can
pretty<00:03:22.739> much<00:03:22.829> tell<00:03:23.130> him<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.489> mississagua

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
pretty much tell him in a mississagua

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.800 
pretty much tell him in a mississagua

was<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.819> lot<00:03:30.060> bigger<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:31.290> one<00:03:31.560> thing<00:03:31.709> about<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
was a lot bigger but one thing about the

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.339 
was a lot bigger but one thing about the
Eastern<00:03:32.579> timber<00:03:32.849> rattler<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.329> tail<00:03:33.599> turns

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
Eastern timber rattler is the tail turns

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.650 
Eastern timber rattler is the tail turns
black<00:03:34.700> as<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.879> guy<00:03:36.060> doesn't<00:03:36.359> have<00:03:36.419> a<00:03:36.510> very

dark<00:03:36.870> black<00:03:37.049> tail<00:03:37.290> sometimes<00:03:37.709> would<00:03:37.829> be<00:03:37.919> just

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
dark black tail sometimes would be just

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.580 
dark black tail sometimes would be just
solid<00:03:38.519> black<00:03:38.639> up<00:03:39.030> today<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:40.440> more

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
Eastern you go the darker the rattle the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.460 
Eastern you go the darker the rattle the
whole<00:03:43.919> snake<00:03:44.099> gets<00:03:44.519> like<00:03:45.510> up<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.840> New<00:03:45.989> York<00:03:46.049> and

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
whole snake gets like up in New York and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.869 
whole snake gets like up in New York and
a<00:03:46.620> place<00:03:46.889> like<00:03:47.099> that<00:03:47.129> the<00:03:47.489> snakes<00:03:47.730> will

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
a place like that the snakes will

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.759 
a place like that the snakes will
actually<00:03:48.150> be<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.510> pretty<00:03:49.049> solid<00:03:49.379> black

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
actually be a pretty solid black

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.740 
actually be a pretty solid black
sometimes<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.669> you<00:03:50.879> did<00:03:51.090> actually<00:03:51.480> some

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
sometimes and you did actually some

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.379 
sometimes and you did actually some
found<00:03:51.989> around<00:03:52.139> here<00:03:52.379> have<00:03:52.859> a<00:03:52.889> black<00:03:53.190> too<00:03:53.430> but

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
found around here have a black too but

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.309 
found around here have a black too but
the<00:03:54.989> venomous<00:03:55.739> snake<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:57.109> so<00:03:58.109> they<00:03:58.199> don't

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
the venomous snake and so they don't

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.650 
the venomous snake and so they don't
restrict<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.919> play<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.129> this<00:03:59.310> bite<00:03:59.609> it<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.150> if

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
restrict the play to this bite it and if

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.420 
restrict the play to this bite it and if
they<00:04:00.810> inject<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.199> venom<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.680> then<00:04:02.040> actually

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
they inject the venom and then actually

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.400 
they inject the venom and then actually
tracked<00:04:02.699> the<00:04:02.879> scent<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.209> their<00:04:03.329> own<00:04:03.449> venom<00:04:03.750> so

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
tracked the scent of their own venom so

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.789 
tracked the scent of their own venom so
that<00:04:04.620> pray<00:04:04.859> that<00:04:05.220> they<00:04:05.340> bit<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.419> animal

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
that pray that they bit to the animal

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.170 
that pray that they bit to the animal
and<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:07.980> you'd<00:04:08.160> be<00:04:08.220> dead<00:04:08.430> by<00:04:08.459> time<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.910> get<00:04:09.060> that

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
and so you'd be dead by time to get that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.900 
and so you'd be dead by time to get that
most<00:04:09.329> time<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:09.660> it's<00:04:10.139> an<00:04:10.230> easy<00:04:10.410> meal<00:04:12.199> now

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
most time and it's an easy meal now

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.740 
most time and it's an easy meal now
