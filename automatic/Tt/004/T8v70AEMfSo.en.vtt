00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.360 
okay the first thing we're going to
create<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.419> texture<00:00:03.780> for<00:00:04.160> means<00:00:05.160> this

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
create a texture for means this

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.860 
create a texture for means this
holographic<00:00:05.790> projector<00:00:06.420> we're<00:00:06.569> going<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.779> go

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
holographic projector we're going to go

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.530 
holographic projector we're going to go
for<00:00:07.080> a<00:00:07.109> colored<00:00:07.830> polished<00:00:08.700> plastic<00:00:09.179> sort<00:00:09.420> of

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
for a colored polished plastic sort of

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.990 
for a colored polished plastic sort of
lock<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.559> little<00:00:11.160> bit<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.429> Apple<00:00:11.759> would<00:00:11.910> have

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
lock a little bit like Apple would have

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.060 
lock a little bit like Apple would have
done<00:00:12.210> five<00:00:12.509> years<00:00:12.750> ago<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.559> I'm<00:00:13.679> axis

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
done five years ago on the I'm axis

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.990 
done five years ago on the I'm axis
we're<00:00:14.250> gonna<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.580> kind<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.849> nice

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
we're gonna have that kind of nice

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.380 
we're gonna have that kind of nice
reflective<00:00:15.389> look<00:00:15.690> on<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> first<00:00:18.119> thing

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
reflective look on it so the first thing

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.970 
reflective look on it so the first thing
I'm<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> do<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.230> press<00:00:19.380> F<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.619> frame

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
I'm going to do is just press F to frame

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.670 
I'm going to do is just press F to frame
that<00:00:20.130> up<00:00:20.930> make<00:00:21.930> sure<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> middle<00:00:22.650> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that up make sure it's in the middle of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.340 
that up make sure it's in the middle of
my<00:00:22.830> view<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> open<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
my view and then I have to open the

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960 
my view and then I have to open the
hypershade<00:00:26.070> which<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.490> where<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.789> make<00:00:26.939> your

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
hypershade which is where you make your

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.700 
hypershade which is where you make your
materials<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.750> Maya<00:00:27.930> mmm

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
materials in Maya mmm

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.830 
materials in Maya mmm
so<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> do<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.789> I'm<00:00:30.060> gonna<00:00:30.210> click<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.480> window

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
I'm gonna go to save layouts and I'm

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.620 
I'm gonna go to save layouts and I'm
gonna<00:00:34.260> choose<00:00:34.590> hypershade<00:00:35.340> slash<00:00:35.940> persp

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
gonna choose hypershade slash persp

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.690 
gonna choose hypershade slash persp
which<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> view<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.340> use<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.610> this

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
which is the view I like to use for this

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
we're going to start by creating a new

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.670 
we're going to start by creating a new
texture<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:18.030> what<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> need<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:19.500> note

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
texture now what you need to make note

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.240 
texture now what you need to make note
of<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.520> these<00:01:20.610> three<00:01:20.820> here

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
of is that there are these three here

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.380 
of is that there are these three here
the<00:01:23.250> most<00:01:23.400> important<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.030> far<00:01:24.150> as<00:01:24.270> we're

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the most important as far as we're

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
the most important as far as we're
concerned<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.990> Lambert<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.430> your

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
concerned is Lambert one this is your

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.730 
concerned is Lambert one this is your
default<00:01:26.939> material<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:28.049> grey<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
default material that is this grey that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.990 
default material that is this grey that
everything<00:01:29.100> already<00:01:29.280> has<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.670> change

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
everything already has if you change

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.819 
everything already has if you change
that<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.329> delete<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.780> there'll<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.259> nothing<00:01:31.680> on

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that or delete it there'll be nothing on

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.429 
that or delete it there'll be nothing on
and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:32.909> try<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.360> any<00:01:33.689> preview

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
and then if you try and do any preview

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.899 
and then if you try and do any preview
renders<00:01:34.740> nothing<00:01:35.040> will<00:01:35.130> show<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.820> you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
renders nothing will show up so you

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.810 
renders nothing will show up so you
should<00:01:36.090> always<00:01:36.240> try<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.600> leave<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.020> alone

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
which is why we've used the Blin to this
