00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.799
 a small potato gratin 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.349
 traditional everyone like that 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.349
 but today as I had under the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.179
 hand leases portobello mushrooms and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.990
 then some sweet potatoes I got 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.930
 said ah ah here is a nice idea and that's 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.080
 what we make a potato gratin 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.779
 sweet mushrooms good for that's 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.320
 simple we need sweet potatoes 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.550
 finely sliced ​​mushrooms 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.430
 portobello a little cream of butter 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.190
 chopped garlic of nutmeg and a small 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.739
 little salt we will start with buttered 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.450
 our pie plate 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.410
 we will take a little bit of butter 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.670
 a brush then we'll go like that 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.550
 all the way round we'll show our haye a 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.640
 cellar everywhere everywhere and we're going 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.940
 to make a layer simply of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.549
 potatoes back here we wanted them but 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.530
 well one over the other but must 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.900
 not to make them overlap too much because 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.990
 that otherwise the liquid after will return 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.880
 no one wants but they have everywhere 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 here 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.200
 and now we take care of our 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.770
 mushrooms have melted a good 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 piece of butter and we will add our 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 mushrooms and they will well soak up 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.040
 butter we will roast them just one 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.829
 little may not be his mushrooms 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.840
 it takes a little bit of thyme so we 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:46.470
 will turn the mushrooms and we 'll 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.490
 does it sleep like that and a little bit of each 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.259
 side and now we are ready to 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.759
 transfer the mushrooms to the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.390
 potatoes we cover completely 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.969
 sweet potatoes with our champions 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.610
 it is already beautiful and then there we go it 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:10.709
 is a little bit of a little flower 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.290
 salt and we will cover another 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.370
 layer of sweet potatoes 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.969
 simply and there we will moan a little 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.780
 and we're going to add a little bit of 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.569
 nutmeg 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.030
 but go pampered enough generous because 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.370
 that it's just going to bring out the taste of 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.250
 sweet potatoes and now we 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.790
 put the crib we will pour our cream 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.420
 everywhere very gently so that the cream 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.409
 seeps between the vegetables 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:46.739
 you can add some mozzarella 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:48.420
 some parmesan a little gruyère a little 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.269
 cheddar or you can all 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.120
 just do not put cheese and 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.540
 let it cook like that we will cover 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.639
 with an aluminum foil 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.090
 we will put it in the oven and in ten 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.139
 minutes 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.139
 remove the paper 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.530
 when we want now it's 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.870
 simply cut off largely 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.340
 big parts 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.489
 look at me this is beautiful 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.799
 mushrooms and sweet potatoes and 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.099
 then a good appetite and see you next time 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.099
