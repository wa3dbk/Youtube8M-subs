00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
behind the Sun so she's gone from pretty

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.690

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it started journey towards Earth 10,000

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
it started journey towards Earth 10,000
years<00:01:20.490> ago<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.060> where<00:01:21.360> your<00:01:21.540> ban<00:01:21.780> like

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
years ago which is where your ban like

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990 
years ago which is where your ban like
all<00:01:22.680> right<00:01:22.830> here's<00:01:23.040> deal<00:01:23.340> how<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.790> they<00:01:23.880> know

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
all right here's deal how do they know

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.380 
all right here's deal how do they know
like<00:01:24.509> 10,000<00:01:25.409> years<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.340> only<00:01:26.640> took<00:01:26.880> ice<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
like 10,000 years it only took ice and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690 
like 10,000 years it only took ice and
basically<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.140> year<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.680> cross<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.400> over<00:01:29.670> our

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
basically one year to cross up over our

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
basically one year to cross up over our
entire<00:01:30.150> solar<00:01:30.479> system<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.229> think<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:31.950> only

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
entire solar system I think it's only

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.410 
entire solar system I think it's only
taking<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.460> two<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:32.790> three<00:01:32.850> months<00:01:33.030> I'm

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
taking like two or three months I'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.480 
taking like two or three months I'm
going<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.780> from<00:01:33.990> Jupiter<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.799> Mars<00:01:35.130> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
going to go from Jupiter to Mars and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.770 
going to go from Jupiter to Mars and
it's<00:01:35.670> only<00:01:35.880> taken<00:01:36.119> like<00:01:36.450> three<00:01:36.600> or<00:01:36.720> four

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it's only taken like three or four

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.679 
it's only taken like three or four
months<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.710> Mars<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> Sun<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.390> if

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
months to go from Mars to the Sun so if

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.140 
months to go from Mars to the Sun so if
it's<00:01:40.049> been<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.470> 10,000<00:01:41.189> year<00:01:41.369> journey<00:01:41.670> where

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
it's been on a 10,000 year journey where

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.420 
it's been on a 10,000 year journey where
the<00:01:42.329> hell<00:01:42.720> did<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.020> come<00:01:43.110> from<00:01:43.290> man<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.280> they

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the hell did it come from man like they

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.030 
the hell did it come from man like they
keep<00:01:44.610> saying<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.689> came<00:01:45.930> from<00:01:46.079> outside<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
keep saying it came from outside of the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.520 
keep saying it came from outside of the
Oort<00:01:47.189> cloud<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.420> thought<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.259> edge

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
Oort cloud well I thought the very edge

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.230 
Oort cloud well I thought the very edge
the<00:01:49.860> Oort<00:01:50.070> cloud<00:01:50.369> was<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.939> empty

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the Oort cloud was kind of empty

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.539 
the Oort cloud was kind of empty
sometimes<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.960> say<00:01:52.200> outer<00:01:52.560> space<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> crowded

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
sometimes I say outer space is crowded

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.039 
sometimes I say outer space is crowded
with<00:01:53.579> asteroids<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> space<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> breathe

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
with asteroids and space to breathe

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
with asteroids and space to breathe
sometimes<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.829> no<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.280> actually<00:01:56.430> bathrobe

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
sometimes like no it's actually bathrobe

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.940 
sometimes like no it's actually bathrobe
belt<00:01:57.270> last<00:01:57.750> runs<00:01:58.049> are<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.259> 10,000<00:01:58.799> miles

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
belt last runs are like 10,000 miles

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.770 
belt last runs are like 10,000 miles
apart<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.340> each<00:01:59.520> other<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.420> man

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
apart from each other so which is it man

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
apart from each other so which is it man
if<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.439> hopping<00:02:02.040> along<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> some<00:02:02.520> other

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
if you was hopping along and some other

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
year journey towards the Sun that is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.770 
year journey towards the Sun that is
important<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:09.000> an<00:02:09.179> article

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
important to know in like an article

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.330 
important to know in like an article
NASA<00:02:10.110> how<00:02:10.470> can<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.709> say<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:10.890> it's<00:02:11.129> spewing

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
NASA how can you say that it's spewing

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.010 
NASA how can you say that it's spewing
water<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.180> say<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.450> can't<00:02:12.750> wait<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
water and then say you can't wait to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.400 
water and then say you can't wait to
take

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
take

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.260 
take
look<00:02:13.500> at<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.860> because<00:02:14.460> then<00:02:14.820> you'll<00:02:14.970> see<00:02:15.150> what

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
look at it because then you'll see what

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.640 
look at it because then you'll see what
it's<00:02:15.300> made<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.660> that's<00:02:16.260> kind<00:02:16.590> of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
it's made of that's kind of

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.920 
it's made of that's kind of
contradictory<00:02:17.430> no<00:02:17.880> I'm<00:02:17.970> saying<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.810> know

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
contradictory no I'm saying I don't know

contradictory no I'm saying I don't know
if<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.050> guys<00:02:19.200> know<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:19.950> true<00:02:20.040> okay

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
if you guys know that but it's true okay

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.180 
if you guys know that but it's true okay
yeah<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.150> they're<00:02:21.690> putting<00:02:21.960> up<00:02:22.050> some<00:02:22.260> super

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
yeah and they're putting up some super

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.890 
yeah and they're putting up some super
space<00:02:23.460> balloon<00:02:23.880> that's<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.450> measure<00:02:24.630> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
space balloon that's going to measure it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.010 
space balloon that's going to measure it
in<00:02:25.020> infrared<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.460> ultraviolet<00:02:27.330> spectrum

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
in infrared and ultraviolet spectrum

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.900 
in infrared and ultraviolet spectrum
which<00:02:28.380> is<00:02:28.530> interesting<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.160> then<00:02:29.310> they<00:02:29.430> got

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
which is interesting and then they got

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270 
which is interesting and then they got
some<00:02:29.970> super<00:02:30.630> fast<00:02:30.900> reaction<00:02:31.530> project<00:02:32.040> where

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
some super fast reaction project where

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.410 
some super fast reaction project where
they're<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.610> measure<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.000> in<00:02:33.270> other

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
they're going to measure it in other

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690 
they're going to measure it in other
ways<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.010> see<00:02:35.190> with<00:02:35.340> all<00:02:35.550> this

to know this is pretty fascinating I
sand<00:05:11.370> gets<00:05:11.520> cooler<00:05:11.729> every<00:05:12.030> day<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.449> I'm

sand gets cooler every day and I'm

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:15.020 
sand gets cooler every day and I'm
wondering<00:05:12.840> how<00:05:13.110> dramatic<00:05:14.069> can<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.520> get<00:05:14.759> any

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
wondering how dramatic can you get any

wondering how dramatic can you get any
ice<00:05:15.389> and<00:05:15.719> by<00:05:15.810> banishing<00:05:16.289> sometimes<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.159> best

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
ice and by banishing sometimes the best

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.790 
ice and by banishing sometimes the best
way<00:05:17.610> to<00:05:18.150> grow<00:05:18.449> interest<00:05:19.080> is<00:05:19.259> to<00:05:19.620> just

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
way to grow interest is to just

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.559 
way to grow interest is to just
disappear<00:05:20.039> completely<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:21.000> memory<00:05:21.300> of<00:05:21.360> you

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
disappear completely the memory of you

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:23.749 
disappear completely the memory of you
grows<00:05:21.870> people<00:05:22.620> start<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.949> miss<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.610> then

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
grows people start to miss you and then

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:25.309 
grows people start to miss you and then
they<00:05:23.879> start<00:05:24.120> to<00:05:24.210> wonder<00:05:24.419> and<00:05:24.719> the<00:05:24.870> legend

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
they start to wonder and the legend

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.860 
they start to wonder and the legend
grows<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.860> such<00:05:26.069> as<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.430> way<00:05:26.550> Ison<00:05:27.120> goes<00:05:27.360> it's

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
grows and such as the way Ison goes it's

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.290 
grows and such as the way Ison goes it's
gone<00:05:28.080> hidden<00:05:28.620> relative<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.280> the<00:05:29.340> Sun<00:05:29.580> now<00:05:29.969> only
