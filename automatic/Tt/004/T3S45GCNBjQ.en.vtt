00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
plays games so that way it's like a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.750 
plays games so that way it's like a
keyboard<00:00:47.510> so<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:48.079> easier<00:00:48.500> access<00:00:49.010> that<00:00:49.340> way

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
keyboard so it's easier access that way

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.810 
keyboard so it's easier access that way
also<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.989> great<00:00:51.260> thing<00:00:51.289> is<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.430> stand

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
also a great thing is that the stand

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.319 
also a great thing is that the stand
also<00:00:53.270> becomes<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.960> handle<00:00:54.590> this<00:00:55.430> is<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.820> great

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
also becomes a handle this is a great

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.880 
also becomes a handle this is a great
feature<00:00:56.629> when<00:00:56.899> you're<00:00:56.989> looking<00:00:57.260> for<00:00:57.530> can't
