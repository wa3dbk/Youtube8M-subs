 The body of the manipulators is made of matte 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.710
 rough plastic but in general he 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.570

 the keys are a little tight 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.850
 to small weight and legs with low 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.009

 keys and general just tickrate this already 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.860
 looks like 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.599
 overkill in general raiser craig is quite good 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.489
 gaming mouse for those who experience
