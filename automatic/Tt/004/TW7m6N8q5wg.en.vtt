00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.150
 well then let's make some ham croquettes that can be perfectly 

00:00:12.149 --> 00:00:14.729
 adequate because the procedure is the same 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:16.939
 the ingredients that we need are 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.889
 ham in this case are ham chips 250 grams 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.929
 we need to support us together 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.880
 to make it kiss me, we'll need butter 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.019
 20 years ago 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.529
 a little out 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.100
 hilary tablecloth 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.970
 nutmeg 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.589
 milk and then to wrap the 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:38.860
 we would need 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 the breadcrumbs 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520
 Well let's start 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.430
 putting butter in a pan 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.090
 let's go to more 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.090
 sauté 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.470
 and for what comes with the girl 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 no study of a package with mime 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.370
 lijewski 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.810
 it is unknown 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 and now that it has caught a little bit of heat we already add traffic 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890
 we do not want it to simply stay that way 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 for type composers 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.170
 very well, if what we have done is to suffer a little onion 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 We left a little out of duty because the ham and 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.330
 either the by itself 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.280
 what we do not want is that in 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.530
 suggestions or allegations the pp proposals for them a ham 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.370
 could be added at the end 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.260
 but if they fry a little 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 picks up a very special very good taste 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
 sabag two or three laps and little more 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.350
 when we arrive, take a little loop in Washington now and add the inc 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.900
 no amount of sand more or less the same as we added butter 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.559
 the idea is essential for the croquettes who is responsible for cooking 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 the unhealthy 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.809
 count is that it has changed color 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.089
 it's time to add milk 

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.409
 if it can be natural even a little activity 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.659
 because they will earn much better 1 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.879
 the lesions 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.229
 now we are adding 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.269
 little by little 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.269
 there is no less intensity and teeth as would be desirable 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.769
 and if it's been a few years 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.559
 and I think you will not see how they are giving 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.989
 I was catching 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.749
 is taking body 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.779
 What is yours to make creamy has to be about 20 minutes 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.349
 stirring without stopping so they do not second 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.510
 and as the moon goes asking 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.349
 the descendants of exiles their safety 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.349
 the measure that is getting closer to those who want 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:28.049
 as I said you have to be about 20 minutes stirring non-stop 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.409
 for what 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.819
 to make them creamy and what gives the nutmeg souvenirs 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.139
 yes the one that thousands and natural 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.429
 much better way is a lot either why 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.149
 You take off right away 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:44.069
 but there is an exquisite taste 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.219
 then after 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:49.249
 have them this time stirring have to let them cool 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.719
 we are in a pastry bag 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:54.769
 i in 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.949
 min in the same plate of mine 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.639
 that's why I want 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.119
 that quite comfortable 

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.929
 it is put directly for the ally and what we will do is make strips 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.999
 - we live 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:11.719
 and it just took a few changes 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.979
 justicialista 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.259
 segi and 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.129
 and it will simply be 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:39.809
 give them the aggressor 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.809
 or the arch we want 

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:54.860
 that's not the way a scheme so they do not stick 

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.469
 iñaki we will spend 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.089
 to the game 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:05.050
 there are people who 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.050
 and even know how to be in temporality for good behavior 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.169
 that's at 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.169
 a little to the taste of each one 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.469
 to pass to the table flowing in abundant oil and that is 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.469
 environmentally 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.289
 as you see 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.719
 each one that was different 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.719
 nothing to do with those that sell but then it is very good 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.159
 well just keep turning and when you catch a little color of the lenses 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.199
 if it's just turning them over 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:51.620
 that also take on the other side she take them to an absorbent paper 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.110
 to choose excess oil and milk representations 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.809
 well, the protests 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:05.610
 everyone else - have ever tried them 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:06.639
 i 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.580
 as an appetizer as silver buddies a second 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.070
 you're always going to look good and diesel you do not think it's coming
