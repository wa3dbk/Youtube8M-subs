00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
chickens but I always do the same wing

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.869 
chickens but I always do the same wing
on<00:00:49.620> everybody<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.280> I'm<00:00:50.370> doing<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> batch<00:00:50.850> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
on everybody when I'm doing a batch of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
chickens so that I know which wing to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.639

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
put that back in there it's dripping so

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.410 
put that back in there it's dripping so
I<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.800> which<00:00:55.980> wean<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.250> check<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.670> takes<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
I know which wean to check for takes so

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.500 
I know which wean to check for takes so
in<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:58.350> weaker<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> think<00:00:59.640> two<00:00:59.760> weeks<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.239> will<00:01:00.359> be

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
in a weaker I think two weeks I will be

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.260 
in a weaker I think two weeks I will be
checking<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.460> scabs<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.789> make<00:01:02.940> sure<00:01:03.120> they

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
checking for scabs to make sure they

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.109 
checking for scabs to make sure they
have<00:01:03.420> two<00:01:03.570> little<00:01:03.719> scabs<00:01:04.110> where<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.320> poked<00:01:04.619> and

we<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.540> poke<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.530> right<00:01:07.710> through<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we just poke it right through and the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.719 
we just poke it right through and the
vaccine<00:01:12.119> itself<00:01:12.450> has<00:01:12.659> dyed<00:01:12.930> blue<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
