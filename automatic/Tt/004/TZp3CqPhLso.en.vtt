think this will really kick on now and a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.259 
think this will really kick on now and a
lot<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.160> people<00:03:17.250> start<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.760> watch<00:03:17.970> and<00:03:18.180> enjoy

lot of people start to watch and enjoy

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.940 
lot of people start to watch and enjoy
maybe<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.959> lot<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.140> kids<00:03:19.320> out<00:03:19.470> there<00:03:19.590> besides

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
maybe a lot of kids out there besides

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.560 
maybe a lot of kids out there besides
take<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.370> up<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.640> well<00:03:20.760> yeah<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> really<00:03:21.390> hope

take you up as well yeah I really hope
so<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.890> all<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.190> females

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
so and I think of all the females

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.310 
so and I think of all the females
playing<00:03:23.940> rugby<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.269> moment<00:03:24.600> over<00:03:24.840> half<00:03:25.019> in

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
playing rugby the moment over half in

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.670 
playing rugby the moment over half in
nearly<00:03:25.560> 8,000<00:03:26.160> Argentine<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:27.720> players<00:03:28.050> and

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
nearly 8,000 Argentine you players and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.780 
nearly 8,000 Argentine you players and
the<00:03:28.890> school<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.580> that's<00:03:29.700> really

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
the school and I think that's really

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.100 
the school and I think that's really
going<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.269> demonstrate<00:03:30.480> how<00:03:30.870> it's<00:03:31.050> healing

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
going to demonstrate how it's healing

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.720 
going to demonstrate how it's healing
continue<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> grow<00:03:31.830> in<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.070> future<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.550> I

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
continue to grow in the future and I

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.580 
continue to grow in the future and I
think<00:03:32.940> having<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.570> world<00:03:33.750> cup<00:03:33.870> hope<00:03:34.260> they<00:03:34.470> will

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
think having a world cup hope they will
