00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
recognize yes you know that's a basic

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.059 
recognize yes you know that's a basic
military<00:02:06.360> principle<00:02:07.170> if<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.350> can't<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.890> your

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
enemy you can never defeat him and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.580 
enemy you can never defeat him and
there's<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.129> lack<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.640> clarity<00:02:12.209> about<00:02:12.599> what<00:02:12.959> the

there's a lack of clarity about what the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.150 
there's a lack of clarity about what the
enemy<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.420> think<00:02:16.200> there's<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.890> same

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
enemy is and I think there's the same

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.610

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
have to understand these times yeah I

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.449 
have to understand these times yeah I
think<00:02:45.239> for<00:02:45.660> our<00:02:45.930> country<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.890> have<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.160> seen

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
think for our country to have not seen

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.360 
think for our country to have not seen
Isis<00:02:48.000> coming<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.959> not<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.860> threat

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
Isis coming and not to see the threat

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.100 
Isis coming and not to see the threat
that<00:02:50.610> we're<00:02:50.819> under<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.299> this<00:02:51.480> country<00:02:51.930> now

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
that we're under in this country now

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.990 
that we're under in this country now
because<00:02:53.099> we're<00:02:53.310> not<00:02:53.430> sealing<00:02:54.000> our<00:02:54.150> borders

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
because we're not sealing our borders

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.449 
because we're not sealing our borders
many<00:02:57.000> other<00:02:57.239> reasons<00:02:58.079> but<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:59.099> me<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.400> is

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
many other reasons but to me this is

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.680 
many other reasons but to me this is
either<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.120> greatest<00:03:01.190> naivety<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.459> think<00:03:03.450> ever

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
either the greatest naivety I think ever

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.720 
either the greatest naivety I think ever
in<00:03:04.019> history<00:03:04.549> of<00:03:05.549> leaders<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:07.920> treason<00:03:08.489> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
in history of leaders or it is treason I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.170 
in history of leaders or it is treason I
don't<00:03:09.299> see<00:03:09.450> anything<00:03:09.690> in<00:03:09.959> between<00:03:10.349> those<00:03:10.620> two

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
don't see anything in between those two

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:19.839 
don't see anything in between those two
we're<00:03:12.180> being<00:03:12.420> sold<00:03:12.810> out

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.300 

and<00:03:20.849> there's<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:21.870> mountain<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.440> evidence<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:23.160> go

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
and there's a mountain of evidence to go

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.940 
and there's a mountain of evidence to go
with<00:03:23.670> either<00:03:23.819> one<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.239> those<00:03:24.480> you<00:03:24.720> could<00:03:24.950> still

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
with either one of those you could still

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.800 
with either one of those you could still
pick<00:03:26.160> but<00:03:26.400> either<00:03:26.550> one<00:03:26.849> is<00:03:27.060> wrong<00:03:27.270> because<00:03:27.510> if

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
pick but either one is wrong because if

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.020 
pick but either one is wrong because if
you<00:03:27.959> take<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.560> position<00:03:29.130> of<00:03:29.580> responsibility
