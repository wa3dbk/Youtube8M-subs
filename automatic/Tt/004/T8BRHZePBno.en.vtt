00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.569 
one of your colleagues and so rightly
you<00:03:24.989> should<00:03:25.230> be<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.919> the<00:03:25.980> difference<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.430> with

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
you should be but the difference is with

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.150 
you should be but the difference is with
entertainment<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:28.440> star<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.919> show<00:03:28.950> is

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
entertainment the star of the show is

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.729 
entertainment the star of the show is
the<00:03:29.519> show<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:31.049> know<00:03:31.169> you're<00:03:31.410> basically

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
the show so you know you're basically

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.460 
the show so you know you're basically
closing<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> business<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:33.450> know<00:03:33.660> if<00:03:33.900> you

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
closing the business you know if you

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.339 
closing the business you know if you
fire<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.950> person<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.840> he's<00:03:36.840> not<00:03:37.019> easily

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
fire the person and he's not easily

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.770 
fire the person and he's not easily
replaced<00:03:37.940> so<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:38.970> think<00:03:39.180> what<00:03:39.510> should<00:03:39.690> have

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
replaced so I think what should have

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.659 
replaced so I think what should have
happened<00:03:39.810> was<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> big<00:03:40.650> apology<00:03:40.919> he<00:03:41.489> should

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
happened was a big apology he should

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.449 
happened was a big apology he should
have<00:03:41.790> had<00:03:41.879> to<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.540> know<00:03:43.099> done<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.190> usual

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
have had to you know done the usual

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.729 
have had to you know done the usual
stuff<00:03:44.699> paid<00:03:45.329> money<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.750> charity<00:03:46.260> or<00:03:46.290> donate

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
stuff paid money to charity or donate

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.589 
stuff paid money to charity or donate
his<00:03:46.859> salary<00:03:47.489> or<00:03:47.790> whatever<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.449> should

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
his salary or whatever it is it should

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.909 
his salary or whatever it is it should
have<00:03:48.690> been<00:03:48.750> some<00:03:49.049> other<00:03:49.079> penalty<00:03:49.709> that's

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
have been some other penalty that's

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.530 
have been some other penalty that's
would<00:03:50.669> have<00:03:50.760> been<00:03:50.849> a<00:03:50.940> better<00:03:51.030> business

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
would have been a better business

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.479 
would have been a better business
situation<00:03:52.260> I'm<00:03:52.379> not<00:03:52.500> justifying<00:03:52.799> what<00:03:53.129> he<00:03:53.280> did

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
situation I'm not justifying what he did

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.050 
situation I'm not justifying what he did
anyway<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:55.010> anyway<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.190> my<00:03:56.340> two<00:03:56.459> cents<00:03:56.910> on

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
anyway but anyway that's my two cents on

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.050 
anyway but anyway that's my two cents on
that<00:03:57.269> instead<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.680> new<00:03:58.799> BBC<00:03:59.190> will<00:03:59.669> continue

that instead the new BBC will continue

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.089 
that instead the new BBC will continue
