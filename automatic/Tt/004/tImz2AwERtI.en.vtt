engineering student at Nevada Southern
University<00:00:07.670> after<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.970> finished<00:00:09.330> mechanical

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
University after I finished mechanical

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.730 
University after I finished mechanical
drawing<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:11.150> designed<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.360> turbojet<00:00:12.750> engine<00:00:13.500> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
drawing I designed a turbojet engine and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740 
drawing I designed a turbojet engine and
I<00:00:13.950> actually<00:00:14.130> built<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.940> that's<00:00:15.480> what<00:00:15.660> we're

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
I actually built it that's what we're

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.150 
I actually built it that's what we're
going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> go<00:00:16.080> over<00:00:16.109> here<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> can<00:00:16.770> see<00:00:16.980> here's

going to go over here you can see here's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
going to go over here you can see here's
some<00:00:17.220> 45<00:00:17.940> year<00:00:18.180> old<00:00:18.330> plans<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:19.020> should<00:00:19.320> be<00:00:19.470> in

some 45 year old plans that should be in
plastic<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.400> they<00:00:20.910> still<00:00:21.210> work<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.740> named

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
plastic but they still work and I named

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.950 
plastic but they still work and I named
the<00:00:23.130> engine<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> rebel<00:00:24.000> after<00:00:24.449> our<00:00:24.600> team<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the engine the rebel after our team I

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.650 
the engine the rebel after our team I
was<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.590> track<00:00:25.769> team<00:00:25.830> there<00:00:26.449> anyway<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
was on the track team there anyway this

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.839 
was on the track team there anyway this
engine<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.170> unique<00:00:28.560> because<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.890> put<00:00:29.189> doing<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
engine is unique because I put doing a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.749 
engine is unique because I put doing a
philosophy<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.679> take<00:00:31.920> things<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
philosophy that you can take things and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.490 
philosophy that you can take things and
make<00:00:33.390> them<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.719> other<00:00:33.930> things<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.440> other

don't nobody else does either but it

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.660 
don't nobody else does either but it
