00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
me I really like the theater mode it

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.300 
me I really like the theater mode it
really<00:02:15.440> brings<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.769> colors<00:02:16.099> looks

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
really brings out the colors looks

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.429 
really brings out the colors looks
really<00:02:16.519> good<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.540> most<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.959> time<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.170> leave

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 
really good but most of the time I leave

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.289 
really good but most of the time I leave
it<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.620> standard<00:02:19.159> because<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.790> brightness<00:02:20.180> is

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
it on standard because the brightness is

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.910 
it on standard because the brightness is
a<00:02:20.329> little<00:02:20.689> too<00:02:20.810> bright<00:02:21.019> for<00:02:21.049> me<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:21.499> the<00:02:21.890> other

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
a little too bright for me on the other

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.739 
a little too bright for me on the other
modes<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.579> I<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.909> turn<00:02:23.120> they<00:02:23.299> bind<00:02:23.510> us<00:02:23.599> down

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:23.749 
modes and I just turn they bind us down

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:24.190 
modes and I just turn they bind us down
to<00:02:23.900> below

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
to below

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.170 
to below
50<00:02:24.530> on<00:02:24.560> standard<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:25.730> usually<00:02:25.879> what<00:02:26.150> I

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
50 on standard and that's usually what I

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.089 
50 on standard and that's usually what I
have<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.450> set<00:02:26.629> at<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.989> also<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.860> fact<00:02:27.890> that

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
have it set at I also like the fact that

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.920 
have it set at I also like the fact that
you<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:28.400> tilt<00:02:28.670> this<00:02:28.790> monitor<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.599> can<00:02:29.629> tilt

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
can it's a fixed angle but this one does

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.930 
can it's a fixed angle but this one does
tilt<00:02:36.019> back<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.470> forth<00:02:36.680> very<00:02:36.980> easily<00:02:37.069> the

tilt back and forth very easily the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.850 
tilt back and forth very easily the
stand<00:02:38.239> for<00:02:38.390> this<00:02:38.480> monitor<00:02:38.900> could<00:02:39.440> be<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.650> little

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
stand for this monitor could be a little

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.100 
stand for this monitor could be a little
bit<00:02:39.950> better<00:02:40.129> it's<00:02:41.000> kind<00:02:41.269> of<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.420> small<00:02:41.750> stand

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
bit better it's kind of a small stand

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.770 
bit better it's kind of a small stand
and<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.709> can<00:02:42.890> be<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> bit<00:02:43.430> wobbly<00:02:43.730> if<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.660> on

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
and it can be a bit wobbly if you are on

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.839 
and it can be a bit wobbly if you are on
an<00:02:44.959> uneven<00:02:45.140> service<00:02:45.769> or<00:02:45.980> if<00:02:46.160> you<00:02:46.250> tend<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.610> hit

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
an uneven service or if you tend to hit

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.180 
an uneven service or if you tend to hit
the<00:02:46.970> desk<00:02:47.180> frequently<00:02:48.140> but<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.800> not<00:02:49.010> that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the desk frequently but it's not that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.589 
the desk frequently but it's not that
big<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.519> deal<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.000> actually<00:02:50.180> like<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:50.599 
big of a deal and I actually like the

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.809 
big of a deal and I actually like the
smaller<00:02:51.049> stand<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:52.010> doesn't<00:02:52.340> take<00:02:52.459> up<00:02:52.610> very

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
smaller stand it doesn't take up very

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.729 
smaller stand it doesn't take up very
much<00:02:53.060> room<00:02:53.239> at<00:02:53.360> all<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.019> like<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.470> aspect

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
much room at all so I like that aspect

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.680 
much room at all so I like that aspect
of<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.129> the<00:02:55.610> stand<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.209> bezel<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.630> the
