 fifth generation then we take it out to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.060
 your house and we have to have certain 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.690
 protectors that we should remove but with 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.690
 very careful 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.950
 then let's see 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:48.190
 well then they take all the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.190
 this one and we're going to take it out 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.780
 these 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.770
 and good 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.770
 and this thing too 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.700
 and in the front we will see 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.489
 we have and above the lock button 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.489
 in the back they want the camera and 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.769
 the flash for the cameras and below watching 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.769
 a little circle that is 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.400
 and now in the lower part with stretches to 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.600
 connect and load our ipod or we have 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.340
 the help and the entrance for the 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.140
 hearing aids in the part next to here 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.210
 are the volume the volume go down and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.210
 go up and that would be all 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:39.000
 now we continue with the load is here 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.470
 came our tree but let's see 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.130
 this 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.920
 and we have our hearing aids and we have 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.250
 our cable and this little piece of paper that says 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.250
 Hello 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.550
 but good this but good then 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.080
 It only has our cable 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.410
 charger that goes to the wall they have to 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:09.069
 buy separately and this little blue thing 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.659
 right now I'll tell you what also 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.310
 since we also have our 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.560
 hearing aids the truth listens very well and 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.470
 they are quite common although it may not seem so 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.250
 but and that would be all 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:25.220
 this good when you have to press the 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.160
 occasion to climb 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.830
 and we have to put this in saying that 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.830
 if you do not like to put the strap 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.379
 that's not going to help 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.379
 your 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.790
 they do not have to crush any and they 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.720
 tired of these 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.720
 then they do not fall 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.900
 then now let's continue let's go to 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.900
 to learn 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.390
 it's already how can you see this is the 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.550
 screen the truth is that it looks really good 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.550
 it looks much better than 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.480
 because it has very good approximations 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.170
 and that's good 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.170
 it would be like 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:25.100
 in the next video 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:28.240
 we are light and I like it in
