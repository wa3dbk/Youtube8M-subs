that's right we have some animation

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.570 
that's right we have some animation
templates<00:00:09.510> or<00:00:09.630> presets<00:00:10.530> already<00:00:11.099> ready<00:00:11.370> for

here and notice that it created an

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.539 
here and notice that it created an
animation<00:01:11.850> path<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.810> me<00:01:12.990> now<00:01:13.650> i<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:14.130> continue

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
animation path for me now i can continue

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.780 
animation path for me now i can continue
animating<00:01:15.270> i<00:01:15.390> can<00:01:15.570> say<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.140> at<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.070> three

second mark I want it to be up here so

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.340 
second mark I want it to be up here so
it<00:01:22.439> basically<00:01:22.700> came<00:01:23.700> down<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.299> bounced<00:01:24.840> now

characteristics<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.610> object<00:01:44.970> we're

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
characteristics of the object we're

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.600 
characteristics of the object we're
animating<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.200> i<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.470> say<00:01:46.649> for<00:01:46.680> example<00:01:47.040> i

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
animating so i can say for example i

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.120 
animating so i can say for example i
want<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.060> change<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> color<00:01:48.960> that's<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:50.100> i

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
want to change the color that's right i

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.609 
want to change the color that's right i
can<00:01:50.280> animate<00:01:50.939> other<00:01:51.180> properties<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.409> fly

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
can animate other properties on the fly

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
can animate other properties on the fly
besides<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.610> movement<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.840> we'll<00:01:55.020> pick

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
besides you just movement so we'll pick

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.899 
besides you just movement so we'll pick
a<00:01:55.200> different<00:01:55.439> color<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.520> we'll<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
a different color and then we'll go to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.480 
a different color and then we'll go to
the<00:01:57.000> ending<00:01:57.479> point<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.960> pick<00:01:58.560> yet<00:01:58.920> another

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the ending point and pick yet another

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.090 
the ending point and pick yet another
different<00:01:59.969> color<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.619> example

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
different color so we can go for example

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.300 
different color so we can go for example
let's<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.430> for<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> bright<00:02:03.270> red<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.780> time

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
let's go for a bright red this time

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.160 
let's go for a bright red this time
there<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.030> now<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.479> preview<00:02:06.960> that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
there we go so now if we preview that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.550 
there we go so now if we preview that
one

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560

it's<00:02:09.340> not<00:02:09.610> only<00:02:09.940> moving<00:02:10.239> but<00:02:10.989> it's<00:02:11.140> changing

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it's not only moving but it's changing

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.820 
it's not only moving but it's changing
colors<00:02:12.220> as<00:02:12.459> it<00:02:12.910> moves<00:02:13.180> and<00:02:13.569> once<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.380> really

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
colors as it moves and once you really

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.040 
colors as it moves and once you really
just<00:02:15.069> get<00:02:15.580> y'all<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.390> start<00:02:16.599> thinking

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
just get y'all you just start thinking

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.860 
just get y'all you just start thinking
about<00:02:17.170> what<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.520> do<00:02:18.819> versus<00:02:19.390> what<00:02:19.420> you

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
about what you can do versus what you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.260 
about what you can do versus what you
can't<00:02:20.260> do<00:02:20.530> you'll<00:02:21.160> get<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> lot<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.640> animation

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
can't do you'll get a lot of animation

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.120 
can't do you'll get a lot of animation

better what I love for it to do is to go

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.170 
better what I love for it to do is to go
from<00:02:58.870> that<00:02:59.410> corner<00:02:59.799> over<00:03:00.099> to<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.790> corner<00:03:01.030> on

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
from that corner over to the corner on

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.270 
from that corner over to the corner on
the<00:03:01.360> right<00:03:01.390> but<00:03:02.319> I<00:03:02.349> don't<00:03:02.620> want<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.860> see<00:03:03.130> it

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
the right but I don't want to see it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.120 
the right but I don't want to see it
until<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.940> gets<00:03:04.330> to<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.720> right<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.709> let's<00:03:05.980> go

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
until it gets to the right so let's go

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.580 
until it gets to the right so let's go
ahead<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.580> we'll<00:03:07.060> turn<00:03:07.450> our<00:03:07.720> stop<00:03:07.989> watches<00:03:08.410> on

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
ahead and we'll turn our stop watches on

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.440 
ahead and we'll turn our stop watches on
and<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.400> first<00:03:09.670> thing<00:03:09.819> we'll<00:03:10.000> do<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.180> we'll

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
and the first thing we'll do is we'll

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.979 
and the first thing we'll do is we'll
turn<00:03:10.810> down<00:03:11.170> all<00:03:11.500> our<00:03:11.980> opacity<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.780> we'll<00:03:13.959> just

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
turn down all our opacity so we'll just

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.319 
turn down all our opacity so we'll just
lower<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.829> opacity<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.670> object<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.269> you

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
lower the opacity of that object so you

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.229 
lower the opacity of that object so you
can't<00:03:16.630> see<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:17.019> now<00:03:17.170> I'll<00:03:18.040> just<00:03:18.100> move<00:03:18.609> the<00:03:18.880> the

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
can't see it now I'll just move the the

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.720 
can't see it now I'll just move the the
current<00:03:19.600> time<00:03:19.780> marker<00:03:20.230> out<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:21.100> however<00:03:21.459> long

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
current time marker out to however long

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.610 
current time marker out to however long
I<00:03:21.910> want<00:03:21.940> that<00:03:22.329> to<00:03:22.480> take<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:22.959> again<00:03:23.200> let's<00:03:23.440> try

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
I want that to take so again let's try

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.410 
I want that to take so again let's try
two<00:03:23.680> seconds<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.430> seemed<00:03:24.609> to<00:03:24.640> work<00:03:24.760> ok<00:03:25.000> last

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
two seconds that seemed to work ok last

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.300 
two seconds that seemed to work ok last
time<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.959> by<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.010> time<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.640> gets<00:03:27.850> over<00:03:28.480> here<00:03:28.930> I

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
time and by the time it gets over here I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.490 
time and by the time it gets over here I
want<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.459> be<00:03:30.930> one<00:03:31.930> hundred<00:03:32.290> percent

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
want it to be one hundred percent

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.039 
want it to be one hundred percent
opacity<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:34.390> just<00:03:34.569> go<00:03:34.660> ahead<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:34.810> change

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
opacity so we just go ahead and change

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.199 
opacity so we just go ahead and change
our<00:03:35.260> opacity<00:03:35.530> back<00:03:35.859> up<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.549> the<00:03:36.579> full<00:03:36.880> amount

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
our opacity back up to the full amount

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.759 
our opacity back up to the full amount
so<00:03:37.959> now<00:03:38.109> if<00:03:38.230> we<00:03:38.319> preview<00:03:38.889> that<00:03:39.100> we'll<00:03:39.970> have<00:03:40.209> our

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
so now if we preview that we'll have our

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.910 
so now if we preview that we'll have our
animation<00:03:41.769> go<00:03:42.160> from<00:03:42.459> zero<00:03:42.819> to<00:03:42.910> 100<00:03:43.750> as<00:03:43.920> it

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
animation go from zero to 100 as it

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.140 
animation go from zero to 100 as it
moves<00:03:45.190> over<00:03:45.459> two<00:03:45.819> seconds<00:03:46.299> in<00:03:46.450> time<00:03:46.690> so

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
moves over two seconds in time so

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.590 
moves over two seconds in time so
animating<00:03:49.150> is<00:03:49.269> awesome<00:03:50.139> inside<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:51.269> Rome<00:03:52.269> we

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
animating is awesome inside of Rome we

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.240 
animating is awesome inside of Rome we
also<00:03:52.750> have<00:03:53.019> an<00:03:53.109> animation<00:03:53.440> selection<00:03:54.069> tool

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
also have an animation selection tool

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.240 
also have an animation selection tool
that<00:03:54.609> allows<00:03:54.850> you<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.030> go<00:03:55.209> in<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.650> more<00:03:56.650> freely

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
that allows you to go in and more freely

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.220 
that allows you to go in and more freely
control<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:58.060> animation<00:03:58.660> points<00:03:59.049> in<00:03:59.139> the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
control the animation points in the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.229 
control the animation points in the
paths<00:03:59.500> themselves<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.850> can<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.090> that

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
paths themselves so you can do that

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.470 
paths themselves so you can do that
directly<00:04:01.600> inside<00:04:02.350> Rome<00:04:03.190> with<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.970> animation

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
directly inside Rome with the animation

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.470 
directly inside Rome with the animation
selection<00:04:05.109> tool<00:04:05.730> it's<00:04:06.730> great<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.180> be<00:04:07.269> able<00:04:07.329> to

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
selection tool it's great to be able to

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.690 
selection tool it's great to be able to
do<00:04:07.600> this<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:08.019> preview<00:04:08.470> it<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.739> see<00:04:08.980> it<00:04:09.069> all<00:04:09.250> in

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
do this to preview it to see it all in

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.670 
do this to preview it to see it all in
the<00:04:09.970> environment<00:04:10.299> and<00:04:10.660> of<00:04:10.930> course<00:04:11.230> once

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
the environment and of course once

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.309 
the environment and of course once
you're<00:04:11.889> done<00:04:12.069> you<00:04:12.670> can<00:04:12.819> output<00:04:13.359> it<00:04:13.540> for<00:04:14.139> your

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
you're done you can output it for your

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.120 
you're done you can output it for your
website<00:04:14.470> as<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.090> flash<00:04:16.090> Swift<00:04:16.510> file<00:04:16.810> or<00:04:17.109> we<00:04:18.010> have

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
website as a flash Swift file or we have

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.039 
website as a flash Swift file or we have
other<00:04:18.370> animation<00:04:19.120> or<00:04:19.299> interactive

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
other animation or interactive

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.550 
other animation or interactive
properties<00:04:20.560> as<00:04:20.739> well

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
properties as well

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.650 
properties as well
so<00:04:21.799> that's<00:04:21.980> just<00:04:22.070> a<00:04:22.310> quick<00:04:22.340> look<00:04:22.760> at<00:04:23.000> animation

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
so that's just a quick look at animation

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.570 
so that's just a quick look at animation
inside<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.139> Rome<00:04:24.350> go<00:04:25.040> ahead<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.220> give<00:04:25.430> it<00:04:25.460> a

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
inside of Rome go ahead and give it a

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.790 
inside of Rome go ahead and give it a
try
