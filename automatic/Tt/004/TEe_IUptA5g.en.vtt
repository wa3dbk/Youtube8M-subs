because<00:01:57.719> your<00:01:57.930> AC<00:01:58.079> button<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.520> come

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because your AC button is going to come

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.160 
because your AC button is going to come
out<00:01:59.939> well<00:02:00.180> mine<00:02:00.360> does<00:02:00.570> anyway<00:02:00.869> I'll<00:02:00.990> know<00:02:01.110> if

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
out well mine does anyway I'll know if

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
out well mine does anyway I'll know if
yours<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:02.040> it'll<00:02:02.280> pop<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.850> take

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
yours is right it'll pop out you take

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
yours is right it'll pop out you take
that<00:02:03.240> out<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.689> just<00:02:03.930> throw<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.710> don't

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
that out and you just throw it you don't

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.539 
that out and you just throw it you don't
need<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.040> no<00:02:05.189> more

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
need it no more

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
need it no more
that's<00:02:06.060> one<00:02:06.299> one<00:02:06.420> winter<00:02:06.719> time<00:02:06.899> we<00:02:07.020> don't<00:02:07.140> need

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
that's one one winter time we don't need

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.740 
that's one one winter time we don't need
AC<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.450> wiggle<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.690> jiggle

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
AC so then you just wiggle and jiggle

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.410 
AC so then you just wiggle and jiggle
too<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.289> whole<00:02:10.739> thing<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.190> now

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
too this whole thing is that now

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.550 
too this whole thing is that now
another<00:02:12.420> important<00:02:12.870> thing

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
another important thing

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.750 
another important thing

this<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.209> very<00:02:24.390> stupid<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.230> Toyota<00:02:25.500> designed

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
this is very stupid but Toyota designed

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.059 
this is very stupid but Toyota designed
this<00:02:26.599> so<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.630> when<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.959> unplug<00:02:28.319> these<00:02:28.680> if

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
this so that when you unplug these if

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.150 
this so that when you unplug these if
you<00:02:29.430> do<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.940> plug<00:02:30.269> those<00:02:30.450> back<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:31.160> your

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
you do not plug those back in your

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.550 
you do not plug those back in your
lights<00:02:32.400> will<00:02:32.670> not<00:02:32.700> work<00:02:33.060> your<00:02:33.810> turn<00:02:34.080> signals

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
lights will not work your turn signals

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.199 
lights will not work your turn signals
will<00:02:34.860> not<00:02:35.069> work<00:02:35.280> your<00:02:35.550> brake<00:02:35.790> lights<00:02:36.000> will<00:02:36.180> not

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
will not work your brake lights will not

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.870 
will not work your brake lights will not
work<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.250> sometimes<00:02:38.250> none<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.819> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
work and sometimes none of the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.420 
work and sometimes none of the
instrumentation<00:02:39.480> will<00:02:39.810> work<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.769> if<00:02:41.099> you're

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
instrumentation will work so if you're

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.100 
instrumentation will work so if you're
like<00:02:41.640> me<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.180> you're<00:02:42.750> halfway<00:02:42.959> through

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
putting a new radio in your car you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.559 
putting a new radio in your car you
realize<00:02:44.910> that<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.090> don't<00:02:45.180> have<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.420> right

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569

realize that you don't have the right
brackets<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.380> leave<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.739> piece<00:02:46.980> off

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
brackets you just leave this piece off

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.460 
brackets you just leave this piece off
and<00:02:47.760> you're<00:02:48.510> going<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.870> up<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.110> street<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
and you're going to go up the street to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.960 
and you're going to go up the street to
the<00:02:49.500> parts<00:02:49.860> store<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.190> get<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.519> need<00:02:50.730> and

the parts store to get what you need and
you're<00:02:51.150> driving<00:02:51.360> there<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.080> realize<00:02:52.350> you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you're driving there and you realize you

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.420 
you're driving there and you realize you
have<00:02:52.680> no<00:02:52.709> nothing

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
have no nothing

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.330 
have no nothing
other<00:02:53.819> than<00:02:54.239> an<00:02:54.390> engine<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.840> transmission

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
other than an engine and transmission

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.490 
other than an engine and transmission
and<00:02:56.340> you're<00:02:57.269> trying<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.450> figure<00:02:57.660> out<00:02:57.690> why<00:02:58.260> all

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
and you're trying to figure out why all

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.680 
and you're trying to figure out why all
your<00:02:58.739> elliptical<00:02:59.310> isn't<00:02:59.549> working<00:03:00.060> it's

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
your elliptical isn't working it's

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.270 
your elliptical isn't working it's
because<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.590> whole<00:03:01.739> computer<00:03:02.160> and

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
because the whole computer and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.600 
because the whole computer and
everything

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
everything

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.430 
everything
runs<00:03:03.000> through<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.420> clock<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.019> hazards

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
runs through the clock and the hazards

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.710 
runs through the clock and the hazards
so<00:03:05.400> nothing<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.000> to<00:03:06.360> work<00:03:06.510> if

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
so nothing is going to work if

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.440 
so nothing is going to work if
you<00:03:07.230> don't<00:03:07.670> make<00:03:08.670> sure<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.060> plugged<00:03:09.299> back

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
you don't make sure that is plugged back

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.360 
you don't make sure that is plugged back
in<00:03:09.660> even<00:03:09.930> if<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.080> don't<00:03:10.230> not<00:03:10.890> going<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.220> run

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
in even if you don't not going to run

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.830 
in even if you don't not going to run
the<00:03:11.459> radio<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.819> need<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.150> make<00:03:12.269> sure<00:03:12.299> all<00:03:12.599> this

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the radio you need to make sure all this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.210 
the radio you need to make sure all this
should<00:03:13.080> just<00:03:13.110> plug<00:03:13.410> back<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:13.920> hold<00:03:14.099> on<00:03:14.190> a

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
should just plug back in so hold on a

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.490 
should just plug back in so hold on a
second<00:03:14.580> let's<00:03:14.730> let<00:03:14.849> y'all<00:03:15.000> down<00:03:15.319> so<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.470> I
