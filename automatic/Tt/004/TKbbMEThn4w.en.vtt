00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
he cuts it into fourths so he's got four

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.050 
he cuts it into fourths so he's got four
pieces<00:03:46.910> from<00:03:47.660> one<00:03:47.900> cold<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:49.190> places<00:03:49.670> them<00:03:49.820> I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
pieces from one cold and places them I

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.390 
pieces from one cold and places them I
think<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:50.540> way<00:03:50.750> does<00:03:51.250> yeah<00:03:52.250> okay<00:03:53.080> either<00:03:54.080> way

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
think this way does yeah okay either way

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.130 
think this way does yeah okay either way
yeah<00:03:55.400> I'm<00:03:55.490> pretty<00:03:55.670> sure<00:03:55.820> he<00:03:56.090> does<00:03:56.270> one<00:03:56.870> two

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
yeah I'm pretty sure he does one two

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.040 
yeah I'm pretty sure he does one two
three<00:03:57.170> four<00:03:57.610> I've<00:03:58.610> tried<00:03:58.820> that<00:03:59.090> works<00:03:59.600> perfect

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
three four I've tried that works perfect

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.960 
three four I've tried that works perfect
um<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:01.760> can<00:04:01.910> try<00:04:02.090> thirds<00:04:02.530> one<00:04:03.530> two<00:04:03.800> three<00:04:03.970> just

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
um you can try thirds one two three just

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.900 
um you can try thirds one two three just
whatever<00:04:05.150> works<00:04:05.510> play<00:04:05.990> around<00:04:06.170> with<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.410> and

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
whatever works play around with it and

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.260 
whatever works play around with it and
you'll<00:04:07.910> be<00:04:08.060> smoking<00:04:08.420> good<00:04:08.570> but<00:04:09.560> definitely

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
you'll be smoking good but definitely

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.930 
you'll be smoking good but definitely
well<00:04:11.270> you<00:04:11.450> can<00:04:11.720> use<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.680> hold<00:04:12.890> coals<00:04:13.190> and<00:04:13.460> stand

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
well you can use to hold coals and stand

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.750 
well you can use to hold coals and stand
them<00:04:14.090> up<00:04:14.180> Stonehenge<00:04:14.840> stall<00:04:15.520> across<00:04:16.520> from

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
them up Stonehenge stall across from

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.479 
them up Stonehenge stall across from
each<00:04:16.790> other<00:04:16.970> but<00:04:17.620> for<00:04:18.620> some<00:04:18.859> reason<00:04:19.220> it<00:04:19.460> just

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
each other but for some reason it just

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.820 
each other but for some reason it just
doesn't<00:04:20.000> seem<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.210> work<00:04:20.450> as<00:04:20.690> well<00:04:21.260> for<00:04:21.290> me<00:04:21.530> as

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
doesn't seem to work as well for me as

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.100 
doesn't seem to work as well for me as
the<00:04:22.580> halves<00:04:22.790> do<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:23.090> guess<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.510> just<00:04:23.540> still<00:04:23.840> puts

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
the halves do I guess it just still puts

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.830 
the halves do I guess it just still puts
off<00:04:24.230> too<00:04:24.380> much<00:04:24.500> heat<00:04:25.210> yeah<00:04:26.210> that's<00:04:26.570> what<00:04:26.720> you

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.650 
off too much heat yeah that's what you
want<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.050> do<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.320> that's<00:04:27.920> how<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.450> pack<00:04:29.450> a
