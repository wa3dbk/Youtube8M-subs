00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 we will talk about card seals 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.359
 if you own a car 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.639
 the front wheel drive for 4 or 5 years you 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.400
 have surely had to replace one of these 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.650
 joint work has consumed you know 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.900
 a half haven that is attached to him and to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.539
 cards as such the cardin is 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.119
 composed of a rocket ie 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.480
 the place where we came from seemed the wheel 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.660
 a case that inside and provided with 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.380
 small countries which transmits at the end of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.410
 account the movement of the engine to the loire 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.270
 is usually because dancer at the level 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.640
 the case of the cage is what is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.450
 product is that when you ride to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 straight line 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.110
 the berries always share the same place 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 and in the same places 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.239
 when you turn the warrior thief 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.129
 b we have strengthened a place that is used 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.160
 not worn so we produce a noise 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.370
 like one more you want fast and more 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.920
 the thief is turned over a noise will be 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.409
 quickly and strong as you have 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.369
 surely guessed the seal is located 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.710
 under the car 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.170
 he comes to join the transmission to 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.020
 the man a piece still very important 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 cartridges alain koffi 7 the euro of 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.939
 this piece is protected greece to 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.040
 inside it naturally avoids 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.830
 get rid of the dust of the road become 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.439
 infiltrate the greece that caused 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.960
 ray premature wear must join so 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.900
 if it is done it is absolutely necessary 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 replace it's things like that that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.290
 see an old inspect under the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.909
 car when performing your 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.920
 load Tuesday 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.020
 one thing to avoid is the colors of 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240
 fashion has raised the motor comes in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.460
 contact with the rubber of the cover 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.579
 dust that will occur is that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.100
 the oil literally inflates the 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.649
 rubber soften him and he'll get 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.159
 prematurely crack another thing to 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.340
 check 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.590
 it's the little radish hands of the neighborhood 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.109
 as such it is a sign before runner 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.569
 of this person for example should 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.840
 predict the goal sound and six 6 months of 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:09.539
 replace this case requires another 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.239
 problem we have is the little collar and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.160
 which retains the cartridge is often 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.120
 when he fell the crafts at the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.190
 place by a college in class and as 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.459
 this one and we should replace it with 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.500
 a special stainless steel 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.530
 designed that when tight guard 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.079
 always the same charge of that the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.239
 problem with the cases requires that it does not 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.400
 is diagnosing himself strong led three 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.049
 only inspect it so if your 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.660
 mechanic during an oil change 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.010
 for example tells you that your cache 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.019
 dust and slightly cracked to 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.109
 replace them in the medium term towards 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.609
 economy to get your free 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.530
 preventive maintenance guide 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.090
 write us to the automaton more to 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.630
 the address you find it at the end 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.560
 of the show
