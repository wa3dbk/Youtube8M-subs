you<00:00:36.540> guys<00:00:36.719> I'm<00:00:36.840> Dell<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.350> look<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.980> go

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
you guys I'm Dell it look like they go

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.299 
you guys I'm Dell it look like they go
around<00:00:38.219> 800<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.390> 716<00:00:40.079> after<00:00:40.440> tax<00:00:40.730> okay<00:00:41.750> so<00:00:43.309> I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
around 800 now 716 after tax okay so I

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.400 
around 800 now 716 after tax okay so I
guess<00:00:44.760> I'll<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.030> ahead<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> open<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> just

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
guess I'll go ahead and open it and just

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
guess I'll go ahead and open it and just
go<00:00:46.559> over<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> performance<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.579> show<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
go over the performance or to show to

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.660 
go over the performance or to show to
the<00:00:47.969> camera<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.800> Intel

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
the camera so you can see it's Intel

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
the camera so you can see it's Intel

one<00:00:56.129> terabyte<00:00:56.460> hard<00:00:56.610> drive<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:58.140> at

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
one terabyte hard drive I think it's at

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.250 
one terabyte hard drive I think it's at
5400<00:01:00.770> rpm<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> saves<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.670> lot<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.789> battery

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
5400 rpm but that saves a lot of battery

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.649 
5400 rpm but that saves a lot of battery
I<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:05.070> reading<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.850> last<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.150> 9

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
I was reading that this can last up to 9

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.660 
I was reading that this can last up to 9
hours<00:01:06.689> even<00:01:07.320> though<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.250> slow<00:01:08.490> but

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
hours even though that it is slow but

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
hours even though that it is slow but
that<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.119> equates<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.960> longer<00:01:10.409> battery<00:01:10.590> life

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
that that equates to longer battery life

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
that that equates to longer battery life
it<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> integrated<00:01:12.240> L<00:01:12.600> Intel<00:01:13.260> HD

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it has the integrated L Intel HD

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.890 
it has the integrated L Intel HD
graphics<00:01:13.740> which<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.729> heard<00:01:14.909> are<00:01:15.299> decent<00:01:15.689> but

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
graphics which I heard are decent but

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.880 
graphics which I heard are decent but
obviously<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.220> thing<00:01:17.490> compared<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.890> higher

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
obviously not a thing compared to higher

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.270 
obviously not a thing compared to higher

go with the pork a ultra but I thought

small as you can see that's cool I'm
just<00:03:24.660> like<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> huge<00:03:25.230> battery<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.430> it's

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
just like a huge battery and it's

actually pretty cool uh pretty good size
battery<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.989> me<00:03:31.079> it's<00:03:31.560> like<00:03:31.859> not<00:03:32.130> too<00:03:32.310> big<00:03:33.200> and

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
battery for me it's like not too big and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.310 
battery for me it's like not too big and
that's<00:03:34.470> part<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.250> why<00:03:35.370> I<00:03:35.400> got<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:35.640> laptop

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.650 

and<00:03:40.320> today<00:03:41.190> actually<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:41.910> March<00:03:42.420> 2nd<00:03:43.040> 2015

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
and today actually is March 2nd 2015

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.870 
and today actually is March 2nd 2015
so<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.210> newer<00:03:49.370> newer<00:03:50.370> ones<00:03:50.700> that

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
so this is the newer newer ones that

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.730 
so this is the newer newer ones that
they've<00:03:51.060> been<00:03:51.380> produced<00:03:52.380> power<00:03:53.010> cord<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:54.740> HDMI

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
they've been produced power cord to HDMI

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.520 
they've been produced power cord to HDMI
an<00:03:56.100> HDMI<00:03:56.520> port<00:03:56.550> another<00:03:57.090> looks<00:03:57.570> like<00:03:57.720> USB<00:03:57.930> and

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
an HDMI port another looks like USB and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.430 
an HDMI port another looks like USB and
a<00:03:59.310> port<00:03:59.730> for<00:03:59.820> headphones<00:04:00.180> I'm<00:04:01.050> trying<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.350> see

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
a port for headphones I'm trying to see

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.390 
a port for headphones I'm trying to see
actually<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.860> do<00:04:01.920> not<00:04:02.190> see<00:04:02.520> a<00:04:04.280> ethernet<00:04:05.280> cord

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
actually I do not see a ethernet cord

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.310 
actually I do not see a ethernet cord
port<00:04:05.700> which<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:05.970> interesting<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:07.080> have<00:04:07.230> to

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
port which is interesting so you have to

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.290 
port which is interesting so you have to
get<00:04:07.440> out<00:04:07.530> separately<00:04:07.890> or<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.910> use<00:04:09.060> wireless

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
get out separately or just use wireless

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.870 
get out separately or just use wireless
I<00:04:10.010> wonder<00:04:11.010> if<00:04:11.070> they<00:04:11.160> did<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.340> because<00:04:11.520> it<00:04:11.700> was

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
I wonder if they did that because it was

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.550 
I wonder if they did that because it was
it<00:04:12.060> was<00:04:12.150> hard<00:04:12.360> because<00:04:12.510> it's<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:12.840> thin<00:04:13.080> it's

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
it was hard because it's so thin it's

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.580 
it was hard because it's so thin it's
actually<00:04:14.180> 0.78<00:04:15.180> no<00:04:15.510> point<00:04:16.260> seven<00:04:16.500> eight

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
actually 0.78 no point seven eight

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:24.010 
actually 0.78 no point seven eight
inches<00:04:17.150> ten<00:04:19.640> okay<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:21.500> was<00:04:22.500> okay<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.860> wrong<00:04:23.010> way

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
inches ten okay I was okay the wrong way

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.130 
inches ten okay I was okay the wrong way
okay<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:25.350> is<00:04:25.500> cool<00:04:25.710> as<00:04:26.700> you<00:04:26.940> can<00:04:27.060> see<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.600> the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
okay this is cool as you can see the the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.390 
okay this is cool as you can see the the
keypad<00:04:28.500> doesn't<00:04:29.430> have<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:30.000> extra<00:04:31.400> numerical

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
keypad doesn't have the extra numerical

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.780 
keypad doesn't have the extra numerical
keypad<00:04:32.640> right<00:04:32.940> here<00:04:33.180> but<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:35.310> feeling<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.700> if

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
keypad right here but just feeling it if

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.860 
keypad right here but just feeling it if
it<00:04:35.910> was<00:04:36.030> wave<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.330> it's<00:04:36.420> really<00:04:36.630> cold

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
it was wave it and it's really cold

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.850 
it was wave it and it's really cold
because<00:04:37.350> this<00:04:37.560> is<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:37.860> think<00:04:37.950> this<00:04:38.070> is<00:04:38.750> entirely

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
because this is I think this is entirely

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.370 
because this is I think this is entirely
aluminum<00:04:40.940> chassis<00:04:41.940> it<00:04:42.870> just<00:04:43.080> looks<00:04:43.290> really

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
aluminum chassis it just looks really

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.640 
aluminum chassis it just looks really
cool<00:04:43.680> it's<00:04:43.890> as<00:04:44.010> opposed<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:45.660> 5000<00:04:46.620> series

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
cool it's as opposed to the 5000 series

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.920 
cool it's as opposed to the 5000 series
I<00:04:47.250> think<00:04:48.000> now<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.150> don't<00:04:48.330> think<00:04:48.480> it's<00:04:48.600> complete

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
I think now I don't think it's complete

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.590 
I think now I don't think it's complete
all<00:04:49.110> aluminum<00:04:49.590> this<00:04:49.880> has<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.910> really<00:04:51.210> nice<00:04:51.390> feel

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
all aluminum this has a really nice feel

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.870 
all aluminum this has a really nice feel
