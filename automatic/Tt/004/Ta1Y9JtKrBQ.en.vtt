00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.269 
why he does so well with it in the
crucible<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.469> it's<00:01:38.799> because<00:01:39.069> of<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:39.279 
crucible and it's because of the

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:41.429 
crucible and it's because of the
explosive<00:01:39.819> rounds<00:01:40.209> so<00:01:40.929> I'm<00:01:41.020> assuming<00:01:41.139> this

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
explosive rounds so I'm assuming this

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.230 
explosive rounds so I'm assuming this
would<00:01:41.649> apply<00:01:41.859> to<00:01:41.950> all<00:01:42.549> hand<00:01:42.819> cannons<00:01:43.209> that

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
would apply to all hand cannons that

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.639 
would apply to all hand cannons that
have<00:01:43.389> explosive<00:01:43.869> rounds<00:01:44.139> we<00:01:44.229> could<00:01:44.350> see<00:01:44.469> here

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
have explosive rounds we could see here

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.989 
have explosive rounds we could see here
it<00:01:44.740> shoots<00:01:44.950> just<00:01:45.189> one<00:01:45.340> bullet<00:01:45.520> but<00:01:45.759> then<00:01:45.880> an

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999 
it shoots just one bullet but then an

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.269 
it shoots just one bullet but then an
explosive<00:01:46.509> round<00:01:46.899> okay<00:01:47.380> but<00:01:47.950> it's<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.159> little

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:48.279 
explosive round okay but it's a little

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:49.679 
explosive round okay but it's a little
different<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:48.670> pv<00:01:48.880> because<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.359> feels<00:01:49.539> like

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
different in pv because it feels like

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:50.999 
different in pv because it feels like
it's<00:01:49.869> shooting<00:01:50.170> two<00:01:50.409> rounds<00:01:50.859> because

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
it's shooting two rounds because

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.190 
it's shooting two rounds because
basically<00:01:51.759> splits<00:01:52.359> the<00:01:52.509> damage<00:01:52.869> I'm<00:01:53.049> gonna

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
basically splits the damage I'm gonna

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.959 
basically splits the damage I'm gonna
slow<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.409> clip<00:01:53.679> up<00:01:53.859> now<00:01:54.039> for<00:01:54.099> you<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.819> gonna

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
slow a clip up now for you it's gonna

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.089 
slow a clip up now for you it's gonna
split<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.389> damage<00:01:55.749> to<00:01:55.929> that<00:01:55.959> it'll<00:01:56.380> do<00:01:56.529> half

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
split the damage to that it'll do half

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.859 
split the damage to that it'll do half
and<00:01:57.249> half<00:01:57.310> yield<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:57.909> you'll<00:01:58.119> get<00:01:58.270> around<00:01:58.569> on

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
and half yield so you'll get around on

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.660 
and half yield so you'll get around on
the<00:01:59.469> person<00:01:59.829> but<00:02:00.009> then<00:02:00.130> you'll<00:02:00.219> also<00:02:00.369> get<00:02:00.609> a

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
the person but then you'll also get a

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.789 
the person but then you'll also get a
splash<00:02:01.179> around<00:02:01.389> right<00:02:01.689> next<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.079> him<00:02:02.200> and<00:02:02.349> I

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
splash around right next to him and I

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.169 
splash around right next to him and I
know<00:02:02.889> it's<00:02:03.039> kind<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.219> silly<00:02:03.399> for<00:02:03.670> me<00:02:03.700> using<00:02:03.939> it

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
know it's kind of silly for me using it

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.330 
know it's kind of silly for me using it
in<00:02:04.329> a<00:02:04.359> sky<00:02:04.779> shock<00:02:05.079> but<00:02:05.319> I<00:02:05.349> barely<00:02:05.889> played<00:02:06.189> this

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
in a sky shock but I barely played this

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.980 
in a sky shock but I barely played this
map<00:02:06.490> I<00:02:06.609> told<00:02:06.759> you<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:06.969> first<00:02:07.119> like<00:02:07.689> two<00:02:07.840> weeks

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
map I told you the first like two weeks

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.109 
map I told you the first like two weeks
dark<00:02:08.349> below<00:02:08.470> came<00:02:08.740> out<00:02:08.890> sky<00:02:09.490> shock<00:02:09.729> never<00:02:09.940> came

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
dark below came out sky shock never came

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.540 
dark below came out sky shock never came
up<00:02:10.270> for<00:02:10.420> me<00:02:10.450> once<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:11.410> apply<00:02:11.680> my<00:02:11.890> first

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
up for me once so I just apply my first

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.430 
up for me once so I just apply my first
light<00:02:12.760> moon<00:02:13.000> principle<00:02:13.599> which<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.930> stay<00:02:14.410> away

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
light moon principle which is stay away

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.140 
light moon principle which is stay away
from<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.950> outside<00:02:15.280> areas<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.700> try<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:15.910> work

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
from the outside areas and try to work

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.839 
from the outside areas and try to work
the<00:02:16.390> corridors<00:02:17.230> here<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.010> I've<00:02:18.730> been

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
the corridors here so and I've been

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.309 
the corridors here so and I've been
liking<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.209> map<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:19.599> far<00:02:19.840> definitely<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.260> lot

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
liking this map so far definitely a lot

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.990 
liking this map so far definitely a lot
of<00:02:20.439> snipers<00:02:20.769> but<00:02:20.950> again<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.370> is<00:02:21.519> a<00:02:21.549> type<00:02:21.760> of

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
of snipers but again this is a type of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.240 
of snipers but again this is a type of
game<00:02:22.090> in<00:02:22.330> my<00:02:22.780> humble<00:02:22.960> opinion<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:24.040> sniped

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
game in my humble opinion I get sniped

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.960 
game in my humble opinion I get sniped
if<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.580> like<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.240> night<00:02:25.390> crossmap<00:02:25.990> one<00:02:26.260> shot
