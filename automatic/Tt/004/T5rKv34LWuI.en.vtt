that you're being purposely kept out of

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.840 
that you're being purposely kept out of

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
of thing and I mean we went up the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.340 
of thing and I mean we went up the

sort of hid behind a pillar I seem to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.120 
sort of hid behind a pillar I seem to
remember<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.200> an<00:01:51.350> absurd<00:01:51.590> notion<00:01:52.010> that

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
remember but it is an absurd notion that

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.770 
remember but it is an absurd notion that
David<00:01:52.580> aim<00:01:52.670> as<00:01:52.790> he<00:01:52.880> close<00:01:53.030> we<00:01:53.150> got<00:01:53.240> a<00:01:53.270> chase<00:01:53.570> are
