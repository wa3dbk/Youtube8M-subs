00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.230

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.389
 veal orloff for 6 people he us 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.450
 you need a kilo of roast veal 150 g of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.880
 GruyÃ¨re in thin slices of 150 g 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.890

 karsenty liters of white wine that a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.000
 centilitres of fresh cream and then to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.699
 smoke soup of you salt powder 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.580
 and pepper 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 the principle of this recipe we will do 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.690
 incisions in the meat pretty much 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.140
 every inch to insert 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.140
 bacon and crew yesterday that promises 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 I will put each time a 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.620
 slices of Gruyere and one to two 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.620
 bacon slices 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.880
 we only have to tie 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.790
 reconstitute our little roast it's not 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.060
 my prefect part it does not pose control 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.060
 the best 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.040
 so we serve very well it seems that a 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.780
 good stringing normally you cut the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.750
 son is there all the string his arm 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.350
 once i'm not sure that's okay 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.880
 succeed in doing whatever I melt 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.330
 the butter in a casserole and then I 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.790
 I'll have my meat back then 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.140
 Brown the meat on all sides are 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.270
 be careful companion more than 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.790
 the cheese are completely now 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.619
 so we really brown the sides or 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.509
 to the meat so both sides and the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.920
 fake when the roast is golden brown game 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:42.220
 classes with white wine 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.190
 I add the aroma and 10 centiliters 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.479
 of water I speak I cover and go 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.490
 for 45 minutes cooking over medium heat and 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.950
 here is the meat is cooked 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.410
 I will be able to put it on my plan 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.759
 working to finish my sauce I cover 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.060
 aluminum foil to keep 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.710
 hot 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.020
 I just have to add the 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.619
 cream to finish the sauce and especially that 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 should not boil 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.840
 that is my god this is that it feels too 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.540
 good it's terrible I have taste buds 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.739
 wriggle these games I tackle besides 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.599
 I think I think we're going to have to 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.530
 to let a misstep have to let me 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.090
 so that I can eat it's 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.290
 maybe thing but at the same time it's 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.739

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.859

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.760

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.959
