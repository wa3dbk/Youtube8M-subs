00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:31.909 
bun and then we're gonna take our

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.819 
bun and then we're gonna take our
extension<00:03:32.909> and<00:03:33.180> I've<00:03:33.930> already<00:03:34.139> fished<00:03:34.470> held

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
extension and I've already fished held

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.059 
extension and I've already fished held
this<00:03:35.069> one<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.120> just<00:03:36.150> took<00:03:36.420> two<00:03:36.690> rows<00:03:37.069> pin

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
this one so I just took two rows pin

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.629 
this one so I just took two rows pin
them<00:03:38.250> together<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.879> then<00:03:39.030> fishtail<00:03:39.510> dip<00:03:39.750> and

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
them together and then fishtail dip and

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.420 
them together and then fishtail dip and
then<00:03:41.639> you'll<00:03:41.819> take<00:03:42.030> these<00:03:42.299> three<00:03:43.400> right<00:03:44.400> here

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
then you'll take these three right here

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.899 
then you'll take these three right here
and<00:03:45.769> then<00:03:46.769> you're<00:03:46.920> gonna<00:03:46.980> pin<00:03:47.549> those

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
and then you're gonna pin those

00:03:47.909 --> 00:04:02.750 
and then you're gonna pin those
underneath<00:03:48.480> your<00:03:48.840> bun

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.210

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
should cover all of the extensions that

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.809 
should cover all of the extensions that
you<00:04:36.340> pinned<00:04:36.729> above<00:04:37.060> your<00:04:37.330> fun<00:04:38.550> but<00:04:39.550> if<00:04:39.669> it

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
pieces and pin them like I can't feel

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.980 
pieces and pin them like I can't feel
any<00:04:45.849> extension<00:04:46.330> so<00:04:46.479> I'm<00:04:46.539> pretty<00:04:46.780> sure<00:04:46.960> all

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
any extension so I'm pretty sure all

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.070 
any extension so I'm pretty sure all
mine<00:04:47.289> are<00:04:47.440> covered<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.389> won't<00:04:49.660> do<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:49.840> but

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
mine are covered so I won't do that but

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.839 
mine are covered so I won't do that but
if<00:04:50.229> you<00:04:50.380> need<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.800> then<00:04:50.949> you<00:04:51.130> can<00:04:51.340> just<00:04:51.550> kind<00:04:51.729> of

if you need to then you can just kind of

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.180 
if you need to then you can just kind of
like<00:04:52.000> pin<00:04:52.389> random<00:04:52.750> pieces<00:04:52.990> wherever<00:04:53.550> and<00:04:56.190> I'm

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
like pin random pieces wherever and I'm

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.320

going<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.430> pin<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.729> piece<00:04:57.910> because<00:04:58.150> it's

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
going to pin that piece because it's

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:05.950 
going to pin that piece because it's
going<00:04:58.569> somewhere

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.550
