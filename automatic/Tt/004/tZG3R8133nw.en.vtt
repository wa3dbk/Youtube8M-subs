talked about some of the cars which were
a<00:01:22.469> little<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.770> drifty<00:01:23.630> more<00:01:24.630> traditional

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
a little bit drifty more traditional

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.380 
a little bit drifty more traditional
track<00:01:25.409> cars<00:01:25.679> for<00:01:25.920> example<00:01:26.490> lot<00:01:27.179> more

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
track cars for example lot more

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.600 
track cars for example lot more
downforce<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:28.170> lot<00:01:28.439> more<00:01:28.649> planted<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> know

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
downforce a lot more planted you know

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.039 
downforce a lot more planted you know
the<00:01:29.729> backing<00:01:30.090> doesn't<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.960> all

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
the backing doesn't go out it's all

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.139 
the backing doesn't go out it's all
about<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> grip<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.069> that<00:01:32.640> means<00:01:32.880> there's<00:01:33.090> a

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
about the grip and that means there's a

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.639 
about the grip and that means there's a
different<00:01:33.569> way<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> approaching<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.470> race

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649

us the first outing and it at its heart

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.160 
us the first outing and it at its heart
what<00:03:04.040> we<00:03:04.129> wanted<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.519> do<00:03:04.760> was<00:03:05.450> a<00:03:05.480> game<00:03:05.750> really

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
what we wanted to do was a game really

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.160 
what we wanted to do was a game really
captured<00:03:06.769> what<00:03:06.950> racing<00:03:07.910> was<00:03:08.030> all<00:03:08.209> about<00:03:08.480> not

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
captured what racing was all about not

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.820 
captured what racing was all about not
driving<00:03:09.680> chasing<00:03:10.580> but<00:03:11.209> real<00:03:11.569> battling<00:03:12.379> racing

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
driving chasing but real battling racing

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.890 
driving chasing but real battling racing
and<00:03:13.010> that's<00:03:13.160> still<00:03:13.670> at<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> heart<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
and that's still at the heart and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.780 
and that's still at the heart and
everything<00:03:15.049> we're<00:03:15.410> doing<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:15.920> with<00:03:16.220> grid<00:03:16.519> to

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
everything we're doing with with grid to

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.910 
everything we're doing with with grid to
the<00:03:17.569> real<00:03:17.720> difference<00:03:18.049> I<00:03:18.410> think<00:03:18.590> we've<00:03:18.709> grid

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
the real difference I think we've grid

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.070 
the real difference I think we've grid
to<00:03:19.129> is<00:03:19.280> we're<00:03:19.430> trying<00:03:19.670> to<00:03:19.760> really<00:03:19.940> pull<00:03:20.360> on<00:03:20.599> the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
to is we're trying to really pull on the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.110 
to is we're trying to really pull on the
emotion<00:03:21.680> pull<00:03:22.280> out<00:03:22.310> a<00:03:22.430> lot<00:03:22.700> more<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.030> that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
emotion pull out a lot more of that

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.690 
emotion pull out a lot more of that
