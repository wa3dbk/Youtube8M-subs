pants game I actually have played it on
to<00:00:39.710> other<00:00:39.860> versions<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.790> computer<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.510> the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
to other versions the computer and the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.020 
to other versions the computer and the
game<00:00:42.080> boy<00:00:42.320> if<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:43.100> had<00:00:43.130> to<00:00:43.340> compare<00:00:43.370> them<00:00:43.880> I

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
game boy if I had to compare them I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.850 
game boy if I had to compare them I
would<00:00:44.240> probably<00:00:44.480> say<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.990> game<00:00:45.590> boy<00:00:45.830> version

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
would probably say the game boy version

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.560 
would probably say the game boy version
is<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.520> worst<00:00:46.880> because<00:00:47.030> it's<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.390> most

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
is the worst because it's the most

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.479 
is the worst because it's the most
boring<00:00:47.840> but<00:00:48.500> if<00:00:48.590> i<00:00:48.680> compare<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.130> one<00:00:49.250> to<00:00:49.309> the

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
boring but if i compare this one to the

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.820 
boring but if i compare this one to the
computer<00:00:49.970> it'd<00:00:50.510> be<00:00:50.809> a<00:00:50.840> very<00:00:51.110> tough<00:00:51.320> battle<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
computer it'd be a very tough battle and

computer it'd be a very tough battle and
I'm<00:00:52.010> not<00:00:52.160> really<00:00:52.309> sure<00:00:52.430> who<00:00:52.730> would<00:00:52.850> win<00:00:53.059> I<00:00:53.390> have

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660

such<00:02:03.469> a<00:02:03.500> poor<00:02:03.619> job<00:02:03.829> at<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.490> that<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.030> director

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
such a poor job at it that the director

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.849 
such a poor job at it that the director
just<00:02:05.479> threw<00:02:05.780> him<00:02:05.869> into<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.109> bunch<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.409> minigames

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
just threw him into a bunch of minigames

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.980 
just threw him into a bunch of minigames
and<00:02:07.130> detested<00:02:08.030> him<00:02:08.090> out<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.509> see<00:02:08.660> which<00:02:08.810> one

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
and detested him out to see which one

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.450 
and detested him out to see which one
will<00:02:09.110> be<00:02:09.140> dumb<00:02:09.560> enough<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.920> get<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.250> role

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
will be dumb enough to get the role

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.340 
will be dumb enough to get the role
quite<00:02:11.030> ridiculous<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.870> think<00:02:12.080> about<00:02:12.170> it

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
quite ridiculous if you think about it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.050 
quite ridiculous if you think about it
and<00:02:12.710> why<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.100> he<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.550> thinking<00:02:13.970> about

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and why is he just thinking about

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.540 
and why is he just thinking about
spongebob<00:02:14.660> as<00:02:14.930> friends<00:02:15.500> why<00:02:15.980> doesn't<00:02:16.280> you<00:02:16.340> get

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
spongebob as friends why doesn't you get

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.270 
spongebob as friends why doesn't you get
some<00:02:16.700> actual<00:02:17.120> top-class<00:02:17.870> actors<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:19.010> I

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
some actual top-class actors in this I

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.800 
some actual top-class actors in this I
guess<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.880> movie<00:02:20.150> must<00:02:20.330> have<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:20.600> been<00:02:20.780> very

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
guess the movie must have just been very

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.230 
guess the movie must have just been very
low<00:02:21.260> budget<00:02:21.770> since<00:02:22.250> no<00:02:22.490> one<00:02:22.580> really<00:02:22.790> seems<00:02:23.000> to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
low budget since no one really seems to

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.270 
low budget since no one really seems to
care<00:02:23.270> about<00:02:23.600> acting<00:02:24.170> out<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.350> min<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> movie<00:02:25.040> with

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
with them I must say at times in some

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690 
with them I must say at times in some
games<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:51.989> bots<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.680> end<00:02:52.890> up<00:02:53.069> screwing<00:02:53.459> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
games the bots will end up screwing you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.970 
games the bots will end up screwing you
over<00:02:53.730> pretty<00:02:54.239> badly<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.230> would<00:02:55.560> be<00:02:55.680> very

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
over pretty badly so I would be very

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.130 
over pretty badly so I would be very
aware<00:02:56.130> when<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.150> two<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.569> two<00:02:57.840> in

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
aware when you have to do two on two in

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.530 
aware when you have to do two on two in
some<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.800> minigames<00:02:59.310> because<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.120> AI<00:03:00.239> at

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
some of the minigames because the AI at

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.380 
some of the minigames because the AI at
times<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.380> incredibly<00:03:02.069> stupid<00:03:02.390> most

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
times can just be incredibly stupid most

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.089 
times can just be incredibly stupid most
of<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.599> characters<00:03:03.810> from<00:03:04.080> the<00:03:04.230> TV<00:03:04.440> show<00:03:04.620> are

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
of the characters from the TV show are

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.800 
of the characters from the TV show are
in<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.459> game<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.030> they're<00:03:06.300> all<00:03:06.480> voiced

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
in the game and they're all voiced

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.540 
in the game and they're all voiced
pretty<00:03:07.230> well<00:03:07.470> I'm<00:03:07.860> going<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.310> assume<00:03:08.489> that

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
pretty well I'm going to assume that

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.339 
pretty well I'm going to assume that
they're<00:03:08.849> voiced<00:03:09.060> by<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.360> original<00:03:09.630> actors

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
they're voiced by the original actors

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.350 
they're voiced by the original actors
most<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.220> voice<00:03:11.400> acting<00:03:11.880> comes<00:03:12.090> from<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
most of the voice acting comes from the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.759 
most of the voice acting comes from the
cutscenes<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.080> they<00:03:13.260> actually<00:03:13.500> look<00:03:13.739> pretty

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
cutscenes and they actually look pretty

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.039 
cutscenes and they actually look pretty
good<00:03:14.069> but<00:03:14.940> then<00:03:15.120> there's<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.540> parts<00:03:15.870> where

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
good but then there's the parts where

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.570 
good but then there's the parts where
the<00:03:16.170> director<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.709> talking<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.400> person

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
the director is talking to the person

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.130 
the director is talking to the person
that<00:03:17.819> helps<00:03:18.209> them<00:03:18.269> out<00:03:18.450> with<00:03:18.569> the<00:03:18.690> minigames

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
that helps them out with the minigames

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.039 
that helps them out with the minigames
such<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.950> Larry<00:03:20.160> lobster<00:03:20.640> bubble<00:03:21.120> baths<00:03:21.360> the

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
such like Larry lobster bubble baths the

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.750 
such like Larry lobster bubble baths the
animations<00:03:22.680> there<00:03:22.980> looks<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.459> they<00:03:23.610> just

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
animations there looks like they just

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.920 
animations there looks like they just
took<00:03:23.910> a<00:03:24.030> bunch<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.330> pictures<00:03:24.600> of<00:03:24.780> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
lip-synching looks terrible you will

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.140 
lip-synching looks terrible you will
travel<00:03:31.739> around<00:03:32.040> different<00:03:32.340> locations<00:03:33.000> in
