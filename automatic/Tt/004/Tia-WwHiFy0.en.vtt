00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
I'm coming back to possibly experiencing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.770 
I'm coming back to possibly experiencing
that<00:01:39.869> level<00:01:40.729> but<00:01:41.729> yeah<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.509> very

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that level but yeah it's just a very

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
that level but yeah it's just a very
different<00:01:43.259> style<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.560> rugby<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.220> you

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
different style of rugby over there you

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.200 
different style of rugby over there you
know<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.420> more<00:01:45.600> tactical<00:01:46.439> kicking

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
know I think it's more tactical kicking

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.520 
know I think it's more tactical kicking
more<00:01:48.210> playing<00:01:48.509> percentages<00:01:49.049> building

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
more playing percentages building

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.289 
more playing percentages building
pressure<00:01:49.890> trying<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.820> points<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.149> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
pressure trying to get points on that

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.580 
pressure trying to get points on that
way<00:01:51.450> whereas<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.140> attacked<00:01:52.439> on

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
way whereas here it's attacked on

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.050 
way whereas here it's attacked on
everywhere<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> training<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> know

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
haven't really had any of that obviously

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.050 
haven't really had any of that obviously
the<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.410> first<00:03:14.650> test<00:03:15.489> is<00:03:15.640> again<00:03:15.819> against

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
the the first test is again against

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.599 
the the first test is again against
South<00:03:16.690> Africa<00:03:17.079> you<00:03:17.260> know<00:03:17.590> I've<00:03:17.739> got<00:03:17.920> no<00:03:18.069> not<00:03:18.579> a

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
South Africa you know I've got no not a

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.879 
South Africa you know I've got no not a
great<00:03:18.850> deal<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.329> history<00:03:19.900> behind<00:03:20.049> me<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.859> know

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
great deal of history behind me you know

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.500 
great deal of history behind me you know
for<00:03:21.160> four<00:03:21.310> years<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.670> haven't<00:03:21.850> experienced

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
for four years I haven't experienced

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.170 
for four years I haven't experienced
playing<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.870> Springboks<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.400> you<00:03:25.060> know<00:03:25.120> I

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
playing the Springboks so you know I

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.879 
playing the Springboks so you know I
think<00:03:25.269> when<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.840> time<00:03:26.019> comes<00:03:26.319> possibly<00:03:26.769> I'll

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
think when the time comes possibly I'll

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.160 
think when the time comes possibly I'll
have<00:03:27.040> some<00:03:27.190> advice<00:03:27.430> for<00:03:27.489> him<00:03:27.850> if<00:03:28.750> I'm<00:03:28.989> there

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
have some advice for him if I'm there

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.370 
have some advice for him if I'm there
obviously<00:03:29.709> ten<00:03:30.130> or<00:03:30.250> twelve<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:31.019> think<00:03:32.019> my<00:03:32.170> best

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
obviously ten or twelve I think my best

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.750 
obviously ten or twelve I think my best
position<00:03:32.799> is<00:03:32.859> 12

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
position is 12

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.569 
position is 12
that's<00:03:34.209> right<00:03:34.769> from<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.889> experience<00:03:36.340> going

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
that's right from the experience going

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.330 
that's right from the experience going
away<00:03:37.079> when<00:03:38.079> I<00:03:38.139> left<00:03:38.380> I<00:03:38.560> probably<00:03:38.769> thought<00:03:39.130> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
away when I left I probably thought that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.220 
away when I left I probably thought that
I<00:03:39.400> could<00:03:39.609> play<00:03:39.730> ten<00:03:40.030> but<00:03:40.209> after<00:03:41.049> playing

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
I could play ten but after playing

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.259 
I could play ten but after playing
outside<00:03:41.410> Jonny<00:03:41.799> Wilkinson<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.459> you<00:03:43.180> know<00:03:43.239> a

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
outside Jonny Wilkinson and you know a

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.270 
outside Jonny Wilkinson and you know a
couple<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.599> other<00:03:43.690> guys<00:03:43.930> over<00:03:44.530> in<00:03:44.769> Toulon<00:03:45.250> I

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
couple of other guys over in Toulon I

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.339 
couple of other guys over in Toulon I
realized<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.180> probably<00:03:46.209> add<00:03:46.599> the<00:03:47.169> best

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
realized that I probably add the best

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.890 
realized that I probably add the best
value<00:03:47.590> to<00:03:47.709> the<00:03:47.799> team<00:03:47.980> at<00:03:48.190> 18<00:03:48.489> for<00:03:48.639> tena<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:49.750> way

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
value to the team at 18 for tena the way

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.270 
value to the team at 18 for tena the way

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
well well that's I think that's what the

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.629 
well well that's I think that's what the
nervous<00:04:02.440> energy<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.889> about<00:04:03.190> you<00:04:03.400> know<00:04:03.519> what

training on there I'm I'm probably at a

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.440 
training on there I'm I'm probably at a
level<00:04:06.459> bit<00:04:06.669> higher<00:04:06.819> than<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.120> rest<00:04:07.269> of<00:04:07.389> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
level bit higher than the rest of the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.390 
level bit higher than the rest of the
boys<00:04:07.569> just<00:04:07.840> because<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:08.739> feels<00:04:08.919> like<00:04:09.220> it's

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400

different opportunities identifying

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.120 
different opportunities identifying
moments<00:05:32.229> in<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.410> game<00:05:32.440> I<00:05:32.620> actually<00:05:32.890> don't

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
but I think my decision-making is gone a

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.020 
but I think my decision-making is gone a
lot<00:05:40.960> better<00:05:41.100> timing<00:05:42.100> yeah<00:05:42.520> well<00:05:42.729> your<00:05:42.880> game

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
sense your knowing you know when your

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.460 
sense your knowing you know when your
team's<00:05:44.770> under<00:05:45.039> the<00:05:45.130> pump<00:05:45.310> what<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:45.580> need

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
team's under the pump what you need

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.540 
team's under the pump what you need
especially<00:05:47.470> in<00:05:47.740> those<00:05:47.860> big<00:05:48.100> games<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.460> know

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
especially in those big games you know

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.159 
especially in those big games you know
when<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.760> pressure<00:05:48.940> comes<00:05:49.090> so<00:05:49.539> I<00:05:49.750> think

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
when the pressure comes so I think

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.290 
when the pressure comes so I think
hopefully<00:05:50.830> if<00:05:51.340> I'm<00:05:51.640> involved<00:05:51.940> that's

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
hopefully if I'm involved that's

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.490 
hopefully if I'm involved that's
something<00:05:52.570> that<00:05:52.690> I<00:05:52.720> can<00:05:52.960> bring<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.289> the<00:05:53.380> group
