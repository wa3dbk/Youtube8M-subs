00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.300
How you doing? Today only super speed. And we began with Lamborghini Gallardo LP-560

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.300
that makes 330 KMH (220 MPH) on German Autobahn.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.300
Its 2 minute video and if you every day drive Lamborghini, you can easy skip

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.300
if not, just watch and enjoy it.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.300
It was pretty close. Not every car can brake from 320KMH (213MPH) to 230KMH (153MPH) in few seconds.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.300
330KMH (220MPH)

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.300
German drivers know that autobahns was made not for them, but for supercars.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.300
In next video we have Corvette Z06, Nissan GTR (2012), BMW E92 M3.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.300
Stop, stop. Dart Vader driving Corvette?

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.300
Surprised Obi Wan wasn't driving the GT-R.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.300
And in the end battle against Nissan GTR (2012) and McLaren MP4-12C

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.300
In this race Nissan might use his main advantage - 4 wheels drive.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.300
Up to 260KMH (174MPH) Nissan was first. And he was so far from McLaren that you can see it in mirror.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.300
It looks like Dart Vader from previous video drives that McLaren. And He used his force on 100%.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.300
Thank you for watching my video and good luck to all of you.
