00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
now the EU gave us an answer to that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.709 
now the EU gave us an answer to that
however<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> e<00:01:02.280> used<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.820> Canon<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.539> now

they'd<00:05:58.760> better<00:05:59.000> watch<00:05:59.120> out<00:05:59.570> because<00:05:59.840> the

movies right now have more
contradictions<00:06:02.750> within<00:06:03.020> themselves<00:06:03.560> without
