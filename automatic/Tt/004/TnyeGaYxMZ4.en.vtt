00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.110
 everything costs 69 cents 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.780
 And besides, if you pay attention 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.580
 here everything costs 29 cents so me 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.060

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:37.230

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.880

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.980
 probably each of you paid attention 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.890
 on this strange stone and thought 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.080
 what is such a stone really 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.680

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.280

 santa monica why does he lie there and what 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.870
 so I don't know, but basically nothing 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.370
 mystical, he himself does not carry a 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.370
 all sorts of hieroglyphs and drawings 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.860
 on the texture of the interior 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.040

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.780
 it is empty and you can not get it why 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:03:01.610

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.450
 san francisco and game action 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.760
 occur in the 90s namely in 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.010
 San Francisco in the 90s was held 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.049
 terrible earthquake and therefore 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.200
 San Fierro earthquake also failed 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.019

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:06.840
