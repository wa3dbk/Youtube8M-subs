so<00:00:05.700> my<00:00:05.910> research<00:00:06.720> project<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.259> called<00:00:07.410> XML

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
so my research project is called XML

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.129 
so my research project is called XML
foodie<00:00:08.099> it's<00:00:08.730> about<00:00:08.910> Jack<00:00:09.269> where<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.599> aim<00:00:09.719> to

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
foodie it's about Jack where we aim to

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.009 
foodie it's about Jack where we aim to
make<00:00:10.769> 3d<00:00:11.610> graphics<00:00:12.030> more<00:00:12.240> available<00:00:12.719> for

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
make 3d graphics more available for

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.650 
make 3d graphics more available for
everyone<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:14.219> now<00:00:14.250> 3d<00:00:14.910> graphic<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.360> more

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
everyone so right now 3d graphic is more

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.870 
everyone so right now 3d graphic is more
or<00:00:15.750> less<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.920> podcast<00:00:16.920> medium<00:00:17.310> only<00:00:17.670> where<00:00:17.850> we

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
or less a podcast medium only where we

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.779 
or less a podcast medium only where we
specialized<00:00:18.570> people<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.500> produce<00:00:20.130> 3d

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
specialized people they produce 3d

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.870 
specialized people they produce 3d
content<00:00:21.029> mainly<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.080> games<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.880> they

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
content mainly for games and they

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.660 
content mainly for games and they
broadcast<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.050> lot<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.260> people<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:26.250> not

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
broadcast it to a lot of people but not

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000 
broadcast it to a lot of people but not
everyone<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.119> able<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.840> produce<00:00:28.199> 3d<00:00:28.769> content

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
everyone is able to produce 3d content

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.730 
everyone is able to produce 3d content
and<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:29.789> said<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.109> put<00:00:31.320> 3d

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
and so we said we have to put 3d

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.490 
and so we said we have to put 3d
graphics<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> web<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.719> make<00:00:34.380> it

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
graphics to the web and make it

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.290 
graphics to the web and make it
available<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.980> web<00:00:35.219> developers<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> then<00:00:36.149> we

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
available to web developers and then we

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.780 
available to web developers and then we
have<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> huge<00:00:37.050> amount<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.800> people<00:00:38.129> who<00:00:38.370> can

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
have a huge amount of people who can

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.639 
have a huge amount of people who can
produce<00:00:39.180> any<00:00:39.629> content<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.350> make<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
produce any content if we make it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.950 
produce any content if we make it
available<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.280> those<00:00:41.370> web<00:00:41.610> developers<00:00:42.120> we

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
available for those web developers we

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.040 
available for those web developers we
designed<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.980> extension<00:00:44.670> html5<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.840> did<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
designed this extension html5 we did a

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.440 
designed this extension html5 we did a
specification<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.520> not<00:00:47.730> only<00:00:48.000> theory

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
specification but it's not only theory

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.869 
specification but it's not only theory
we<00:00:48.660> also<00:00:48.840> implemented<00:00:49.739> XML<00:00:50.309> 30<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.850> we

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
we also implemented XML 30 so we

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569 
we also implemented XML 30 so we
extended<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.690> example<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.620> google<00:00:53.340> chrome

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
extended for example the google chrome

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.450 
extended for example the google chrome
browser<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.809> support<00:00:54.960> XML<00:00:55.590> 30<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.309> a

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
browser to also support XML 30 this is a

graphics<00:01:50.369> oh<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.909> huge<00:01:51.540> amount<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
graphics oh the huge amount of

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.690 
graphics oh the huge amount of
applications<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.070> imagine<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
applications we can imagine like a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.469 
applications we can imagine like a
kitchen<00:01:54.299> configurator<00:01:54.899> or<00:01:55.439> something<00:01:56.040> like

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
kitchen configurator or something like

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
kitchen configurator or something like
project<00:01:57.479> management<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.770> visualize

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
project management so you can visualize

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120 
project management so you can visualize
your<00:01:59.790> products<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.689> also<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:01.170> casual<00:02:01.829> games

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
your products but also like casual games

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.940 
your products but also like casual games
