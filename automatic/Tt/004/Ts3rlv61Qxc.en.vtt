00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.130
 the first time here and I'm positive 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.680
 surprised by the flood of information 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 all at once the best thing was the now 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.300
 description of the lac approximation that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.489
 still all this is being revised 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.780
 that was already relatively informative 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.980
 that you can take with you 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.719
 to insurance against wool 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.719
 hold back argumentation 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.339
 we are now in the second year and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.070
 The event took place last year 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:53.050
 already extremely exciting because of the high 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.079
 professional competence that can be found here and 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.609
 the really interesting and technical 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.549
 relevant discussions to lead the here 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:05.049
 We are exhibitors, it is one 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:07.320
 scary interesting event 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.820
 because it is exactly our audience there 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.619
 Our clientele's leadership potential 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.390
 represents and that come naturally 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.649
 because it 's a very interesting one 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.539
 event is with many 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.259
 interesting to many exhibitors 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.850
 lectures and always live 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.819
 about the new assistance systems in the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.560
 Vehicles that was appreciated 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.319
 partly also terrifying what is up 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.179
 but it's also very informative 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:33.759
 I have noticed that too 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.780
 many originating participants are there 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.140
 repeat offender 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.149
 you know it's more common that the 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.280
 the same faces you the last 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.319
 evenly also seen years has distinguished 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.049
 in particular, the event 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:49.259
 and therefore this one comes very much too 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.369
 Family character of the event 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.460
 the special will almost say that 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.950
 only one is really hand-picked 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.340
 selected audience was iris we have 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.100
 Yes 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.100
 100 target group which otherwise rarely too 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.280
 but of course it is the same 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.950
 co-exhibitor and who I call it 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.750
 Friendly fellow on the experts 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.489
 stage the day before and that is one 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.489
 round concept and that is fun
