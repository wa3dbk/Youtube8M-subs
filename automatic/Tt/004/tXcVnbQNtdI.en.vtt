00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.819
 not only bread will man live that is 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.180
 the theme for our devotional this 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.230
 day 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:14.769
 Saint Matthew chapter 4 verse 3 and 4 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.130
 says the word thus and came to him the 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.500
 tempting and told him if you're God's son 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.269
 without these stones becoming 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:28.000
 bread is answered and said written this is not 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:30.599
 only man will live on bread but on 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.160
 every word that comes from the mouth of God 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.840
 blessed be the name of our Lord 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.570
 Jesus Christ 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.750
 satan attacks Jesus with the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.950
 Physical needs Jesus was hungry 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.440
 the temptation was strong because the body 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.900
 I needed so satan I was trying to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.790
 jesus distrust of kindness and 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.210
 provision of his father for his 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.150
 needs but jesus responds to 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.120
 attack like a law with a command 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:04.330
 with an order with a decree with a 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.790
 final sentence blessed be the name of 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.430
 Jesus Christ that all happens 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.550
 of the need for food to sustain 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.570
 the physical body but it was not the time 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.840
 of bread Jesus would not distrust his father 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.050
 Jesus chose not to use his divine power 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 to meet the natural need for 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:30.010
 food will not only bread man will live 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.610
 said the Lord this means that the bread 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.150
 He speaks physical needs 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.670
 physical desires are not the whole in life 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.119
 of man there may be moments 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.229
 where we have a shortage of food 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.080
 of money and material things but that 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.930
 does not mean that God did not forget or that 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.610
 has neglected us or that 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.610
 we are going to die immediately 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.420
 in no way 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.549
 we live by the mercy of God 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.640
 we live by the power of god for the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.850
 grace of God we live by the blessing 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.900
 of God we live by the care of God 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.120
 not for bread or for water not only from 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.850
 bread will live the man said the lord 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.550
 Jesus Christ also means that the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 man does not have life just because of things 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.569
 physical live from every word that comes out 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.450
 from the mouth of God is to live trusting 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.150
 the decrees of God living trusting 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.580
 the word of God the word that comes out 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.180
 from the mouth of God also produces life 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.330
 produces health produces blessing and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.030
 it also produces provision if we do not have 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.269
 food if we do not have money if not 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.360
 we have health if we do not have peace but if 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.989
 we have a word of God in our 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.370
 heart to believe and make our that 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.030

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.049
