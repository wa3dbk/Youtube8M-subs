00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 Lately, they have been defeated by pollen recently, and they are dying (悶 ii)) Zulu Zulu This will be a sortie with the Indians card ('NoД`) 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 Turning around ('no ω`) is a commentary commentary video part II (' no ω`) this time about turning around 4 vs 4 short distance front escort in the field, the important point is the range where you can see the awareness of space and route I will explain it in. 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.000
 First of all, greetings &lt;n&gt; 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 There is no reply ... it is already like a wolf again (', _ ゝ `) Fuhihi 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 There is also no report of the number from the tank at the same time ... It is OK in the self-judge (', _ ゝ `) Fuhihi 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 As there is no front restraint anti at this stage, let's secure the route which can escape to the enemy base ('No Д`) Koshiri 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 First of all, you can lose here, so you can set your position on the enemy base side to create a route that can be fleeing to the enemy base, either by turning the opponent or getting an invincibility. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 I secured a route to flee to the enemy base side here, and even if it was set to two by this, the space which can flee was made ('no Д `) Koshiri 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 I gave up the tank to chase after it, so I called the tank to my own side. Since there were 2 sheets in my side, the tank should naturally be able to join freely ('no ω `) Cossori 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 As you can see, there is a large space in the tank and on your side, and it is a distance where you can escape as much as you like ('no ω `) Cossori 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.000
 At this point, it is almost impossible for the opponent's anti to get involved in the tank, so the shooting match is an advantageous situation where you can fight at any distance in the short distance ('no ω`) 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 As I wrote earlier, after you escape the defender, I cut it into a cheap pie at my favorite distance. (∀ ∀ ∀ ∀ ノ ノ ノ パ ッ ☆ ☆ ☆ 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 As there is a possibility that a cold gym will work and cause an accident, I will cover it to the extent that I will not get caught. ;) Yuk Rishitai 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Cold gym escapes safely ... If this distance is 2 near each other cheap pie distance or not ... ('no Д `) Koshiri 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Ghufu appeared !! (; Д Д () (Д; (; (Д) ;;) Nah, Nadatte !!) 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 First of all, let's escape from the cross range so that I can't get caught up in a battle. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 As space with two enemies was made, we take advantage of that chance ('no ω `) Koshiri 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.000
 Because boost is cut and it is not possible to make a quick turn, I use a saber with a wider judgment than the tackle, and aim for thrust ((A ;;) abnai 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.700
 There is a space on the left here, and if you stand in that position, you may be able to escape with the tank ('no ω`) 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.700
 There is no ball = popular name useful time (; Д `) Naei 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 Since there is a space that can escape on your side, we will support you so that the tank can escape from the case. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 Because the goofu drops, you can make the number advantage if you collect the cold rucksack, so target the rucksack with priority ('no ω`) 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.000
 As it is big if we can take it, we use air deviation only at such time ('no ω `) We have advantage here at a stretch, and we surround here (`, ω,)) Shakin 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 This time there is a space on the left where you can flee, so let's flee to it (he '∀ `) 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 This is the second round of the editing work, so if you have a defect such as a heavy video, it would be helpful if you could get some rice (; · ∀ ·) Thank you for your audition (`· · ω · ') Shakin
