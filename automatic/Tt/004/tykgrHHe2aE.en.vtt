00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.880
 until the kaats de jong schöne 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.530
 there is going to class 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.430
 escapes from the back of van anholt here 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:24.720
 at the second pole side you see her 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.670
 there is also muscle shirt 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.509
 takes good care of it and the ball gets there 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.000
 touched by beautiful without 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.320
 poet opening goal niklas moisander 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.120
 if the ball is extended at the first post 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.720
 root it but get nice without it 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.720
 there anyway on construction 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.980
 last time Heerenveen was in Yvon 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.570
 2009 January 2009 when from Boston or 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.550
 coach of ajax 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.550
 fisher here no offside and then 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.830
 I call it is not the question is 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.830
 the offside 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.210
 that is it is not nearly 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.720
 the young nothing at the right time 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.990
 places responds but here is from 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990
 acts 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.530
 for heerenveen 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.530
 fischer serero 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.940
 viktor fischer de jong and then it becomes 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.540
 Fall brought to a penalty 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.540
 for all 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.330
 played well or token and then the 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.549
 earth violation of joey van der berg 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.990
 jarne behind the ball 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:44.439
 oh my so still on the lead 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.439
 no problem after 12 minutes 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.800
 the screen of the match started the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.940
 ajax and this i deserved ahead 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.940
 schöne 's penalty kick 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.580
 the young is constantly playable 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.210
 blind 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.260
 now even right outside but what 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 makes it out of physio and that's the 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.240
 following penalties this is one 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.240
 creature 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.519
 so gentlemen v know a whole lot different 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.519
 start in this competition 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 and another penalty comes 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.500
 so within 18th minute within schöne 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.550
 now the other corner is already 2 0 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.550
 yet to explain 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.520
 hit well enough by lasse schöne 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.040
 she lost here too see no cattle with it now 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.590
 Who against two good dad says you 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.130
 van la parra can still score 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.130
 not anymore 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.270
 rajiv from la parra basacikoglu 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.190
 cheeky and wind it already comes from fact 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.420
 but this was a good chance for van la 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.550
 parra 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.720
 So you can say that the sharpness is still 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.340
 not always with the van team 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.800
 cast the sharpness that you had last week 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.220
 just was in the first half 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.220
 groningen 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.230
 Serero he had the track but 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.040
 so no 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.040
 and no violations either 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.650
 another deep bait of moisander and 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.060
 play modes of nibble or not the ball 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.440
 I don't think so I don't think so 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.440
 offense is for joey van der werf 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.629
 you see 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.799
 really nice down for this 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.610
 article is enough for the purpose 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.890
 finnbogason 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.540
 then that pass must be good because then 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.439
 Finnbogason there is of course 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.439
 back in the right place 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.570
 it was chic on 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.570
 finnbogason 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.300
 you really see that 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.980
 I wrote beautiful article group 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.590
 many players from heerenveen you for the 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.740
 ajax goal including finnbogason younger 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.270
 then here they will because there 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.750
 no one in the second pole was ahead 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.750
 heerenveen 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:26.090
 the roon 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.090
 finnbogason just next to it 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.960
 then it becomes a bit more one 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.960
 contest 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.100
 you torture the right back 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.780
 in you see that's the following 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.780
 dangerous moment of heerenveen 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.650
 sigthorsson for the last 20 minutes 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.810
 earlier this season in the nabe 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.140
 lenstra stadium accurately kolder and himself 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.140
 loose at 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.370
 sheet 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.560
 van rijn no offside this is 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.580
 beautiful plays for Rijn 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.470
 finish Sunday 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.520
 and he doesn't 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.410
 what Noordveld can turn so a farewell 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.700
 more than a hundred games after the game 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:20.290
 for ajax , ajax still wants to be there 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.830
 to create a third 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.900
 clean 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.509
 it could be now 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.840
 see lawned villages that are laying for 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.840
 left 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.870
 trade held in by viktor 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.080
 fischer fischer says good ball and then is 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.250
 it like there is it again 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:44.450
 lasse schöne excellent pass by 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.580
 viktor fischer looking at group list and 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.290
 that ball also with the perfect speed 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.290
 for the oralift corstjens 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.800
 It is done in Amsterdam Ajax wins with 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.390
 3 0 van heerenveen it was the day of 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.180
 lasse schöne 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.980
 7 the penalties and the 3 0 to 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.190
 Russia minutes before the end of the 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.290
 service his old club ajax takes the 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.690
 next heard the farmer wins for it 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.990
 first this career of van basts 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:18.190
 ajax this with 3 0 pretty easy 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.190
 when it comes in
