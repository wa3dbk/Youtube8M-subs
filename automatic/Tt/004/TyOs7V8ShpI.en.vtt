00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:10.990
 and so the couple went to plant our potatoes 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.690
 which we previously germinated 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.880
 but now we have folded the bucket and carried it out 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.099
 on the plot to plant 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.050
 but the potato plant can be different from 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.570
 someone has a separate plot 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.789
 and even whole potato field and someone 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.069
 prefers to plant potatoes leg rows 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.789
 individual especially those who are difficult 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:33.160
 handle missionaries or just here 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.890
 loving any vegetable to be under 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.960
 control and sometimes even if you have 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.300
 potato field need to do fruit 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.550
 shifts i.e. change cultures in places and 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.950
 here if you a few have grown on 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.830
 one place has potatoes sometimes 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.920
 translate it and on guides and some 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.380
 other spaces so the club is different 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.870
 a place much higher and plant potatoes 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.200
 need of course to carefully process 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.690
 dig certainly desirable course 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.119
 if you have this much 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.000
 manure because the potato loves 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.030
 dung well and as they say if dung 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.070
 no, then at least generously for its icy 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.550
 fertilizer is not difficult to cook 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.140
 need to fold crappy find out others among 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.050
 her who you are abundant all on every 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.600
 plot in a barrel for watering water and pour 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.640
 water in two weeks will be ready 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.190
 a kind of brew that you can just 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.890
 pour into the land you are going to 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.350
 plant potatoes it will be nice but 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.600
 of course they say that without manure 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.710
 there are no potatoes but maybe 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.110
 something they are wrong 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.900
 she is of course you are of age 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.729
 record harvest and those who approve 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.369
 that we can land 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.170
 a ton of potatoes to remove they are right if 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.979
 there will be a large amount of manure can and 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.830
 such to be 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.619
 Well, at least 300 kilograms weave 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.729
 it is therefore best provided with manure 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.049
 Of course take care and either until present 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.780
 dung use either 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.010
 processed products that are available and 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.869
 sold in stores 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.420
 but the main thing that this wonderful 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.750
 organic fertilizer got into the ground then 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 and are meant for potatoes and then 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.330
 it is time 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.330
 you can plant him directly 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.090
 plant any 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.100
 water and after the rain may even be after 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.650
 rain is more convenient because the soil is better 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.230
 hold false dry weather main 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 to be warm and to give a listing 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.270
 as I said we were with that pretty penny 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.810
 signs are there but how are we going to plant 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.030
 potatoes 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.520
 Of course the rows we will not do so 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.150
 as we do for many other vegetables 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.610
 because she live on seeds a tubers and 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.770
 certainly you can not put them in go but 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.600
 Of course breaking under each such swim new 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.510
 you are here, too, we will be because 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.360
 potatoes killed another kind of planting a 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.080
 why it will become clear now I need him 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.150
 prepare deep enough furrows 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.700
 this is due to the structure is not its root 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.209
 systems so i take no shovel or 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.820
 scoop 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.400
 attack his rag here is such a device 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.160
 simple every summer resident gardener 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.959
 new is exactly here it is more convenient for them 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.490
 just work with potatoes just 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.410
 we plan here somewhere in the middle of what we have 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.690
 will be redox potatoes 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.430
 but the next one is also parallel 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.350
 to him you are just this 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.570
 hopper it is very easy it is very 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.610
 convenient not even compare with some scoop 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.190
 we can do it deeply 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.430
 here I get manure because 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.880
 that i'm earth is rich in convenience since i 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.390
 Soot the potatoes and so here and this 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.550
 even said very comfortably easy 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.750
 passed with this hoop work because I 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.370
 I make a groove like this and even another floor 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.310
 grooves because there is another side 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.739
 I will go here by the way such grooves 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.580
 which will be decomposed potatoes they 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:58.340
 should be approximately 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.890
 sentiment at 50 because there must be 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.920
 the aisle between the rows of potatoes is that 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.030
 please go and take care of him and 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.850
 minimum width of aisles and how 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.500
 5040 centimeters is very narrow 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.400
 so 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.030
 Aida's potatoes apart enough 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.670
 far away is the potatoes themselves 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.670
 I will come in everybody more closely Daudova 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.490
 tank centimeters 20 30 here I go with 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:30.290
 other side and deepen their groove 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.110
 Oh, how and where the bands for will get more 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:36.620
 and on the neck to make our potatoes 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.750
 there was a place to develop to her 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.850
 the battle is not my students can be more 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.900
 there were strawberries and those 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.660
 i'm deep enough about a spade dripping 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.169
 it would be difficult of course to do this 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:55.760
 let's just beat me 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:58.040
 trench but it's not all on you 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.790
 good and the hall is even better than that 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.580
 the potatoes are very fond of her okay i 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.610
 most of all the stove stopped here with me 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.919
 natural ash bucket 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.200
 my stove and I'll sprinkle it a little 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:19.190
 so here about no longer need gays 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.320
 and sprinkle my trench 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.110
 and do not be afraid, some believe that 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.540
 the potatoes from burn no no burn 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.090
 because biological features 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.900
 tubers such that he was not afraid and took 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.560
 even if they did it beforehand 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.650
 by landing 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.170
 I am the same ash and pound him in tubers 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.770
 his potatoes 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:47.990
 to the hall a little chair covered a 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.510
 now the most interesting tab potatoes 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.990
 he has no bottom and top as such 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.920
 so 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.110
 put the tubers as they come from you 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.440
 here you just take out and put on 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.260
 a distance of 25 centimeters means of course 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:07.670
 variety initially with small tubers can 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:11.090
 more often and if large-fruited it is rare 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:14.600
 they are what sprouts from all sides therefore 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.750
 I'm just and I do not even scatter along the trench 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.840
 looked to the Kirov where looking and already in 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.110
 in the end, all the same everything will turn out when 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.590
 I set out my potato now 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.740
 turn 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.310
 bury her but if while planting others 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.560
 of vegetables 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.810
 we dig in flush that is flat 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.050
 we get a place we do not even see 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.390
 where did it change my buried 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.400
 here's a potato here, everything is 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.440
 differently she loves to be 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.050
 very very deep 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.750
 what we on for days was still such a mound 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.419
 peculiar so its often even when 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.400
 she's already pretty big and spud here 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.010
 and now you need to essentially make a club 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.480
 very high spud then yourself but this 

00:06:55.010 --> 00:07:00.200
 same 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:02.720
 mother and throw the land and again very 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.380
 convenient time to work on bass ground with 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.380
 both sides 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.820
 it's even more convenient for this potato 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:17.250
 first go out of the row and then with 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.900
 2nd, I specifically do as high as possible 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.570
 then when you plant all your branches 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.130
 These straight will stand out potato 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.430
 food they will be slides 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:30.610
 that's what I need to achieve with one 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:34.330
 Party has passed and now I will go to another 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:37.380
 and here I will be even more these for a long time and 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:42.240
 and buried and yet I must 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:48.479
 high high make a roller like this 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.479
 that's how seen what roller 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.610
 then 

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.980
 and then in the villages when did this 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.370
 roller additionally to be convenient 

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:05.070
 walk around and tread like that 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:07.660
 track to understand what is there 

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.420
 inter-row and here you can walk and 

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:14.100
 take care of potatoes ie you 

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.100
 can do the same
