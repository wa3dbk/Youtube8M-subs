00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
the art Animal Center web site and then

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.229 
the art Animal Center web site and then
that<00:01:00.160> was<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.340> first<00:01:00.550> time<00:01:00.760> I<00:01:00.790> heard<00:01:00.970> about<00:01:01.059> it

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
that was the first time I heard about it

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.530 
that was the first time I heard about it
I<00:01:01.540> was<00:01:01.840> fascinated<00:01:02.770> by<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.550> movie<00:01:03.910> industry<00:01:04.329> and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
I was fascinated by a movie industry and

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.050 
I was fascinated by a movie industry and
game<00:01:04.750> industry<00:01:05.290> and<00:01:05.530> when<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.340> was<00:01:06.579> making<00:01:06.759> that

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
game industry and when I was making that

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.940 
game industry and when I was making that
decision<00:01:07.329> about<00:01:07.569> fine<00:01:07.960> art<00:01:08.139> I<00:01:08.259> was<00:01:08.409> rejecting

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
decision about fine art I was rejecting

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.239 
decision about fine art I was rejecting
it<00:01:09.100> a<00:01:09.130> bit<00:01:09.429> and<00:01:09.700> then<00:01:09.999> I<00:01:10.030> figured<00:01:10.780> out<00:01:10.889> why<00:01:11.889> I

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249 
it a bit and then I figured out why I

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:14.520 
it a bit and then I figured out why I
thought<00:01:12.700> I'm<00:01:12.969> give<00:01:13.359> it<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.539> shot<00:01:13.719> and<00:01:13.929> I<00:01:14.049> do<00:01:14.109> just

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
thought I'm give it a shot and I do just

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.609 
thought I'm give it a shot and I do just
the<00:01:14.619> drawing<00:01:14.770> course<00:01:15.069> yeah<00:01:15.549> yeah<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.619> from

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
the drawing course yeah yeah and from

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.649 
the drawing course yeah yeah and from
there<00:01:17.799> I<00:01:18.249> was<00:01:18.670> just<00:01:18.850> more<00:01:19.030> impressed<00:01:19.359> and<00:01:19.539> I

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
there I was just more impressed and I

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.669 
there I was just more impressed and I
went<00:01:19.929> with<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.759> full<00:01:22.600> course<00:01:22.959> I<00:01:23.259> mean

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
went with the full course I mean

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.379 
went with the full course I mean
difference<00:01:24.069> between<00:01:24.399> basic<00:01:24.609> oh<00:01:24.819> and<00:01:25.060> that

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:25.389 
difference between basic oh and that

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:28.469 
difference between basic oh and that
school<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:26.579> give<00:01:27.579> it<00:01:27.729> some<00:01:27.850> design<00:01:28.149> the

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
school is give it some design the

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.300 
school is give it some design the
emphasis<00:01:28.749> on<00:01:28.869> taking<00:01:29.229> something<00:01:29.499> from<00:01:29.950> nature

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
emphasis on taking something from nature

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.639 
emphasis on taking something from nature
and<00:01:30.459> making<00:01:31.119> it<00:01:31.209> look<00:01:31.329> look<00:01:31.779> better<00:01:32.020> than<00:01:32.529> it

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
and making it look look better than it

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.149 
and making it look look better than it
actually<00:01:32.679> is<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:34.319> that's<00:01:35.319> one<00:01:35.829> of<00:01:35.859> the<00:01:35.979> things

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
actually is and that's one of the things

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.699 
actually is and that's one of the things
that<00:01:36.279> I<00:01:36.310> think<00:01:36.999> I'm<00:01:37.090> taking<00:01:37.389> with<00:01:37.479> me<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:38.619> is

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:38.709 
that I think I'm taking with me that is

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.350 
that I think I'm taking with me that is
a<00:01:38.740> great<00:01:39.039> value<00:01:39.189> once<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.240> think

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
a great value once I think

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.650 
a great value once I think
pushes<00:01:42.230> a<00:01:42.500> bit<00:01:42.740> more<00:01:42.950> technical<00:01:43.660> proficiency

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
pushes a bit more technical proficiency

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.270 
pushes a bit more technical proficiency
first<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.980> then<00:01:46.130> design<00:01:46.910> later<00:01:47.480> on<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.860> for<00:01:49.160> me

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
first and then design later on so for me

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.980 
first and then design later on so for me
that's<00:01:49.430> what<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.640> was<00:01:49.790> looking<00:01:49.940> for<00:01:50.390> I<00:01:50.660> wasn't

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
that's what I was looking for I wasn't

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.410 
that's what I was looking for I wasn't
looking<00:01:51.470> for<00:01:51.710> that<00:01:51.880> classic<00:01:52.880> fine<00:01:53.210> art

fast I think this is the best place to
go

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
go

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.370 
go
one<00:02:04.610> thing<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:04.910> is<00:02:05.390> probably<00:02:05.900> really<00:02:06.140> high

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
one thing that is probably really high

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
of this school is the constant

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.430 
of this school is the constant
demonstration<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.750> teachers<00:02:15.050> do<00:02:15.230> I

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
demonstration that the teachers do I

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.540 
demonstration that the teachers do I
have<00:02:16.400> never<00:02:16.580> seen<00:02:16.850> that<00:02:16.880> before

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
have never seen that before

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.520 
have never seen that before
just<00:02:19.550> on<00:02:20.000> every<00:02:20.420> class<00:02:20.630> we've<00:02:20.870> come<00:02:21.140> in<00:02:21.320> and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
just on every class we've come in and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.770 
just on every class we've come in and
the<00:02:21.860> teacher<00:02:22.130> would<00:02:22.280> demonstrate<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:22.940> it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
the teacher would demonstrate for it

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.410 
the teacher would demonstrate for it
30<00:02:24.260> minutes<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.800> we're<00:02:25.040> how<00:02:25.940> they<00:02:26.090> will<00:02:26.209> do

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
30 minutes and we're how they will do

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.060 
30 minutes and we're how they will do
things<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.959> I<00:02:27.470> think<00:02:27.650> that's<00:02:27.800> one<00:02:27.890> of<00:02:27.920> the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
things and I think that's one of the

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.440 
things and I think that's one of the
best<00:02:28.340> ways<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.660> found<00:02:29.720> to<00:02:30.470> learn<00:02:31.450> all

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450

really<00:02:45.050> a<00:02:45.080> little<00:02:45.440> bit<00:02:45.769> insane<00:02:46.250> about<00:02:46.940> art

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
really a little bit insane about art

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.560 
really a little bit insane about art
they<00:02:48.350> collect<00:02:48.739> art<00:02:48.950> books<00:02:49.310> they<00:02:49.790> do<00:02:50.180> not<00:02:50.330> sleep

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
they paint it's it's hard to not improve

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.070 
they paint it's it's hard to not improve
really<00:02:55.100> because<00:02:55.549> there's<00:02:56.269> no<00:02:56.480> way<00:02:56.630> out

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
really because there's no way out

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.160 
really because there's no way out
I<00:02:57.110> had<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.709> false<00:02:57.980> idea<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:59.090> when<00:03:00.049> you're
