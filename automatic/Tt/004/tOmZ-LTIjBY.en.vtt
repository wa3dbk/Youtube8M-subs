to take these straighten them out a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.910 
to take these straighten them out a
little<00:01:56.630> bit<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.049> that<00:01:57.079> out<00:01:57.289> of<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.469> way<00:01:57.500> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
little bit so that out of the way and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.690 
little bit so that out of the way and
then<00:01:58.490> fold<00:01:58.909> this<00:01:59.299> down<00:02:00.310> so<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.340> will<00:02:01.549> become

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
then fold this down so that will become

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:10.210 
then fold this down so that will become
the<00:02:01.909> chest<00:02:02.770> pop<00:02:03.770> these<00:02:03.979> backup<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.759> place<00:02:06.700> like

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.760 

so<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:11.940> we<00:02:12.090> go<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:13.170> then<00:02:13.730> take<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.820> test<00:02:15.030> go

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
so there we go and then take the test go

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.100 
so there we go and then take the test go
take<00:02:16.770> his<00:02:16.890> arms<00:02:17.190> back<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:18.080> split<00:02:19.080> open<00:02:20.070> up

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
take his arms back here split open up

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.610 
take his arms back here split open up
pull<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.530> around<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.160> rotate<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.730> down

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
pull the can around and rotate it down

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.290 
pull the can around and rotate it down
and<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:25.920> here<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.490> have<00:02:27.440> like<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.560> you're<00:02:28.680> on

and this robot mode as you can see he

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.310 
and this robot mode as you can see he
looks<00:02:34.910> really<00:02:35.910> really<00:02:36.300> good<00:02:38.000> looks<00:02:39.320> really

looks really really good looks really
accurate<00:02:40.680> if<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.980> ask<00:02:41.070> me<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:42.470> cartoon<00:02:43.470> model

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
accurate if you ask me to cartoon model

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.910 
accurate if you ask me to cartoon model
looks<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.300> as<00:02:45.450> good<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:45.840> not<00:02:46.170> better<00:02:46.350> even

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
maybe then the voyagers articulation he

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.840 
maybe then the voyagers articulation he
does<00:02:53.730> rotate<00:02:53.970> at<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.330> shoulder<00:02:55.489> bend<00:02:56.489> at<00:02:56.820> the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
a good deal shorter than Megatron as he

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.810 
a good deal shorter than Megatron as he

just<00:04:37.569> to<00:04:37.690> kind<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:37.930> round<00:04:38.110> out<00:04:38.379> the<00:04:38.620> Decepticon

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
just to kind of round out the Decepticon

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.450 
just to kind of round out the Decepticon
ranks<00:04:39.729> right<00:04:39.879> now<00:04:40.120> since<00:04:40.780> we've<00:04:40.960> gotten<00:04:41.169> a<00:04:41.740> lot

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
ranks right now since we've gotten a lot

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.029 
ranks right now since we've gotten a lot
more<00:04:42.900> Autobots<00:04:43.900> moment<00:04:44.409> than<00:04:44.530> Decepticons
