00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
rolling I'm probably to do some some

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.119

live<00:01:03.719> gameplay<00:01:04.110> commentaries<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.890> way<00:01:05.100> I

live gameplay commentaries that way I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.399 
live gameplay commentaries that way I
can<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> slow<00:01:05.939> down<00:01:06.119> my<00:01:06.299> play<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.840> maybe

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
can kind of slow down my play and maybe

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.700 
can kind of slow down my play and maybe
explain<00:01:08.100> more<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.640> basics<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> game<00:01:09.710> for

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
those who probably don't know what's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
those who probably don't know what's
going<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:12.869> assume<00:01:13.110> many<00:01:13.439> of

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
going on which I would assume many of

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.830 
going on which I would assume many of
you<00:01:14.060> don't<00:01:15.060> really<00:01:15.240> understand<00:01:15.600> everything

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you don't really understand everything

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.140 
you don't really understand everything
I'm<00:01:16.020> doing<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.860> one<00:01:17.610> thing<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.820> playing<00:01:18.060> as

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I'm doing so one thing I'm playing as

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.920 
I'm doing so one thing I'm playing as
France<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.930> I'm<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.710> blue<00:01:20.930> provenance

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
France so I'm like the blue provenance

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.230 
France so I'm like the blue provenance
or<00:01:22.140> country<00:01:22.680> upper<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> right

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
or country upper right there and right

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.550 
or country upper right there and right
now<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> am<00:01:25.080> seeing<00:01:25.740> Spain<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.090> my

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
now I am seeing Spain so I have my

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
now I am seeing Spain so I have my
individual<00:01:28.560> armies<00:01:29.009> divided<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.570> on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
individual armies divided up and I'm on

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
individual armies divided up and I'm on
each<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.229> their<00:01:31.350> provinces<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.009> states<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
each of their provinces or states and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.660 
each of their provinces or states and
then<00:01:33.180> basically<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:34.350> causes<00:01:35.220> them<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
then basically that causes them to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.890 
then basically that causes them to
become<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:37.049> guess<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.340> siege<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.939> they<00:01:39.600> can't

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
become I guess in a siege and they can't

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.340 
become I guess in a siege and they can't
spawn<00:01:40.320> or<00:01:40.770> make<00:01:41.189> more<00:01:41.700> dudes<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.390> attack<00:01:42.720> which

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
spawn or make more dudes to attack which

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
spawn or make more dudes to attack which
is<00:01:43.470> pretty<00:01:43.619> nice<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.070> kind<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.759> guess

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
is pretty nice so you kind of I guess

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.270 
is pretty nice so you kind of I guess
suffocate<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.350> some<00:01:46.710> kind<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.040> sense

right now what I'm doing is effectively

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.470 
right now what I'm doing is effectively
i<00:02:30.730> have<00:02:31.090> i<00:02:31.329> have<00:02:31.359> won<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:32.409> skirmish<00:02:33.159> and<00:02:33.909> i'm

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
states Providence's i want from them and

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.770 
states Providence's i want from them and
essentially<00:02:42.549> as<00:02:42.879> you'll<00:02:43.060> see<00:02:43.239> bottom<00:02:43.540> left

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
essentially as you'll see bottom left

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.379 
essentially as you'll see bottom left
that<00:02:44.319> will<00:02:44.560> then<00:02:44.769> add<00:02:45.010> up<00:02:45.400> in<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.819> peace<00:02:46.090> offer

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
that will then add up in the peace offer

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.800 
that will then add up in the peace offer
value<00:02:47.139> so<00:02:48.040> looks<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:48.489> my<00:02:48.849> war<00:02:49.120> score<00:02:49.480> against

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
value so looks like my war score against

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.020 
value so looks like my war score against
them<00:02:49.959> as<00:02:50.109> seventy-four<00:02:50.530> percent<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:51.670> want<00:02:51.909> to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
them as seventy-four percent you want to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.119 
them as seventy-four percent you want to
have<00:02:52.389> the<00:02:52.629> peace<00:02:52.840> offering<00:02:53.409> within<00:02:53.769> that<00:02:53.920> kind

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
have the peace offering within that kind

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
let Portugal do its own thing and then

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.580 
let Portugal do its own thing and then
maybe<00:03:12.220> I'll<00:03:12.459> go<00:03:12.639> attack<00:03:12.970> Portugal<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:14.349> it

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
maybe I'll go attack Portugal so it

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.410 
maybe I'll go attack Portugal so it
works<00:03:15.010> out<00:03:15.220> where<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.579> can<00:03:15.700> kind<00:03:15.819> of<00:03:15.970> play<00:03:16.269> the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
works out where you can kind of play the

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.400 
works out where you can kind of play the
field<00:03:16.659> of<00:03:16.989> hey<00:03:17.889> like<00:03:18.190> high<00:03:18.609> one<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:20.290> know

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
field of hey like high one so you know

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.780 
field of hey like high one so you know
you're<00:03:20.650> not<00:03:20.739> going<00:03:20.829> to<00:03:20.949> be<00:03:21.040> allies<00:03:21.370> with<00:03:21.579> Great

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
you're not going to be allies with Great

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.339 
you're not going to be allies with Great
Britain<00:03:21.819> anymore<00:03:22.419> and<00:03:22.629> then<00:03:23.019> you<00:03:23.109> can<00:03:23.199> like

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
Britain anymore and then you can like

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.680 
Britain anymore and then you can like
just<00:03:23.590> work<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.579> into<00:03:24.790> your<00:03:24.970> advantage<00:03:25.419> or<00:03:25.629> I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
just work that into your advantage or I

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.270 
just work that into your advantage or I
guess<00:03:25.900> so<00:03:26.169> it's<00:03:26.349> it's<00:03:26.769> pretty<00:03:26.949> cool<00:03:27.069> i'm

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
guess so it's it's pretty cool i'm

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.860 
guess so it's it's pretty cool i'm
definitely<00:03:27.579> to<00:03:27.639> take<00:03:27.819> that<00:03:28.000> into<00:03:28.389> my<00:03:28.569> my

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
definitely to take that into my my
