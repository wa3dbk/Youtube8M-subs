00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 to make a Brazilian bracelet 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.950
 right you need the cotton threads of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.510
 colors and choose the silos 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.429
 number of colors you want 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.009
 before in your brasserie bracelets 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.830
 brazilians over via two sons plus the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.340
 bracelet will be was after each 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.359
 pilot 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.670
 cut out about a meter of the ale 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.490
 take each end and put the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.160
 together I decided to make some 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 bracelets with only five threads and 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.170
 girls a little shorter for them 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.329
 be more readable to the camera when 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.450
 the sludge is half time are made in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.450
 them 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:01:01.550
 then take a bone base or 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:05.030
 several and attach your bracelet a wall 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.420
 to your jeans to a sandal to what you 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.400
 find that your under your name 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.240
 this will be used to hold the bracelet 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.190
 in place then it must be done 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:23.110
 Press reiterated price target also 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.110
 possible over and it's almost normal 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.320
 every time we take a side we 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.840
 spend two hours in front and we pick up 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.689
 the other side and we pass it in front of a 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.340
 other side and we pass it in front and 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.920
 the other side and passwords in front and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.399
 we alternate like that until we have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.319
 a braid of about 3 centimeters when 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.319
 this race is over it's all the better 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.489
 we do not fall is like at the beginning and you 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:18.849
 put it down your stress and you 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:21.910
 tighten shape once between not 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.980
 finishes his scene with the colors in order 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.440
 that is to say here I will have red 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.519
 first then purple then blue 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.150
 dark then light blue and then glass 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.880
 take the color that will be the color 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.790
 who will be at the top so the red in the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.730
 right hand and the other in English so 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:48.450
 first of all purple you are going to do 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:52.329
 a triangle has passed below then 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:56.739
 pulled as hard as possible and likewise 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.630
 always two irons a triangle with the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.190
 red always in the right hand and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.610
 pulled as hard as possible 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.920
 this is called the right you go 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.480
 then switch to the second color on 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.069
 blue trial of the same makes a triangle 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.370
 spent the red below that 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.420
 look like this and you're going to pull the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.549
 as much as possible 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.670
 sometimes they weave the corner we will 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.950
 just have to shoot on it and one more 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.420
 time you will do it a second time 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.650
 then move on to the third color 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:36.090
 and always the same 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.090
 sarah then can a second 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.750
 and finally the last color that is 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.750
 always the same 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.780
 I 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.460
 and here's oh of course she's proud and of 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.410
 blow the red is in last 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.420
 position and we have the rape is in 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.970
 first position that will come 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.950
 realize the second line you have to do 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.200
 similarly so at the beginning the brewing does not 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.880
 will not look like much but that 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.510
 will eventually come when the sons will be 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.510
 well positioned 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:32.599
 and that so on always 2 never ju 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.370
 this case the hunger until the 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.250
 bracelet reach the length of your 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.469
 wrist by counting a hunt in more 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.110
 same identical on the other side in order to 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:44.270
 do the knot is so here after I 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.099
 will go on with dark blue plus 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.530
 the light blue if the green is again 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.729
 the pattern will be repeated with the rose and the 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:55.729
 purple when your arm c is finished 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.650
 it's a press like at the beginning of 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:01.909
 the year length so that the brown sleeps 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.479
 hold around your wrist the same 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.580
 that at the beginning 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:15.069
 when you had finished is a node 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:17.719
 simple tight and cut the threads 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.490
 your Brazilian bracelet is finished 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:23.529
