character<00:06:21.360> along<00:06:21.540> with<00:06:21.660> piccolo<00:06:22.020> when<00:06:22.169> I<00:06:22.230> was

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
character along with piccolo when I was

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.110 
character along with piccolo when I was
younger<00:06:22.530> I<00:06:22.800> think<00:06:23.280> I<00:06:23.460> just<00:06:23.640> admired<00:06:23.940> his

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
younger I think I just admired his

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.550 
younger I think I just admired his
badass<00:06:24.330> attitude<00:06:24.750> and<00:06:25.110> his<00:06:25.230> unflinching

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 
badass attitude and his unflinching

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.740 
badass attitude and his unflinching
desire<00:06:25.980> to<00:06:26.130> get<00:06:26.250> what<00:06:26.430> he<00:06:26.490> wanted<00:06:26.760> also<00:06:27.480> I

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:27.750 
desire to get what he wanted also I

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.180 
desire to get what he wanted also I
think<00:06:27.870> that<00:06:28.050> his<00:06:28.200> development<00:06:28.650> might<00:06:28.830> be<00:06:29.100> the

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
think that his development might be the

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.130 
think that his development might be the
most<00:06:29.310> prominent<00:06:29.730> in<00:06:29.880> DBZ<00:06:30.240> at<00:06:30.660> least<00:06:30.900> on<00:06:31.050> the

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
most prominent in DBZ at least on the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.409 
most prominent in DBZ at least on the
surface<00:06:31.530> he<00:06:32.340> was<00:06:32.460> rather<00:06:32.669> complex<00:06:33.210> and

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
surface he was rather complex and

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.480 
surface he was rather complex and
compelling<00:06:33.840> character<00:06:34.230> perhaps<00:06:34.710> made<00:06:35.220> mostly

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
compelling character perhaps made mostly

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.630 
compelling character perhaps made mostly
interesting<00:06:36.000> by<00:06:36.180> his<00:06:36.300> flaws<00:06:37.400> which<00:06:38.400> can<00:06:38.550> be

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
interesting by his flaws which can be

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.370 
interesting by his flaws which can be
true<00:06:38.760> in<00:06:38.880> even<00:06:39.090> real<00:06:39.240> life<00:06:39.419> terms

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
true in even real life terms

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.170 
true in even real life terms
as<00:06:40.560> I've<00:06:40.920> gotten<00:06:41.040> older<00:06:41.430> I<00:06:41.550> don't<00:06:41.580> like<00:06:41.820> 4G<00:06:42.090> too

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
as I've gotten older I don't like 4G too

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.550 
as I've gotten older I don't like 4G too
quite<00:06:42.510> as<00:06:42.630> much<00:06:42.780> as<00:06:42.900> the<00:06:42.990> other<00:06:43.140> characters

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
quite as much as the other characters

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.860 
quite as much as the other characters
but<00:06:43.920> I<00:06:44.010> still<00:06:44.190> love<00:06:44.340> him<00:06:44.430> he<00:06:45.300> started<00:06:45.570> off<00:06:45.690> as<00:06:45.720> a

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870 
but I still love him he started off as a

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.540 
but I still love him he started off as a
ruthless<00:06:46.230> villain<00:06:46.560> evolved<00:06:47.340> into<00:06:47.490> a

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
ruthless villain evolved into a

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.610 
ruthless villain evolved into a
conflicted<00:06:48.150> antihero<00:06:48.660> and<00:06:48.840> eventually

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
conflicted antihero and eventually

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.310 
conflicted antihero and eventually
became<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:49.860> tragic<00:06:50.340> hero<00:06:50.460> in<00:06:50.670> the<00:06:50.760> end<00:06:51.320> well

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
became a tragic hero in the end well
