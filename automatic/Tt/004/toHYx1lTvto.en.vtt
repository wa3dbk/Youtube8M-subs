00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
meantime I did pick up another role that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990 
meantime I did pick up another role that
reflectix<00:01:01.800> insulation<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:02.520> used<00:01:02.699> for

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
reflectix insulation that we used for

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.520 
reflectix insulation that we used for
the<00:01:03.180> buckets<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> I'm<00:01:03.930> gonna<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.260> ahead<00:01:04.320> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the buckets and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
the buckets and I'm gonna go ahead and
staple<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> canvas<00:01:05.909> instead<00:01:06.210> of

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
staple this to the canvas instead of

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.020 
staple this to the canvas instead of
trying<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.830> he<00:01:07.950> said<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.400> lawyer<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
trying to and he said be my lawyer to

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.910 
trying to and he said be my lawyer to
the<00:01:09.119> canvas<00:01:09.450> cloth<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.020> hopefully<00:01:10.770> that'll

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the canvas cloth so hopefully that'll

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.690 
the canvas cloth so hopefully that'll
work<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:12.650> as<00:01:13.650> far<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.860> Tomatoes

promised to raise the water temperature
by<00:01:58.710> five<00:01:58.740> degrees<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.420> not<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.689> that

by five degrees and if it is not do that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.550 
by five degrees and if it is not do that
but<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.259> not<00:02:01.320> sure<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.710> did<00:02:01.890> anything<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.899> the

but I'm not sure it did anything the the
bucket<00:02:04.829> missing<00:02:05.159> here<00:02:05.369> has<00:02:05.460> been

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
bucket missing here has been

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.880 
bucket missing here has been
transplanted<00:02:06.030> outside<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.469> showed

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
transplanted outside because it showed

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.700 
transplanted outside because it showed
no<00:02:08.129> and

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
no and

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.100 
no and
he<00:02:08.860> went<00:02:09.010> so<00:02:09.160> ever<00:02:09.370> after<00:02:09.700> all<00:02:09.850> this<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:10.960> that's

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
he went so ever after all this so that's

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.820 
he went so ever after all this so that's
where<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.380> Peter<00:02:12.100> came<00:02:12.340> from<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:13.660> also<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:16.830> have

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
where that Peter came from I also I have

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.920 
where that Peter came from I also I have
fans<00:02:18.100> installed<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.760> both<00:02:19.090> corners<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
fans installed in both corners of the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.560 
fans installed in both corners of the
euro<00:02:20.110> area<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:20.650> had<00:02:20.770> read<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.570> pollination

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
euro area I had read that pollination

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.360 
euro area I had read that pollination
might<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.900> in<00:02:23.050> issue<00:02:23.230> with<00:02:23.500> with<00:02:23.740> blossom<00:02:24.160> drop

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
might be in issue with with blossom drop

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.640 
might be in issue with with blossom drop
so<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.910> went<00:02:25.510> about<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.930> three<00:02:26.110> ways<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
so I went about that in three ways the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.070 
so I went about that in three ways the
fan<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.130> too<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.520> addition<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.270> airflow

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
fan is too in addition to just airflow

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.500 
fan is too in addition to just airflow
it<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.350> always<00:02:29.590> good<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.180> make<00:02:31.180> sure<00:02:31.210> that<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
it is always good to make sure that the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.150 
it is always good to make sure that the
flowers<00:02:31.810> are<00:02:32.080> getting<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.590> movement<00:02:33.100> and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
flowers are getting the movement and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160 
flowers are getting the movement and
vibration<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.850> they<00:02:33.970> need<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.540> sell<00:02:34.720> colony

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
vibration that they need to sell colony

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.430 
vibration that they need to sell colony
and<00:02:35.890> also<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:36.820> picked<00:02:37.570> up<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.870> bottle<00:02:38.050> of

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
and also I picked up this bottle of

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.890 
and also I picked up this bottle of
tomato<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.280> blossom<00:02:39.640> set<00:02:39.940> spray<00:02:40.300> which

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
tomato and blossom set spray which

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.330 
tomato and blossom set spray which
supposedly<00:02:41.410> just<00:02:41.740> spread<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.070> on<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
supposedly just spread this on the

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.410 
supposedly just spread this on the
flowers<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:43.390> magically<00:02:43.960> set<00:02:44.380> free<00:02:44.650> I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
flowers and they magically set free I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.940 
flowers and they magically set free I
was<00:02:46.420> dubious<00:02:46.630> at<00:02:47.140> first<00:02:47.440> but<00:02:47.620> if<00:02:47.740> I<00:02:47.800> had<00:02:47.890> to

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
was dubious at first but if I had to

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.170 
was dubious at first but if I had to
take<00:02:48.160> one<00:02:48.580> thing<00:02:48.820> that's<00:02:49.030> been<00:02:49.150> most

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
take one thing that's been most

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.440 
take one thing that's been most
efficacious<00:02:49.600> in<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.740> setting<00:02:51.070> fruit<00:02:51.450> it's

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
efficacious in in setting fruit it's

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.970 
efficacious in in setting fruit it's
been<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.320> I'm<00:02:53.500> going<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.710> keep<00:02:53.800> using

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
been this so I'm going to keep using

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.520 
been this so I'm going to keep using
this<00:02:54.220> spray<00:02:54.550> and<00:02:54.820> I<00:02:55.720> might<00:02:55.990> suggest<00:02:56.170> that<00:02:56.410> you

try to and the third thing that read
about<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.070> regards<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.640> blossom<00:03:00.940> top

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
and some minnows are growing and that's

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.320

nice<00:04:38.260> I<00:04:38.560> still<00:04:39.280> have<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.639> blossom<00:04:40.180> drop

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
nice I still have the the blossom drop

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.300 
nice I still have the the blossom drop
issue<00:04:40.630> though<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:40.870> mean<00:04:41.080> for<00:04:41.260> every<00:04:41.470> fruit<00:04:42.190> that

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
issue though I mean for every fruit that

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.189 
issue though I mean for every fruit that
does<00:04:42.460> actually<00:04:42.699> set<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.360> probably<00:04:43.810> have<00:04:44.050> at

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
does actually set I probably have at

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.189 
does actually set I probably have at
least<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.470> couple<00:04:44.680> flowers<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:45.550> drop<00:04:45.789> dead

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
least a couple flowers I just drop dead

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.689 
least a couple flowers I just drop dead
so<00:04:47.199> I'm<00:04:47.260> still<00:04:47.470> struggling<00:04:47.710> with<00:04:47.889> that<00:04:48.039> and<00:04:48.250> in

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:48.699 
so I'm still struggling with that and in

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.180 
so I'm still struggling with that and in
addition<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.560> know<00:04:50.560> for<00:04:50.710> every<00:04:50.889> fruit<00:04:51.070> that

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
addition you know for every fruit that

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.760 
addition you know for every fruit that
does<00:04:51.370> actually<00:04:51.610> end<00:04:52.030> up<00:04:52.150> sitting<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.770> don't

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
does actually end up sitting I don't

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.490 
does actually end up sitting I don't
know<00:04:53.830> I'd<00:04:53.979> say<00:04:54.190> maybe<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.760> third<00:04:55.630> or<00:04:55.750> fourth<00:04:55.900> of

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
know I'd say maybe a third or fourth of

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.490 
know I'd say maybe a third or fourth of
the<00:04:56.650> tomatoes<00:04:57.039> interseting<00:04:57.430> end<00:04:57.850> up<00:04:58.500> with

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the tomatoes interseting end up with

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.800 
the tomatoes interseting end up with
this<00:04:59.620> issue<00:04:59.830> with<00:05:00.550> running<00:05:01.360> out<00:05:01.510> at<00:05:01.690> the

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
this issue with running out at the

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.990 
this issue with running out at the
bottom<00:05:01.960> and<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.889> a<00:05:02.979> term<00:05:03.190> for<00:05:03.370> that<00:05:03.400> that's<00:05:03.850> not

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
bottom and is a term for that that's not

coming<00:05:04.270> to<00:05:04.479> me<00:05:04.600> at<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.780> moment<00:05:05.110> but<00:05:05.289> that's

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
coming to me at the moment but that's

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.830 
coming to me at the moment but that's
probably<00:05:06.430> affecting<00:05:07.000> about<00:05:07.389> a<00:05:07.419> quarter<00:05:07.810> of

growing wonderfully in fact the only

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.140 
growing wonderfully in fact the only
problem<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:26.950> having<00:05:27.099> is<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.639> I<00:05:27.669> fail<00:05:28.030> to

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
problem is having is that I fail to

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.879 
problem is having is that I fail to
think<00:05:28.330> about<00:05:28.539> supports<00:05:29.020> for<00:05:29.260> it<00:05:29.410> it's<00:05:29.650> growing

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
think about supports for it it's growing

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.629 
think about supports for it it's growing
too<00:05:30.160> well<00:05:30.340> and<00:05:30.580> it's<00:05:31.000> too<00:05:31.750> heavy<00:05:31.900> for<00:05:32.050> itself

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
too well and it's too heavy for itself

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.550 
too well and it's too heavy for itself
but<00:05:33.639> that<00:05:33.760> aside<00:05:34.060> so<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.960> only<00:05:35.380> key

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
but that aside so the only key

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.560 
but that aside so the only key
differences<00:05:36.039> between<00:05:36.099> these<00:05:36.700> two<00:05:36.849> systems<00:05:37.090> is

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
differences between these two systems is

differences between these two systems is
the<00:05:37.990> lights<00:05:38.289> and<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.560> feed<00:05:38.740> program<00:05:38.979> so<00:05:39.880> here
