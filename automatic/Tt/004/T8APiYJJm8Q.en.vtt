pattern design onto your glass you can
cut<00:00:08.550> your<00:00:08.760> pattern<00:00:08.940> out<00:00:09.240> if<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.510> don't<00:00:09.780> have<00:00:10.019> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
and I'm gonna go ahead and cut out you

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.820 
and I'm gonna go ahead and cut out you
notice<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.539> two<00:00:21.570> copies<00:00:22.260> I've<00:00:22.470> got<00:00:22.650> this

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
notice you have two copies I've got this

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.740 
notice you have two copies I've got this
copy<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> mean<00:00:23.550> cutting<00:00:23.910> from<00:00:24.090> I've<00:00:24.600> got

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
copy that I mean cutting from I've got

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.269 
copy that I mean cutting from I've got
another<00:00:24.990> copy<00:00:25.260> down<00:00:25.560> here<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.949> I'm<00:00:26.039> laying

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
another copy down here that I'm laying

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.710 
another copy down here that I'm laying
my<00:00:26.369> pattern<00:00:26.910> out<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.420> I'll<00:00:27.539> be

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
my pattern out on that I'll be

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.720 
my pattern out on that I'll be
assembling<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:29.250> sure<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.550> always

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
assembling on so make sure you always

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.120 
assembling on so make sure you always
have<00:00:30.060> two<00:00:30.300> copies<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.529> I'm<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.740> gonna<00:00:31.890> finish

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
have two copies so I'm just gonna finish

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.190 
have two copies so I'm just gonna finish
cutting<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.730> piece<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.329> I'm<00:00:33.989> gonna<00:00:34.110> be

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
cutting this piece out I'm gonna be

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.470 
cutting this piece out I'm gonna be
cutting<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:37.579> center<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.940> line<00:00:39.180> if

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
cutting it in the center of the line if

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.400 
cutting it in the center of the line if
I<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:44.270> again<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.480> careful<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> cut<00:00:46.260> your

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
I can again be careful not to cut your

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.979 
I can again be careful not to cut your
other<00:00:46.590> pieces<00:00:46.950> wrong<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:48.420> all<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.870> are

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
other pieces wrong because all these are

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.880 
other pieces wrong because all these are
gonna<00:00:49.079> fit<00:00:49.200> together<00:00:49.770> pretty<00:00:50.309> nice<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.000> close

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
gonna fit together pretty nice and close

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.610 
gonna fit together pretty nice and close
boiling<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> lot<00:00:53.370> closer

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
boiling is a lot closer

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.110 
boiling is a lot closer
piecing<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:56.070> led<00:00:56.399> there's<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.760> little<00:00:57.000> bit

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
piecing then led there's a little bit

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
piecing then led there's a little bit
more<00:00:57.420> allowance<00:00:57.930> than<00:00:58.199> lead<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.739> there's

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
more allowance than lead but there's

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.860 
more allowance than lead but there's
also<00:00:59.070> different<00:00:59.609> method<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.329> cutting<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.750> out

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
also different method for cutting it out

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.170 
also different method for cutting it out
of<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.140> pattern<00:01:01.559> I'll<00:01:01.739> explain<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.609> at

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
of your pattern I'll explain that it at

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:22.789 
of your pattern I'll explain that it at
another<00:01:03.449> time<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:22.110> I've<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.409> that

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
another time so there I've got that

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.310 
another time so there I've got that
piece<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.490> butterfly<00:01:23.759> wing<00:01:24.330> cut<00:01:24.689> out<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
piece of my butterfly wing cut out and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.020 
piece of my butterfly wing cut out and
what<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.220> want<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.580> do<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:27.060> I'm<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> choose

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
what I want to do is I'm going to choose

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.719 
what I want to do is I'm going to choose
which<00:01:30.030> type<00:01:30.450> or<00:01:31.049> color<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.650> glass<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.340> want<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
which type or color of glass I want to

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.569 
which type or color of glass I want to
use<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> insides<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.560> outsides<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.430> my

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
use for the insides and outsides of my

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.880 
use for the insides and outsides of my
wing<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.979> green<00:01:39.680> is<00:01:40.680> in

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
wing and I think it's the green is in

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.800 
wing and I think it's the green is in
the<00:01:41.009> center<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:43.159> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.250> use<00:01:44.430> probably<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the center I want to use probably the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
the center I want to use probably the
purples<00:01:46.619> because<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:47.759> gonna<00:01:47.880> allow<00:01:48.210> for

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
purples because it's gonna allow for

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.920 
purples because it's gonna allow for
more<00:01:48.750> light<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.350> come<00:01:49.560> through<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.659> I'm<00:01:51.659> gonna

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
more light to come through so I'm gonna

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.679 
more light to come through so I'm gonna
choose<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> purple<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.369> inside<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.450> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
choose a purple for the inside and the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.719 
choose a purple for the inside and the
yellows<00:01:55.079> or<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.409> oranges<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> outside

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
yellows or the oranges for the outside

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
yellows or the oranges for the outside
of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> butterfly<00:01:57.509> wings<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.680> grab<00:01:58.890> my

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.459 
of the butterfly wings I'm gonna grab my
purple<00:01:59.490> glass<00:02:02.869> since<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.049> doesn't<00:02:04.320> have<00:02:04.439> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
purple glass since it doesn't have a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.899 
purple glass since it doesn't have a
pattern<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> glass<00:02:05.310> there's<00:02:05.759> no

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
pattern in the glass there's no

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.029 
pattern in the glass there's no
particular<00:02:06.479> place<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.409> really<00:02:07.890> need<00:02:08.009> to
