00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:14.309
 we will see here how to configure the sizing in the high cadin according to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.650
 with the technical standard date limit 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.380
 in the technical drawing it is not enough just to define the geometry of the part 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.780
 you must specify its dimensions 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.780
 to make it possible 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.800
 the first item that we will configure aquino the cade 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.510
 is the unit of measure used in the project 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 For this, let's go 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 since the command is here 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.380
 and the grandchildren 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.559
 sets up 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.530
 confirm with inter 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.070
 a dialog box 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.420
 is displayed 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.210
 in her we will configure the type of unit that will be of that evil 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.180
 since we are using the millimeter unit 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.050
 and the accuracy of this measure 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.060
 in case here I can leave mature 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.130
 and there goes I'll leave two houses to peace 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.140
 comma in the decimal 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.789
 us angolans 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.360
 the position of the cpc 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.720
 dawson minutes of the second I translate radiating assis 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.700
 I will keep the 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.000
 degree of this evil 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.050
 or even on top does not use the elite grain second that these two 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.180
 shapes are the most used 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.560
 I'll keep it then. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.010
 decimal binary 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.070
 here i too 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.760
 I verify 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.560
 the accuracy of this angle 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.290
 I'll use the same 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.420
 precision 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.210
 of the 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.310
 length in the river to erse conference 500 hunts 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.530
 here is the modified angola way this angle will be 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.630
 themis called clockwise or counterclockwise 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.070
 here by default before the area 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.430
 to use the direction the area is a milestone in the shots 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.089
 already for the blocks 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:13.399
 I'm going to define 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.609
 which drive I'm going to use 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.859
 tell the blocks here 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:19.969
 in case 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.860
 I'll keep millimeters 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 which is what I am using in the project 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.369
 here I have a preview 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.540
 the form 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.389
 how the entries will be made 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.429
 or note how dimensions will be displayed 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:37.769
 done that 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.449
 I confirm that you have here 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:44.459
 now that I already have unit of measurement that I will use 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.829
 in my configured project 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.199
 I will configure the dimensions the way they will be 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:52.949
 inserted properly 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.129
 and for this I will use the standard of the cabin to have 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:02.110
 I'm going to here, I did not write anything down and clicked the team on Friday 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.319
 inside 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.900
 give the box of 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.490
 never name here the panel in question of dimensions 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.519
 a dialog fee will be opened where I will start the setup 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.459
 of my sizing style 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.639
 so I'm going to create here new year here 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.410
 not to modify the basket patterns 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.970
 existing in the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.019
 I will start from the base style and this 25 since all the technical norms 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.400
 are derived from this rule here click nest 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.109
 I define the name here. 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.409
 I'll continue 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.610
 now that is the beginning to configure 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.829
 mine 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.719
 dimension, I'll go here 

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:53.129
 the spacing give baseline that baseline in that line here 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.059
 where the dimension itself goes 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.299
 the spacing between the drawings 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.539
 and that baseline should be 7 millimeters so I'm training 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:07.049
 the dimension 7 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.390
 why in the final dimension of it will be 10 millimeters in length 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.069
 to be there right? 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.590
 of call 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.180
 then I go 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.249
 set here 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:24.740
 the extension of the basic line of three by the end I have 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.110
 the spacing between call lines and the part that must be repeated 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.250
 that I will inform in this field here 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.729
 done that I confirm with alckmin and pasted 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.219
 now let's create a blog style that will only be used for the 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.390
 cruzeirense henrique 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.850
 the representation in half quartet as we saw in the previous module 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.890
 so I will again click here 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.259
 on taxing right here 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.690
 in the dialog that opens I will use as base the abnt norm and that 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:02.389
 I configured earlier 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.169
 and me neither 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.169
 I will define the name here in the middle the cut 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:10.909
 to confirm continue 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.909
 here I'm going to change produce things 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:15.680
 I'll 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.629
 talk here that I'm going to delete 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.050
 the line 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.999
 says Amadeu 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.509
 a part of it and also the extension line 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.229
 For this I will go 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.870
 Selected from miami 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.139
 extra online 1 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.009
 and see that I've received it here, I think they 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.169
 dimensions they have the goal of representing the other half not 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.270
 exist 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.620
 that this is what is needed to represent the quarters in the projects that 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.409
 are represented in half-cut 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:55.179
 In addition, I can also either in the previous configuration or in this 

00:05:55.179 --> 00:06:01.300
 configure the text by clicking the texas tab and modifying the text style 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.490
 used 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.240
 text size 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.129
 more information about the settings 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.899
 you find in the other courses of auto cad by the donkey cad 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:14.589
 then with these settings made here 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.929
 then it must have been like nothing lines here to represent the half part 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.029
 I confirm over time 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.569
 and see that you already have here the style half apart and abnt 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.300
 existing here already configured 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.830
 then click and everyone 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.800
 to select the style sheet select in this check box here 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.639
 where clicking on it I can select abnt 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.379
 or half cut 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.819
 to later make art 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:46.839
 coulthard sizing 

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:48.400
 of my project 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.400
 and so in this class concludes our configuration 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.649
 of dimensioning and gives unit of measurement used by auto cad 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:06:59.930
 according to the new date a bntm
