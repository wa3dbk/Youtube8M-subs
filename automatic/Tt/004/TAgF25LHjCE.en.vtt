00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.330 

the<00:00:05.520> Kami<00:00:05.759> car<00:00:06.029> competition<00:00:06.770> started<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:08.010> think

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
the Kami car competition started I think

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.080 
the Kami car competition started I think
13<00:00:09.179> years<00:00:09.420> ago<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.880> competition<00:00:11.880> where

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
13 years ago this is a competition where

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.749 
13 years ago this is a competition where
we<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.019> regional<00:00:13.309> competitions<00:00:14.309> for

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
we have regional competitions for

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.939 
we have regional competitions for
students<00:00:15.179> before<00:00:15.599> they<00:00:15.929> actually<00:00:16.260> get<00:00:16.560> here

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
students before they actually get here

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.510 
students before they actually get here
and<00:00:17.570> the<00:00:18.570> idea<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.140> they<00:00:19.800> have<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.250> build

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
and the idea is that they have to build

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.779 
and the idea is that they have to build
a<00:00:20.760> car<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.660> runs<00:00:21.960> based<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:23.010> some<00:00:23.310> kind<00:00:23.670> of

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
a car that runs based on some kind of

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.920 
a car that runs based on some kind of
chemical<00:00:24.240> reaction<00:00:25.189> they<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.580> told<00:00:26.970> how

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
chemical reaction they are not told how

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
chemical reaction they are not told how
far<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.500> car<00:00:28.680> has<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.279> because<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.699> has<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
far the car has to go because it has to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.420 
far the car has to go because it has to
start<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.720> has<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.050> stop<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.890> they're

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
start and it has to stop and they're

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.150 
start and it has to stop and they're
also<00:00:32.579> not<00:00:32.820> told<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.630> weight<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> car<00:00:34.469> both

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
also not told the weight of the car both

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.889 
also not told the weight of the car both
of<00:00:35.399> these<00:00:35.579> measurements<00:00:36.120> are<00:00:36.390> given<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.780> them

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
of these measurements are given to them

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.860 
of these measurements are given to them
one<00:00:37.170> hour<00:00:37.469> before<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.219> competition<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.750> they

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
one hour before the competition so they

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.090 
one hour before the competition so they
have<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.350> hour<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.980> the

primarily professionals and R&amp;D but the

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.700 
primarily professionals and R&amp;D but the
weekend<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.570> for<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.840> students<00:01:17.380> and<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
weekend is for the students and the

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.250 
weekend is for the students and the
hands-on<00:01:18.190> part<00:01:18.520> is<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.180> best<00:01:19.360> part<00:01:19.540> it<00:01:19.930> really

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
hands-on part is the best part it really

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.900 
hands-on part is the best part it really
gives<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.620> students<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:21.250> wonderful

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
gives the students this wonderful

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.060 
gives the students this wonderful
feeling

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
feeling

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
feeling
taking<00:01:24.070> what<00:01:24.220> they've<00:01:24.400> learned<00:01:24.700> as

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
taking what they've learned as

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.240 
taking what they've learned as
undergraduates<00:01:25.660> and<00:01:26.260> putting<00:01:27.010> it<00:01:27.130> to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
undergraduates and putting it to

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.440 
undergraduates and putting it to
practical<00:01:27.670> use

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
practical use

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.200 
practical use
I<00:01:28.480> mean<00:01:29.410> they've<00:01:29.560> competed<00:01:29.950> at<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.520> regional

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
I mean they've competed at the regional

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.380 
I mean they've competed at the regional
area<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.920> now<00:01:33.100> this<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.490> culmination<00:01:34.120> the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
area so now this is the culmination the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.330 
area so now this is the culmination the
winners<00:01:34.750> meeting<00:01:35.229> the<00:01:35.350> winners<00:01:35.680> there's<00:01:36.130> that

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
winners meeting the winners there's that

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.730 
winners meeting the winners there's that
excitement<00:01:36.729> and<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.630> football<00:01:37.930> games<00:01:38.380> sort

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
excitement and it's football games sort

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.580 
excitement and it's football games sort
of<00:01:38.860> thing<00:01:39.070> basketball<00:01:39.970> game<00:01:40.270> with<00:01:41.200> not<00:01:41.410> so

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
of thing basketball game with not so

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.140 
of thing basketball game with not so
much<00:01:41.770> rivalries<00:01:42.340> because<00:01:42.640> you're<00:01:42.790> sort<00:01:43.090> of

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
much rivalries because you're sort of

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.880 
much rivalries because you're sort of
competing<00:01:43.540> against<00:01:43.930> their<00:01:44.140> absolute<00:01:49.890> what

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
competing against their absolute what

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.219 
competing against their absolute what
chemical<00:01:51.640> engineering<00:01:52.090> is<00:01:52.390> really<00:01:52.630> what<00:01:53.080> is

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
chemical engineering is really what is

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.400 
chemical engineering is really what is
used<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:54.280> make<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:55.060> chemical<00:01:55.270> reactions<00:01:56.020> in<00:01:56.290> a

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
used to make the chemical reactions in a

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.200 
used to make the chemical reactions in a
practical<00:01:57.009> setting<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.550> they<00:01:57.670> are<00:01:57.729> taking

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
practical setting so they are taking

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.140 
practical setting so they are taking
they<00:01:58.690> seaweed

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
they seaweed

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.900 
they seaweed
and<00:02:00.600> they're<00:02:00.690> applying<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.760> engineering<00:02:02.760> is

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
and they're applying and engineering is

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.180 
and they're applying and engineering is
the<00:02:02.940> application<00:02:03.120> of<00:02:03.750> chemistry<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.890> make<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
the application of chemistry to make a

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.580 
the application of chemistry to make a
product<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.660> case<00:02:06.930> they're<00:02:07.200> making<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
product in this case they're making a

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.900 
product in this case they're making a
product<00:02:07.890> which<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.670> vehicle<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.720> moves<00:02:10.170> on

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
product which is a vehicle that moves on

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.300 
product which is a vehicle that moves on
strictly<00:02:11.910> chemical<00:02:12.630> reaction<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.920> Chemical

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
strictly chemical reaction so Chemical

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.830 
strictly chemical reaction so Chemical
Engineering<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> basis<00:02:15.360> for<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:15.630> whole

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
Engineering is the basis for this whole

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.470 
Engineering is the basis for this whole
competition<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> other<00:02:17.850> thing<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.420> that

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
competition but the other thing is that
