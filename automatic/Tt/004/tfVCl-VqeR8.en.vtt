00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:02.540
 dedicated to star wars jedi thousand 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.690
 na and I thank you for watching my video 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.680
 I am 100% yuyu accused and today I come with another chapter of analyzing games 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.729
 rare 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:15.169
 as you will see the game that touches us today is sony that r and many will tell me with that 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.349
 what sonic r is very well known 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.390
 but if you remember at the beginning of the saga I said that I was going to talk about games 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.199
 that are not so well known or that stood out for something weird that made them 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.419
 famous 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:27.880
 as you will see in the title 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.849
 we will also talk about the legend mierd was details dolls 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.240
 which by the way I do not believe 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.250
 but all that for later 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.200
 first of all this game recommended me to analyze it my friend star 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.410
 wars jedi thousand and as I say always I would never refuse the help of others 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.050
 well first of all the game just started to play so if I'm wrong 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.350
 in something I ask you a thousand apologies 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.200
 although the tournament details I already know about laundry since in a friend's house 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.550
 we play it and unlock atalis doll 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.780
 and tata tata an 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.030
 I'm still alive and pajillero xd 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.390
 well let's start with the analysis 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.050
 the first thing to analyze is the story 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.250
 sony titanium were taking a break from so many adventures they had 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.550
 lived together 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.660
 so 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.460
 suddenly 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.150
 thais sees a billboard advertising a championship 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.100
 speed 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.310
 sony is not very interested 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.280
 until he sees that the robotnik doctor is targeted 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.110
 the doctor tells sonic that he knows the location of the chaos emeralds 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.370
 Quique also wants to win them in the championship 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.840
 sony does not think so 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.730
 is aimed at the tournament along with so many 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.670
 Lucrecia nor received the news 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.610
 the first one decided to join the tournament to prove to sonic who is 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.030
 the best 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.040
 on the other hand 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.799
 wants to secretly help sony to find the emeralds of chaos 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 they see it seems that the story is interesting 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.310
 now what he touches are the characters 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.759
 first of all the characters like they are missing something because they are with 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.140
 Geometric figures even in the eyes and the most noticeable is in loops 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.310
 because it looks like it has a triangle like tail xd 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.610
 but good 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.819
 what I do know are the levels 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.469
 this was what I liked most about the game 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.900
 because having so many shortcuts does not make you more entertained 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.619
 I absolutely liked all the levels 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:23.229
 although the last one was called if I remember correctly radial only lic 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.929
 I had so many colors that I burned my eyes fuck xd 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.519
 I also liked that they vary in climatic situations 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:34.929
 because it can rain can be day or night or it can be snowing in the 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:35.869
 game 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.209
 I liked that much more 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.159
 honestly the game is spectacular 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.629
 another thing that I liked is that the game weighs little xddddd 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.519
 good the last thing is music 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.329
 the game has good music 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.400
 I like the songs but it did not affect me in the least the canio 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.819
 fil of sunshine xddddd b 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.259
 good people arrive the most awaited part for all 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.659
 the part in which we cag will do in the legend details 12 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:05.069
 good first of all 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.939
 I did not even have to do this 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:10.900
 because my good friend super balances that he has given to ass the fucking legend and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.709
 I agree a lot with him 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.959
 but I could not resist and I wanted to show you my point of view on 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.150
 Legend of the poor innocent doll 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.180
 that more than a supposed murderer is nice xddddd 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:23.969
 let's accept it 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.679
 tahir this is already very cruel and xd 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:28.739
 well history says well 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.769
 in a very distant land from there in gringolandia there was a asshole that 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.879
 apart from services or was pedophile and zoophilic 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.610
 because he was obsessed with taking out a character called thanks to hell in the 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.680
 game sonic r it seems that the boy managed to unlock but after a while 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.639
 died 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.019
 well let's analyze this story 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.439
 first if the child died it was because of the excitement and he jumped on the bed and he hit 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.959
 with the chest and fell xd no lie 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.220
 sure it was because of the emotion or as I said I had a level called radial 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:03:58.599
 metal 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.719
 which abused the blue colors 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.120
 red green and so on and if I remember correctly 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.109
 he found it with foam in his mouth, how strange 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.769
 since in Japan some children were interned because in a chapter of 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.739
 pokÃ©mon also abused those colors and well they had the same as the 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:15.609
 boy 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.509
 so the case was for the radio level in emerald 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.519
 and they do not carry manager of fuck 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.409
 another thing 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.060
 if the thing had been like that then 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.420
 there had to be more cases registered which did not happen 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.180
 and finally if you are going to tell me with that doll tt 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.020
 that attacks the police in a cemetery 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.460
 as the team said devil may cry that has the word story everywhere 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.800
 well with this we have clear that such doll 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.960
 it's just a simple sonic character and nothing else 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.009
 Stop saying that he is a murderer because he is not the only one who is scary 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:51.279
 here is weegee xd 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:55.009
 I have been warned by the microphone that tanks where there is and is here 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.509
 to punish me 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:57.620
 uu aa 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.819
 please forgive me xd 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.860
 hahahaha area this is the real tandil stoll people streets where yes 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.919
 exists and is here xd 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.800
 Well I hope that with this I had helped many 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.169
 I also closed my mouth to many 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.400
 subscribe vote and comment that it does not cost a lot of people 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.959
 good says goodbye 100% yuyu accused the first goal there until the next 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:23.569
 postscript because all my friends have assistants and I do not 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.639
 I think one day I'll have an assistant xd 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.879
 good people get ahead
