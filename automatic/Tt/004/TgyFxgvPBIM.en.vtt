00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:07.549
 Fiction World Magazine Presents 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.990
 the world of fiction is with you 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.799
 today we will tell you what we liked 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.360
 and what is not in the cartoon city of heroes 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.790
 Disney has long acquired a studio 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.160
 marvel but the city of heroes is the first cartoon 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.849
 Mouse House by Marvel Comics 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.489
 rather based on very remote 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.059
 the motives of the little-known prickly big hero 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.489
 6 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:33.030
 to be honest just left him 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:36.120
 names of heroes and it does not upset us 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.240
 because disney have created their world yet 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.910
 more interesting writers came up 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.450
 fantastic city san francois where 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.900
 mixed cultures of the west and japan and 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.000
 new heroes 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.700
 prodigy hero hamad who 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.730
 conquers evil with the power of science and beymaks 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.760
 inflatable medical robot exactly 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 this paunch is the main star of the movie he's up 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.649
 madness cute funny and soft damn it 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.049
 really want to hug 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.329
 yes this is not a marvel universe but in spirit 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.270
 the city of heroes is very close to the movie about 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.850
 Marvel's superheroes hero is similar to 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.130
 tony stark in childhood beymaks dressed in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.850
 costume like an iron man and their 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.950
 comrades remind team avengers 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.929
 as in the best marvel films in 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.369
 the city of heroes is full of great jokes 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.569
 cultural references 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.700
 dashing flights and fights with villains and 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:35.459
 then secondary is the main weakness of the city 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.020
 there are too many recognizable heroes 

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:39.359
 scenes 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.270
 which we have already seen in the avengers alive 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.600
 became guardians of the galaxy and other 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.789
 fiction from marvel and disney 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.939
 plot twists predictable and guess 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.009
 who is the main villain is not difficult but 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.770
 let's not be snickering 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:01.649
 such little things a child cartoon can 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.779
 forgive is true which is especially nice for us 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.749
 lovers of fiction city ​​of heroes 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:09.420
 praises science film shows how 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.050
 baby botanists create robots flying 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.340
 costumes weapons 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.610
 directors were advised by serious 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.430
 scientists so beymax and other appliances 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.990
 look quite convincing after such 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.110
 movies kids dream of becoming 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.360
 scientists and designers it is so not 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.840
 missing current fiction for adults 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.770
 where new technologies are their creators often 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.390
 expose evil and dangerous up 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.170
 excellence and new robocop it now 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.170
 was about you 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.300
 disney lads removed fascinating and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.000
 funny cartoon created original 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.820
 and charming characters sense beymaks 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.650
 and we could grumble on banal 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.650
 plot but do not want to watch
