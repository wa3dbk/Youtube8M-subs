fortresses or something that's just an

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.220 
fortresses or something that's just an
example<00:00:38.280> but<00:00:38.699> as<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.000> see<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.420> seed<00:00:39.690> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
example but as you see this seed you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.660 
example but as you see this seed you
spawn<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.800> next<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.220> village<00:00:41.370> was

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
spawn right next to a village was

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.030 
spawn right next to a village was
definitely<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.630> great<00:00:43.050> location<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.800> spawn

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
definitely in a great location to spawn

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.319 
definitely in a great location to spawn
at<00:00:44.220> because<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.730> can<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.180> know<00:00:45.239> some

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
at because you can get you know some

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.870 
at because you can get you know some
food<00:00:45.630> off<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.780> bat<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.260> shelter<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.880> gather

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
food off the bat some shelter and gather

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.370 
food off the bat some shelter and gather
materials<00:00:48.329> if<00:00:48.450> you're<00:00:48.570> planning<00:00:48.809> survival<00:00:49.230> um

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
materials if you're planning survival um

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.709 
materials if you're planning survival um
but<00:00:50.130> if<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.340> head<00:00:50.579> straight<00:00:50.850> north<00:00:51.329> from

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
but if you head straight north from

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
but if you head straight north from
spawn<00:00:52.050> area<00:00:52.230> you'll<00:00:52.530> actually<00:00:52.710> run<00:00:53.070> into<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
spawn area you'll actually run into a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.150 
spawn area you'll actually run into a
pretty<00:00:53.640> cool<00:00:53.910> mushroom<00:00:54.450> biome<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.950> this<00:00:55.950> one

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
pretty cool mushroom biome and this one

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.209 
pretty cool mushroom biome and this one
is<00:00:56.340> relatively<00:00:56.850> large<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.129> islands<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is relatively large for the islands that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.670 
is relatively large for the islands that
you<00:00:59.340> see<00:00:59.610> I<00:00:59.850> mean<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.719> not<00:01:00.840> too<00:01:01.110> big<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.350> you

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
you see I mean it's not too big but you

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.170 
you see I mean it's not too big but you
know<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.640> know<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.000> said<00:01:03.149> for

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
know it you know like I said for

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.969 
know it you know like I said for
mushroom<00:01:03.690> biomes<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.289> see<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.710> it's

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
mushroom biomes that you see it's it's

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.430 
mushroom biomes that you see it's it's
pretty<00:01:05.190> big<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> um<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.350> it

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
pretty big for for that um and it

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.690 
pretty big for for that um and it
actually<00:01:07.470> has<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:07.950> pretty<00:01:08.070> unique<00:01:08.190> features

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
actually has some pretty unique features

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.889 
actually has some pretty unique features
under<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.149> surface<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.690> there's<00:01:09.810> this

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
under the surface of it there's this

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.609 
under the surface of it there's this
little<00:01:10.080> water<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.990> creek<00:01:12.990> type<00:01:13.200> thing<00:01:13.410> whatever

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
little water a creek type thing whatever

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
little water a creek type thing whatever
and<00:01:14.190> there's<00:01:14.340> another<00:01:14.429> one<00:01:14.759> if<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> dig<00:01:15.240> down

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
and there's another one if you dig down

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.540 
and there's another one if you dig down
and<00:01:15.780> then<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.410> just<00:01:16.619> kept<00:01:16.950> digging<00:01:17.100> straight

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
and then I just kept digging straight

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.980 
and then I just kept digging straight
down<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:17.910> this<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> actually<00:01:18.509> ran<00:01:18.750> into

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
down from this and I actually ran into

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.389 
down from this and I actually ran into
another<00:01:19.080> cave<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.860> cave<00:01:20.009> actually<00:01:20.130> goes

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
another cave and this cave actually goes

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.249 
another cave and this cave actually goes
on<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.640> quite<00:01:20.789> a<00:01:20.850> while<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.959> I<00:01:21.990> don't

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
on for quite a while and then I don't

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.570 
on for quite a while and then I don't
show<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.649> but<00:01:22.800> there's<00:01:23.009> actually<00:01:23.310> another

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
show it but there's actually another

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.550 
show it but there's actually another
cave<00:01:23.850> underneath<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.569> cave<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.170> has<00:01:25.349> some

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
cave underneath this cave which has some

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.930 
cave underneath this cave which has some
lava<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.039> so<00:01:26.099> is<00:01:26.160> definitely<00:01:26.429> pretty<00:01:26.520> cool<00:01:26.759> if

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
lava and so is definitely pretty cool if

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.790 
lava and so is definitely pretty cool if
you<00:01:27.060> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.330> build<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.750> house<00:01:27.899> plus<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.709> know

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
couple like two or three that this is

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.440 
couple like two or three that this is
the<00:03:08.640> one<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:08.760> spawning<00:03:09.060> but<00:03:09.210> there's<00:03:09.330> like

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the one you spawning but there's like

two or three that are actually grass but

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.060 
two or three that are actually grass but
everyone<00:03:12.570> else<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:13.670> mushroom<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:16.800> hint

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
everyone else is mushroom and the hint

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.190 
everyone else is mushroom and the hint
that<00:03:17.220> I<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.490> to<00:03:17.550> tell<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.730> guys<00:03:17.970> before

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
that I was going to tell you guys before

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.560 
that I was going to tell you guys before
was<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.790> works<00:03:21.060> better<00:03:21.330> in

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
was that and this works better in

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.120 
was that and this works better in
creative<00:03:21.960> mode<00:03:21.990> then<00:03:22.560> uh<00:03:24.200> then<00:03:25.200> survival<00:03:25.830> but

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
creative mode then uh then survival but

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.340 
creative mode then uh then survival but
you<00:03:26.400> can<00:03:26.550> actually<00:03:26.970> expand<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:28.020> mushroom

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
you can actually expand the mushroom

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.930 
you can actually expand the mushroom
biomes<00:03:28.650> now<00:03:28.800> I've<00:03:28.980> said<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.250> before<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.850> I

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
biomes now I've said this before and I

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.420 
biomes now I've said this before and I
think<00:03:30.120> another<00:03:30.300> seats<00:03:30.570> valid<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.250> can

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
think another seats valid but you can

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.290 
think another seats valid but you can
actually<00:03:32.910> add<00:03:33.090> dirt<00:03:33.570> on<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.530> are<00:03:35.370> two<00:03:35.940> next

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
actually add dirt on to a are two next

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.720 
actually add dirt on to a are two next
to<00:03:36.600> a<00:03:36.630> mycelium<00:03:37.410> block<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.400> it'll<00:03:38.580> actually

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
to a mycelium block and it'll actually

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.790 
to a mycelium block and it'll actually
spread<00:03:39.210> it's<00:03:39.360> like<00:03:39.480> grass<00:03:39.720> pretty<00:03:40.020> much<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:40.650> if

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
spread it's like grass pretty much so if

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.200 
spread it's like grass pretty much so if
you<00:03:40.890> just<00:03:41.010> keep<00:03:41.250> adding<00:03:41.430> dirt<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.910> can<00:03:42.060> make

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
you just keep adding dirt you can make

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.430 
you just keep adding dirt you can make
these<00:03:42.360> things<00:03:42.390> as<00:03:42.660> big<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.020> want<00:03:43.260> now

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440

you're<00:03:44.070> going<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.460> add<00:03:44.580> in<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:44.970> know

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
you're going to have to add in to know

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.460 
you're going to have to add in to know
some<00:03:45.300> hills<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.720> stuff<00:03:45.900> if<00:03:46.050> you<00:03:46.140> want<00:03:46.320> to<00:03:46.380> make

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
are maybe wondering about what to do if

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.830 
are maybe wondering about what to do if
they<00:04:47.470> do<00:04:47.530> choose<00:04:48.280> these<00:04:48.460> seeds<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:49.480> one<00:04:49.660> is

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
they do choose these seeds this one is

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.270 
they do choose these seeds this one is
actually<00:04:50.020> kind<00:04:50.380> of<00:04:50.440> weird<00:04:50.620> though<00:04:50.680> this<00:04:51.040> seed

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
actually kind of weird though this seed

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280 
actually kind of weird though this seed
and<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:52.450> reason<00:04:52.690> i<00:04:52.750> say<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:52.990> is<00:04:53.170> because

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
and the reason i say that is because

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.290 
and the reason i say that is because
there's<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.400> abandoned<00:04:54.550> iron<00:04:54.880> chef<00:04:55.090> that's

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
there's this abandoned iron chef that's

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.650 
there's this abandoned iron chef that's
cool<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:55.600> everything<00:04:55.780> but<00:04:55.960> if<00:04:56.680> we<00:04:56.830> go<00:04:57.010> up

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
cool and everything but if we go up

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.820 
cool and everything but if we go up
you'll<00:04:58.660> see<00:04:58.990> that<00:04:59.170> you<00:04:59.320> cannot<00:04:59.620> actually

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
you'll see that you cannot actually

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.040 
you'll see that you cannot actually
throw<00:05:00.310> an<00:05:00.490> eye<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.790> ender<00:05:01.090> and<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.780> kind<00:05:02.020> of

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
throw an eye of the ender and I kind of

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.420 
throw an eye of the ender and I kind of
confuse<00:05:02.470> it<00:05:02.590> so<00:05:02.710> we're<00:05:02.830> like<00:05:02.890> I<00:05:03.040> guess<00:05:03.220> there's

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
confuse it so we're like I guess there's

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.720 
confuse it so we're like I guess there's
no<00:05:03.610> stronghold<00:05:04.060> but<00:05:04.150> then<00:05:04.390> uh<00:05:04.740> beast<00:05:05.740> whatever

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
no stronghold but then uh beast whatever

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.370 
no stronghold but then uh beast whatever
