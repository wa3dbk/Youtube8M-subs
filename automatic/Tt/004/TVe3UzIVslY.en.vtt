do this little vacuum experiment if the
bead<00:00:21.480> stays<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:21.990> might<00:00:22.140> even<00:00:22.289> see<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.529> pattern

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
can drive on it I doubt it but it's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.889 

well<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:06.759> was<00:02:06.880> interesting<00:02:07.299> and<00:02:07.479> sort<00:02:07.719> of<00:02:07.780> what

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
well it was interesting and sort of what

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.630 
well it was interesting and sort of what
I<00:02:07.929> expected<00:02:10.650> now<00:02:11.650> we<00:02:11.709> stand<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.250> much<00:02:12.400> back

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
I expected now we stand that much back

in<00:02:14.190> those<00:02:15.190> tire<00:02:15.489> beads<00:02:15.790> are<00:02:15.970> not<00:02:16.090> very<00:02:16.300> tight

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
in those tire beads are not very tight

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.170 
in those tire beads are not very tight
either<00:02:17.160> they're<00:02:18.160> very<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.489> very<00:02:18.730> easy<00:02:18.940> to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
either they're very it very easy to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.570 
either they're very it very easy to
dismount<00:02:19.920> that's<00:02:20.920> why<00:02:21.010> I've<00:02:21.099> got<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.280> few<00:02:21.459> other

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
dismount that's why I've got a few other

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.160 
dismount that's why I've got a few other
old<00:02:21.790> Junkers<00:02:22.269> floating<00:02:22.690> around<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.900> couple<00:02:23.110> of
