00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
destroying a zombie head but I think I

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.120 
destroying a zombie head but I think I
think<00:00:13.080> I'll<00:00:13.170> just<00:00:13.259> make<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.590> into<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.920> three

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
think I'll just make this into a three

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.829 
think I'll just make this into a three
part<00:00:14.400> video<00:00:14.610> series<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.360> this<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
part video series and this is just a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.310 
part video series and this is just a
best<00:00:16.529> part<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.750> there<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> am<00:00:18.869> just<00:00:18.990> drawing

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
best part and there I am just drawing

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.710 
best part and there I am just drawing
the<00:00:19.529> shape<00:00:19.820> you<00:00:20.820> know<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> overall<00:00:21.330> shape<00:00:21.600> you

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the shape you know the overall shape you

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.870 
the shape you know the overall shape you
don't<00:00:21.810> have<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> be<00:00:22.170> perfect<00:00:22.650> because<00:00:22.850> you<00:00:23.850> can

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
don't have to be perfect because you can

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
don't have to be perfect because you can
build<00:00:24.210> up<00:00:24.359> here<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.990> know<00:00:25.109> your<00:00:25.320> zombie

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
build up here you know your zombie

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.870 
build up here you know your zombie
sketch<00:00:25.920> from<00:00:27.949> simple<00:00:28.949> random<00:00:29.279> shared<00:00:29.580> fairly

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
sketch from simple random shared fairly

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.970 
sketch from simple random shared fairly
interested<00:00:30.599> just<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> good<00:00:31.830> idea

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
interested just so you have a good idea

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
interested just so you have a good idea
of<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.399> are<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> gonna<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.540> know<00:00:33.630> approach

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
of how are you gonna you know approach

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.610 
of how are you gonna you know approach
the<00:00:34.230> drawing<00:00:39.110> because<00:00:40.110> things<00:00:40.379> can<00:00:40.530> be

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the drawing because things can be

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
the drawing because things can be
changed<00:00:40.649> later<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.640> don't<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.300> other

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
changed later if you don't like in other

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.420 
changed later if you don't like in other
ways<00:00:44.570> just<00:00:45.570> wait<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> join<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:47.550> main<00:00:47.730> details

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
ways just wait to join the main details

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
ways just wait to join the main details
to<00:00:50.430> stuff<00:00:50.670> later<00:00:50.940> sort<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.329> sketchy<00:00:51.539> fun

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to stuff later sort of sketchy fun

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:05.749 
to stuff later sort of sketchy fun

head<00:02:21.190> join<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.030> concept<00:02:22.480> sketch

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.520 

near<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.420> end<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.659> the<00:02:44.750> trial<00:02:44.959> now<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.230> should

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
near the end of the trial now you should

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.660 
near the end of the trial now you should

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
ripped a here and they're twisted I

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.949 
ripped a here and they're twisted I
still<00:02:56.269> twisted<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.930> zombie<00:02:57.379> head<00:02:57.500> spot<00:02:58.959> this

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
still twisted a zombie head spot this

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.140 
still twisted a zombie head spot this
one<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.290> 10<00:03:00.470> okay<00:03:01.239> cuz<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.420> just<00:03:02.480> like<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.970> a

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.280 

so<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.250> our<00:03:13.400> next<00:03:13.610> panel<00:03:14.030> I'll<00:03:14.390> try<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.750> try<00:03:15.230> to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
so on our next panel I'll try and try to
