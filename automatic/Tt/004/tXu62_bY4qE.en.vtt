00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
anyways that is my review of this match

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.399 
anyways that is my review of this match
like<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.060> said<00:01:42.240> nothing<00:01:42.390> too<00:01:42.780> much<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.170> report

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
like I said nothing too much to report

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.690 
like I said nothing too much to report
on<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> big<00:01:43.799> show<00:01:43.979> getting<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> thought

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
on a big show getting when I thought

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
on a big show getting when I thought
Erick<00:01:45.030> Rowan<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.570> thought<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.500> made

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
Erick Rowan I thought it would have made

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.050 
Erick Rowan I thought it would have made
more<00:01:46.770> sense<00:01:46.950> for<00:01:47.070> Erick<00:01:47.340> Rowan<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:47.939> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
more sense for Erick Rowan to get the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.870 
more sense for Erick Rowan to get the
victory<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:48.810> obviously<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.649> WWE<00:01:50.220> has<00:01:50.399> has

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
victory but obviously the WWE has has

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.340 
victory but obviously the WWE has has
other<00:01:51.090> plans<00:01:51.270> for<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> big<00:01:51.750> show<00:01:51.780> maybe<00:01:52.140> he's

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
other plans for the big show maybe he's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.050 
other plans for the big show maybe he's
going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.740> his<00:01:52.890> 100th<00:01:53.310> push<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.000> a

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
going to go on his 100th push of a

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
going to go on his 100th push of a
lifetime<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> W<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.860> thinking
