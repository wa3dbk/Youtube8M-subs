00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
they can be cheaper but the big con is

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.890 
they can be cheaper but the big con is

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
that does take a quite a bit of time to

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.560

big one for social social can be no it's
not<00:05:24.560> can<00:05:25.190> be<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.310> brilliant<00:05:25.520> option<00:05:25.970> but<00:05:26.360> it's

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
not can be a brilliant option but it's

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.640 
not can be a brilliant option but it's
definitely<00:05:26.600> not<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.930> Magic<00:05:27.200> Bullet<00:05:27.230> is

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
definitely not the Magic Bullet is

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.950 
definitely not the Magic Bullet is
probably<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.130> best<00:05:28.310> long-term<00:05:29.000> strategy<00:05:29.720> but

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
probably the best long-term strategy but

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.750 
probably the best long-term strategy but
again<00:05:30.050> it's<00:05:30.560> going<00:05:30.710> to<00:05:30.770> take<00:05:30.920> a<00:05:30.950> long<00:05:31.160> time<00:05:31.220> and

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
again it's going to take a long time and

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.420 
again it's going to take a long time and
as<00:05:32.390> we<00:05:32.960> were<00:05:33.110> on<00:05:33.260> business<00:05:33.590> time<00:05:33.830> does<00:05:34.160> equal

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
as we were on business time does equal

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.980 
as we were on business time does equal
money<00:05:34.790> so<00:05:35.680> something<00:05:36.680> to<00:05:36.800> consider<00:05:37.990> the

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
money so something to consider the

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.190 
money so something to consider the
reality<00:05:39.440> is<00:05:39.470> these<00:05:39.950> days<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.670> all<00:05:41.630> of<00:05:42.050> these

they're<00:05:52.340> all<00:05:52.490> interrelated<00:05:52.970> so<00:05:53.870> you<00:05:53.930> can<00:05:54.260> be

well<00:06:01.210> so<00:06:02.410> that's<00:06:03.410> probably<00:06:03.710> the<00:06:03.890> best<00:06:03.980> thing

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100

that's<00:06:04.400> the<00:06:04.460> biggest<00:06:04.640> takeaway<00:06:05.060> today<00:06:05.360> I

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
that's the biggest takeaway today I

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.100 
that's the biggest takeaway today I
think<00:06:05.630> is<00:06:05.720> to<00:06:05.810> consider<00:06:06.110> that<00:06:07.780> you<00:06:08.780> can<00:06:08.960> use

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
think is to consider that you can use

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.560 
think is to consider that you can use
all<00:06:09.350> of<00:06:09.470> those<00:06:09.620> all<00:06:09.860> of<00:06:09.890> these<00:06:10.160> techniques<00:06:11.120> or

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
all of those all of these techniques or

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.800 
all of those all of these techniques or
strategies<00:06:12.580> all<00:06:13.580> in<00:06:13.730> one<00:06:13.880> go<00:06:14.060> so<00:06:14.420> this<00:06:14.510> is<00:06:14.660> sort

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
strategies all in one go so this is sort
