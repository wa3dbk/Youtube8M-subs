camera<00:02:01.830> because<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.580> floor<00:02:02.940> isn't<00:02:03.330> very

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
camera because my floor isn't very

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.039 
camera because my floor isn't very
stable<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> walk<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.360> camera<00:02:06.690> wobbles

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
stable and as I walk the camera wobbles

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.250 
stable and as I walk the camera wobbles
a<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.350> bit<00:02:07.640> my<00:02:08.640> lens<00:02:08.940> choice<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.570> a<00:02:09.929> fifty

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
a little bit my lens choice is a fifty

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.539 
a little bit my lens choice is a fifty
millimeter<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:12.200> 1.47<00:02:13.200> f9<00:02:13.680> which<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.459> to

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
millimeter of 1.47 f9 which is going to

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.400 
millimeter of 1.47 f9 which is going to
give<00:02:14.670> me<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.820> really<00:02:15.180> good<00:02:15.269> sharpness<00:02:15.660> because

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
give me a really good sharpness because

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.710 
give me a really good sharpness because
it's<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.650> prime<00:02:16.890> lens<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.570> when<00:02:18.570> I'm

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
it's a prime lens now when I'm

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.020 
it's a prime lens now when I'm
photographing<00:02:19.019> today<00:02:19.769> are<00:02:20.220> these<00:02:20.730> little

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
photographing today are these little

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.130 
photographing today are these little
bottles<00:02:21.390> filled<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.380> globe<00:02:22.890> glass<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
bottles filled with globe glass and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.880 
bottles filled with globe glass and
unfortunately<00:02:25.140> they<00:02:25.410> don't<00:02:25.470> glow<00:02:25.709> by

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
unfortunately they don't glow by

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.390 
unfortunately they don't glow by
themselves<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.260> they<00:02:28.260> need<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.830> charged

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
themselves and they need to be charged

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.060 
themselves and they need to be charged
with<00:02:29.670> light<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:31.110> what<00:02:31.380> I'm<00:02:31.500> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> be<00:02:31.769> using

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
with light so what I'm going to be using

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.670 
with light so what I'm going to be using
for<00:02:32.100> charging<00:02:32.850> these<00:02:33.780> bottles<00:02:34.200> with<00:02:34.380> is

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
for charging these bottles with is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.640 
for charging these bottles with is
actually<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.549> Canon<00:02:35.940> speed<00:02:36.239> light<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:37.530> can

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
actually the Canon speed light you can

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.590 
actually the Canon speed light you can
use<00:02:37.680> any<00:02:38.160> light<00:02:38.370> source<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> little<00:02:39.299> torch

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
use any light source like a little torch

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.390 
use any light source like a little torch
or<00:02:39.959> whatever<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:40.739> I'm<00:02:40.829> just<00:02:40.950> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.190> use<00:02:41.370> a

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
or whatever but I'm just going to use a

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.390 
or whatever but I'm just going to use a
speed<00:02:41.730> light<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.239> strobe<00:02:42.600> setting<00:02:43.400> because

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
speed light on a strobe setting because

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.490 
speed light on a strobe setting because
it<00:02:44.549> emits<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.970> really<00:02:45.360> strong<00:02:45.600> light<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.170> these

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
it emits a really strong light and these

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410 
it emits a really strong light and these
bottles<00:02:46.890> are<00:02:47.010> going<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.250> be<00:02:47.340> charged<00:02:47.820> in<00:02:48.030> no

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
bottles are going to be charged in no

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.949 
bottles are going to be charged in no
time

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
time

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.310 
time
so<00:02:49.890> that's<00:02:50.280> about<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.880> for<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.239> setup<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:51.959> for

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
so that's about it for the setup now for

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.410 
so that's about it for the setup now for
the<00:02:52.470> actual<00:02:52.890> magic<00:02:53.130> shot<00:02:53.549> I'm<00:02:53.790> going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.209> turn

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
the actual magic shot I'm going to turn

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.120 
the actual magic shot I'm going to turn
off<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> lights<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.200> we<00:02:55.650> will<00:02:55.860> see<00:02:56.010> what

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
off the lights and we will see what

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.070 
off the lights and we will see what
happens<00:02:56.489> then

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
happens then

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.720 
happens then
okay<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.140> here<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.680> are<00:02:59.860> with<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.160> light<00:03:00.400> sound

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
okay so here we are with a light sound

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.520 
okay so here we are with a light sound
and<00:03:01.000> I'm<00:03:01.060> going<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.270> be<00:03:01.360> using<00:03:01.660> my<00:03:01.840> speed<00:03:02.290> light

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and I'm going to be using my speed light

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.970 
and I'm going to be using my speed light
on<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:04.140> multi<00:03:05.140> setting<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:06.730> actually<00:03:07.450> flash

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
on a multi setting to actually flash

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.500 
on a multi setting to actually flash
little<00:03:08.980> bottles<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.850> charge<00:03:10.240> them<00:03:10.480> with

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
little bottles to charge them with

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.840 
little bottles to charge them with
lights<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.440> let's<00:03:11.650> see<00:03:11.770> what<00:03:11.950> happens<00:03:12.310> after

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
lights so let's see what happens after

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:51.780 
lights so let's see what happens after
that<00:03:48.600> that<00:03:49.600> should<00:03:49.810> be<00:03:49.960> enough<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:50.770> I'm<00:03:51.370> just

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
that that should be enough so I'm just

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.550 
that that should be enough so I'm just
gonna<00:03:53.400> let<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.550> camera<00:03:54.880> take<00:03:55.120> its<00:03:55.300> frame<00:03:58.560> I'm

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
gonna let the camera take its frame I'm

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.130 
gonna let the camera take its frame I'm
also<00:03:59.710> going<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.040> use<00:04:00.100> in<00:04:00.730> flash<00:04:01.120> twice<00:04:01.630> on<00:04:02.020> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
also going to use in flash twice on the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.530 
also going to use in flash twice on the
environment<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:06.310> give<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.120> white<00:04:07.300> background

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
environment to give the white background

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.180 
environment to give the white background
some<00:04:07.989> why<00:04:08.170> because<00:04:08.560> there's<00:04:08.739> not<00:04:08.920> enough

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
some why because there's not enough

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.130 
some why because there's not enough
light<00:04:09.430> even<00:04:09.760> for<00:04:10.000> lock<00:04:10.209> exposure<00:04:10.360> to<00:04:10.840> pick<00:04:10.989> up

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
light even for lock exposure to pick up

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.900 
light even for lock exposure to pick up
the<00:04:11.260> background<00:04:15.150> more<00:04:17.250> I'm<00:04:18.250> also<00:04:18.430> using<00:04:18.640> the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
the background more I'm also using the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.090 
the background more I'm also using the
long<00:04:19.419> exposure<00:04:19.780> noise<00:04:19.900> reduction<00:04:20.440> so<00:04:20.770> after

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
long exposure noise reduction so after

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.380 
long exposure noise reduction so after
this<00:04:21.220> frame<00:04:21.549> it's<00:04:21.880> going<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.090> take<00:04:22.180> another

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
this frame it's going to take another

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.140 
this frame it's going to take another
dark<00:04:22.780> frame<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.919> then<00:04:24.130> subtract<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.970> noise

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
dark frame and then subtract the noise

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.950 
dark frame and then subtract the noise
profile<00:04:25.750> from<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.320> final<00:04:27.160> picture<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:31.630> here's

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
profile from the final picture so here's

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.950 
profile from the final picture so here's
what<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.200> camera<00:04:32.500> picked<00:04:32.710> up<00:04:32.890> it<00:04:33.730> looks<00:04:34.390> a<00:04:34.660> lot

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
what the camera picked up it looks a lot

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.130 
what the camera picked up it looks a lot
overexposed<00:04:35.919> on<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.850> actual<00:04:37.180> footage<00:04:37.419> but<00:04:37.870> as

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
overexposed on the actual footage but as

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.050 
overexposed on the actual footage but as
you<00:04:38.350> will<00:04:38.500> see<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.980> a<00:04:39.070> bit<00:04:39.100> when<00:04:39.520> we're<00:04:39.760> back<00:04:39.880> to

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
you will see in a bit when we're back to

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.090 
you will see in a bit when we're back to
the<00:04:40.150> computer<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.750> picture<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.650> exposed

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
the computer the picture is exposed

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.700 
the computer the picture is exposed
perfectly<00:04:42.730> fine<00:04:42.970> so<00:04:43.140> I'm<00:04:44.140> going<00:04:44.350> to<00:04:44.410> go<00:04:44.500> back

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
perfectly fine so I'm going to go back

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.210 
perfectly fine so I'm going to go back
to<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.250> computer<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.450> we'll<00:04:46.720> see<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:46.990> there

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.930 
hey what's up here we
back<00:04:52.620> of<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.920> computer<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.610> I've<00:04:53.760> already

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
back of the computer and I've already

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.500 
back of the computer and I've already
taken<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.050> liberty<00:04:55.080> of<00:04:55.640> importing<00:04:56.640> the

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
taken the liberty of importing the

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.450 
taken the liberty of importing the
photograph<00:04:58.200> into<00:04:58.590> Lightroom<00:04:59.300> 5.2<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:02.010> doesn't

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
photograph into Lightroom 5.2 it doesn't

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.100 
photograph into Lightroom 5.2 it doesn't
matter<00:05:02.580> which<00:05:02.760> Lightroom<00:05:03.180> you're<00:05:03.330> using<00:05:03.600> it's

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
matter which Lightroom you're using it's

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.780 
matter which Lightroom you're using it's
going<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.350> be<00:05:04.440> fine<00:05:04.770> they<00:05:05.190> all<00:05:05.310> do<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.580> same

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
going to be fine they all do the same

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:06.530 
going to be fine they all do the same
thing<00:05:06.030> anyway

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
thing anyway

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.410 
thing anyway
so<00:05:07.350> there<00:05:08.070> are<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.160> couple<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.490> problems<00:05:09.030> with

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
so there are a couple of problems with

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.050 
so there are a couple of problems with
this<00:05:09.480> picture<00:05:09.810> that<00:05:09.990> I'm<00:05:10.080> seeing<00:05:10.350> already<00:05:11.060> one

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
this picture that I'm seeing already one

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.900 
this picture that I'm seeing already one
is<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.930> exposure<00:05:13.470> is<00:05:13.650> a<00:05:13.740> little<00:05:14.220> too<00:05:14.430> low<00:05:14.640> I

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
is the exposure is a little too low I

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.210 
is the exposure is a little too low I
mean<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.480> detail<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:16.530> enough<00:05:16.830> for<00:05:16.860> us

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
mean the detail is just enough for us

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.470 
mean the detail is just enough for us
but<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.850> wish<00:05:18.360> it<00:05:18.690> was<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:18.900> little<00:05:19.020> lighter<00:05:19.530> but

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
but I wish it was a little lighter but

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.090 
but I wish it was a little lighter but
thankfully<00:05:21.480> we<00:05:21.750> can<00:05:21.780> play<00:05:22.410> around<00:05:22.560> in

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
thankfully we can play around in

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.080 
thankfully we can play around in
Lightroom<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.180> get<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.600> correct<00:05:25.020> exposure<00:05:26.090> that

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
Lightroom to get a correct exposure that

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.360 
Lightroom to get a correct exposure that
seems<00:05:27.450> about<00:05:27.660> right<00:05:27.720> for<00:05:28.140> me<00:05:28.320> probably<00:05:29.100> going

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
seems about right for me probably going

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.850 
seems about right for me probably going
to<00:05:29.430> boost<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:30.120> highlights<00:05:30.630> a<00:05:30.810> little<00:05:31.110> bit<00:05:31.440> to

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
to boost the highlights a little bit to

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.600 
to boost the highlights a little bit to
get<00:05:32.040> some<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:33.270> that<00:05:33.300> nice<00:05:33.720> healthy<00:05:34.320> white<00:05:34.980> glow

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
get some of that nice healthy white glow

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.250 
get some of that nice healthy white glow
in<00:05:35.820> there<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:37.340> possibly<00:05:38.780> reducing<00:05:39.780> the

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
in there and possibly reducing the

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.880 
in there and possibly reducing the
shadows<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:40.950> little<00:05:41.280> bit<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:43.110> kind<00:05:43.290> of<00:05:43.440> increase

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 
shadows a little bit to kind of increase

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
shadows a little bit to kind of increase
the<00:05:44.040> contrast<00:05:44.880> between<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.900> glow<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.910> the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
the contrast between the glow and the

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.480 
the contrast between the glow and the
background<00:05:48.830> I'm<00:05:49.830> also<00:05:49.950> going<00:05:50.160> to<00:05:50.220> white

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
background I'm also going to white

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.320 
background I'm also going to white
balance<00:05:50.670> using<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.570> color<00:05:52.260> picker<00:05:52.290> tool<00:05:52.860> and

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
balance using the color picker tool and

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.600 
balance using the color picker tool and
just<00:05:54.410> making<00:05:55.410> it<00:05:56.450> grayish<00:05:57.450> I<00:05:58.160> suppose<00:05:59.160> there

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
just making it grayish I suppose there

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.240 
just making it grayish I suppose there
we<00:05:59.700> go<00:05:59.850> just<00:06:00.410> going<00:06:01.410> to<00:06:01.470> add<00:06:01.560> a<00:06:01.590> little<00:06:01.950> bit<00:06:02.220> of

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
we go just going to add a little bit of

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.280 
we go just going to add a little bit of
that<00:06:02.460> clarity<00:06:03.240> which<00:06:03.420> is<00:06:03.540> going<00:06:03.690> to<00:06:03.750> increase

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
that clarity which is going to increase

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.110 
that clarity which is going to increase
the<00:06:04.530> local<00:06:04.800> contrast<00:06:05.930> not<00:06:06.930> too<00:06:07.200> much<00:06:08.030> there<00:06:09.030> we

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
the local contrast not too much there we

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.540 
the local contrast not too much there we
go<00:06:09.300> and<00:06:09.710> I'm<00:06:10.710> just<00:06:10.740> going<00:06:10.980> to<00:06:11.070> bump<00:06:11.340> up<00:06:11.520> the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
go and I'm just going to bump up the

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.990 
go and I'm just going to bump up the
luminance<00:06:12.210> of<00:06:12.510> aquas<00:06:13.200> and<00:06:13.560> blues<00:06:13.950> just<00:06:14.850> a

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
luminance of aquas and blues just a

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.050 
luminance of aquas and blues just a
touch<00:06:15.270> and<00:06:16.490> probably<00:06:17.490> increase<00:06:17.790> the

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
touch and probably increase the

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.250 
touch and probably increase the
saturation<00:06:18.360> of<00:06:19.050> Blues<00:06:20.060> let's<00:06:21.060> see<00:06:21.390> sharpening

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
saturation of Blues let's see sharpening

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.740 
saturation of Blues let's see sharpening
and<00:06:22.500> noise<00:06:22.530> reduction<00:06:23.090> probably<00:06:24.090> keep<00:06:24.450> about

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
and noise reduction probably keep about

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.780 
and noise reduction probably keep about
40<00:06:25.410> and<00:06:25.560> 50<00:06:26.690> enable<00:06:27.800> profile<00:06:28.800> Corrections<00:06:28.830> for

40 and 50 enable profile Corrections for
my<00:06:29.940> lens<00:06:30.270> to<00:06:30.720> remove<00:06:31.020> any<00:06:31.200> distortion<00:06:32.160> and

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
my lens to remove any distortion and

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.040 
my lens to remove any distortion and
vignetting<00:06:33.480> and<00:06:34.760> I<00:06:35.760> usually<00:06:35.970> add<00:06:36.390> a<00:06:36.750> little

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
vignetting and I usually add a little

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.590 
vignetting and I usually add a little
bit<00:06:37.290> of<00:06:37.320> Vinnie<00:06:38.220> adding<00:06:38.580> back<00:06:38.910> into<00:06:39.480> the

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
bit of Vinnie adding back into the

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.800 
bit of Vinnie adding back into the
picture<00:06:39.810> especially<00:06:40.260> the<00:06:40.770> glowing<00:06:41.190> ones

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
picture especially the glowing ones

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.720 
picture especially the glowing ones
because<00:06:42.810> that<00:06:43.170> just<00:06:43.350> kind<00:06:43.770> of<00:06:43.920> focuses<00:06:44.580> your

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
because that just kind of focuses your

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.250 
because that just kind of focuses your
attention<00:06:44.790> to<00:06:45.450> the<00:06:45.570> middle<00:06:45.960> where<00:06:46.230> the

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
attention to the middle where the

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.090 
attention to the middle where the
glowing<00:06:46.620> bit<00:06:46.920> is<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:47.400> it<00:06:47.820> just<00:06:48.030> looks<00:06:49.100> like

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
glowing bit is and it just looks like

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.700 
glowing bit is and it just looks like
the<00:06:50.610> glows<00:06:51.000> a<00:06:51.030> little<00:06:51.750> stronger<00:06:52.140> if<00:06:52.380> you<00:06:52.530> will

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710 
the glows a little stronger if you will

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.980 
the glows a little stronger if you will
and<00:06:53.570> that's<00:06:54.570> about<00:06:54.810> it<00:06:55.110> so<00:06:55.980> what<00:06:56.190> I<00:06:56.220> did<00:06:57.090> for

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990 
and that's about it so what I did for

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:59.690 
and that's about it so what I did for
the<00:06:58.230> original<00:06:58.680> picture<00:06:59.100> that<00:06:59.250> I<00:06:59.280> showed<00:06:59.400> you

00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.700 
the original picture that I showed you

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.070 
the original picture that I showed you
was<00:07:00.210> I<00:07:00.600> actually<00:07:00.840> cropped<00:07:01.470> it<00:07:01.740> to<00:07:02.630> 2<00:07:03.630> by<00:07:03.840> 1

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
was I actually cropped it to 2 by 1

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.940 
was I actually cropped it to 2 by 1
aspect<00:07:04.680> ratio

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:06.950 
aspect ratio

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.220 
aspect ratio
and<00:07:07.190> that's<00:07:07.730> pretty<00:07:08.150> much<00:07:08.270> the<00:07:08.540> final<00:07:08.720> result

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.230 
and that's pretty much the final result

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.260 
and that's pretty much the final result
now<00:07:09.740> I<00:07:09.770> would<00:07:10.130> usually<00:07:10.460> take<00:07:10.850> this<00:07:11.030> a<00:07:11.090> little

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
now I would usually take this a little

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.730 
now I would usually take this a little
bit<00:07:11.870> further<00:07:12.200> and<00:07:13.510> go<00:07:14.510> into<00:07:14.660> Photoshop<00:07:15.110> and

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
bit further and go into Photoshop and

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.150 
bit further and go into Photoshop and
kind<00:07:16.520> of<00:07:16.610> remove<00:07:17.090> little<00:07:17.810> pieces<00:07:18.080> of<00:07:18.290> dirt<00:07:18.830> and
