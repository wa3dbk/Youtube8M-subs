this<00:02:16.470> game<00:02:17.989> we<00:02:18.989> spend<00:02:20.900> several<00:02:21.900> weeks<00:02:22.160> trying

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
this game we spend several weeks trying

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.300 
this game we spend several weeks trying
to<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.790> through<00:02:24.360> I<00:02:24.690> think<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.050> was<00:02:25.080> 30<00:02:25.650> levels

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

this<00:02:26.790> game<00:02:27.120> has<00:02:28.220> increasingly<00:02:29.569> difficult

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
this game has increasingly difficult

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.690

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
starting with very very easy ones so oh

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.539 
starting with very very easy ones so oh
I<00:02:35.940> think<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.870> could<00:02:37.290> maybe<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.860> recording<00:02:38.340> of

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
I think it could maybe the recording of

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.789 
I think it could maybe the recording of
the<00:02:39.030> game<00:02:39.330> picture<00:02:39.720> started<00:02:40.080> right<00:02:40.319> now<00:02:40.350> I

Jason and a two player mode and Oh be

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.990 
Jason and a two player mode and Oh be
easy<00:03:17.519> on<00:03:17.850> me<00:03:18.180> please<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:19.340> don't<00:03:20.340> know<00:03:20.640> whether<00:03:20.880> I

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
easy on me please I don't know whether I

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.210 
easy on me please I don't know whether I
will<00:03:21.329> be<00:03:21.570> able<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:23.000> think<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:25.220> puzzles

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
will be able to think of all the puzzles

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.099 
will be able to think of all the puzzles
in<00:03:27.230> short<00:03:28.230> time<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:30.510> i'll<00:03:30.660> play<00:03:30.930> with<00:03:30.959> a

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
in short time and i'll play with a

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.740 
in short time and i'll play with a
keyboard<00:03:32.600> ok<00:03:33.600> press<00:03:34.069> button<00:03:35.069> on<00:03:35.340> move<00:03:36.180> no

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
keyboard ok press button on move no

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.970 
keyboard ok press button on move no
player<00:03:37.140> one<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.380> a<00:03:37.500> move<00:03:37.799> press<00:03:38.459> button

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
player one is a move press button

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.309 
player one is a move press button
okay<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:41.239> here<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.599> have<00:03:41.629> the<00:03:41.840> first<00:03:41.989> molecule

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
okay so here you have the first molecule

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:50.440 
okay so here you have the first molecule
of<00:03:42.590> water<00:03:43.480> and<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:45.909> the<00:03:46.909> puzzle<00:03:47.269> here<00:03:47.450> is<00:03:49.450> here

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
of water and so the puzzle here is here

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.170 
of water and so the puzzle here is here
use<00:03:50.569> in<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.260> bottom<00:03:52.010> left<00:03:52.580> do<00:03:52.760> you<00:03:52.849> see<00:03:53.030> how

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
use in the bottom left do you see how

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.899 
use in the bottom left do you see how
the<00:03:53.239> molecule<00:03:53.690> looks<00:03:53.900> like<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.610> here<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:55.700> see

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:55.909 
the molecule looks like and here you see

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:00.820 
the molecule looks like and here you see
what<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.739> blue<00:03:57.739> at<00:03:57.920> home<00:03:58.160> is<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:59.830> hydrogen

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
what the blue at home is the hydrogen

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:09.759 
what the blue at home is the hydrogen
atom<00:04:01.129> and<00:04:03.730> this<00:04:04.730> is<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.060> oxygen<00:04:05.750> atom<00:04:08.769> you'll

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
atom and this is the oxygen atom you'll

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.100 
atom and this is the oxygen atom you'll
have<00:04:09.950> to<00:04:10.099> find<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.489> place<00:04:10.730> where<00:04:11.269> to<00:04:11.480> build<00:04:11.780> this

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
have to find a place where to build this

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.039 
have to find a place where to build this
molecule<00:04:13.099> and<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:15.530> think<00:04:16.299> we've<00:04:17.299> built<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.690> here

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
molecule and I think we've built it here

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.080 
molecule and I think we've built it here
in<00:04:18.260> these<00:04:18.680> three<00:04:19.549> times<00:04:20.060> at<00:04:21.550> the<00:04:22.550> problem<00:04:22.910> is

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
in these three times at the problem is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.250 
in these three times at the problem is
when<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.199> move<00:04:24.470> an<00:04:24.919> atom<00:04:25.539> you<00:04:26.539> can<00:04:26.720> only<00:04:26.900> move

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
when you move an atom you can only move

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.980 
when you move an atom you can only move
it<00:04:27.910> from<00:04:28.910> edge<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.960> edge<00:04:30.470> you<00:04:31.430> cannot<00:04:31.699> stop

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
it from edge to to edge you cannot stop

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:42.630 
it from edge to to edge you cannot stop
anywhere<00:04:32.990> on<00:04:33.169> your<00:04:33.979> way<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:37.539> basically

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.190 

looks<00:04:43.640> like<00:04:43.940> this<00:04:44.230> now<00:04:45.230> I<00:04:45.260> see<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.830> problem

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
looks like this now I see the problem

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.800 
looks like this now I see the problem
how<00:04:48.200> will<00:04:48.230> we<00:04:48.590> get<00:04:52.120> how<00:04:53.120> will<00:04:53.270> we<00:04:53.300> get<00:04:53.630> the

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
how will we get how will we get the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.350 
how will we get how will we get the
oxygen<00:04:54.140> more<00:04:54.530> like<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:55.220> oxygen<00:04:55.670> atom<00:04:55.820> up

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
oxygen more like the oxygen atom up

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:08.380 
oxygen more like the oxygen atom up
there<00:04:56.810> I<00:05:02.200> think<00:05:03.200> that<00:05:03.320> was<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.470> trick<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:08.030> trick

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
there I think that was a trick the trick

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:29.260 
there I think that was a trick the trick
was<00:05:23.740> now<00:05:24.740> I<00:05:24.770> don't<00:05:24.919> really<00:05:25.220> know<00:05:26.260> haha<00:05:28.270> first

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
was now I don't really know haha first

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.990 
was now I don't really know haha first
level<00:05:29.450> is<00:05:29.540> so<00:05:29.720> easy<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.110> i'm<00:05:30.410> i'm<00:05:30.680> already<00:05:34.000> i'm

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
level is so easy and i'm i'm already i'm

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.200 
level is so easy and i'm i'm already i'm
already<00:05:35.900> overwhelmed<00:05:36.740> with<00:05:36.830> its<00:05:38.950> complexity

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
already overwhelmed with its complexity

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.070 
already overwhelmed with its complexity
probably<00:05:41.210> will<00:05:41.360> have<00:05:41.510> to

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:54.750 

probably<00:05:45.080> i'll<00:05:45.200> have<00:05:45.350> to<00:05:45.470> just<00:05:45.680> play<00:05:46.010> and<00:05:46.190> try

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.830 

well<00:05:56.080> see<00:05:57.080> i<00:05:57.110> don't<00:05:57.590> know<00:05:57.740> how<00:05:57.889> i<00:05:58.389> get<00:05:59.389> out<00:05:59.600> of

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
well see i don't know how i get out of

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.250 
well see i don't know how i get out of
ah<00:06:02.860> of<00:06:03.860> course<00:06:03.950> now<00:06:04.669> why<00:06:05.389> would<00:06:05.450> i<00:06:05.660> want<00:06:05.780> to

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
ah of course now why would i want to

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.440 
ah of course now why would i want to
build<00:06:06.470> the<00:06:06.590> molecule<00:06:07.040> here<00:06:07.310> it's<00:06:08.150> much<00:06:08.419> easier

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
build the molecule here it's much easier

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.890 
build the molecule here it's much easier
when<00:06:09.260> I<00:06:09.320> build<00:06:09.590> it<00:06:09.740> in<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.669> in<00:06:11.060> the<00:06:11.150> right

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
when I build it in the in the right

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.580 
when I build it in the in the right
lower<00:06:12.680> corner<00:06:12.980> I<00:06:13.370> don't<00:06:14.270> know<00:06:14.330> how<00:06:14.510> I<00:06:14.540> came<00:06:15.530> up

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 
lower corner I don't know how I came up

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.110 
lower corner I don't know how I came up
with<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:16.010> idea<00:06:16.040> to<00:06:16.370> build<00:06:16.610> it<00:06:16.760> here<00:06:16.970> in<00:06:17.090> the

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
with the idea to build it here in the

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:23.440 
with the idea to build it here in the
first<00:06:17.389> place<00:06:20.050> so<00:06:21.190> this<00:06:22.190> is<00:06:22.220> fairly<00:06:22.940> easy<00:06:23.090> of

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
first place so this is fairly easy of

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.150 
first place so this is fairly easy of
course<00:06:25.900> so<00:06:26.900> you<00:06:26.930> see<00:06:27.229> the<00:06:27.500> choice<00:06:27.770> of<00:06:28.010> the

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
course so you see the choice of the

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.010 
course so you see the choice of the
place<00:06:28.460> where<00:06:28.790> you<00:06:28.910> build<00:06:29.120> the<00:06:29.270> molecule<00:06:29.750> is

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
place where you build the molecule is

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.070 
place where you build the molecule is
essential<00:06:30.710> for<00:06:31.270> for<00:06:32.270> your<00:06:32.389> performance<00:06:32.570> with
