00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
overclock it will overclock it together

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.030 
overclock it will overclock it together
and<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.810> should<00:04:38.990> be<00:04:39.080> all<00:04:39.200> good<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.620> go<00:04:39.650> there

TouchWiz yet I don't think there's

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.570 
TouchWiz yet I don't think there's
actually<00:04:47.390> one<00:04:47.480> exists<00:04:48.520> speedball<00:04:49.520> is

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
actually one exists speedball is

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.400 
actually one exists speedball is
actually<00:04:50.000> pretty<00:04:50.240> good<00:04:50.450> i've<00:04:50.570> tried<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:50.990> so

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
actually pretty good i've tried that so

actually pretty good i've tried that so
I've<00:04:51.500> been<00:04:51.650> messing<00:04:51.800> around<00:04:52.070> with<00:04:52.310> that<00:04:52.430> to

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
I've been messing around with that to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.660 
I've been messing around with that to
make<00:04:53.210> this<00:04:53.420> work<00:04:53.660> load<00:04:54.290> over<00:04:54.680> call<00:04:54.860> module

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
make this work load over call module

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.330 
make this work load over call module
first<00:04:56.000> make<00:04:56.300> sure<00:04:56.330> you<00:04:56.510> hit<00:04:56.600> grants<00:04:57.340> once

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
first make sure you hit grants once

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.800 
first make sure you hit grants once
that's<00:04:58.610> done<00:04:59.320> overclock<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:00.350> to<00:05:00.770> 1.6<00:05:01.460> now<00:05:02.210> if

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
that's done overclock it to 1.6 now if

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.290 
that's done overclock it to 1.6 now if
you<00:05:03.020> get<00:05:03.230> the<00:05:03.530> deep<00:05:04.430> a<00:05:04.670> version<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.150> can

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
you get the deep a version you can

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.660 
you get the deep a version you can
actually<00:05:05.540> overclock<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.380> GPU<00:05:06.770> also<00:05:07.280> will

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
actually overclock the GPU also will

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.900 
actually overclock the GPU also will
make<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:08.000> way<00:05:08.240> faster<00:05:08.860> and<00:05:09.860> also<00:05:09.950> on<00:05:10.280> every

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
make it way faster and also on every

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.640 
make it way faster and also on every
reboot<00:05:11.270> with<00:05:11.660> this<00:05:11.810> one<00:05:12.020> you<00:05:12.050> actually<00:05:12.290> have

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
reboot with this one you actually have

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.150 
reboot with this one you actually have
to<00:05:13.090> redo<00:05:14.090> everything<00:05:14.290> but<00:05:15.290> get<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.590> paid<00:05:15.920> app

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
to redo everything but get the paid app

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.690 
to redo everything but get the paid app
you<00:05:16.460> can<00:05:16.580> get<00:05:16.760> it<00:05:16.880> here<00:05:17.360> take<00:05:17.720> wreck<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:18.700> think

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
you can get it here take wreck I think

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.090 
you can get it here take wreck I think
this<00:05:19.850> is<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.210> two<00:05:20.450> dollars<00:05:20.780> 33<00:05:21.380> cents<00:05:21.680> totally
