you<00:03:02.940> know<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.060> think<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.510> about<00:03:03.780> five<00:03:04.500> hours

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
you know I think it's about five hours

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.000 
you know I think it's about five hours
after<00:03:05.100> he<00:03:05.370> shot<00:03:05.580> it<00:03:05.850> it's<00:03:06.030> about<00:03:06.380> 11:20<00:03:07.380> now<00:03:07.709> I

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
after he shot it it's about 11:20 now I

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.090 
after he shot it it's about 11:20 now I
think<00:03:08.310> he<00:03:08.549> shot<00:03:08.730> it<00:03:08.970> somewhere<00:03:09.330> around<00:03:09.420> 7:00

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
think he shot it somewhere around 7:00

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.940 
think he shot it somewhere around 7:00
