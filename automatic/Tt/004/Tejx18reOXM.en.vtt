cannons new 8 to 15 millimeter fisheye

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.640 
cannons new 8 to 15 millimeter fisheye
zoom<00:00:10.910> when<00:00:11.599> I<00:00:11.660> first<00:00:11.869> heard<00:00:12.019> about<00:00:12.139> this<00:00:12.379> lens

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650 
zoom when I first heard about this lens

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.589 
zoom when I first heard about this lens
I<00:00:12.920> thought<00:00:13.790> it<00:00:13.910> was<00:00:14.000> pretty<00:00:14.240> much<00:00:14.360> like<00:00:14.570> a

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:14.599 
I thought it was pretty much like a

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.780 
I thought it was pretty much like a
one-trick<00:00:15.169> pony<00:00:15.469> and<00:00:15.740> that<00:00:16.309> I<00:00:16.340> wouldn't<00:00:16.610> have

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
one-trick pony and that I wouldn't have

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.760 
one-trick pony and that I wouldn't have
a<00:00:16.820> lot<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:17.090> use<00:00:17.330> for<00:00:17.360> it<00:00:17.660> besides<00:00:18.020> the<00:00:18.230> the

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
a lot of use for it besides the the

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.159 
a lot of use for it besides the the
crazy<00:00:19.009> fisheye<00:00:19.430> shots<00:00:19.720> but<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.840> truth<00:00:21.020> of<00:00:21.110> the

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
crazy fisheye shots but the truth of the

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.109 
crazy fisheye shots but the truth of the
matter<00:00:21.260> is<00:00:21.590> I<00:00:21.920> have<00:00:22.010> tested<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:22.670> lens<00:00:22.939> out

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
matter is I have tested this lens out

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.939 
matter is I have tested this lens out
recently<00:00:23.359> on<00:00:23.779> a<00:00:23.869> trip<00:00:24.109> to<00:00:24.199> Burma<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:24.710> I<00:00:24.830> have

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:24.949 
recently on a trip to Burma and I have

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.160 
recently on a trip to Burma and I have
to<00:00:25.070> say<00:00:25.220> I'm<00:00:25.340> pretty<00:00:25.490> impressed<00:00:25.699> with<00:00:26.000> it<00:00:26.210> it

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
to say I'm pretty impressed with it it

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.950 
to say I'm pretty impressed with it it
really<00:00:27.560> shines<00:00:27.890> on<00:00:28.369> a<00:00:28.429> full-frame<00:00:29.179> sensor<00:00:29.660> so

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
really shines on a full-frame sensor so

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.350 
really shines on a full-frame sensor so
if<00:00:30.050> you<00:00:30.140> have<00:00:30.289> a<00:00:30.320> 5d<00:00:30.920> Mark<00:00:31.220> -<00:00:31.429> this<00:00:31.880> is<00:00:32.029> going<00:00:32.269> to

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
if you have a 5d Mark - this is going to

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.910 
if you have a 5d Mark - this is going to
be<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.509> lens<00:00:32.960> that<00:00:33.140> you<00:00:33.260> are<00:00:33.379> going<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.830> be

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
be a lens that you are going to be

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.090 
be a lens that you are going to be
interested<00:00:34.400> in<00:00:34.629> at<00:00:35.629> 8<00:00:35.900> millimetres<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:36.949> get

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
interested in at 8 millimetres you get

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.039 
interested in at 8 millimetres you get
something<00:00:37.430> called<00:00:37.549> a<00:00:37.729> circular<00:00:38.269> fisheye<00:00:38.479> and

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:39.049 
something called a circular fisheye and

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:41.829 
something called a circular fisheye and
what<00:00:39.170> that<00:00:39.320> means<00:00:39.620> is<00:00:39.979> that<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.330> lens<00:00:41.570> is

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
what that means is that the the lens is

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.670 
what that means is that the the lens is
able<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.260> capture<00:00:42.470> a<00:00:43.210> 180<00:00:44.210> degree<00:00:44.510> field<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.589> if

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
able to capture a 180 degree field so if

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.899 
able to capture a 180 degree field so if
you're<00:00:45.799> pointing<00:00:45.979> the<00:00:46.220> lens<00:00:46.400> straight<00:00:46.760> up

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:46.909 
you're pointing the lens straight up

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:50.410 
you're pointing the lens straight up
straight<00:00:47.900> down<00:00:47.989> or<00:00:48.409> even<00:00:49.040> you<00:00:49.879> know<00:00:49.909> sideways

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
straight down or even you know sideways

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.689 
straight down or even you know sideways
it<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.320> going<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.710> get<00:00:51.830> a<00:00:51.860> tremendous<00:00:52.489> amount

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
it is going to get a tremendous amount

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:54.460 
it is going to get a tremendous amount
of<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.940> landscape<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.780> shot<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:54.229> kind<00:00:54.379> of

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
of the landscape in the shot and kind of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.829 
of the landscape in the shot and kind of
shrink<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:54.830> in<00:00:54.979> of<00:00:55.850> course<00:00:55.940> there's<00:00:56.510> going<00:00:56.689> to

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
shrink it in of course there's going to

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.380 
shrink it in of course there's going to
be<00:00:56.930> some<00:00:57.320> distortion<00:00:57.710> but<00:00:58.549> that<00:00:58.790> is<00:00:59.030> what

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
be some distortion but that is what

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.359 
be some distortion but that is what
makes<00:00:59.659> this<00:00:59.900> a<00:01:00.110> fun<00:01:00.439> lens<00:01:00.739> it's<00:01:01.040> a<00:01:01.100> very

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
makes this a fun lens it's a very

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.299 
makes this a fun lens it's a very
different<00:01:01.790> type<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.600> look<00:01:02.869> and<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:03.920> it's

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
different type of look and it's it's

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.630 
different type of look and it's it's
really<00:01:04.519> cool<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.879> play<00:01:04.970> around<00:01:05.239> with<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:06.640> lens

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
really cool to play around with the lens

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.330 
really cool to play around with the lens
allows<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.479> go<00:01:08.630> from<00:01:08.840> 8<00:01:09.049> millimeters<00:01:09.619> to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
allows you to go from 8 millimeters to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.370 
allows you to go from 8 millimeters to
15<00:01:10.700> millimeters<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.840> a<00:01:11.869> strength

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
15 millimeters and this is a strength

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.740 
15 millimeters and this is a strength
because<00:01:12.859> if<00:01:13.070> you've<00:01:13.219> ever<00:01:13.310> shot<00:01:13.670> with<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.270> fixed

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
because if you've ever shot with a fixed

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.130 
because if you've ever shot with a fixed
prime<00:01:15.049> fisheye<00:01:15.859> you<00:01:16.789> know<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:17.840> have<00:01:17.990> to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
prime fisheye you know that you have to

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.289 
prime fisheye you know that you have to
move<00:01:18.289> your<00:01:18.350> feet<00:01:18.530> in<00:01:19.039> sometimes<00:01:19.640> there's<00:01:19.909> just

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
move your feet in sometimes there's just

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.719 
move your feet in sometimes there's just
not<00:01:20.450> enough<00:01:20.509> room<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.100> being<00:01:22.460> able<00:01:22.579> to

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
not enough room and so being able to

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.239 
not enough room and so being able to
zoom<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.179> and<00:01:23.359> out<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.719> going<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.530> allow<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:24.950> to

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:25.249 
zoom in and out is going to allow you to

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:27.669 
zoom in and out is going to allow you to
adapt<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.329> focal<00:01:26.840> range<00:01:26.990> according<00:01:27.499> to<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
adapt the focal range according to the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.190 
adapt the focal range according to the
shooting<00:01:27.979> situation<00:01:28.579> so<00:01:29.509> we<00:01:29.810> were<00:01:29.929> at<00:01:30.049> this

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
shooting situation so we were at this

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.310 
shooting situation so we were at this
temple<00:01:30.679> in<00:01:30.859> Burma<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:32.179> was<00:01:32.299> able<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.600> use

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
temple in Burma and I was able to use

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.080 
temple in Burma and I was able to use
that<00:01:33.499> lens<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.920> get<00:01:34.039> all<00:01:34.219> kinds<00:01:34.429> of<00:01:34.640> cool<00:01:34.819> shots

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
that lens to get all kinds of cool shots

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.919 
that lens to get all kinds of cool shots
a<00:01:36.579> few<00:01:37.579> other<00:01:37.909> things<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.240> really<00:01:38.539> really<00:01:38.749> liked

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
a few other things I really really liked

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.319 
a few other things I really really liked
about<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:39.229> is<00:01:39.439> that<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.429> is<00:01:40.579> built<00:01:40.880> like<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.210> tank

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
about it is that it is built like a tank

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.090 
about it is that it is built like a tank
it's<00:01:41.840> made<00:01:41.990> out<00:01:42.109> of<00:01:42.200> metal<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.770> little<00:01:42.979> bit

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
it's made out of metal it's a little bit

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.910 
it's made out of metal it's a little bit
smaller<00:01:43.450> I'm<00:01:44.450> not<00:01:44.780> a<00:01:44.810> fan<00:01:45.109> of<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.319> lens<00:01:45.499> hood<00:01:45.710> I

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
smaller I'm not a fan of the lens hood I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.010 
smaller I'm not a fan of the lens hood I
didn't<00:01:46.189> shoot<00:01:46.399> with<00:01:46.549> lens<00:01:46.819> hood<00:01:46.999> on<00:01:47.149> at<00:01:47.299> all<00:01:47.450> it

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
didn't shoot with lens hood on at all it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.419 
didn't shoot with lens hood on at all it
kind<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.289> got<00:01:48.409> into<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.770> way<00:01:48.889> when<00:01:49.249> I<00:01:49.280> was

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
kind of got into the way when I was

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.219 
kind of got into the way when I was
shooting<00:01:49.549> at<00:01:49.789> 8<00:01:49.909> millimeters<00:01:50.389> now<00:01:50.899> two<00:01:50.960> things

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
shooting at 8 millimeters now two things

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.289 
shooting at 8 millimeters now two things
that<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.469> didn't<00:01:51.799> really<00:01:51.920> like<00:01:52.039> was<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.119> fact

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
that I didn't really like was the fact

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.319 
that I didn't really like was the fact
that<00:01:53.389> it<00:01:53.569> was<00:01:53.719> a<00:01:53.749> maximum<00:01:54.380> aperture<00:01:54.740> of<00:01:54.770> f/4<00:01:55.329> so

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
that it was a maximum aperture of f/4 so

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.200 
that it was a maximum aperture of f/4 so
despite<00:01:56.780> having<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.200> very<00:01:57.439> sharp<00:01:58.130> image<00:01:58.999> in<00:01:59.119> a

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.899 
despite having a very sharp image in a
very<00:01:59.389> sharp<00:02:00.079> look<00:02:00.350> you're<00:02:01.280> not<00:02:01.399> going<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.819> get

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
very sharp look you're not going to get

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.969 
very sharp look you're not going to get
as<00:02:02.060> much<00:02:02.209> light<00:02:02.539> into<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.170> camera<00:02:03.380> as<00:02:03.740> you

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
as much light into the camera as you

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.819 
as much light into the camera as you
