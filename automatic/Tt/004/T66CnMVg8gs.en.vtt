00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello live broadcast took 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.400
 arrival fly my name is Ilya here 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.620
 according to the stories of different types and ways 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.179
 earnings over with which we have to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.740
 face it without forgetting to mention 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.940
 one how much money you can earn 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.940
 doing that 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.840
 Today we decided to try the most 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.869
 the world's fastest profession is a trainer and 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.830
 ceiling sash or rather sideways friends and 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.720
 we need to be 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.410
 professionals for this we called on 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.480
 our 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.110
 pad of the famous flocked program 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.110
 top gear 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.000
 could 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.350
 You can simply Andrei Andrei this is leading 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.120
 coach network of pictures of clubs pit stop 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.829
 it is this person who can teach you 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.379
 drive at lightning speed to 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.890
 no one could catch you but the first thing 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.899
 I want to ask this where it starts 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.610
 here is the lead coach and man 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.530
 who loves everything very quickly 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.670
 it seems to me to make the day 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.710
 should start with a coffee mug and quickly 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.479
 will not go again bypassed otherwise we are not 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.670
 wake up but let's drink some coffee and 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:18.500
 let's see what we will do next so 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.729
 what are the further points of the day 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.890
 kart coach 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.720
 by mentors to come onto the track for 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.789
 settling teach those who came on 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.860
 lesson to drive fast Andrei since 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.300
 i have no wrong i don't know how to drive me 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.250
 I would not want a car after all 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.929
 really hear as much as possible 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.659
 theories so that I somehow felt 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.119
 yourself on the track sure to track 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.080
 understand how the trajectory is built and how 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.700
 it's done i can show you at the blackboard 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.830
 so but as the main prime said 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.560
 trajectory as it is built now on 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.140
 Let's take a quick example. 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.690
 talker for example and there is a turn which 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.280
 goes nose to right on anyone's mouth is 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.520
 beginning-middle so -called and exit 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.360
 from turning to any turning here with 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.410
 the outside 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.239
 so I understood the most important thing before the start 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.459
 turning take action related to 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.410
 braking though either dumping gas or 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.629
 braking the gate and already the speed is not 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.640
 be able to yes that is how you got started 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.450
 port when it stands right you should 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 ottormozitsya after this let go 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.590
 brake and go to the apex 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.300
 without gas and then when you drive through 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.090
 apex start straightening the steering wheel and 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.890
 click on the gas here the split is not here 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.959
 you gently press and then 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.720
 it is no longer possible to wolf and sharp 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.130
 contrasts yes and why too soon 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.870
 many moments on the rear wheels 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.830
 have to and the card can slide on 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.720
 out of turn 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.970
 again the moment you should 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.709
 accelerate your cards 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.660
 effectively how could you matter 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.360
 brake and accelerate when you are destined 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.040
 stands up straight because unlike 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.230
 there is no differential in the card 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.959
 the rear wheels do not twist with the same 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.209
 speed and turn to the inside 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.800
 the wheel is trying to overtake down and she 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.390
 remember the drift 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.430
 therefore, it is desirable to put the role 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.960
 right click on the gas and then you 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.330
 Acceleration will be effective without slip 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.950
 how long does it take for coaches to 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.200
 order to teach the absolute beginner 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.630
 to some basic adequate level 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.620
 driving all people are very different to someone 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.570
 lacks the simplest sets of theory and they 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.150
 already but relatively quickly moving 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.480
 some need some on the highway 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.790
 once there to repeat the same until all 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.620
 actions don't reach automatism i 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.510
 I feel much more confident 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.460
 thanks for the theory what are we going to do 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.110
 further we will try to embody the theory 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.110
 in practice and let's go cards 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.000
 we skated I got huge 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.070
 but I still want pleasure 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.960
 figure out a few questions first 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.610
 Andrei how much to learn and whom 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.440
 you need to learn to become such a coach 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.760
 how are you quite a difficult question because 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.830
 what I studied 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.830
 Academy of Public Service on 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.580
 financier until a few years worked in 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.290
 the bank realized that it's boring, and basically and 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.610
 initially keen on karting you then 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.400
 it became my profession 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.050
 just need to ride a lot but this one 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.850
 of the options so much you ride 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.530
 be sure to get an education 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.360
 sports there I don't know any 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.410
 Of course, if you put in a goal like 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.600
 you can earn perfect 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.120
 end to my lesgaft we have yes there 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.830
 before coaching there faculty there shadow 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:25.320
 taught to drive fast but learn 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.320
 encode yes precisely pedagogy 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.229
 now the most burning question 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:39.529
 how much can you earn doing here 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.810
 these races these terrific well, roughly 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.500
 and hour lesson Engels costs one and a half 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.150
 thousand rubles how much 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.460
 you want to earn so much and 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.410
 earn a thousand and a half this 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.350
 very cool because if we take in 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.850
 the calculation is that you can at least 6 hours to 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.200
 day but there at 810 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.330
 well in the end 24 hours a day and 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.910
 the benefits of working very much besides 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.440
 and besides these here pedagogical 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.300
 hours can be somehow possible 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.060
 more money to make money now appears 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.400
 quite a lot of competition love 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.110
 karting has a prize pool enough 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.000
 not bad for example in our club 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.820
 in a month it will be played out there 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.680
 more than there 150 thousand rubles for the fund 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.590
 principle a good approach for lovers 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.200
 karting about 150 thousand left all 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.910
 our viewers will go to master this view 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.950
 sport will dangle 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.630
 pit stop come over there exactly teach you 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.120
