that's about the highest he's ever gone

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.550 
that's about the highest he's ever gone
Wow<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.430> did<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.730> manage<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.180> then

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
Wow so did you manage to get that then

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.470 
Wow so did you manage to get that then
did<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.590> did<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.609> how<00:00:23.789> high<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.000> went<00:00:24.210> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
did you did you see how high it went it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.820 
did you did you see how high it went it
went<00:00:24.600> very<00:00:24.900> hard<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.410> want<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.650> try<00:00:25.800> it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
went very hard do you want to try it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.120 
went very hard do you want to try it
again<00:00:26.180> yeah<00:00:27.180> go<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.750> then<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.260> yeah<00:00:28.949> well

simply<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> want<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.640> talk<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:29.910> today<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
simply I want to talk about today is is

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.520 
simply I want to talk about today is is
the<00:00:31.650> cymbal<00:00:31.949> eater<00:00:32.160> which<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.600> one<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.320> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the cymbal eater which is one of them is

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.990 
the cymbal eater which is one of them is
a<00:00:34.559> symbol<00:00:34.920> we<00:00:35.010> use<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.219> proportion

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
a symbol we use for proportion

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880 
a symbol we use for proportion
efficiency<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
efficiency this one here now this is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.330 
efficiency this one here now this is
this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.579> original<00:00:39.230> jet<00:00:40.230> engine<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:40.980> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
this is the original jet engine so it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.660 
this is the original jet engine so it
takes<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.820> air<00:00:43.160> compresses<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.280> up<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
takes in air compresses it up in a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400 
takes in air compresses it up in a
multi-stage<00:00:45.149> compressor<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.289> high

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
multi-stage compressor here to a high

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.560 
multi-stage compressor here to a high
pressure<00:00:46.590> then<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> burn<00:00:47.730> fuel<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> air

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
pressure then you burn fuel in the air

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.000 
pressure then you burn fuel in the air
and<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.840> gets<00:00:48.989> very<00:00:49.050> hot<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.710> when<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> gets

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
and it gets very hot and when it gets

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
and it gets very hot and when it gets
hot<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> expands<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.480> lot

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
hot it expands so it's going a lot

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
hot it expands so it's going a lot
faster<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.489> then<00:00:53.489> he<00:00:53.550> rushes<00:00:53.850> out<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> back

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
faster and then he rushes out the back

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.290 
faster and then he rushes out the back
now<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.680> engine<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
now now this engine here is a is a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.260 
now now this engine here is a is a
modern<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.230> modern<00:00:58.520> turbofan<00:00:59.520> engine<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.120> we

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
modern a modern turbofan engine as we

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.819 
modern a modern turbofan engine as we
call<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.989> most<00:01:01.230> modern<00:01:01.559> engine

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
call it and this is most modern engine

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.189 
call it and this is most modern engine
the<00:01:01.920> trent<00:01:02.190> 800<00:01:02.789> made<00:01:03.359> by<00:01:03.510> rolls-royce<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the trent 800 made by rolls-royce and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.609 
the trent 800 made by rolls-royce and
the<00:01:04.619> way<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.129> works<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:06.110> air<00:01:07.110> comes<00:01:07.409> in

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the way this one works is air comes in

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.429 
the way this one works is air comes in
at<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> front<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.689> small<00:01:10.080> amount<00:01:10.200> of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
at the front here and a small amount of

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.780 
at the front here and a small amount of
air<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.920> goes<00:01:11.130> through<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.490> compressor

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
air really goes through the compressor

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
air really goes through the compressor
it's<00:01:12.240> compressed<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.689> high<00:01:12.840> pressure<00:01:13.170> then

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it's compressed to high pressure then

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.109 
it's compressed to high pressure then
the<00:01:13.799> fuels<00:01:14.040> burnt<00:01:14.340> here<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.850> section

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the fuels burnt here in this section

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
the fuels burnt here in this section
that's<00:01:15.420> why<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.930> red<00:01:16.170> there's<00:01:16.409> got<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that's why it's all red there's got the

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.490 
that's why it's all red there's got the
flames<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.759> makes<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.110> air<00:01:19.229> then

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
flames there that makes the the air then

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.980 
flames there that makes the the air then
expands<00:01:20.310> goes<00:01:20.610> faster<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.570> comes<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
expands goes faster and it comes out of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.780 
expands goes faster and it comes out of
the<00:01:22.170> back<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> back<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.340> engine

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the back and on the back of this engine

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.230 
the back and on the back of this engine
instead<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:25.640> instead<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> having<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.970> small

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
instead of instead of having a small

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
instead of instead of having a small
turbine<00:01:27.659> we've<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.170> big<00:01:28.409> turbo<00:01:28.619> when

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
turbine we've got a very big turbo when

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.130 
turbine we've got a very big turbo when
we<00:01:28.979> take<00:01:29.159> most<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> energy<00:01:30.210> out<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
we take most of the energy out of the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.719 
we take most of the energy out of the
air<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.680> stage<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.250> doesn't<00:01:32.520> come<00:01:32.640> out

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
air at this stage so it doesn't come out

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.370 
air at this stage so it doesn't come out
very<00:01:32.970> fast<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> back<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> comes<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.170> quite

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
very fast at the back it comes out quite

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.230 
very fast at the back it comes out quite
slowly<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.070> instead<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.820> turned<00:01:36.090> this

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
slowly and instead it's turned this

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.270 
slowly and instead it's turned this

accelerates<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> relatively<00:01:50.460> low

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
accelerates it to relatively low

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.330 
accelerates it to relatively low
velocities<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.590> high<00:01:52.979> proportion

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
velocities so for a high proportion

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.760 
velocities so for a high proportion
efficiency<00:01:54.000> what<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.229> lot<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
efficiency what you want is a lot of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.700 
efficiency what you want is a lot of
stuff<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.700> quite<00:01:56.909> slowly<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.290> old<00:01:58.439> sort

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
stuff going quite slowly in the old sort

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.469 
stuff going quite slowly in the old sort
of<00:01:58.799> jet<00:01:58.979> engine<00:01:59.340> we<00:01:59.520> had<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> small<00:02:00.060> amount<00:02:00.360> of

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
of jet engine we had a small amount of

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.389 
of jet engine we had a small amount of
stuff<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:01.020> small<00:02:01.229> amount<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.560> air<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:02.189> very

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
stuff a small amount of air going very

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.929 
stuff a small amount of air going very
fast

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
fast

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.179 
fast
that<00:02:03.299> gave<00:02:03.509> us<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.659> similar<00:02:04.380> thrust<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.070> it

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
that gave us a similar thrust but it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.069 
that gave us a similar thrust but it
wasn't<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.549> efficient<00:02:06.060> because<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.780> takes<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
wasn't very efficient because it takes a

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.219 
wasn't very efficient because it takes a
lot<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.229> energy<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.710> make<00:02:07.890> air<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.340> fast<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
lot of energy to make air go fast in a

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.920 
lot of energy to make air go fast in a
modern<00:02:10.229> turbofan<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.390> lot

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
modern turbofan what we have is a lot

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.740 
modern turbofan what we have is a lot
more<00:02:13.170> air<00:02:13.349> going

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
more air going

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.660 
more air going
but<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.230> comes<00:02:14.440> out<00:02:14.650> slower<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.280> that<00:02:15.340> gives

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
but it comes out slower and that gives

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.210 
but it comes out slower and that gives
us<00:02:15.820> greater<00:02:16.360> proportion<00:02:16.900> efficiency<00:02:17.530> now<00:02:18.160> we

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
us greater proportion efficiency now we

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.100 
us greater proportion efficiency now we
can<00:02:18.550> I<00:02:18.760> can<00:02:19.150> demonstrate<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.630> with<00:02:19.960> this

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
can I can demonstrate that with this

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.780 
can I can demonstrate that with this
water-powered<00:02:20.620> with<00:02:21.250> this<00:02:21.370> water-powered

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
water-powered with this water-powered

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.810 
water-powered with this water-powered
rocket<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:23.050> we've<00:02:23.170> got<00:02:23.350> a<00:02:23.530> foot<00:02:23.950> pump<00:02:24.160> we've

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
rocket so we've got a foot pump we've

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.630 
rocket so we've got a foot pump we've
got<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> guidance<00:02:25.720> system<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.350> we've<00:02:27.340> got<00:02:27.460> some

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
got a guidance system and we've got some

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.580 
got a guidance system and we've got some
rocket<00:02:27.940> fuel<00:02:27.970> which<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.750> which<00:02:29.470> is

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
rocket fuel which is just a which is

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.480 
rocket fuel which is just a which is
just<00:02:29.800> some<00:02:29.950> water

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
just some water

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.820 
just some water
so<00:02:31.390> we'll<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.660> go<00:02:31.840> outside<00:02:31.990> onto<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.590> grass

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
so we'll just go outside onto the grass

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.699 
so we'll just go outside onto the grass
and<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:34.330> not<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.990> don't<00:02:35.170> huge<00:02:35.350> amounts<00:02:35.620> of

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
and it's not you don't huge amounts of

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.320 
and it's not you don't huge amounts of
water<00:02:35.800> mostly<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.430> straight<00:02:36.760> down<00:02:36.910> so<00:02:37.180> it's

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
water mostly go straight down so it's

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.570 
water mostly go straight down so it's
not<00:02:37.450> too<00:02:37.600> bad<00:02:37.890> now<00:02:38.890> actually<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.250> thing<00:02:39.430> does

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
not too bad now actually the thing does

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.690 
not too bad now actually the thing does
go<00:02:39.730> very<00:02:40.000> high<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:41.280> well<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.370> first<00:02:42.580> thing

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
go very high and well the first thing

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.510 
go very high and well the first thing
we've<00:02:42.850> got<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.780> need<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.080> put<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.520> the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
we've got is I need to put the the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.729 
we've got is I need to put the the
launch<00:02:45.700> site<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.300> have<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:47.080> guide<00:02:47.260> rod<00:02:47.500> so

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
launch site we have the the guide rod so

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:48.750 
launch site we have the the guide rod so
I'm<00:02:47.830> going<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:47.980> put<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.190> guide<00:02:48.370> rod<00:02:48.520> in<00:02:48.700> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
I'm going to put the guide rod in the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.460 
I'm going to put the guide rod in the
ground<00:02:49.000> just<00:02:49.180> here<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.630> this<00:02:50.110> makes<00:02:50.350> sure

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
ground just here and this makes sure

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.880 
ground just here and this makes sure
that<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.800> rocket<00:02:51.070> goes<00:02:51.250> up<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:52.890> relatively

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
that the rocket goes up that relatively

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.100 
that the rocket goes up that relatively
straight<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.340> doesn't<00:02:54.430> fall<00:02:54.820> over<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.390> come

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
straight and doesn't fall over and come

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.130 
straight and doesn't fall over and come
back<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.380> hit<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.830> face<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:58.540> if<00:02:58.750> then

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
back and hit you in the face so if then

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.630 
back and hit you in the face so if then
we've<00:02:59.260> got<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.830> rocket<00:03:00.130> it's<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.489> a

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
we've got the the rocket it's just a

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.000 
we've got the the rocket it's just a
it's<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.360> coke<00:03:01.540> bottle<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.590> first<00:03:02.770> one

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
it's just a coke bottle so the first one

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.380 
it's just a coke bottle so the first one
in<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.430> first<00:03:03.640> one<00:03:03.850> we're<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.030> going<00:03:04.360> to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
in the first one we're just going to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.229 
in the first one we're just going to
we're<00:03:05.140> just<00:03:05.170> going<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.530> fill<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.800> with<00:03:06.239> we're

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
we're just going to fill it with we're

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:08.640 
we're just going to fill it with we're
just<00:03:07.360> going<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.510> fill<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.750> with<00:03:07.870> air<00:03:08.020> so<00:03:08.410> here's

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
just going to fill it with air so here's

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.840 
just going to fill it with air so here's
the<00:03:08.770> rocket<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:10.350> we're<00:03:11.350> just<00:03:11.530> going<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.850> blow

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
the rocket and we're just going to blow

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:13.949 
the rocket and we're just going to blow
it<00:03:13.000> up<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.270> air<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.540> we're<00:03:13.660> not<00:03:13.750> going<00:03:13.900> to

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
it up with air and we're not going to

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.530 
it up with air and we're not going to
use<00:03:14.020> any<00:03:14.320> water<00:03:14.560> at<00:03:15.340> 35<00:03:15.820> pounds<00:03:16.300> per<00:03:16.510> square

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
use any water at 35 pounds per square

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.130 
use any water at 35 pounds per square
inch<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.410> nozzle<00:03:17.850> comes<00:03:18.850> out<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.989> bomb

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
inch the the nozzle comes out the bomb

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.410 
inch the the nozzle comes out the bomb
comes<00:03:20.410> out<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.400> air<00:03:21.760> compressed<00:03:22.239> air

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
comes out and the air compressed air

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420 
comes out and the air compressed air
inside<00:03:22.540> here<00:03:23.049> rushes<00:03:23.620> out<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.890> bottom<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
inside here rushes out the bottom and

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.420 
inside here rushes out the bottom and
pushes<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.940> rocket<00:03:25.209> into<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.480> air<00:03:25.660> and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
pushes the rocket into the air and

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.180 
pushes the rocket into the air and
because<00:03:27.430> we've<00:03:27.670> as<00:03:28.299> not<00:03:28.870> very<00:03:28.900> heavy<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:30.070> air

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
because we've as not very heavy the air

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.920 
because we've as not very heavy the air
comes<00:03:30.459> out<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:31.090> pressure<00:03:31.299> in<00:03:31.420> here<00:03:31.540> makes<00:03:31.780> the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
comes out the pressure in here makes the

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.600 
comes out the pressure in here makes the
air<00:03:32.019> come<00:03:32.200> out<00:03:32.260> very<00:03:32.500> fast<00:03:32.739> there's<00:03:33.430> not<00:03:33.580> very

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
air come out very fast there's not very

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.490 
air come out very fast there's not very
much<00:03:33.910> air<00:03:34.120> inside<00:03:34.540> there<00:03:34.810> comes<00:03:35.170> out<00:03:35.320> very

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
much air inside there comes out very

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.190 
much air inside there comes out very
fast<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.040> makes<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.430> rocket<00:03:36.700> go<00:03:36.850> go<00:03:37.600> up<00:03:37.810> but

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
fast and makes the rocket go go up but

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.440 
fast and makes the rocket go go up but
because<00:03:38.530> we've<00:03:38.739> got<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.220> small<00:03:39.880> amount<00:03:40.090> of<00:03:40.299> air

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
because we've got a small amount of air

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.240 
because we've got a small amount of air
going<00:03:40.780> very<00:03:41.320> fast<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.920> propulsion

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
going very fast the propulsion

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.650 
going very fast the propulsion
efficiency<00:03:42.430> isn't<00:03:42.940> very<00:03:43.180> good<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:43.570> it

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
efficiency isn't very good and it

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.870 
efficiency isn't very good and it
doesn't<00:03:43.810> go<00:03:43.989> very<00:03:44.230> high<00:03:44.410> all<00:03:45.280> right<00:03:45.430> so<00:03:45.730> we

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
doesn't go very high all right so we

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.840 
doesn't go very high all right so we
keep<00:03:46.329> pumping<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.019> it's<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.829> go<00:03:50.850> any

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
keep pumping and it's going to go any

00:03:51.850 --> 00:04:00.240 
keep pumping and it's going to go any
time<00:03:52.209> now<00:03:52.540> oh<00:03:55.620> there<00:03:56.620> we<00:03:56.709> go<00:03:58.860> now<00:03:59.860> that<00:03:59.890> wasn't

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
time now oh there we go now that wasn't

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.270 
time now oh there we go now that wasn't
really<00:04:00.519> very<00:04:00.820> high<00:04:01.230> now<00:04:02.230> when<00:04:02.590> we<00:04:02.709> go<00:04:02.799> now<00:04:03.130> what

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
really very high now when we go now what

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.850 
really very high now when we go now what
we're<00:04:03.430> going<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.579> do<00:04:03.730> is<00:04:03.910> we're<00:04:04.060> going<00:04:04.090> to<00:04:04.329> put

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
we're going to do is we're going to put

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.680 
we're going to do is we're going to put
make<00:04:05.860> it<00:04:05.980> about<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.220> third<00:04:06.459> full<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.910> water<00:04:07.150> I'm

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
make it about a third full of water I'm

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.030 
make it about a third full of water I'm
understanding<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.290> rocket<00:04:08.590> up<00:04:08.739> they'll<00:04:08.950> be

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
understanding the rocket up they'll be

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.430 
understanding the rocket up they'll be
watering<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.519> bottom<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.030> we'll<00:04:10.930> pump<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.320> up

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
watering the bottom and we'll pump it up

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.870 
watering the bottom and we'll pump it up
with<00:04:11.590> air<00:04:11.769> and<00:04:12.010> there<00:04:12.160> you'll<00:04:12.459> see<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.760> air

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
with air and there you'll see the air

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.979 
with air and there you'll see the air
bubbles<00:04:12.910> coming<00:04:13.480> up<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:13.720> it's<00:04:13.810> got

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
bubbles coming up and it's got

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.620 
bubbles coming up and it's got
compressed<00:04:14.829> air<00:04:15.010> on<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.220> top<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:16.269> when<00:04:16.450> the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
compressed air on the top and when the

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.930 
compressed air on the top and when the
rocket<00:04:17.019> goes<00:04:17.169> off<00:04:17.200> this<00:04:17.500> time<00:04:17.859> it's<00:04:18.669> pushing

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
rocket goes off this time it's pushing

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.759 
rocket goes off this time it's pushing
the<00:04:19.060> water<00:04:19.299> out<00:04:19.479> now<00:04:19.810> waters<00:04:20.200> much<00:04:20.410> heavier

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
the water out now waters much heavier

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.210 
the water out now waters much heavier
than<00:04:20.859> air<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:22.630> air<00:04:23.260> pressure<00:04:23.560> can't<00:04:23.979> make

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
than air so the air pressure can't make

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.089 
than air so the air pressure can't make
the<00:04:24.340> way<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> get<00:04:24.729> water<00:04:25.390> go<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:25.810> fast<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.890> we've

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:27.099 
the way I get water go so fast so we've

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:27.870 
the way I get water go so fast so we've
got

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
got

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.750 
got
water<00:04:28.390> coming<00:04:29.350> out<00:04:29.500> more<00:04:29.680> slowly<00:04:30.010> but<00:04:30.400> waters

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
water coming out more slowly but waters

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.220 
water coming out more slowly but waters
much<00:04:30.970> heavier<00:04:31.300> than<00:04:31.450> air<00:04:31.570> so<00:04:31.810> effectively

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
much heavier than air so effectively

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.040 
much heavier than air so effectively
what<00:04:32.440> we've<00:04:32.590> got<00:04:32.710> this<00:04:32.860> time<00:04:32.920> is<00:04:33.370> we've<00:04:33.550> got<00:04:33.760> a

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
what we've got this time is we've got a

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.610 
what we've got this time is we've got a
large<00:04:35.050> amount<00:04:35.110> of<00:04:35.440> stuff<00:04:37.380> coming<00:04:38.380> out<00:04:38.470> more

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
large amount of stuff coming out more

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.080 
large amount of stuff coming out more
slowly<00:04:38.800> and<00:04:39.220> this<00:04:39.400> gives<00:04:39.610> us<00:04:39.790> greater

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
slowly and this gives us greater

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.600 
slowly and this gives us greater
proportion<00:04:40.690> efficiency<00:04:41.200> so<00:04:41.800> what<00:04:42.220> happens

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
proportion efficiency so what happens

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.210 
proportion efficiency so what happens
now<00:04:42.820> is<00:04:43.260> for<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.320> same<00:04:44.500> amount<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.950> energy

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
now is for the same amount of energy

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.820 
now is for the same amount of energy
reporting<00:04:45.940> to<00:04:46.120> compress<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.200> air<00:04:47.230> in<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.620> top

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
reporting to compress the air in the top

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.710 
reporting to compress the air in the top
we<00:04:48.490> actually<00:04:48.820> get<00:04:48.970> greater<00:04:49.270> proportion

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
we actually get greater proportion

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.090 
we actually get greater proportion
efficiency<00:04:50.170> so<00:04:50.320> we<00:04:50.410> can<00:04:50.530> actually<00:04:50.650> go<00:04:50.860> further

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
efficiency so we can actually go further

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.560 
efficiency so we can actually go further
with<00:04:51.340> this<00:04:51.460> rocky<00:04:51.700> so<00:04:51.910> this<00:04:52.060> rocket<00:04:52.360> will<00:04:52.450> go

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
with this rocky so this rocket will go

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:58.200 
with this rocky so this rocket will go
very<00:04:52.810> much<00:04:52.990> further<00:04:54.240> Wow<00:04:56.100> incredible<00:04:57.120> when<00:04:58.120> we

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
very much further Wow incredible when we

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.520 
very much further Wow incredible when we
put<00:04:58.360> water<00:04:58.540> in<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.020> that's<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.410> bit

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
put water in and that's a bit

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.050 
put water in and that's a bit
counterintuitive<00:04:59.920> really<00:05:00.580> because<00:05:00.730> people

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
counterintuitive really because people

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.280 
counterintuitive really because people
think<00:05:01.180> oh<00:05:01.300> it's<00:05:01.330> got<00:05:01.600> water<00:05:01.810> in<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.080> must<00:05:02.200> be

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
think oh it's got water in it must be

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.540 
think oh it's got water in it must be
heavier<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.770> won't<00:05:02.950> go<00:05:03.070> as<00:05:03.100> far<00:05:03.340> but

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
heavier so it won't go as far but

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.520 
heavier so it won't go as far but
actually<00:05:03.820> goes<00:05:04.000> much<00:05:04.210> further<00:05:04.510> and<00:05:05.230> we've<00:05:05.380> got

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
actually goes much further and we've got

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.920 
actually goes much further and we've got
water<00:05:05.710> in<00:05:05.920> because<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.540> proportion<00:05:07.540> system

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
water in because the proportion system

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.260 
water in because the proportion system
is<00:05:08.020> more<00:05:08.200> efficient<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:09.670> this<00:05:09.820> time<00:05:10.060> what

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
is more efficient and this time what

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.450 
is more efficient and this time what
we've<00:05:10.390> done<00:05:10.510> is<00:05:10.870> strapped<00:05:11.260> thee<00:05:11.500> we<00:05:12.190> strapped

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
we've done is strapped thee we strapped

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.830 
we've done is strapped thee we strapped
this<00:05:12.580> camera<00:05:12.940> on<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.210> side<00:05:13.390> so<00:05:13.660> we're<00:05:13.810> going

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
this camera on the side so we're going

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.780 
this camera on the side so we're going
to<00:05:13.960> hopefully<00:05:14.200> we<00:05:14.560> have<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.770> NASA<00:05:15.070> I<00:05:15.370> view

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.750 
to hopefully we have a NASA I view
astronauts<00:05:16.720> eye<00:05:16.900> view<00:05:17.170> of<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.440> takeoff<00:05:17.860> I

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
astronauts eye view of the takeoff I

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.310 
astronauts eye view of the takeoff I
think<00:05:19.420> it<00:05:19.510> probably<00:05:19.780> won't<00:05:19.930> lift<00:05:20.080> off<00:05:20.230> the

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
think it probably won't lift off the

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.690 
think it probably won't lift off the
ground<00:05:20.410> at<00:05:20.650> all<00:05:20.740> because<00:05:20.980> this<00:05:21.130> camera<00:05:21.400> weighs

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
ground at all because this camera weighs

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.090 
ground at all because this camera weighs
more<00:05:21.940> than<00:05:22.380> weighs<00:05:23.380> more<00:05:23.560> than<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.800> bottle

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
more than weighs more than the bottle

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.050 
more than weighs more than the bottle
yes<00:05:24.820> right<00:05:25.330> okay<00:05:25.720> let's<00:05:25.960> try<00:05:26.110> this<00:05:26.230> one<00:05:26.590> right

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060
