yes I'm looking at this drawing page
this<00:00:07.740> comic<00:00:08.130> page<00:00:08.340> I'm<00:00:08.610> thinking<00:00:08.970> about<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
this comic page I'm thinking about a

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.970 
this comic page I'm thinking about a
problem<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.440> I've<00:00:10.679> loved<00:00:11.450> backgrounds

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:12.980 
problem that I've loved backgrounds

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.110 
problem that I've loved backgrounds
backgrounds<00:00:13.980> have<00:00:14.160> been<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.519> problem<00:00:14.880> with<00:00:15.000> me

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
backgrounds have been a problem with me

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.970 
backgrounds have been a problem with me
for<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> long<00:00:15.540> time<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:16.410> be<00:00:16.500> honest<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.800> think<00:00:16.890> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
for a long time to be honest I think I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590 
for a long time to be honest I think I
probably<00:00:17.130> would<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.460> benefited<00:00:18.000> from<00:00:18.029> going

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
probably would have benefited from going

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.380 
probably would have benefited from going
through<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:20.250> old<00:00:20.460> practice<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.180> having

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
through the the old practice of having

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.820 
through the the old practice of having
beginning<00:00:22.080> artists<00:00:22.410> working<00:00:22.560> under

beginning artists working under
experienced<00:00:23.430> ones<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.880> doing<00:00:24.150> all<00:00:24.420> drawing

the<00:00:25.140> backgrounds<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> artist<00:00:26.430> while

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the backgrounds for the artist while

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.310 
the backgrounds for the artist while
they<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.240> figures<00:00:30.320> something

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
they do all of the figures something

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
they do all of the figures something
that<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> recently<00:00:31.830> when<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.850> say<00:00:33.000> recently<00:00:33.149> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that I recently when I say recently I

mean<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> past<00:00:33.809> year<00:00:34.410> started<00:00:34.829> using<00:00:35.550> as<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
mean in the past year started using as a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.340 
mean in the past year started using as a
way<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.180> look<00:00:36.420> at<00:00:36.540> backgrounds<00:00:36.899> differently

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
way to look at backgrounds differently

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.569 
way to look at backgrounds differently
is<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:38.629> populate<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.170> backgrounds<00:00:40.950> with

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
is to populate the backgrounds with

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.790 
is to populate the backgrounds with
figures<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> sounds<00:00:43.410> like<00:00:43.440> common

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
figures now that sounds like common

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
figures now that sounds like common

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
sense if you're drawing an environment

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.970 
sense if you're drawing an environment
you're<00:00:45.809> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.170> want<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> have<00:00:46.559> figures

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you're going to want to have figures

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
you're going to want to have figures
going<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.670> drawing<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> mall

going in there if you're drawing a mall

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
going in there if you're drawing a mall
you<00:00:48.660> could<00:00:48.780> want<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.140> people<00:00:49.350> shoppers

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
you could want to have people shoppers

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the most part we tend to focus on figure

in cars and buildings draw a lot of cars

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.230 
in cars and buildings draw a lot of cars
and<00:01:11.310> buildings<00:01:11.640> they<00:01:11.790> probably<00:01:12.030> don't

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and buildings they probably don't

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
and buildings they probably don't
necessarily<00:01:12.540> even<00:01:12.600> draw<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.140> many<00:01:13.950> figures

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
necessarily even draw as many figures

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
animals if that's what you're good at

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.870 
animals if that's what you're good at
drawing<00:01:24.710> then<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.979> more<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.340> those<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.610> you

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
drawing then the more of those that you

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.940 
drawing then the more of those that you
fill<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.210> background<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.590> less<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
fill your background with the less you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
have to draw in background details now

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.310 
have to draw in background details now
it<00:01:32.369> sounds<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.180> I'm<00:01:33.329> trying<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.869> take<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
it sounds like I'm trying to take a a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.200 
it sounds like I'm trying to take a a
lazy<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> make<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> short<00:01:35.939> cut<00:01:36.180> but

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
lazy way out and make a short cut but

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
lazy way out and make a short cut but
the<00:01:36.540> truth<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.170> really<00:01:37.500> believe

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the truth is is that I really believe

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.700 
the truth is is that I really believe
that<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.630> common-sense<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that it's a common-sense thing that I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
that it's a common-sense thing that I

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and that if you're used to drawing a lot

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.170 
and that if you're used to drawing a lot
of<00:01:49.680> figures<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> time<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> that's<00:01:51.030> what

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
of figures all the time and that's what

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.330 
of figures all the time and that's what
you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> draw<00:01:51.540> quickly<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:52.799> when<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.130> draw

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you can draw quickly then when you draw

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.859 
you can draw quickly then when you draw
a<00:01:53.610> sidewalk<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:55.170> yeah<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.799> may<00:01:56.100> draw<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.869> box

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
a sidewalk then yeah you may draw a box

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.620 
a sidewalk then yeah you may draw a box
to<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.159> shape<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.729> car<00:01:59.939> but

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630

it<00:02:21.480> means<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.870> don't<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.140> draw<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:23.070> many

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
it means you don't have to draw as many

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.030 
it means you don't have to draw as many
tires<00:02:24.240> around<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.780> car<00:02:25.050> or<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.350> many<00:02:25.440> bricks<00:02:25.860> on
