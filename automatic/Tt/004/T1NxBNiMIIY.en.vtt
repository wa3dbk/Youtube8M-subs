00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.659 

this<00:04:23.050> is<00:04:23.229> one<00:04:23.409> of<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.650> first<00:04:23.889> level<00:04:24.220> that<00:04:24.520> we

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669 
this is one of the first level that we

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.550 
this is one of the first level that we
created<00:04:25.060> for<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.389> game<00:04:25.629> it<00:04:25.900> was<00:04:26.050> initially

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
created for the game it was initially

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.469 
created for the game it was initially
part<00:04:26.590> of<00:04:27.069> the<00:04:27.159> archives<00:04:27.669> level<00:04:28.030> which<00:04:28.240> we<00:04:28.360> were

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
part of the archives level which we were

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.570 
part of the archives level which we were
reaching<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.930> bit<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.770> we<00:04:29.919> just<00:04:30.159> started<00:04:30.340> out

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
reaching a bit and we just started out

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.309 
reaching a bit and we just started out
that<00:04:30.789> are<00:04:30.909> pretty<00:04:31.060> different<00:04:31.300> design<00:04:31.930> and

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
that are pretty different design and

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.200 
that are pretty different design and
when<00:04:32.470> we<00:04:32.620> read<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:32.919> sign<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.610> maps<00:04:33.909> did

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
when we read the sign that the maps did

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.559 
when we read the sign that the maps did
not<00:04:34.389> fit<00:04:34.720> this<00:04:35.530> cost<00:04:35.860> us<00:04:36.099> to<00:04:36.280> split<00:04:36.550> up<00:04:36.879> scatter

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
not fit this cost us to split up scatter

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.890 
not fit this cost us to split up scatter
them<00:04:37.810> out<00:04:38.129> so<00:04:39.129> in<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.370> first<00:04:39.400> design<00:04:40.150> off<00:04:40.449> to

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
them out so in the first design off to

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.869 
them out so in the first design off to
this<00:04:41.020> corridor<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.740> archives<00:04:42.370> level<00:04:42.729> were

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
this corridor the archives level were

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.180 
this corridor the archives level were
supposed<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.479> follow<00:04:43.690> and<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.440> room<00:04:44.680> langer

supposed to follow and the room langer

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.939 
supposed to follow and the room langer
now<00:04:45.400> was<00:04:45.699> still<00:04:45.940> much<00:04:46.150> better<00:04:46.210> in<00:04:47.169> fact<00:04:47.500> the

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949 
now was still much better in fact the

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:50.129 
now was still much better in fact the
first<00:04:48.220> asst<00:04:48.460> science<00:04:48.940> did<00:04:49.120> not<00:04:49.270> have<00:04:49.539> Daniel

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139

little program for stem cells went

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.279 
little program for stem cells went
through<00:05:21.549> a<00:05:21.579> lot<00:05:21.819> of<00:05:21.999> design<00:05:22.449> changes<00:05:22.989> during

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
through a lot of design changes during

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.429 
through a lot of design changes during
the<00:05:23.529> development<00:05:24.359> not<00:05:25.359> that<00:05:25.509> many<00:05:25.689> in<00:05:26.049> visual

structures<00:05:29.559> on<00:05:29.739> hand<00:05:30.599> this<00:05:31.599> happened<00:05:32.019> mostly

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
structures on hand this happened mostly

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.109 
structures on hand this happened mostly
because<00:05:32.529> at<00:05:32.889> the<00:05:32.979> beginning<00:05:33.099> we<00:05:33.609> only<00:05:33.759> knew

00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:34.119 
because at the beginning we only knew

00:05:34.119 --> 00:05:36.389 
because at the beginning we only knew
the<00:05:34.899> basic<00:05:35.259> stuff<00:05:35.499> that<00:05:35.739> needed<00:05:35.949> to<00:05:36.069> be<00:05:36.189> in

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:36.399 
the basic stuff that needed to be in

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.399 
the basic stuff that needed to be in
them<00:05:36.609> and<00:05:36.819> as<00:05:37.269> the<00:05:37.479> agree<00:05:37.659> on<00:05:37.779> features<00:05:38.199> and

them and as the agree on features and

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.469 
them and as the agree on features and
functionality<00:05:39.099> we<00:05:39.429> started<00:05:39.819> kind<00:05:40.059> of<00:05:40.239> fall

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
functionality we started kind of fall

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.259 
functionality we started kind of fall
apart<00:05:40.829> mostly<00:05:41.829> due<00:05:42.039> to<00:05:42.069> my<00:05:42.669> big<00:05:42.879> lack<00:05:43.089> of

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:43.269 
apart mostly due to my big lack of

00:05:43.269 --> 00:05:45.119 
apart mostly due to my big lack of
previous<00:05:43.779> experience<00:05:44.409> in<00:05:44.619> projects<00:05:45.099> like

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:45.129 
previous experience in projects like

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:47.819 
previous experience in projects like
this<00:05:45.749> right<00:05:46.749> now<00:05:46.929> allowed<00:05:47.289> what<00:05:47.529> the<00:05:47.649> hell

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:47.829 
this right now allowed what the hell

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:49.499 
this right now allowed what the hell
still<00:05:48.129> sounds<00:05:48.489> in<00:05:48.610> my<00:05:48.639> head<00:05:48.879> when<00:05:49.059> I<00:05:49.149> look<00:05:49.389> at

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:49.509 
still sounds in my head when I look at

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.989 
still sounds in my head when I look at
some<00:05:49.749> part
