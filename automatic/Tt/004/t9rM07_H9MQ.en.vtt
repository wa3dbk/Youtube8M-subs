 [Music] 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.000
 the Chinese so we use well 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.889
 obviously for the fee if we use 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.269
 in full of cakes it can also be 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.400
 a cake for children of things 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.110
 very very simple because it's very simple to 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.890
 make 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.519
 we start with four building sites on 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.490
 sugar we will mix the whole eggs 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:29.919
 and the sugar in a bowl we will ask his 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.870
 on a barrel then we will put some air 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.480
 we can also heat it a little bit 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.530
 and the determined little drummer 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.239
 do a little elbow grease it's not 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.340
 badly no we can start it at 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.170
 cold will no longer be long gold between 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.020
 the air you know it's like that in 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.000
 dollars and I check that it does not heat up 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.260
 too much to go kill the replace because 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.969
 I'm tired there go go on you put 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.859
 the probe in the device and as soon as that 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.670
 40 ° c good and there actually the fact of the 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.460
 to do like that is something 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.960
 a cake super years that without any 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.360
 chemical measurements it's really very 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.390
 good it's impeccable and you saw that 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.020
 all without suffering I managed to 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.290
 up virtually alone thou hast 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.689
 helped the pain but I saw the mixture 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.590
 hot it's really soft this sparkling 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:33.710
 helping will incorporate the melted butter and 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.299
 the flour at the same time all of a sudden to 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.600
 the ankle was going slowly I'm going 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.600
 do that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.780
 you see I'm going to search deep down 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.429
 readings do not knock everything down 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.890
 okay to go really hard enough 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.939
 slowly 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.310
 if there are some small lumps it is 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.380
 not important 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.280
 we have a cake circle like the pros 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.259
 understand it here we go and theirs 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.259
 always with butter pomade that 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:07.649
 the ointment and thicker butter and we go 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:10.970
 put a little bit of flour on 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.720
 garnish to two- thirds 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.090
 it will still inflate yes it will blow 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.569
 we go to the oven 170 ° we already preheat 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.190
 the oven then for 20 30 40 minutes 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.200
 then we'll do the famous knife test 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.170
 and that the soul comes out dry is cooked 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.450
 [Music] 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.549

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.700
 perfect in global has already listened to the cry 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.720
 of the sponge cake 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.819
 it's a moment of great emotion 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.470
 angie l'oise which is well cooked which is 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.880
 very soft we will leave well 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.060
 cool we see there we will take care of it
