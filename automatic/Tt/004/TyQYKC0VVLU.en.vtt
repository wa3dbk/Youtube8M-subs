tend to produce more adiponectin and
that's<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:10.080> thing<00:01:10.460> unfortunately<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.640> we

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
that's a good thing unfortunately as we

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.260 
that's a good thing unfortunately as we
gain<00:01:12.150> weight<00:01:12.510> as<00:01:12.900> our<00:01:13.619> fat<00:01:14.040> cells<00:01:14.070> become<00:01:14.970> fat

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
gain weight as our fat cells become fat
