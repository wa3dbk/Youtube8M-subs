survival<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.199> Beastmaster<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.910> just

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
survival and Beastmaster so as you just

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.530 
survival and Beastmaster so as you just
saw<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.570> inspected<00:00:43.470> a<00:00:43.769> hunter<00:00:44.309> who<00:00:44.519> I<00:00:44.940> thought

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
saw I inspected a hunter who I thought

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.860 
saw I inspected a hunter who I thought
was<00:00:45.780> very<00:00:46.050> closely<00:00:46.559> geared<00:00:47.159> as<00:00:47.400> me<00:00:47.610> his<00:00:48.600> name

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
was very closely geared as me his name

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.120 
was very closely geared as me his name
was

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
was

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.430 
was
shockwave<00:00:51.130> and<00:00:51.510> he<00:00:52.510> was<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.720> survival<00:00:53.170> hunter

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
shockwave and he was a survival hunter

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.680 
shockwave and he was a survival hunter
his<00:00:53.980> gear<00:00:54.430> was<00:00:54.670> a<00:00:54.700> little<00:00:55.000> bit<00:00:55.120> lower<00:00:55.420> than

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
his gear was a little bit lower than

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
his gear was a little bit lower than
mine<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:57.100> terms<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.640> overall<00:00:57.900> stats<00:00:58.900> however

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
mine in terms of overall stats however

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.180 
mine in terms of overall stats however
it<00:01:00.100> was<00:01:00.280> close<00:01:00.640> enough<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:01.150> I<00:01:01.560> considered<00:01:02.560> it<00:01:02.680> a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
it was close enough so I considered it a

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.730 
it was close enough so I considered it a
good<00:01:04.000> enough<00:01:04.239> comparison

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
good enough comparison

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.969 
good enough comparison
however<00:01:07.740> there's<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.100> person<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.729> didn't

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
however there's one person that I didn't

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.000 
however there's one person that I didn't
expect<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:12.260> Bravo<00:01:13.260> another

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
expect and that was Bravo another

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.600 
expect and that was Bravo another
survival<00:01:14.820> hunter<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.299> his<00:01:15.690> dps<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.710> his<00:01:17.040> gear

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
survival hunter and his dps or his gear

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.289 
survival hunter and his dps or his gear
was<00:01:18.119> actually<00:01:19.310> insanely<00:01:20.310> better<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:21.150> mine

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
was actually insanely better than mine

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.930 
was actually insanely better than mine
whether<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.530> main<00:01:22.710> weapon<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.759> few

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
whether it's a main weapon or just a few

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.770 
whether it's a main weapon or just a few
of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.300> weapons<00:01:24.770> he<00:01:25.770> didn't<00:01:26.280> however

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
of the other weapons he didn't however

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
of the other weapons he didn't however
fully<00:01:27.780> buffed<00:01:28.110> himself<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> with<00:01:29.009> food<00:01:29.399> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
fully buffed himself and with food and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090 
fully buffed himself and with food and
flasks<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.390> also<00:01:31.140> he<00:01:31.259> didn't<00:01:31.530> fully<00:01:31.740> gem

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
flasks and also he didn't fully gem

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.090 
flasks and also he didn't fully gem
however<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:33.240> think<00:01:33.690> in<00:01:34.080> terms<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.440> item<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
however I think in terms of item and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.710 
however I think in terms of item and
everything<00:01:35.600> he

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
everything he

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.240 
everything he
just<00:01:38.170> still<00:01:38.380> superior

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.390 

and<00:01:41.370> I'll<00:01:41.940> have<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
and I'll have a

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.240 
and I'll have a
better<00:01:44.030> comparison<00:01:44.690> of<00:01:45.050> his<00:01:45.590> items<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:46.130> my

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
better comparison of his items and my

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.850 
better comparison of his items and my
later<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.910> in<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.120> video<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.110> as<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.320> saw<00:01:48.590> we

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
later on in the video so as you saw we

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.540 
later on in the video so as you saw we
just<00:01:49.070> wiped<00:01:49.280> because<00:01:49.790> on<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.630> trash<00:01:51.550> tours

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550

they<00:01:54.610> will<00:01:55.030> actually<00:01:55.210> start<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.049> grow<00:01:56.409> in<00:01:56.590> size

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
they will actually start to grow in size

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.499 
they will actually start to grow in size
and<00:01:57.360> explode<00:01:58.360> if<00:01:59.079> you<00:01:59.200> don't<00:01:59.380> kill<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.799> ad

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and explode if you don't kill the ad

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.569 
and explode if you don't kill the ad
within<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.630> certain<00:02:01.869> amount<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.409> time<00:02:02.590> so

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
within a certain amount of time so

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.020 
within a certain amount of time so
that's<00:02:04.049> something<00:02:05.049> everyone<00:02:05.409> will<00:02:05.829> have<00:02:06.009> to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
that's something everyone will have to

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.690 
that's something everyone will have to
pay<00:02:08.569> attention<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:09.259> if<00:02:09.470> you<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.369> someone<00:02:10.610> in

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750

instantly now when one minion dies
another<00:04:12.500> one<00:04:12.799> will<00:04:13.010> respawn<00:04:13.280> within<00:04:13.819> three<00:04:14.239> to

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
another one will respawn within three to

another one will respawn within three to

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
five seconds of that minion being killed

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.750 
five seconds of that minion being killed
so<00:04:17.840> now<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.799> off<00:04:18.949> tank<00:04:19.160> will<00:04:19.280> have<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.489> pick<00:04:19.609> up

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
so now the off tank will have to pick up

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.360

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
at the TPS meters I actually did more

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.630 
at the TPS meters I actually did more

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
that one instance in terms of the trash

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.580 
that one instance in terms of the trash
he<00:06:06.250> did<00:06:07.470> far<00:06:08.470> superior<00:06:08.950> TPS<00:06:09.580> to<00:06:10.210> me<00:06:10.360> and

he did far superior TPS to me and

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.800 
he did far superior TPS to me and
it<00:06:13.040> really<00:06:13.340> would<00:06:13.550> have<00:06:13.580> to<00:06:13.790> depend<00:06:14.090> on<00:06:14.270> the

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
it really would have to depend on the

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.710 
it really would have to depend on the
which<00:06:15.380> box<00:06:15.650> for<00:06:15.860> fighting<00:06:16.250> and<00:06:16.600> you<00:06:17.600> know

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
which box for fighting and you know

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.880 
which box for fighting and you know
under<00:06:18.320> what<00:06:18.350> circumstances<00:06:19.250> the<00:06:20.210> GPS<00:06:20.810> of<00:06:21.050> the

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:21.890 
under what circumstances the GPS of the

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.520 
under what circumstances the GPS of the
Beastmasters<00:06:22.520> is<00:06:22.790> no<00:06:23.660> compared<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.230> a

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
Beastmasters is no compared to a

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.720 
Beastmasters is no compared to a
survival<00:06:25.100> and<00:06:25.310> so<00:06:26.030> this<00:06:26.780> is<00:06:26.840> just<00:06:27.200> one<00:06:28.130> of<00:06:28.160> my

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
survival and so this is just one of my

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.170 
survival and so this is just one of my
many<00:06:28.760> tests<00:06:29.510> that<00:06:29.630> I'll<00:06:29.780> do<00:06:29.990> between<00:06:31.180> these

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
many tests that I'll do between these

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.350 
many tests that I'll do between these
masters<00:06:32.720> survival<00:06:33.590> and<00:06:33.800> marksman<00:06:34.430> TPS<00:06:34.820> so

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
masters survival and marksman TPS so

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.390 
masters survival and marksman TPS so
stay<00:06:35.660> tuned<00:06:35.870> and<00:06:36.110> I'll<00:06:36.620> have<00:06:36.830> more<00:06:36.980> videos<00:06:37.280> for

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 
stay tuned and I'll have more videos for

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.850 
stay tuned and I'll have more videos for
