00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
 Edo is also a toy Today is night sleep 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:12.219
 But what time it's too late now 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:17.560
 It is half past 1 o'clock work is a bit late today to shoot a bit 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:21.160
 There in game apps also but I'm shooting from the 1:30 I want to really introduce the 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.850
 I would like to introduce you briefly 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.460
 The game I want to introduce is this fantasy 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.220
 record 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.610
 Oh 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.080
 keeper 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:36.670
 And a little bit of music, so good music is flowing now 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:42.399
 Music does not play because the problem of copyright seems a bit entangled 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:46.870
 Since the crystal of music Toka battle music of up to ff music now it has been blown plenty 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:51.550
 If you are interested, you can download it for free, so please give it a try . 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.089
 Speaking of what kind of game is so popular in recent games, there is nothing left 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.660
 you know 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:01:01.790
 Just this and this Final Fantasy Record keeper nice 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.980
 As a pro, I can get a little mystery about the story of the final fantasy so far 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.330
 You know look at this screen 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.030
 Mist cave place ff cone guy underground water vein 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.200
 Cave of antrion 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.120
 I think that it is nostalgic to those who got tired of the final fantasy in real 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.280
 These dungeons are good 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.950
 As it is, I can play it with a feeling like a memory event, so if you look at a party or something 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.260
 The say the cloud and membership and mouse this 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.100
 I'm a hero in the original character of this game to put your name 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.200
 The Toka White Mage Toka Lydia It is this kind of a 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:42.600
 There is that last time, but I'm going to pick and combine these things by myself 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 I just play and Kai Well It is this Todd pattern is point to say that Todd pattern now 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.040
 Again, it sounds but I do not put out of you I'm airships ff Music is flowing music 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.170
 Kanakore 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.490
 I can choose to play a variety of abilities and equipment myself, but this is a seed 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.290
 There is a sid 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.950
 Would you like a little try recommend events simple guy softening 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.490
 wonder if in the good 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.780
 For example , cave of mist 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:12.220
 Is this a little easy place ? 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:16.390
 If you choose an event, you can get into a middle age party 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.530
 I guess roughly three Toka five and 75 Toka ne this dungeon 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.670
 There is 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.500
 Go ahead with it and finally fight with the boss 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:29.270
 It will be Well like a form event clear 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:35.660
 It is a reluctant hardness Tteyuu keep playing to consume some common stamina in recent games 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:37.270
 The active time patrol atb But I was doing this is the old old days ff Officer 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.430
 It has adopted 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.240
 Because there is Otomo, because Haruta 's dungeon is entrusted to Auto, it will continue to fight. 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.120
 It is easy victory 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:52.510
 Well, if you go ahead, there is no way to use the free warranty , so if you're Lydia, there's no problem 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.560
 But it is set as a special move or character 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.260
 In Toma to continue using its deathblow this 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.790
 Battle effective 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.000
 It is said that it is recommended to people 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.670
 The world that is drawn by dot painting is great, is n't it? 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.580
 Ff music 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.790
 Bonus points will be added depending on the circumstances of that clear ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.110
 You 're about raising the character level and making it stronger 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:23.130
 Or in here, of course there is that Gacha Reagacha and 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.319
 Well I the equipment there is Toka 11 consecutive Reagacha 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.730
 If you win but what did you say, such as add to bag hand 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:34.959
 In this room where you collect the crystal and consume it to do a gacha 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:40.389
 It is not different from the strike I admire the flow of the game that is big or big now 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.189
 I hit I Toka generation liked Final Fantasy gold in the fact that ff apps 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:46.310
 Seek to put in fantasy 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:50.120
 And I wonder if I'm glad the game is on the people of the generations that have been doing since I was a heavy punch anxiety 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.920
 I thought so well , today is the final fantasy 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.569
 I've introduced a record keeper a bit, but recently it was released 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.780
 I think there are many people who just started doing it 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.100
 It's really like going forward 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.690
 Hmm 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:10.560
 There is makes us to really fun and nostalgic feelings app 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.330

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.380

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:26.020
 No one else is 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.130
 I think I'm going to go to sleep with video editing 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.130
 It's over 20 lightly 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.540
