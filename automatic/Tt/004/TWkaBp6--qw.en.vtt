 starts in tecámac the program of 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.970
 vehicle recycling in the state of 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.970
 Mexico 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.349
 the governor of the state of mexico

 eruviel ávila villegas launched the 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.500
 State recycling program 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.800
 vehicles that in a first stage 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.770
 pretends to crush more than 30 thousand 400 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.199
 automotive in 4 months said vehicles 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.140
 they are in custody in 41 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.880
 deposits of 30 Mexican municipalities 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.830
 This measure is intended to protect the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.559
 environment of pollution of the 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.750
 air and water that by spills of 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.210
 oil or fuel are frequent in 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.809
 this type of deposits has two 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.809
 deposits 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.690
 with capacity are approximately 8 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.230
 hectares we are also talking about 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.780
 80 thousand meters the first stage in cranes 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.120
 Central of 2,683 vehicles 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.860
 we do not destroy them have a 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.989
 company contracted by the government of 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.790
 been in this land located in the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.409
 fractionation heroes tecamac the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.930
 hard scrap process 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.970
 between about 5 minutes 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.009
 emptying liquids that are stored in 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.130
 special containers that are 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.690
 confined to ecological technology 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.880
 responsible for the protection of waste 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.909
 the tires are also disabled 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.920
 the vehicle is ready to conform 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.690
 cookie name that is given to the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.690
 compaction of three vehicles 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.930
 in this way biscuits are spliced 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.540
 over biscuits what allows to optimize 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.150
 spaces and a better classification of the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.010
 junk and in experience as much as 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.620
 region or as secret the city council I know 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.990
 that many of these corralones in these 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.300
 above all, the junkyards generate a lot 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.190
 what is the theft to vehicles generates 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.560
 much abandonment of vehicles on track 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.510
 public and I think it's important that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.830
 let's make a comprehensive program and I think 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.140
 an excellent idea and I think they are very 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.480
 good start with this scrap it 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.610
 expects to raise 25 million pesos from 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.470
 which 70% will be for the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.149
 state government acquires more 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.240
 technology for the detection of 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.100
 stolen vehicles the remaining 30% will be 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.560
 for companies that participate in the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.690
 program as utilities and for payment of 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.840
 repair of damages to owners 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.880
 if necessary in a second 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.830
 stage the mexiquense administration puts 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.620
 in march five public corralones in 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.110
 Amecameca netzahualcóyolt ecatepec 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.090
 tlalnepantla and toluca which are 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.890
 are in the process of adaptation with 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.620
 the help of the coordinating office of 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.090
 insured risks to these places will be 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.069
 where all the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.170
 recovered cars with theft report 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.480
 for which the owners will no longer pay 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.129
 a penny to recover them will count 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.019
 with a specialized agency of the 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.300
 public prosecutor for complaints and 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.099
 claim of car theft the president 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.470
 He also explained that this process of 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.120
 crushing and recycling is done 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.069
 after a thorough census and 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.470
 exhaustive of the origin of the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.090
 vehicles in which all records 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.250
 they were verified by the attorney general's office 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.739
 state and the security secretary 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.310
