 Hi guys, I'm fine today I'll talk to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.839
 you an application that has already 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.389
 Sensation of the moment 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.099
 in just ten days it has had more than 10 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:21.449
 millions of users 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:23.730
 Somebody takes a guess, I 'm 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.619
 talking perez cook that the novelty of 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.240
 twitter for streaming video to 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 I live by the social network 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 today the videos are super high and it is 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.540
 a key strategy for 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.850
 different from its competitors is the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.190
 post videos on the internet and the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.200
 fashion then image is everything else 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.120
 applications that already use the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.219
 video with the warri instagram by 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 example the difference since the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.379
 country is good people are not sculpted 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.629
 use stream videos whether you record 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 a video in real time and already put in the air 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.920
 on the network and can still share 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.690
 twitter while you're won, you 're going to 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.800
 you can use the videos you already have 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 your gallery 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.210
 then the other periscope differential 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 is that it is fully integrated 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.790
 concrete 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.710
 every time you perform or 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.570
 transmission for example of a 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.680
 opening in your store will you do 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.140
 a collection launch cocktail 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.000
 be aggravated in the country little real time 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.280
 where and how it is here everyone crowded 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.829
 will be available for android too 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.869
