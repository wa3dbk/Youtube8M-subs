00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.550
 however protesters of acs to enter to comment the resolutions by 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.830
 respect for Chilean law 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.729

 senator in the next legislative elections in japan 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:05.369
 but the reactions from Peru continue the relatives of the victims of 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:09.039
 the slaughter of the cantuta a crime that is attributed to former president alberto 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:09.910
 fujimori 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.910
 regretted the announced decision so if it were followed 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.379
 the tied hands assured to feel happy the abortion 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.099
 sister of one of the nine students who murdered the facts of the 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.309
 cantuta in 1992 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:26.739
 from the date he has kept active his struggle to achieve Alberto bread 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.740
 entire state for alleged violations of human rights 

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.379
 they do not associate are very yours was hindered 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.719
 if we consider so unfortunately in these issues as the 

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:38.900
 issue of extradition 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.280
 others are the factors that also prevail that is also under pressure 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.419
 so that these processes are resolved 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.499
 and other actors ken evidence in this case of fujimori infection 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:51.729
 like the pressure exerted by japan 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.750
 as the pressure of groups of economic power in Chile that came then 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:59.099
 insisting on Alberto Fujimori's innocence that they were coming from some 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:06:59.860
 way 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.219
 by scientists so much the cons that the pronouncement of the 

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.490
 Chilean justice in favor of extradition 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.379
 the director of the association for human rights 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.949
 does not understand the decision of the Chilean judge orlando álvarez but trusts 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.770
 the appeal process despite the arguments presented by the prosecution 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.889
 Peruvian government present its report in Chile has not heard any judgment against 

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:22.819
 fujimori 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:27.080
 that is why we expect him to have announced the lawyers 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.689
 of the state but do not appeal before the court room second criminal court of the supreme court 

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:35.119
 that this rectifies but yes we will not accompany the relatives
