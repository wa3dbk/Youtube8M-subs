00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
that's not only guided by the steps but

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.720 
that's not only guided by the steps but
we<00:00:26.020> can<00:00:26.200> do<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:26.439> on<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:26.800> spot<00:00:27.160> we<00:00:27.460> can<00:00:27.579> do

down or we can do that to actually get a

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.510 
down or we can do that to actually get a
little<00:00:31.540> bit<00:00:31.720> closer<00:00:31.989> to<00:00:32.320> understanding<00:00:32.520> how

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
little bit closer to understanding how

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.300 
little bit closer to understanding how
the<00:00:33.550> motion<00:00:34.239> of<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.540> dancers<00:00:35.050> go<00:00:35.320> how<00:00:36.040> that

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
the motion of the dancers go how that

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.520 
the motion of the dancers go how that
actually<00:00:36.489> works<00:00:36.790> to<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.359> music<00:00:37.899> and<00:00:38.199> what<00:00:38.379> we

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
actually works to the music and what we

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.069 
actually works to the music and what we
should<00:00:38.710> be<00:00:38.739> feeling<00:00:39.340> from<00:00:39.640> an<00:00:39.789> energetic<00:00:40.570> kind

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
should be feeling from an energetic kind

should be feeling from an energetic kind
of<00:00:41.260> level<00:00:41.710> from<00:00:41.949> the<00:00:42.070> physicality<00:00:42.640> of<00:00:43.000> it<00:00:43.359> so

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
of level from the physicality of it so

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.090 
of level from the physicality of it so
