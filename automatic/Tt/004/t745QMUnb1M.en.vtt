Rory<00:03:08.120> best<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:08.870> his<00:03:09.739> team<00:03:12.489> again

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.949 

there's<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.030> lot<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.239> energy<00:03:21.599> need<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:25.560> look<00:03:25.799> to

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
there's a lot of energy need to look to

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.830 
there's a lot of energy need to look to
the<00:03:27.959> cross<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.439> is<00:03:28.590> cold<00:03:28.920> but<00:03:29.129> certainly

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
the cross it is cold but certainly

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.809 
the cross it is cold but certainly
austere<00:03:30.840> did<00:03:31.019> not<00:03:31.290> do<00:03:31.799> not<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.640> way

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
austere did not do not see it that way

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.050 
austere did not do not see it that way
it's<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.299> good<00:03:33.480> finish<00:03:33.870> by<00:03:33.900> O'Halloran<00:03:34.650> but

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
it's a good finish by O'Halloran but

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.580 
it's a good finish by O'Halloran but
Masterton<00:03:36.060> certainly<00:03:36.689> makes<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:37.049> nuisance<00:03:37.439> of

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
Masterton certainly makes a nuisance of

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:57.020 
Masterton certainly makes a nuisance of
himself<00:03:53.900> some<00:03:54.900> running<00:03:55.349> leaders<00:03:55.739> do<00:03:55.980> not<00:03:56.310> only
