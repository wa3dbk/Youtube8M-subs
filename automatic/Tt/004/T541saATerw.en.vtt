00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
problems let's take a look at a PDF the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.750 
problems let's take a look at a PDF the
biggest<00:00:51.120> issue<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.600> thing<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.350> slow<00:00:52.710> as

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
biggest issue this thing is as slow as

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.500 
biggest issue this thing is as slow as
molasses<00:00:53.760> quite<00:00:54.000> noticeable<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:56.180> let's<00:00:57.180> open

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
molasses quite noticeable so let's open

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.189 
molasses quite noticeable so let's open
this<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:59.030> now<00:01:00.030> let's<00:01:00.300> set<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
this up here now let's set this up to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.610 
this up here now let's set this up to

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.530 

so<00:01:10.620> there's<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> bit<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> lag<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.360> as

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so there's a bit of a lag it's not as

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.230 
so there's a bit of a lag it's not as
bad<00:01:13.040> after<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> while<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.030> able<00:01:15.120> to
