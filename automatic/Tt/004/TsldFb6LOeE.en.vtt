started thinking that this might have

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.230 
started thinking that this might have
been<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:22.159> defect<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> backpack<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.090> maybe

this teaching came off but then a couple

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.640 
this teaching came off but then a couple
hours<00:01:27.030> after<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> got<00:01:27.810> home<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.320> started

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
hours after I got home I started

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770

and<00:02:06.509> he<00:02:06.600> seemed<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:06.840> hurt<00:02:07.369> he<00:02:08.369> even<00:02:08.729> lost<00:02:08.970> a

and he seemed very hurt he even lost a

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.809 
and he seemed very hurt he even lost a
little<00:02:09.420> bit<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.599> SAP<00:02:09.929> tight<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:11.640> made<00:02:11.790> me

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
little bit of SAP tight and that made me

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.880 
little bit of SAP tight and that made me
realize<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.510> whatever<00:02:12.750> cost<00:02:13.200> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
realize that whatever cost is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.400 
realize that whatever cost is
must<00:02:14.490> have<00:02:14.640> probably<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.569> branch<00:02:15.990> getting

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
must have probably like a branch getting

stuck a probably the moment is probably

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.760 
stuck a probably the moment is probably
this<00:02:19.980> was<00:02:20.220> shanked<00:02:20.640> or<00:02:21.050> I<00:02:22.050> don't<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.500> what

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.800 
about it from they have a good return
policy<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:32.670> should<00:03:32.850> be<00:03:32.880> much<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.329> bunch

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
policy so it should be much of a bunch

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.850 
policy so it should be much of a bunch
of<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.989> trouble<00:03:34.320> but<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.570> don't<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:37.260> guess<00:03:37.739> this

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.970 
changes my opinion about his backpack I
don't<00:03:40.079> think<00:03:40.230> it's<00:03:40.320> bad<00:03:40.500> back<00:03:40.799> back

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
don't think it's bad back back

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.470 
don't think it's bad back back

especially we could find it for a good
price<00:03:42.780> but<00:03:43.680> for<00:03:44.100> about<00:03:44.459> 50<00:03:44.850> something<00:03:45.090> dollars

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
you and your dog I think it's a good

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.569 
you and your dog I think it's a good
first<00:04:03.810> model<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:04.980> want<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.280> try<00:04:05.519> to

first model and if you want to try to

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.940 
first model and if you want to try to
see<00:04:05.850> if<00:04:05.910> your<00:04:06.060> dog<00:04:06.239> likes<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.810> or<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.530> like<00:04:07.769> by

see if your dog likes it or you like by

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.860 
see if your dog likes it or you like by
the<00:04:07.980> way<00:04:08.100> you<00:04:08.220> don't<00:04:08.459> like<00:04:08.700> about<00:04:08.850> it<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.450> my

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
the way you don't like about it in my

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.349 
the way you don't like about it in my
case<00:04:10.370> I've<00:04:11.370> learned<00:04:11.730> that<00:04:11.910> this<00:04:12.030> back<00:04:12.090> there

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
case I've learned that this back there

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.940 
case I've learned that this back there
might<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.660> little<00:04:12.870> too<00:04:13.019> big<00:04:13.380> for<00:04:13.440> hunter

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
might be a little too big for hunter

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.250 
might be a little too big for hunter
because<00:04:14.549> not<00:04:14.850> because<00:04:15.060> he's<00:04:15.390> a<00:04:15.420> small<00:04:16.019> dog

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
because not because he's a small dog

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.069 
because not because he's a small dog
over<00:04:16.829> because<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.250> backpack<00:04:17.640> is<00:04:17.760> too<00:04:17.789> big<00:04:18.570> but

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
over because the backpack is too big but

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.469 
over because the backpack is too big but
because<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.560> has<00:04:19.739> more<00:04:19.769> space<00:04:20.640> than<00:04:20.970> what<00:04:21.359> he

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
because it has more space than what he

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.200 
because it has more space than what he
needs<00:04:21.720> he<00:04:22.049> usually<00:04:22.680> just<00:04:23.250> carries<00:04:23.700> just

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
needs he usually just carries just

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.810 
needs he usually just carries just
enough<00:04:24.510> water<00:04:24.750> for<00:04:24.900> himself<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.650> some<00:04:26.580> food

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
enough water for himself and some food

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.290 
enough water for himself and some food
he

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
he

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.149 
he
you<00:04:27.419> need<00:04:27.569> all<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.960> this<00:04:28.139> you<00:04:28.830> can<00:04:28.979> probably

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:29.159 
you need all of this you can probably

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.070 
you need all of this you can probably
carry<00:04:29.430> enough<00:04:29.729> for<00:04:29.909> three<00:04:30.180> days<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.599> this<00:04:30.780> and

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
carry enough for three days and this and

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.439 
carry enough for three days and this and
well<00:04:31.949> we<00:04:32.190> don't<00:04:32.430> do<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.639> kind<00:04:32.819> of<00:04:32.879> thing<00:04:33.120> for

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
well we don't do the kind of thing for

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.510 
well we don't do the kind of thing for
three<00:04:33.690> days<00:04:33.900> or<00:04:34.530> less<00:04:34.680> now<00:04:34.919> with<00:04:35.099> him<00:04:35.250> well

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
three days or less now with him well

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.820 
three days or less now with him well
it's<00:04:35.669> not<00:04:35.819> yet<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.870> for<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.319> railroad<00:04:37.500> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
it's not yet so for the railroad a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.770 
it's not yet so for the railroad a
hiking<00:04:38.129> I<00:04:38.430> probably<00:04:38.849> switching<00:04:39.599> to<00:04:39.720> a

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
hiking I probably switching to a

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.499 
hiking I probably switching to a
different<00:04:39.919> brand<00:04:40.919> backpack<00:04:41.490> I'm<00:04:42.180> thinking

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
different brand backpack I'm thinking

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.990 
different brand backpack I'm thinking
maybe<00:04:42.840> a<00:04:43.020> rough<00:04:43.500> where<00:04:43.800> they<00:04:44.610> have<00:04:44.759> some

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
maybe a rough where they have some

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.520 
maybe a rough where they have some
models<00:04:45.389> that<00:04:45.479> I<00:04:45.569> think<00:04:45.780> will<00:04:45.870> work<00:04:46.050> better<00:04:46.289> for

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
models that I think will work better for

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.749 
models that I think will work better for
him<00:04:46.879> and<00:04:47.879> also<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:49.139> backpack<00:04:49.530> tends<00:04:49.979> to<00:04:50.310> side

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
him and also this backpack tends to side

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.990 
him and also this backpack tends to side
a<00:04:51.060> lot<00:04:51.240> which<00:04:52.169> might<00:04:52.500> be<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.740> reason<00:04:52.919> why<00:04:53.310> he

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
a lot which might be the reason why he

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.570 
a lot which might be the reason why he
got<00:04:54.210> stuck<00:04:54.599> and<00:04:55.199> all<00:04:55.680> these<00:04:55.889> extra<00:04:56.190> straps

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
got stuck and all these extra straps

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.580 
got stuck and all these extra straps
offer<00:04:56.849> they<00:04:57.120> are<00:04:57.180> nice<00:04:57.419> to<00:04:57.690> sinking<00:04:58.110> down<00:04:58.289> the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
offer they are nice to sinking down the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.159 
offer they are nice to sinking down the
backpack<00:04:59.009> can<00:04:59.610> get<00:04:59.819> stuck<00:05:00.270> on<00:05:00.479> other<00:05:00.900> things

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
backpack can get stuck on other things

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.749 
backpack can get stuck on other things
as<00:05:01.469> you<00:05:01.740> saw<00:05:02.069> you<00:05:02.430> know<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.879> happening<00:05:03.300> so
