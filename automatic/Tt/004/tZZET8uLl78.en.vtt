00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.050
 the living chiefs always woke up 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.360
 curiosity in man several centuries 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.360
 before Christ the Greek thinkers 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.390
 they asked the same questions that we 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.030
 we do today they were wondering about 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.640
 example how living things work 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.760
 as its structure what are its 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.239
 similarities their differences how they 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.969
 relate to each other and to the environment 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:38.879
 Today we can say that knowing more about 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.850
 living beings is to know more about us 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.760
 and this is the great contribution of the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.399
 natural sciences what we do classroom 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.339
 open we think about giving a new use of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.800
 television giving you one more hour 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.249
 of classes to strengthen the proposals 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.499
 of teaching from the selection 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.350
 thorough of the contents the 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:04.110
 strategies and resources of the area 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 natural sciences to us moves us 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.530
 the idea of ​​sharing new paths 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.150
 add reflections and open debates with 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.510
 multiple actors and proposals 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.430
 is today I propose that we reflect 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.290
 about the importance of teaching 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.510
 of the natural sciences and 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.230
 use of resources and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.840
 own strategies of the area besides you 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.350
 I'm going to propose a methodology for 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 address new content in the classroom 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.190
 let's move on to development 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.950
 now 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.360
 from these classes on television 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.180
 we bring you proposals to generate 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.020
 situations that trigger new form 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.390
 of thinking about producing and imagining what we do 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.210
 from our place a place that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.119
 restless to renew the desire to 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.610
 learn we approach you with 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.310
 this proposal and with the commitment of 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.880
 accompany the schools in the objective 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.000
 to improve quality conditions 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.220
 equity and educational inclusion 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.380
 it is important to teach the 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.140
 natural sciences and the use 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.990
 of resources and strategies in the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.640
 schools because it puts into new uses 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:32.190
 problems exercises theories and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.590
 experiments that are typical of the area 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.140
 all this generates situations of 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.959
 learning in which the students 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.959
 they must analyze and process the information 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.290
 they should discuss and reflect on that 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 information formulate hypotheses and also 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.020
 look for justifications that just 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:55.350
 do this justify your decisions or 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.150
 your choices all this allows the 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.970
 students feel like little 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.550
 researchers exploring the universe 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.500
 that surrounds them and we also have to 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.810
 keep in mind that work with the idea 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.540
 of causality allows students 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.510
 look for models by means of which 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.850
 can observe interpret and explore 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.280
 the universe that surrounds them 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.070
 It is also important when it comes to 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.960
 build knowledge keep in mind 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.090
 the previous ideas of the students 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.120
 taking into account these previous ideas 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.790
 you can relate them to these ideas 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.810
 previous with new content and 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.300
 build well new concepts now they 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.280
 I propose that we review the concepts more 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.280
 important that we saw in this class 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.280
 today we saw that from these classes 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.590
 on television we bring you proposals 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.099
 to generate situations that 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:01.849
 unleash new ways of investigating 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:04.459
 of thinking about producing and imagining we said 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.159
 that the importance of teaching 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:11.319
 the natural sciences in the area is 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:15.319
 in which he puts problems in use 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.959
 experiments that are specific to the area and 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.750
 that all this is important because 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.539
 It serves the students to feel like 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.430
 small researchers exploring the 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.460
 universe that surrounds them with a 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.940
 scientific thinking we believe that all 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.330
 these these actions could strengthen 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.460
 actions that favor the common good and 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.039
 respect for the individual as a 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.289
 individual person but at the same time as 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.840
 member of nature that we 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.060
 surround now I pass you I propose that 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.360
 let's go to the activities 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.000
 let's experiment, I propose that when 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.700
 have to work new content in 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.639
 the natural science area you use 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.849
 this cycle that occurs on the plate 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.430
 This cycle consists of four stages that 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.029
 come to replace the stages of 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.819
 scientific method these stages can be 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:13.749
 do in any order what is important 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:17.629
 is that all four processes are met 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:19.370
 let's analyze these stages for example a 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.889
 Knowledge production can 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.409
 start from that of the 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.199
 approach to a problem or a 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:29.469
 problematic situation what next 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:32.689
 you can do is look for information 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:35.000
 collect data or look for experiments 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:38.240
 by means of which one can 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.779
 collect information and then 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.629
 can draw conclusions inferences 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:47.120
 or hypotheses that demonstrate these 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.909
 experiments finally to these 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.789
 conclusions can be applied in 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.370
 other uses or using other concepts 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.740
 today I say goodbye to you, hoping that 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.259
 open classroom has been useful for 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.510
 accompany in the learning process 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.180
 both students and teachers 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.980
 and the family you are not based 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.410
 because she comes to the teacher claudia 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.410
 with one more language class
