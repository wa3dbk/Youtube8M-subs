obvious<00:02:24.489> because<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.690> kind<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> risky

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260

you're giving the defender chance to get

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.370 
you're giving the defender chance to get
the<00:02:27.880> ball<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.569> if<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:28.810> can<00:02:28.930> pull<00:02:29.140> it<00:02:29.230> off

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
the ball but if you can pull it off

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.930 
the ball but if you can pull it off
you're<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.770> to<00:02:29.830> leave<00:02:30.040> them<00:02:30.190> in<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.370> dust

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
