I<00:00:23.279> honestly<00:00:24.279> believe<00:00:25.060> that<00:00:25.480> this<00:00:26.140> vehicle<00:00:26.650> is

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
I honestly believe that this vehicle is

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.990 
I honestly believe that this vehicle is
going<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.180> have<00:00:28.360> an<00:00:28.510> enormous<00:00:28.990> impact<00:00:29.529> on<00:00:30.340> the

motorcycle industry as a whole

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.299 
motorcycle industry as a whole
particularly<00:00:34.300> in<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:35.080> touring<00:00:35.559> segment<00:00:36.129> I

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
particularly in the touring segment I

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.100 
particularly in the touring segment I
don't<00:00:36.879> think<00:00:37.120> that's<00:00:37.330> going<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:37.900> happen

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
don't think that's going to happen

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.400 
don't think that's going to happen
immediately<00:00:39.720> even<00:00:40.720> though<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:41.050> interest

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
immediately even though the interest

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.700 
immediately even though the interest
level<00:00:41.830> is<00:00:42.040> high<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.629> going<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.199> take<00:00:44.470> a

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
level is high it's going to take a

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.130 
level is high it's going to take a
little<00:00:44.980> while<00:00:45.280> for<00:00:45.309> it<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.850> catch<00:00:46.090> on<00:00:46.420> but

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
little while for it to catch on but

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.220 
little while for it to catch on but

industry I've only seen two or three

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.880 
industry I've only seen two or three
really<00:01:09.340> groundbreaking<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.750> vehicles<00:01:11.560> come

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
really groundbreaking the vehicles come

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.030 
really groundbreaking the vehicles come
around<00:01:12.130> vehicles<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:12.940> defined<00:01:13.540> an<00:01:14.040> entirely

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
around vehicles that defined an entirely

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.679 
around vehicles that defined an entirely
new<00:01:15.610> niche<00:01:16.060> within<00:01:17.130> motorcycling<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:19.420> I

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
new niche within motorcycling and this I

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.289 
new niche within motorcycling and this I
believe<00:01:19.750> is<00:01:20.530> one<00:01:21.100> of<00:01:21.130> them

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
believe is one of them

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
believe is one of them

three-wheeled luxury touring bike I

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.440 
three-wheeled luxury touring bike I
think<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.550> things<00:02:33.790> that<00:02:34.030> interests

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
think one of the things that interests

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.900 
think one of the things that interests
me<00:02:34.540> most<00:02:34.960> about<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.950> thousands<00:02:36.490> of<00:02:36.550> people

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
me most about the thousands of people

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.120 
me most about the thousands of people
we've<00:02:37.060> talked<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.110> far<00:02:38.140> is<00:02:39.660> how

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
we've talked to so far is how

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.400 
we've talked to so far is how
wide-ranging<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:43.120> interest<00:02:43.540> level<00:02:43.960> is<00:02:44.140> it

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
wide-ranging the interest level is it

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.250 
wide-ranging the interest level is it
doesn't<00:02:45.100> come<00:02:45.760> down<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:46.240> one<00:02:46.450> specific<00:02:46.780> group

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
doesn't come down to one specific group

and the word starts getting out about
them<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.290> really<00:04:39.250> think<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:40.360> dealerships

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
them I really think that the dealerships

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.380 
them I really think that the dealerships
are<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.280> be<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.520> ones<00:04:42.700> that<00:04:42.850> reap<00:04:43.180> the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
are going to be the ones that reap the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.660 
are going to be the ones that reap the
most<00:04:43.600> benefits<00:04:44.200> from<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.590> because<00:04:45.460> it's

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
most benefits from this because it's

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.570 
most benefits from this because it's
going<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.000> bring<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.900> whole<00:04:47.890> new<00:04:48.160> group<00:04:48.400> of

somewhere
none<00:05:42.670> of<00:05:42.700> it<00:05:42.970> is<00:05:43.470> radically<00:05:44.470> new<00:05:44.770> but<00:05:45.490> what's

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
none of it is radically new but what's

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.990 
none of it is radically new but what's
important<00:05:46.360> is<00:05:46.560> that<00:05:47.560> no<00:05:47.800> one<00:05:48.070> has<00:05:48.100> ever<00:05:48.520> put<00:05:48.880> it

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
important is that no one has ever put it

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.020 
important is that no one has ever put it
all<00:05:49.210> together<00:05:49.810> in<00:05:50.530> a<00:05:50.770> single<00:05:50.800> package<00:05:51.790> before

no one's even come close this for the
first<00:05:55.720> time<00:05:56.080> is<00:05:56.770> the<00:05:56.860> complete<00:05:57.670> package<00:05:58.600> and

at<00:06:00.100> a<00:06:00.220> price<00:06:00.750> so<00:06:01.750> much<00:06:01.960> lower<00:06:02.350> than<00:06:03.160> what<00:06:03.760> you

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
at a price so much lower than what you

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.330 
at a price so much lower than what you

vehicle to reach this level of

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.710 
vehicle to reach this level of
Technology<00:06:09.510> it's<00:06:10.510> astounding

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
Technology it's astounding

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.780
