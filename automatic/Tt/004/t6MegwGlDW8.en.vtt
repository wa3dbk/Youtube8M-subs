 yes photos immerse one very 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.670
 slowly this is a major drawback 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.569
 quality photo apps on non 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.239

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.640
 others fighters

 not bad printer copes with bright 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.590
 multi-detailed pictures in particular 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.930
 landscapes but the portraits are not very 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.780
 the cost of the device itself is on 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.459
 level 150 dollars and you still add 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.380
 the cost of the paper and realize that 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.000
 pleasure is not the cheapest 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.250
 but the printer produces a nice 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.470
 impression with the right approach can 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.360
 print really beautiful pictures and 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.640
 the consequences of making whom 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.940
 and the dimensions allow you not to worry about 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.099
 transportation but it's certainly more 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.620
 a toy than a serious tool 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.230
