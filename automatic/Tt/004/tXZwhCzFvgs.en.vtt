whoa how come a butterfly big surprise
but<00:00:59.949> later<00:01:00.129> on<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.369> think<00:01:00.489> when<00:01:00.760> I<00:01:00.820> grew<00:01:01.030> up<00:01:01.119> I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330 
but later on I think when I grew up I

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.789 
but later on I think when I grew up I
discovered<00:01:01.780> there<00:01:01.900> were<00:01:01.960> books<00:01:02.199> which<00:01:02.530> were

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:02.799 
discovered there were books which were

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:04.530 
discovered there were books which were
either<00:01:03.309> or<00:01:03.640> completely<00:01:04.000> altered<00:01:04.330> so<00:01:04.449> they

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
either or completely altered so they

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.270 
either or completely altered so they
couldn't<00:01:04.689> be<00:01:04.839> read<00:01:04.989> again<00:01:05.229> or<00:01:05.560> in<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.040> case

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
couldn't be read again or in this case

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.280 
couldn't be read again or in this case
use<00:01:07.000> for<00:01:07.240> something<00:01:07.510> completely<00:01:07.689> other<00:01:08.080> than

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
use for something completely other than

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.050 
use for something completely other than
a<00:01:08.380> book<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:08.680> looks<00:01:08.830> like<00:01:08.950> a<00:01:08.979> book<00:01:09.220> but<00:01:09.790> actually

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
a book it looks like a book but actually

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.050 
a book it looks like a book but actually
as<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.540> probably<00:01:10.750> guessed<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.380> book<00:01:12.340> safe<00:01:12.610> for

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
as you probably guessed a book safe for

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.440 
as you probably guessed a book safe for
money<00:01:13.350> ever<00:01:14.350> or<00:01:14.679> jewelry<00:01:15.250> or<00:01:15.399> watches<00:01:16.000> or

anything valuable and disguised as a
book<00:01:19.210> I<00:01:19.920> also<00:01:20.920> noticed<00:01:21.340> that<00:01:21.399> there<00:01:21.549> are

books and there's a lot of these coming
around<00:03:43.590> now

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
around now

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.090 
around now
then<00:03:44.970> there's<00:03:45.180> books<00:03:45.480> which<00:03:45.810> are<00:03:46.080> not<00:03:46.950> really

books at all they're just look-alikes I
mean<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.230> simplest<00:03:49.470> one<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.680> came<00:03:49.920> across<00:03:50.040> is

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
mean the simplest one I came across is

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.040 
mean the simplest one I came across is
this<00:03:50.430> one<00:03:50.610> here<00:03:50.820> looking<00:03:51.180> as<00:03:51.660> though<00:03:51.840> it's<00:03:52.020> a

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
this one here looking as though it's a

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.510 
this one here looking as though it's a
little<00:03:52.290> wooden<00:03:52.470> book<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:52.920> actually<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.370> you

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
little wooden book but actually as you

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.820 
little wooden book but actually as you
can<00:03:53.670> see<00:03:53.880> it's<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.450> spinning<00:03:54.780> top<00:03:54.830> necklace

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
can see it's a spinning top necklace

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.850 
can see it's a spinning top necklace
dint<00:03:56.040> very<00:03:56.220> well<00:03:56.370> -<00:03:56.610> it's<00:03:56.760> got<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:56.910> nice<00:03:57.090> even

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
dint very well - it's got a nice even

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.790 
dint very well - it's got a nice even
weight<00:03:58.860> distribution<00:03:59.010> there<00:04:00.560> here's<00:04:01.560> another

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
weight distribution there here's another

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.470 
weight distribution there here's another
one<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.040> thought<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.490> first<00:04:02.520> glance<00:04:02.970> this<00:04:03.300> was<00:04:03.450> a
