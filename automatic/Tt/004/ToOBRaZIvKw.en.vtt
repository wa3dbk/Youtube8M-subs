00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:11.650
 Meverse is integrated into wiiu at the system level, so all wii u 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:14.980
 The game corresponds to the brother Bath and without interrupting the game 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:22.150
 It can be used by calling mebers 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:27.510
 In addition to the straw plazas and communities we introduced today , we have created a dedicated program 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.550
 It also becomes possible to create software that utilizes the communication function of Meverse . 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.379
 Queen 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:38.230
 For example, in the new Super Mario Bros u, other players are playing during the game 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:38.230
 You can now view the posted comments 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:47.520
 If you miss a course, you will meet other players who made mistakes in the same place 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.080
 It will be displayed together 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.630
 Such a comment is when many times had a mistake in the same place 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:59.170
 Hmm 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:01:03.390
 The player who was prompted by the software to post their feelings now is that time 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.390
 It was written to express my feelings 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:12.990
 When I cleared another difficult course 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:18.240
 It is possible to comment even when you can play great 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.560
 Comments written by other players are various places in the game such as the world map 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.649
 It is supposed to be displayed 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:31.130
 By playing with Mebers and playing alone, playing with players from all over Japan 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.470
 You can enjoy the game as if you are 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.500
 Sometimes 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.830
 Why don't you express your feelings with Kawayanagi 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.920
 There may be unusual titles such as 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.920
 You may be able to see unique comments 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:56.450
 In addition to its attraction after each attraction that played in Nintendo land 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.450
 Displays comments posted by other users who played 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:05.760
 Players can also post their feelings from this screen 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.440
 This is a handwritten message of Mr. Miyamoto 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.440
 Shrewdly it has been advertised 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:18.500
 In addition , players from all over the world who play Nintendo Land gather 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.500
 There is a plaza called Nintendo Land Plaza 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.590
 You can post various comments on this square 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:33.810
 It is a nice burst to show only other players in this Nintendo Land Plaza 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.810
 It is a system that could be realized by linking 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:44.990
 This time, the screen was prepared by the development staff for shooting. 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.700
 People from different countries in different languages after the release of Nintendo Land 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.060
 Communicate 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:55.280
 I think it will be a lively square 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.670
 A handwritten message is not a place where you can feel common in all countries 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.670
 Is not it
