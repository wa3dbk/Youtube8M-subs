 raid so far will be included we 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.200
 We will cover the case that comes in 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.450
 complete 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.330
 make sure that there is a principle from him 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.370
 so on protects this device from

 rubberized that's when it will fall 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.370
 let's say the screen will be on the bumper 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.300
 leans in principle 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:39.209
 thing pretty practical and let's say 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:43.440
 so so well that booted our device so 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.590

 a half inch diagonal looks 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.269
 just amazing despite the fact that 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.599
 these actions are not executed 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.470
 out the eye technology however screen 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.430
 very juicy with pixel density on 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.730
 inch of course a lot 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.840
 like that well, let's move on to the review 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:17.220
 real characteristics with 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:22.820
 benchmark antutu that's 17,000 96 points 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.820

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.810
 shake the name of the new model andro 42

 hd resolution 8 megapixels with us 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:41.820
 rear camera 4 cores 13th hertz 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.720
 and these are the sensors that are present on 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.720
 device 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:57.830
 the next paragraph I will show you how 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:02.010
 the camera is working on this gadget 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:06.680
 Now we take a ticket that 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.680
 we were bundled 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.669
 take a photo and benfica photography 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.620
 really worthy and always me 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:22.030
 remember that the model is positioned 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:32.710
 like budget principle hd full hd 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:40.130
 resolution so loud speaker noticed 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:45.860
 such here is the return photo pomoc not 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:49.580
 I increased the camera, I think it's great 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.680
 go wrong and everything else 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:56.289
 little by little the most basic 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:06:01.400
 showed here now go to the settings 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:07.240
 This gadget and because it is 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:13.030
 here there is so definitely something built 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:21.500
 gps works without internet connection 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:23.680
 wi-fi bluetooth also available to us 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.680
 device 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:32.599
 ten 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:36.270
 7 point touch we have on this Galich 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:39.119
 Here, in principle, summing up small results and 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.589
 I can safely say that this 

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:47.009
 the model is the best among competitors 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:49.919
 since the price-quality ratio is just 

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:52.889
 colossal always same 3 was popular 

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:55.619
 and because she was head down 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.449
 than 4 but nevertheless always digalo with 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:07:00.960
 next to them means something very capacious 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.909
 battery at this is all going away 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.189
 I can recommend this gadget 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.699
 buy online we are ready 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:07.699
