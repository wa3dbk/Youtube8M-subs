00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.420 
of that and i'll do a V log as well so
it<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.500> fun<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.310> gonna

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it will be good fun I think it's gonna

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.830 
it will be good fun I think it's gonna
be<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:32.729> good<00:01:32.939> fun<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.299> looking

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
be really good fun really looking

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.030 
be really good fun really looking
forward<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.380> still<00:01:34.590> more<00:01:34.799> than<00:01:34.829> are

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
forward to it I'm still more than are

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.440 
forward to it I'm still more than are
about<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> deck<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:36.000> bring<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
about the deck that I'm gonna bring a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.730 
about the deck that I'm gonna bring a
bit<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.780> difficult<00:01:37.170> decision<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.500> me

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
bit of a difficult decision for me

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
bit of a difficult decision for me
because<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.790> either<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.930> something

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
because it's either going with something

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780 
because it's either going with something
really<00:01:40.290> serious<00:01:40.590> or<00:01:41.009> something<00:01:41.130> quite

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
really serious or something quite

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.969 
really serious or something quite
serious<00:01:42.420> still<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:42.960> fun<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:43.680> I'm

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
serious still but fun and I think I'm

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.260 
serious still but fun and I think I'm
probably<00:01:44.100> leaning<00:01:44.430> towards<00:01:44.880> more<00:01:44.939> this

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
probably leaning towards more this

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.569 
probably leaning towards more this
because<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.049> gonna<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> long<00:01:46.560> day<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.460> one

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
because it's gonna be a long day so one

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.190 
because it's gonna be a long day so one
or<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.790> least<00:01:47.820> enjoy<00:01:48.210> ur<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.509> be<00:01:48.630> bored<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
or at least enjoy ur not be bored of the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810
