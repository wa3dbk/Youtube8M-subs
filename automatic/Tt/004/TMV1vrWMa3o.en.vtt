level I think for me the biggest

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.540 
level I think for me the biggest
transition<00:00:55.230> was<00:00:55.440> coming<00:00:55.950> from<00:00:56.039> college<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
pros dealing with Rome and rather than

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
being young man so to me that was the
hardest<00:01:02.039> transition<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.149> learning<00:01:03.840> how<00:01:03.899> to
