00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.470
 are very well today well here 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.330
 said welcome to a new video of 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.519
 black ops 2 this time I am 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.070
 stealing the video somebody shit shit 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.509
 good the idea I feel I feel bad the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.280
 I really feel very bad about 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.920
 that nothing is a pretty hard news 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 with a one thing that is the first 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.980
 youtuber I'm going to talk about this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 all the credits like putting the title 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.730
 flag ti martín I do not want I do not want 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.500
 feel you doing it I'm stealing I'm 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.109
 stealing the pricking image is stealing the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.640
 video I know but but all 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.170
 screams are going to him I want I want I want 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 clarify that I mean no no I do not want 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.329
 earn me nothing with this just inform them 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.050
 that this weight and martín a commentator 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.780
 American it seems that he discovered the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.640
 order of which strix the deaths 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.710
 necessary for the critic's and all the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.420
 crisis that will come out in black ops 2 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.670
 how did he do this good in the trailer for 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.690
 the black ops 2 multiply that 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.030
 now you are watching on screen 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.489
 can see that different scenes good 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.550
 different shots of different people 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.469
 no and then each different take is a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.629
 different crisis accommodation that was what 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.040
 that made team martín grabbed the three 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.930
 corners tricks 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.970
 he made a screenshot of all 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.730
 the every time it is on the feet 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.920
 tricks in the video and I arrange them 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.930
 way that this image came out because in 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.640
 the 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.590
 then how can you see what he did 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.510
 was to order the spells depending 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.220
 which are in the same row and in the 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.320
 same in the same row of the number of 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.870
 low then started from three casualties to 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.390
 twelve to fifteen casualties this obviously all 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.880
 everything is a theory everything is an idea 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.940
 but it sounds pretty enough to me 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.760
 logical enough how can you say or 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.270
 it sounds good to me and I feel that this is 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.350
 how are you going to be the physicists in black ops 2 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.760
 I'm going to steal the credit I'm going to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.979
 mention all the kills tricks but 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.450
 I repeat, I repeat, I repeat credit again 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.430
 for you martín until there I wanted to leave 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.750
 the watermark so you do not kill me 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.950
 this is going to take to claim the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.930
 cock and I will know the channel 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.460
 youtube but good I wanted I wanted 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.720
 share with you because it has 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.000
 seen in no videos in spanish about 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.310
 of the six kits in black ops 2 then 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.080
 we started from three of three casualties that is 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.910
 the little plane we see there is the baby 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.380
 as always in all that the likes 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.660
 the I lived has always needed three 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.399
 lowers of the I lived I have the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.670
 guardian who is the guardian is the mother 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.250
 that we see in the trailer that like 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.890
 blow sonic waves or I do not know how to 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.930
 some blowjob that encourages the enemy not 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.329
 is these things will you need 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.010
 deaths after four deaths we see 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.780
 up the bid and it's something like a 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.760
 rocket launcher I'm not too sure it's 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.040
 I say that something is something that has 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.870
 what to see with image rockets says that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.939
 it can be a Valkyrie rocket or something 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.280
 I do not know I just know that you have created with 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:39.170
 a rocket not after some of that there 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.609
 something that nobody knows what the fuck is not no 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.469
 I have an idea that it is I do not know about you 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.450
 see and then we have like a guy 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.209
 of turret that I do not know very well either 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.420
 be after the five deaths we have 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.219
 what seems to be the care helicopter 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.870
 package or better said juncker to catch 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.790
 you can see the helicopter below 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.239
 as with the box falling after 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.430
 we have next to the helicopter a 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.260
 aerial attack says vicente martín equal 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.569
 that you do not know if it's going to be a common attack 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.359
 or something like that type harriers like mode 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.129
 bales after six deaths we have 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.919
 a turret grenade launcher if I do not 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.419
 wrong they had mentioned in some 

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.000
 information that had escaped not 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.919
 I'm not very sure after 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.329
 we have the drone the good torque frame 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.250
 this already everyone knows what came out in the 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.290
 trailer you control it goes flying and 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.519
 start making a crap with the no to 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.290
 the seven deaths we have the helicopter 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.569
 of attack as always 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.480
 of attack has needed seven casualties 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:34.430
 then there is this attack helicopter 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.290
 and on the right we have what appears to be 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.260
 like a little plane that's like the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.790
 that you see in the trailer at the end that 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.790
 as it is the plane that goes down and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.340
 star in the vato and like they kill him 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.439
 or I do not know is something like 89 deaths 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.730
 good low we have something similar to pay 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.849
 blow it is common for a helicopter to 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.340
 attack but more prettier prettier by 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:58.189
 which we give us the idea that you can 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.569
 be a pay blog on the right we have no 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.130
 follow I do not know what the fuck does that do not 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.110
 I'm very sure 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.880
 it seems that it's something like that other 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.170
 another type of other type of turret but 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.170
 like more hardcore 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.690
 I think I think it was the thing that looks 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.430
 in the trailer that is like a solution 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.160
 Fortress so that's like the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.900
 robot site that you control it and can 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.420
 make a crap with the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.710
 after 9 to 10 casualties we have that 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.560
 mother who seems to be like that a 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.000
 satellite came a rumor about that 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.730
 I was going to have a kiss trick 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.830
 equal to black birds in black ops and 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.950
 martín believes that this is because it is like 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.720
 that the black birds called sad sad 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.720
 It's not true, I do not know what it's called 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.190
 something like satellite and it's the black bird that 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.140
 is going to tell you where the enemies are and 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.120
 it speaks to the right is what 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.740
 it seems to be a and in pi we are not sure 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.450
 if it's going to be clean because the same 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.240
 symbol but good to look like it's like 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.280
 that an electric wave a band one 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.260
 electromagnetic wave above this 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.530
 we have the dogs that are from 10 to 12 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.250
 deaths and up we have with what 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.500
 it seems to be what they call the swarm drone 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.450
 it's like swan what can you say 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.980
 well I do not remember the word well 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.150
 but that's how they're going to do 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.790
 many airplanes 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.290
 airplanes as seen in the trailer of 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.360
 black ops 2 that look in the air 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.070
 a lot of airplanes we think is this 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.150
 tri clicks that many planes will make 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.980
 and they will be studying 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.570
 constantly with enemies not 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.070
 we know we do not yet know well that 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.190
 are going to be hits tics but it seems 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.660
 be that tim martin did discover how he's going 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.970
 to be the order then they are around 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.470
 15 kilos tricks I do not remember well the 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.620
 number I counted them right now but I do not 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.600
 I remember the number well then it seems 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.160
 that there will be no support seems to be that 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.380
 there will be no content and it seems that 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.200
 there will be no specialist seems to be 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.230
 that there is not going to be something like a nook or something 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.920
 Fashionable but good type of trailers never 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.530
 has never never been highlighted by 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.090
 make keys tricks many that the sign does not 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.080
 it's like infinity ward that does 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.450
 very many 15 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.280
 troy that is always a little simpler 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.870
 as for crises then it seems 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.340
 be the feet I want I want that 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.770
 go and check the bidet and martín for 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.270
 to get a little better how 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.620
 is the thing the bato explained a little 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.300
 more of that is in English then but it's going to 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.110
 It cocks as is understood not so 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.780
 well then it would be all 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.250
 again I say it's the credit is for 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.810
 ti martín so then nothing people 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.430
 thank you for watching, take care 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.780
 that you liked the video and comment 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.460
 what do you think is characterized 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.690
 if they think it's okay if they believe 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.150
 it's wrong I do not know how you want 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.150
 take care, see you later, goodbye
