hopefully<00:00:50.420> end<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.510> buying<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.230> here<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.559> go

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.220 

the<00:01:11.510> steering<00:01:12.510> works<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.900> fine

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:32.600 

Ronald<00:01:29.030> it's<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.240> geared<00:01:30.480> to<00:01:30.780> high<00:01:31.520> should<00:01:32.520> be

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
Ronald it's not geared to high should be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.860 
Ronald it's not geared to high should be
geared<00:01:32.730> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.060> bit<00:01:33.150> higher<00:01:33.330> but<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.660> was

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:33.870 
geared a little bit higher but I was

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.750 
geared a little bit higher but I was
just<00:01:33.900> worried<00:01:34.800> about<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.100> doing<00:01:35.280> backflips

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
just worried about it doing backflips

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.400 
just worried about it doing backflips
all<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> time<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.690> which<00:01:36.870> it<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:37.200> does

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
all the time in which it really does

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.000 
all the time in which it really does
anyways<00:01:38.690> pretty<00:01:39.690> much<00:01:39.840> needs<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.350> wheelie<00:01:40.830> bar

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
anyways pretty much needs a wheelie bar

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.960 
anyways pretty much needs a wheelie bar
and<00:01:42.229> I<00:01:43.229> mean<00:01:43.800> it's<00:01:43.979> comes<00:01:44.400> with<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.580> charger

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
and I mean it's comes with the charger

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.750 
and I mean it's comes with the charger
for<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> batteries<00:01:46.280> power<00:01:47.280> supply<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
for the batteries power supply the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.469 
for the batteries power supply the
batteries<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:49.170> brushless<00:01:49.590> systems<00:01:50.150> remote<00:01:51.150> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
batteries the brushless systems remote I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.270 
batteries the brushless systems remote I
mean<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.869> things<00:01:52.220> things<00:01:53.220> pretty<00:01:53.580> bad<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
mean the things things pretty bad so

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.500 
mean the things things pretty bad so
yeah<00:01:56.280> that's<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> item<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.259> have<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.350> been
