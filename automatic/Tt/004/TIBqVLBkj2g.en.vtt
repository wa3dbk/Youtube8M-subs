00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
skin and this is how we're going to

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.740 
skin and this is how we're going to
exfoliate<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.369> skin<00:02:09.520> now<00:02:10.240> it's<00:02:10.390> just<00:02:10.600> the

same principle as you apply in dry

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.180 
same principle as you apply in dry
brushing<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:13.930> all<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.440> towards<00:02:14.950> your

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and just make sure that in on the joins

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.870 
and just make sure that in on the joins
off<00:02:22.600> I<00:02:22.900> will<00:02:23.290> show<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.590> pendulum<00:02:24.100> can<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:24.610> reach

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
off I will show the pendulum can I reach

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.820 
off I will show the pendulum can I reach
it<00:02:25.150> not<00:02:25.720> sure<00:02:26.110> yeah<00:02:26.350> there<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.650> go

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
so on the knees you're going to go in

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.840 
so on the knees you're going to go in
certain<00:02:29.500> emotions<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:30.280> legs<00:02:30.610> you're

certain emotions but on legs you're
going<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.090> go<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.660> upward<00:02:32.320> motion<00:02:32.709> just<00:02:32.950> like

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
going to go in upward motion just like

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.940 
going to go in upward motion just like
that<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.750> Gaussian<00:02:35.140> blasts<00:02:35.500> are<00:02:35.740> going

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that and the Gaussian blasts are going

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.520 
that and the Gaussian blasts are going
to<00:02:36.070> take<00:02:36.280> care<00:02:36.580> of<00:02:36.930> exfoliation<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.380> don't

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
to take care of exfoliation so you don't

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.320 
to take care of exfoliation so you don't
