00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
filtration so it comes with all the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.800 
filtration so it comes with all the
components<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> need<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.240> basically

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
components that you need and basically

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.190 
components that you need and basically
it's<00:01:58.020> very<00:01:58.079> very<00:01:58.710> simple<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.610> hook<00:01:59.820> up<00:02:00.200> you

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it's very very simple to hook up you

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's very very simple to hook up you
basically<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> large<00:02:02.189> carbon<00:02:02.759> chamber

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
basically have a large carbon chamber

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
basically have a large carbon chamber
and<00:02:04.219> what<00:02:05.219> this<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.149> filter

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
and what this is going to do is filter

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.180 
and what this is going to do is filter
up<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.840> 30<00:02:07.140> gallons<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.680> water

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
up to 30 gallons of water

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
up to 30 gallons of water
and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.400> doesn't<00:02:08.729> quite<00:02:08.970> efficiently<00:02:09.479> for

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and it doesn't quite efficiently for

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.050 
and it doesn't quite efficiently for
this<00:02:10.380> size<00:02:10.619> enclosure<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.670> you're<00:02:11.880> going<00:02:12.030> to

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
this size enclosure so you're going to

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.610 
this size enclosure so you're going to
be<00:02:12.150> really<00:02:12.390> happy<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.080> filtration

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
be really happy with this filtration

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.430 
be really happy with this filtration
system<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:14.970> need<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.990> filter

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
system and really all you need to filter

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.460 
system and really all you need to filter
the<00:02:16.560> water<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:17.220> this<00:02:17.820> particular<00:02:18.630> turtle<00:02:19.230> tub

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the water in this particular turtle tub

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.920 
the water in this particular turtle tub
so<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.760> will<00:02:20.880> handle<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> 30<00:02:21.720> gallons

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
so and it will handle up to 30 gallons

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.470 
so and it will handle up to 30 gallons
but<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.400> don't<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.730> quite<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.360> you

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
but you don't have quite that but you

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.270 
but you don't have quite that but you
have<00:02:24.510> about<00:02:24.750> 13<00:02:25.170> gallons<00:02:25.590> inside<00:02:26.040> this

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
have about 13 gallons inside this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.130 
have about 13 gallons inside this
particular<00:02:27.120> enclosure<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.720> does<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> great

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
particular enclosure so it does a great

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.900 
particular enclosure so it does a great
job<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.500> filtering<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.460> like<00:02:29.730> about

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
job of filtering that what I like about

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.330 
job of filtering that what I like about
it<00:02:30.150> though<00:02:30.300> is<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.930> very<00:02:30.990> easy<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.740> can

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
it though is it's very easy you can

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.860 
it though is it's very easy you can
pretty<00:02:32.550> much<00:02:32.640> put<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.090> anywhere<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.630> want

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
pretty much put this anywhere you want

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.110 
pretty much put this anywhere you want
you<00:02:34.080> don't<00:02:34.230> have<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.830> visible<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.940> the

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
you don't have to have it visible to the

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.520 
you don't have to have it visible to the
tank<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:36.960> you<00:02:37.050> want<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.230> take<00:02:37.410> this

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
tank because if you want to take this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.380 
tank because if you want to take this
canister<00:02:37.770> filter<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.550> if<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.180> your

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
canister filter and if you have your

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.110 
canister filter and if you have your
turtle<00:02:39.690> tub<00:02:39.900> up<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.790> something<00:02:41.790> like<00:02:41.970> this

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
turtle tub up on a something like this

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.760 
turtle tub up on a something like this
that's<00:02:42.390> higher<00:02:42.600> up<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.380> want<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> put

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
that's higher up and you want to put

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.250 
that's higher up and you want to put
your<00:02:43.830> canister<00:02:44.280> underneath<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
your canister underneath you can so that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.200 
your canister underneath you can so that
it's<00:02:46.500> not<00:02:46.650> visible<00:02:46.860> if<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.730> want<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.030> shorten

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
it's not visible if you want to shorten

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.420 
it's not visible if you want to shorten
the<00:02:48.420> hoses<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:49.020> can<00:02:49.290> do<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.740> as<00:02:49.890> well

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
the hoses you can do that as well

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.620 
the hoses you can do that as well
and<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.450> basically<00:02:51.750> has<00:02:52.530> an<00:02:52.710> intake<00:02:53.070> um

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
and so it basically has an intake um

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.000 
and so it basically has an intake um
which<00:02:54.630> is<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.870> tube<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.350> goes<00:02:55.410> down<00:02:55.740> to<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
which is a tube that goes down to the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.730 
which is a tube that goes down to the
bottom<00:02:56.340> which<00:02:56.490> takes<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.210> and<00:02:57.470> puts<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.590> into

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
bottom which takes in and puts it into

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.650 
bottom which takes in and puts it into
the<00:02:58.920> filter<00:02:59.160> filters<00:03:00.030> all<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.330> particles

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
the filter filters all the particles

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.380 
the filter filters all the particles
whatever<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.320> is<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.710> produces<00:03:02.340> clean<00:03:02.550> water

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
whatever it is and produces clean water

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.380 
whatever it is and produces clean water
puts<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.440> back<00:03:04.650> up<00:03:04.920> into<00:03:05.160> this<00:03:05.460> great<00:03:05.880> spray

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
puts it back up into this great spray

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.150 
puts it back up into this great spray
bar<00:03:06.690> which<00:03:07.410> spouts<00:03:07.920> out<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:09.380> eight<00:03:10.380> nine

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
bar which spouts out of eight nine

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.430 
bar which spouts out of eight nine
different<00:03:11.670> holes<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.330> it<00:03:12.750> creates<00:03:13.260> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
different holes and it creates a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.670 
different holes and it creates a
waterfall<00:03:14.040> effect<00:03:14.220> back<00:03:15.180> into<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.200> enclosure

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
waterfall effect back into the enclosure

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.300 
waterfall effect back into the enclosure
and<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.670> really<00:03:18.209> great<00:03:18.480> mix<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.020> great<00:03:19.770> effect

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
and a really great mix of a great effect

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.160 
and a really great mix of a great effect
you<00:03:20.580> love<00:03:20.850> this<00:03:21.030> down<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.480> sounds<00:03:21.630> like<00:03:21.870> sort

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
you love this down it sounds like sort

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.010 
you love this down it sounds like sort
of<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.380> waterfall<00:03:23.010> sound<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.660> really<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
of that waterfall sound so it's really a

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.350 
of that waterfall sound so it's really a
pleasant<00:03:25.739> thing<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:25.920> have<00:03:26.280> in<00:03:26.459> your<00:03:26.489> home

pleasant thing to have in your home

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.060 
pleasant thing to have in your home
environment<00:03:27.750> when<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.380> hear<00:03:28.590> sort<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.890> that

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
waterfall effect and it's a very

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.530 
waterfall effect and it's a very
interactive<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.400> what<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.270> what

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
interactive this is what this is what
