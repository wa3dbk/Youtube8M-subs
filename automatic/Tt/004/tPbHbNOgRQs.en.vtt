barbara santa barbara is a little bit

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.820 
barbara santa barbara is a little bit
odd<00:01:00.660> coast<00:01:01.379> arranged<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:04.680> not

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
odd coast arranged in here it's not

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.060 
odd coast arranged in here it's not
there<00:01:05.630> exactly<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.840> that's<00:01:08.420> we're<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> curve

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.870 

the<00:01:14.070> OSHA<00:01:14.220> turbo<00:01:14.880> California<00:01:15.390> coastline<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.719 

the<00:01:20.880> directions<00:01:21.630> are<00:01:21.750> sort<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:21.960> weird<00:01:22.170> because

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
the directions are sort of weird because

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.109 
the directions are sort of weird because
that's<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> Sun<00:01:24.030> setting<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.420> West<00:01:24.830> as

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
that's a Sun setting in the West as

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.469 
that's a Sun setting in the West as
something<00:01:27.119> left<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.100> that<00:01:29.100> weighs<00:01:29.340> Nora<00:01:32.479> here

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
something left and that weighs Nora here

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.570 
something left and that weighs Nora here
here<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:35.670> running<00:01:35.940> north-south<00:01:36.179> pretty<00:01:36.690> much

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
here is running north-south pretty much

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.820 
here is running north-south pretty much
so<00:01:38.580> what<00:01:38.670> happens<00:01:38.910> is<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.380> way<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.590> come<00:01:40.800> up

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
so what happens is the way up come up

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.560 
so what happens is the way up come up
right<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.340> Santa<00:01:41.640> Barbara<00:01:41.670> income<00:01:42.210> really

there<00:03:29.220> then<00:03:30.220> they<00:03:31.150> dredge<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.480> harbor<00:03:31.780> here

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
there then they dredge the harbor here

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:40.100 
there then they dredge the harbor here
but<00:03:32.110> it<00:03:32.170> doesn't<00:03:32.410> seem<00:03:32.530> too

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.050 

I<00:03:40.200> think<00:03:40.890> fingers<00:03:41.250> clean<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:41.580> bottom<00:03:41.880> if<00:03:41.940> it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
I think fingers clean the bottom if it

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.890 
I think fingers clean the bottom if it
comes<00:03:42.210> up<00:03:42.300> here

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.559 

it<00:03:45.900> may<00:03:46.319> be<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.470> bit<00:03:46.620> confused<00:03:47.099> because

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
it may be a bit confused because

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.550 
it may be a bit confused because
actually<00:03:48.569> if<00:03:48.689> a<00:03:48.750> heads<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.140> Harvard<00:03:49.379> is

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
actually if a heads in the Harvard is

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.460 
actually if a heads in the Harvard is
heading<00:03:49.829> north<00:03:50.010> its<00:03:51.019> migration<00:03:52.019> route<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.409> a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
heading north its migration route to a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.619 
heading north its migration route to a
north<00:03:52.650> but<00:03:53.159> it's<00:03:53.519> just<00:03:53.849> a<00:03:53.909> harbor<00:03:54.209> here<00:03:56.629> into

the<00:03:58.670> into<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.959> harbor<00:04:00.959> where<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.170> boats<00:04:01.319> are

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
the into the harbor where the boats are

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.649 
the into the harbor where the boats are
no<00:04:02.700> wait<00:04:02.849> for<00:04:02.970> her<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.060> go<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.420> basically

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
no wait for her to go but basically

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.880 
no wait for her to go but basically
that's<00:04:03.780> what<00:04:03.870> they<00:04:03.989> do<00:04:04.110> they<00:04:04.230> run<00:04:04.349> up<00:04:04.409> really

that's what they do they run up really

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.289 
that's what they do they run up really
close<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.220> short<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.519> is<00:04:05.640> unusually<00:04:06.090> photo

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
close the short this is unusually photo

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.530 
close the short this is unusually photo
we<00:04:07.200> haven't<00:04:07.379> seen<00:04:07.500> one<00:04:07.650> that's<00:04:07.799> close<00:04:07.950> for<00:04:07.980> I

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
we haven't seen one that's close for I

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.750 
we haven't seen one that's close for I
haven't<00:04:09.540> seen<00:04:09.599> once<00:04:09.810> I've<00:04:09.959> been<00:04:10.110> here<00:04:10.260> but

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
haven't seen once I've been here but

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.580 
haven't seen once I've been here but
this<00:04:11.760> is<00:04:11.940> really<00:04:12.150> unusual<00:04:12.329> but<00:04:13.200> seems<00:04:13.440> he's

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
this is really unusual but seems he's

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.809 
this is really unusual but seems he's
stuck<00:04:13.829> my<00:04:13.950> Harbor<00:04:14.099> some<00:04:14.400> reason<00:04:14.640> it's<00:04:14.760> not

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
stuck my Harbor some reason it's not

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.930 
stuck my Harbor some reason it's not
going<00:04:15.030> I've<00:04:15.180> been<00:04:15.329> here<00:04:15.450> for<00:04:15.569> a<00:04:15.629> few<00:04:15.659> days<00:04:15.930> so

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
going I've been here for a few days so

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.819 
going I've been here for a few days so
maybe<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.090> bit<00:04:18.239> confused<00:04:18.630> as<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.959> where<00:04:19.680> it's

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
maybe a bit confused as to where it's

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.229 
maybe a bit confused as to where it's
supposed<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:20.070> go<00:04:20.160> apparently<00:04:20.820> separated<00:04:21.180> from

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
supposed to go apparently separated from

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.650 
supposed to go apparently separated from
wherever<00:04:21.449> group<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.810> list<00:04:23.150> whales<00:04:24.150> migrate<00:04:24.539> to

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
wherever group is list whales migrate to

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:31.570 
wherever group is list whales migrate to
the<00:04:24.690> north<00:04:24.870> end<00:04:25.080> group<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.760> it

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.610 

it's<00:04:32.150> separated<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:33.110> may<00:04:33.199> not<00:04:33.319> be<00:04:33.379> old

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
it's separated and it may not be old

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.839 
it's separated and it may not be old
enough<00:04:33.740> to<00:04:34.129> understand<00:04:34.520> them<00:04:34.699> where<00:04:34.819> it

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
enough to understand them where it

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.029 
enough to understand them where it
supposed<00:04:34.970> to<00:04:35.180> go<00:04:35.330> besides<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.110> general<00:04:36.830> north

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
supposed to go besides the general north

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.610 
supposed to go besides the general north
heading<00:04:37.280> that's<00:04:38.150> my<00:04:38.270> guess<00:04:38.330> and<00:04:38.659> that<00:04:38.810> this<00:04:39.439> is

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
heading that's my guess and that this is

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.129 
heading that's my guess and that this is
north<00:04:39.830> from<00:04:40.610> where<00:04:40.759> it's<00:04:40.879> where<00:04:41.810> came<00:04:41.990> up<00:04:42.080> from

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
north from where it's where came up from

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.700 
north from where it's where came up from
Mexico<00:04:42.520> Baja<00:04:43.520> Mexico<00:04:43.990> head<00:04:44.990> north<00:04:45.379> it<00:04:45.530> runs

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
Mexico Baja Mexico head north it runs

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.830 
Mexico Baja Mexico head north it runs
right<00:04:45.979> into<00:04:46.129> Santa<00:04:46.370> Barbara<00:04:46.639> is<00:04:46.840> basically

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
right into Santa Barbara is basically

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.619 
right into Santa Barbara is basically
sand<00:04:48.110> courts<00:04:48.469> but<00:04:48.680> unfortunately<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:50.270> cosine

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:50.629 
sand courts but unfortunately the cosine

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.809 
sand courts but unfortunately the cosine
curves<00:04:50.900> here<00:04:51.169> and<00:04:52.060> it's<00:04:53.060> whoa<00:04:54.490> that's<00:04:55.490> right

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
curves here and it's whoa that's right

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:12.750 
curves here and it's whoa that's right
beside<00:04:55.969> the<00:04:56.180> kayaker<00:04:56.479> he<00:04:56.719> said<00:04:56.870> oh<00:04:57.020> yeah

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.010 

is<00:05:13.350> it's<00:05:14.350> very<00:05:14.860> unusual<00:05:15.100> approach<00:05:15.930> and<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
is it's very unusual approach and the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.390 
is it's very unusual approach and the
books<00:05:17.200> are<00:05:17.290> not<00:05:17.380> actually<00:05:17.710> supposed<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:18.040> get

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
books are not actually supposed to get

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.250 
books are not actually supposed to get
right<00:05:18.580> on<00:05:18.670> how<00:05:18.760> selective<00:05:19.090> but<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:19.990> is<00:05:20.140> the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
right on how selective but this is the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.380 
right on how selective but this is the
harbor<00:05:20.560> inlet<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.520> outlet<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:21.940> they<00:05:22.150> do<00:05:22.270> go

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
harbor inlet and outlet that they do go

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.629 
harbor inlet and outlet that they do go
through<00:05:22.450> here

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.059 

so<00:05:30.210> they<00:05:30.689> are<00:05:30.840> going<00:05:31.020> on<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.469> mean<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.710> both<00:05:31.860> you

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
so they are going on I mean the both you

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.450 
so they are going on I mean the both you
go<00:05:32.189> in<00:05:32.310> and<00:05:32.400> out<00:05:32.490> to<00:05:32.669> start<00:05:32.879> right<00:05:33.090> here<00:05:33.120> but<00:05:34.460> by

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
go in and out to start right here but by

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.670 
go in and out to start right here but by
all<00:05:35.639> the<00:05:35.789> necklace<00:05:36.090> actually<00:05:36.300> be<00:05:36.719> getting

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
all the necklace actually be getting

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:54.380 
all the necklace actually be getting
very<00:05:38.009> close<00:05:40.370> watch<00:05:41.370> your<00:05:41.759> motor<00:05:41.939> buddy

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.370 

they<00:05:55.390> have<00:05:55.480> to<00:05:55.570> be<00:05:55.600> fair<00:05:55.810> flowing<00:05:56.050> doesn't<00:05:56.320> go

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
they have to be fair flowing doesn't go

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.180 
they have to be fair flowing doesn't go
any<00:05:56.530> way<00:05:56.590> they<00:05:56.680> can<00:05:56.740> get<00:05:56.830> it<00:05:56.950> out<00:05:57.070> of<00:05:57.100> the

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
any way they can get it out of the

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.880 
any way they can get it out of the
harbor<00:05:57.460> so<00:05:57.670> they<00:05:58.660> just<00:05:58.810> have<00:05:59.080> to<00:05:59.230> be<00:05:59.770> very

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
harbor so they just have to be very

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.060 
harbor so they just have to be very
careful<00:06:00.160> shuffle
