question<00:00:13.349> what<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.549> difference<00:00:14.580> between

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
question what is the difference between

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.200 
question what is the difference between
mono<00:00:15.719> key<00:00:16.020> and<00:00:16.289> mono<00:00:16.680> lock<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.880> front<00:00:18.119> of

mono key and mono lock here in front of
me<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.380> plates<00:00:19.710> this<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:21.150> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
me I have the two plates this here is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.390 
me I have the two plates this here is
the<00:00:21.510> mono<00:00:21.720> key<00:00:22.020> series<00:00:22.500> plate<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.980> you'll

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the mono key series plate and you'll

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.640 
the mono key series plate and you'll
notice<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:24.060> when<00:00:24.210> monarchy<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.810> uses<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> much

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
notice it when monarchy it uses a much

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.279 
notice it when monarchy it uses a much
larger<00:00:26.310> clamp<00:00:26.699> here<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> top<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
larger clamp here at the top of the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.650 
larger clamp here at the top of the
plate<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> case<00:00:29.550> latches<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.449> and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
plate where the case latches on to and

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.139 
plate where the case latches on to and
at<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> bottom<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.830> two<00:00:32.219> receptacles

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
at the bottom we have two receptacles

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.810 
at the bottom we have two receptacles
that<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> mono<00:00:33.960> key<00:00:34.260> series<00:00:34.680> case<00:00:34.920> will<00:00:35.370> slide

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that a mono key series case will slide

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.630 
that a mono key series case will slide
into<00:00:36.530> coming<00:00:37.530> across<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> monologue

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
into coming across to the monologue

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610 
into coming across to the monologue
series<00:00:39.090> plate<00:00:39.360> you'll<00:00:39.870> see<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.440> mono

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
series plate you'll see that the mono

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830 
series plate you'll see that the mono
lot<00:00:40.860> uses<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> much<00:00:41.520> smaller<00:00:41.850> clamp<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
lot uses a much smaller clamp here and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
lot uses a much smaller clamp here and
at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> bottom<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> case<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
at the bottom of the case the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.420 
at the bottom of the case the
receptacles<00:00:45.629> are<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:45.960> slots<00:00:46.500> which<00:00:47.250> are

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
receptacles are two slots which are

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.790 
receptacles are two slots which are
basically<00:00:48.000> small<00:00:48.149> plates<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> monologue

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
basically small plates on the monologue

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.660 
basically small plates on the monologue
case<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:51.090> slides<00:00:51.480> into<00:00:51.840> both<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> these<00:00:52.710> now

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
case that slides into both of these now

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.010 
case that slides into both of these now
we're<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> look<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> monarchy<00:00:54.780> case

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
we're going to look at the monarchy case

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.889 
we're going to look at the monarchy case
itself<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> main<00:00:56.309> differences<00:00:56.940> over

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
itself to see the main differences over

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.090 
itself to see the main differences over
here<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> monarchy<00:00:59.100> v<00:00:59.309> 46<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.960> V<00:01:01.140> 46<00:01:01.800> case

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
here is the monarchy v 46 the V 46 case

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910 
here is the monarchy v 46 the V 46 case
is<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.760> little<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.180> heavier<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.019> its<00:01:04.379> physical

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
is a little bit heavier in its physical

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
is a little bit heavier in its physical
weight<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.580> when<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.240> open<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.869> you'll

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
weight and when you open it up you'll

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
weight and when you open it up you'll
notice<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.070> monarchy<00:01:08.640> series

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
notice that with all monarchy series

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.240 
notice that with all monarchy series
cases<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:10.229> are<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> lot<00:01:10.560> thicker<00:01:10.920> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
cases there are a lot thicker in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.840 
cases there are a lot thicker in
construction<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> double<00:01:12.780> wall<00:01:13.049> system

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
construction with a double wall system

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.190 
construction with a double wall system
therefore<00:01:14.850> making<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> lot<00:01:15.659> more<00:01:15.689> durable

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
therefore making them a lot more durable

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
therefore making them a lot more durable
a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:16.830> more<00:01:17.040> heavy-duty<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:18.060> have<00:01:18.540> probably

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
a lot more heavy-duty and have probably

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.740 
a lot more heavy-duty and have probably
favored<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.650> towards<00:01:20.280> higher<00:01:20.850> displacement

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
favored more towards higher displacement

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.859 
favored more towards higher displacement

here once I open this for you you'll
notice<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> physical<00:01:35.310> construction<00:01:35.759> is

notice that the physical construction is

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.170 
notice that the physical construction is
a<00:01:36.150> little<00:01:36.479> bit<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:36.900> lighter<00:01:37.380> thinner

a little bit more lighter thinner

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.670 
a little bit more lighter thinner
therefore<00:01:39.180> making<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.810> lighter<00:01:40.200> case

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
therefore making it a lighter case

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.230 
therefore making it a lighter case
