our oil is ready so now we are going to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.080 
our oil is ready so now we are going to
fry<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.840> we<00:01:42.840> won't<00:01:43.079> add<00:01:43.350> too<00:01:44.100> much<00:01:44.340> at<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
time we will fry by batches and it will

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.530 
time we will fry by batches and it will
help<00:01:51.869> us<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> maintain<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.159> temperature<00:01:54.119> of

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
help us to maintain the temperature of

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.950 
help us to maintain the temperature of
further<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:56.070> fry<00:01:56.369> each<00:01:56.610> side<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.210> will<00:01:57.329> take<00:01:57.570> 2

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
further to fry each side it will take 2

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.850 
further to fry each side it will take 2
minutes<00:01:58.110> maximum

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
minutes maximum

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.090 
minutes maximum
so<00:01:59.340> total<00:01:59.729> to<00:02:00.719> play<00:02:00.930> one<00:02:01.259> batch<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.710> will<00:02:01.920> take

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
so total to play one batch it will take

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.240 
so total to play one batch it will take
around<00:02:02.549> 4<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.210> 5<00:02:03.540> minutes<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.320> our<00:02:04.590> first<00:02:05.040> batch

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
around 4 to 5 minutes so our first batch
