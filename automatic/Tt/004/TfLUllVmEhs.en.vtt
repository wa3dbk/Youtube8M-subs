 okay with the pilot a distance of new 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.870
 directions will be one of structure will be 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.940
 cut

 health x engine 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.140
 and then let's make the circuit the way 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.900
 how they are connected to the screen sana is well 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.970

 now in the sky is the limit 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.400
 do you understand microcontrollers can 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:47.120
 very well have gone a project controlling 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.470
 her by password or by phone or
