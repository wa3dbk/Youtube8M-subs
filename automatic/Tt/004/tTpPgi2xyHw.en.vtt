00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
their pics change every single week that

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.530 
their pics change every single week that
we<00:00:14.280> play<00:00:14.429> them<00:00:14.549> they're<00:00:14.670> just<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.969> completely

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
we play them they're just a completely

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.390 
we play them they're just a completely
different<00:00:15.900> style<00:00:16.199> every<00:00:16.650> single<00:00:17.010> time<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
different style every single time and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.370 
different style every single time and
it's<00:00:17.820> kind<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.539> don't<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:19.020> they've<00:00:19.140> just

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
it's kind of I don't think they've just

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.230 
it's kind of I don't think they've just
found<00:00:19.770> their<00:00:20.130> own<00:00:20.279> stride<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> don't<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.180> don't

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
found their own stride I don't I don't

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
found their own stride I don't I don't
think<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:22.020> their<00:00:22.199> number<00:00:22.470> i

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
think it's that we have their number i

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230 
think it's that we have their number i
think<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.769> they're<00:00:22.890> just<00:00:22.920> struggling<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.609> to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
think that they're just struggling to to

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.939 
think that they're just struggling to to
just<00:00:24.480> stick<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.050> specific<00:00:25.289> kind<00:00:25.890> of

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
just stick with one specific kind of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769 
just stick with one specific kind of
team<00:00:26.279> comments<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.029> they<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.390> run<00:00:27.539> and

yesterday<00:00:41.070> what<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> thought<00:00:41.910> process

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
yesterday what was the thought process

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.440 
yesterday what was the thought process
behind<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:44.370> knew<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.149> really

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
behind that so we knew that they really

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.690 
behind that so we knew that they really
value<00:00:45.570> Jack's<00:00:46.289> because<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:47.100> first<00:00:47.430> picked

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
value Jack's because they first picked

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.459 
value Jack's because they first picked
it<00:00:47.969> yesterday<00:00:48.450> against<00:00:48.690> curse<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.079> obviously

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
it yesterday against curse so obviously

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.869 
it yesterday against curse so obviously
you<00:00:49.680> want<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> champion<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> really

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you want to put that champion a really

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
you want to put that champion a really
high<00:00:50.969> priority<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.780> thought<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> take<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
high priority we thought that take it

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.959 
high priority we thought that take it
early<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.489> actually<00:00:53.699> took<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
early and they actually took in the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.520 
early and they actually took in the
first<00:00:54.149> rotation<00:00:54.480> but<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.989> didn't<00:00:55.170> really<00:00:55.230> care

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
first rotation but we didn't really care

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.840 
first rotation but we didn't really care
because<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.039> thought<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.309> we'd<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.610> able<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
because we thought that we'd be able to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.939 
because we thought that we'd be able to
just<00:00:57.000> help<00:00:57.270> team<00:00:57.719> fight<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.680> came<00:00:58.829> in

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
just help team fight them so we came in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.260 
just help team fight them so we came in
with<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> game<00:00:59.250> plan<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.699> how<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> deal<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
with a game plan so how to deal with a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.389 
with a game plan so how to deal with a
split<00:01:00.899> push<00:01:01.020> pressure<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.980> ended<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
split push pressure and we ended up just

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.680 
split push pressure and we ended up just
taking<00:01:02.460> vibe<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.300> good<00:01:03.480> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
taking vibe which is a really good it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.210 
taking vibe which is a really good it's
kind<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> knock<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.500> almost<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.979> if

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
kind of like a knock and almost I if

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500 
kind of like a knock and almost I if
your<00:01:05.339> split<00:01:05.640> pushing<00:01:05.820> alone<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
your split pushing alone you're going to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.090 
your split pushing alone you're going to
get<00:01:06.630> caught<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:06.869> by<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.439> twisted<00:01:07.740> fate<00:01:07.920> if

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
get caught out by with twisted fate if

you're<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.820> trying<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> split<00:01:09.390> push<00:01:09.600> you're

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you're just trying to split push you're

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.030 
you're just trying to split push you're
going<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.140> collapsed<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.650> every<00:01:10.920> single

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
going to get collapsed on every single

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
going to get collapsed on every single
time<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.520> Lulu<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.960> strong<00:01:13.260> Lane

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
time and Lulu is a really strong Lane

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080 
time and Lulu is a really strong Lane
bully<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.250> didn't<00:01:14.460> actually<00:01:14.580> ban<00:01:14.909> that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
bully and they didn't actually ban that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.030 
bully and they didn't actually ban that
Lulu<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:15.900> means<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.590> could<00:01:16.740> have<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
Lulu which means that we could have the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.950 
Lulu which means that we could have the
early<00:01:17.369> advantage<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.210> Jackson<00:01:18.659> beginning

early advantage on the Jackson beginning
of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.080> game<00:01:19.229> which<00:01:19.740> meant<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.040> they

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
of the game which meant that they

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.320 
of the game which meant that they
thought<00:01:20.549> they're<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> put<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> lot<00:01:21.299> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
thought they're there to put a lot of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.850 
thought they're there to put a lot of
pressure<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> lulu<00:01:21.990> lane<00:01:22.140> especially

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
pressure on the lulu lane especially

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
pressure on the lulu lane especially
with<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> d<00:01:23.220> blade<00:01:23.460> start<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.820> Jax<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.210> i

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
with the d blade start on Jax but i

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.870 
with the d blade start on Jax but i
guess<00:01:24.990> not<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.009> meant<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.280> we

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
guess not and then that meant that we

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.819 
guess not and then that meant that we
had<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.119> really<00:01:27.540> strong<00:01:27.960> lame<00:01:28.409> bully<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
had a really strong lame bully in the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.469 
had a really strong lame bully in the
beginning<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> lane<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.790> Jack's<00:01:30.299> which

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
beginning of the lane for Jack's which

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.359 
beginning of the lane for Jack's which
meant<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.350> stalls<00:01:31.590> longer<00:01:32.070> for<00:01:32.280> how

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
meant that it just stalls longer for how

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.830 
meant that it just stalls longer for how
much<00:01:32.520> time<00:01:32.700> he<00:01:32.820> needs<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> ramp<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> just

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
much time he needs to ramp up and just

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.109 
much time he needs to ramp up and just
be<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.110> split<00:01:34.439> push<00:01:34.710> monster<00:01:35.189> well<00:01:35.939> you

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
be that split push monster well you

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.850 
be that split push monster well you
managed<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.659> get<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.930> vibe<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.409> then<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.650> saw

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
managed to get that vibe and then we saw

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.890 
managed to get that vibe and then we saw
the<00:01:37.890> effectiveness<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.970> we're<00:01:39.509> gonna<00:01:39.600> jump

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
the effectiveness of it we're gonna jump

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.020 
the effectiveness of it we're gonna jump
to<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> replay<00:01:40.650> four<00:01:41.340> minutes<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to a replay four minutes in it's the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
to a replay four minutes in it's the
first<00:01:42.270> blood<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.200> midline<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
first blood that you get the midline and

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
first blood that you get the midline and
just<00:01:44.430> kind<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.610> walk<00:01:44.759> us<00:01:44.790> through<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.180> your

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
just kind of walk us through it your

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.210 
just kind of walk us through it your
thoughts<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> knew<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.560> he<00:01:46.770> warded<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
thoughts so I knew that he warded that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.609 
thoughts so I knew that he warded that
but<00:01:47.490> we<00:01:47.939> also<00:01:48.090> knew<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.420> Jackson<00:01:49.140> had<00:01:49.350> not

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
but we also knew that Jackson had not

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.830 
but we also knew that Jackson had not
warded<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.040> something<00:01:50.640> talk<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.000> had<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> free

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
warded a something talk so I had a free

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
warded a something talk so I had a free
time<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.770> from<00:01:53.009> behind<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
time to get from behind and just to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.730

knock back puts him right in range for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.039 
knock back puts him right in range for
that<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:57.149> try<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> flash<00:01:57.719> in

controls around mid lane making it so
that<00:02:43.630> TF<00:02:44.050> could<00:02:44.260> just<00:02:44.470> go<00:02:44.739> unseen<00:02:45.250> which<00:02:45.519> puts

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
that TF could just go unseen which puts

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.539 
that TF could just go unseen which puts
a<00:02:46.000> lot<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.209> split<00:02:46.569> put<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.830> destiny<00:02:47.830> pressure<00:02:48.040> so

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
a lot of split put a destiny pressure so

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:49.860 
a lot of split put a destiny pressure so
we're<00:02:48.700> thinking<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.209> enemy<00:02:49.450> team<00:02:49.569> is<00:02:49.720> just

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
we're thinking the enemy team is just

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.449 
we're thinking the enemy team is just
like<00:02:50.019> oh<00:02:50.140> well<00:02:50.350> TF<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.739> off<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> map<00:02:51.160> you

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
like oh well TF is off the map you

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.370 
like oh well TF is off the map you
listen<00:02:51.700> he's<00:02:51.910> looking<00:02:52.120> for<00:02:52.239> a<00:02:52.269> play<00:02:52.420> so<00:02:52.989> by

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
listen he's looking for a play so by

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.380 
listen he's looking for a play so by
hiding<00:02:53.680> Twisted<00:02:54.100> Fate<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:54.489> me<00:02:54.910> showing<00:02:55.180> up

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
hiding Twisted Fate and me showing up

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.000 
hiding Twisted Fate and me showing up
top<00:02:55.600> making<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.959> really<00:02:56.230> obvious<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.799> gank

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
top making it really obvious that a gank

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.039 
top making it really obvious that a gank
is<00:02:57.130> happening<00:02:57.519> we're<00:02:57.670> able<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.970> shut<00:02:58.540> down<00:02:58.569> Jax

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
is happening we're able to shut down Jax

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.660 
is happening we're able to shut down Jax
and<00:02:59.260> eventually<00:02:59.650> force<00:02:59.890> his<00:03:00.069> teleport<00:03:00.519> back

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
and eventually force his teleport back

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.880 
and eventually force his teleport back
to<00:03:00.880> lanes<00:03:01.090> after<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.569> Lulu<00:03:01.959> chunking<00:03:02.319> him<00:03:02.410> which

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
to lanes after a Lulu chunking him which

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.680 
to lanes after a Lulu chunking him which
meant<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.190> since<00:03:03.610> our<00:03:03.760> Lulu<00:03:04.030> had<00:03:04.150> a<00:03:04.180> teleport

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
meant that since our Lulu had a teleport

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.809 
meant that since our Lulu had a teleport
were<00:03:05.080> able<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.380> just<00:03:05.500> head<00:03:05.890> down<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.130> dragon<00:03:06.519> get

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
were able to just head down a dragon get

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.070 
were able to just head down a dragon get
free<00:03:07.060> dragons<00:03:07.450> which<00:03:07.569> was<00:03:07.720> pretty<00:03:07.900> much<00:03:08.019> a

free dragons as we outplayed him with

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.690

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
the first one was at 27 minutes that was

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.210 
the first one was at 27 minutes that was
actually<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.290> pretty<00:03:17.650> big<00:03:17.769> change<00:03:18.040> for

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
actually a pretty big change for

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.380 
actually a pretty big change for
dignitas<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:18.880> overall<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.150> guys<00:03:19.269> have

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
dignitas in the overall you guys have

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.060 
dignitas in the overall you guys have
pretty<00:03:19.570> much<00:03:19.630> shied<00:03:19.900> away<00:03:19.930> from<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.620> throw

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
pretty much shied away from it and throw

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.530 
pretty much shied away from it and throw
it<00:03:21.100> at<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.310> a<00:03:21.400> couple<00:03:21.489> times<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.030> Tori's<00:03:22.359> for

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
it at it a couple times and Tori's for

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.509 
it at it a couple times and Tori's for
that<00:03:22.630> why<00:03:23.079> is<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:23.290> changed<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.310> you

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
that why is that changed now and you

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:25.860 
that why is that changed now and you
guys<00:03:24.640> just<00:03:24.790> have<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.090> much<00:03:25.180> control<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.780> it

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
guys just have so much control and it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.509 
guys just have so much control and it
seems<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.109> easy<00:03:26.410> for<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.799> now<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.010> take<00:03:27.340> those

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
seems so easy for you now to take those

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:28.800 
seems so easy for you now to take those
parents<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.970> don't<00:03:28.150> think<00:03:28.299> this<00:03:28.390> split<00:03:28.690> we've

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
parents I don't think this split we've

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.870 
parents I don't think this split we've
actually<00:03:28.989> thrown<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.620> Baron<00:03:29.980> really<00:03:30.310> we're

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
actually thrown that Baron really we're

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.979 
actually thrown that Baron really we're
getting<00:03:31.150> really<00:03:31.450> good<00:03:31.660> at<00:03:31.690> just

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
getting really good at just

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.890 
getting really good at just
understanding<00:03:32.560> when<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:33.100> do<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.900> it's

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
understanding when to do it and it's

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.870 
understanding when to do it and it's
just<00:03:35.109> a<00:03:35.230> matter<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.530> really<00:03:36.489> thinking<00:03:36.819> about

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
just a matter of really thinking about

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.729 
just a matter of really thinking about
it<00:03:37.030> because<00:03:37.209> before<00:03:37.540> we'd<00:03:37.870> use<00:03:38.109> barren<00:03:38.500> as<00:03:38.709> a

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
it because before we'd use barren as a

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.039 
it because before we'd use barren as a
tool<00:03:39.069> of<00:03:39.100> oh<00:03:39.340> we're<00:03:39.640> losing<00:03:40.090> let's<00:03:40.660> just<00:03:40.930> try

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
tool of oh we're losing let's just try

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.590 
tool of oh we're losing let's just try
baron<00:03:41.350> right<00:03:41.799> or<00:03:42.040> oh<00:03:42.069> we're<00:03:42.670> even<00:03:43.150> let's<00:03:43.540> just

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
baron right or oh we're even let's just

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.479 
baron right or oh we're even let's just
try<00:03:43.810> perilous<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.260> see<00:03:44.380> what<00:03:44.500> happens<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:44.980> now

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
try perilous to see what happens so now

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.949 
try perilous to see what happens so now
we're<00:03:45.700> actually<00:03:45.790> okay<00:03:46.120> well<00:03:46.269> baron<00:03:46.630> we<00:03:46.810> can

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
we're actually okay well baron we can

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.900 
we're actually okay well baron we can
use<00:03:47.139> this<00:03:47.350> as<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> tool<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.859> actually<00:03:48.220> get<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:48.790> if

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
use this as a tool to actually get it if

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.430 
use this as a tool to actually get it if
they're<00:03:49.120> not<00:03:49.269> in<00:03:49.450> range<00:03:49.630> or<00:03:49.900> we<00:03:49.989> can<00:03:50.079> just<00:03:50.139> bait

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
they're not in range or we can just bait

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.990 
they're not in range or we can just bait
it<00:03:50.590> in<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:50.829> we<00:03:50.889> fail<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.400> do<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.670> a<00:03:51.700> couple<00:03:51.760> of

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
it in now we fail to do that a couple of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.940 
it in now we fail to do that a couple of
times<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.750> we<00:03:52.870> managed<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.200> not<00:03:53.410> really<00:03:53.829> do

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
times but we managed to not really do

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.170 
times but we managed to not really do
anything<00:03:53.980> because<00:03:54.370> we<00:03:54.489> had<00:03:54.670> such<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:54.970> good

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
anything because we had such a good

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.849 
anything because we had such a good
position<00:03:55.480> on<00:03:55.720> them<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.290> they're<00:03:56.560> not<00:03:56.680> able

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
position on them that they're not able

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.099 
position on them that they're not able
to<00:03:57.040> capitalize<00:03:57.549> on<00:03:57.579> our<00:03:57.910> damage<00:03:58.569> from<00:03:58.780> Baron

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
to capitalize on our damage from Baron

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.020 
to capitalize on our damage from Baron
quickly<00:03:59.739> enough<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.370> we<00:04:00.579> just<00:04:00.730> basically

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
quickly enough so we just basically

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.729 
quickly enough so we just basically
tried<00:04:01.540> many<00:04:01.810> times<00:04:01.900> until<00:04:02.200> we<00:04:02.440> managed<00:04:02.650> to

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
tried many times until we managed to

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.160 
tried many times until we managed to
catch<00:04:02.920> the<00:04:03.100> mattah<00:04:03.310> doing<00:04:04.000> dragon<00:04:04.420> as<00:04:04.540> two<00:04:05.049> and

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
catch the mattah doing dragon as two and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
catch the mattah doing dragon as two and
then<00:04:05.290> we<00:04:05.350> just<00:04:05.500> got<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.650> free<00:04:05.829> bear<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.100> off

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
then we just got a free bear and off

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.309 
then we just got a free bear and off
that<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:07.120> just<00:04:07.660> puts<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.870> lot<00:04:08.049> of<00:04:08.079> pressure

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:08.319 
that so it just puts a lot of pressure

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.809 
that so it just puts a lot of pressure
on<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.560> map<00:04:08.680> especially<00:04:09.100> with<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.370> destiny

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
on the map especially with the destiny

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.420 
on the map especially with the destiny
that<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.690> just<00:04:11.260> walking<00:04:11.560> into<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:11.980> makes<00:04:12.280> it

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
that you just walking into it makes it

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.800 
that you just walking into it makes it
really<00:04:12.700> dangerous<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.359> opposing<00:04:13.660> team

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
really dangerous for the opposing team

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.960 
really dangerous for the opposing team
now<00:04:14.139> we<00:04:14.260> saw<00:04:14.410> yet<00:04:14.620> another<00:04:14.650> example<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.910> that

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
now we saw yet another example of that

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.250 
now we saw yet another example of that
bear<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:16.450> control<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.810> pressure<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.200> you

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
bear and control and pressure that you

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.830 
bear and control and pressure that you

Luis Jack's like that even if you have
red<00:05:00.830> buff<00:05:01.040> so<00:05:01.280> eventually<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.510> just<00:05:02.660> backfired

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
red buff so eventually it just backfired

just<00:05:20.180> strong<00:05:20.450> right<00:05:20.660> now<00:05:20.690> obviously<00:05:21.170> CLG<00:05:21.620> is

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
just strong right now obviously CLG is

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.610 
just strong right now obviously CLG is
pretty<00:05:22.400> solid<00:05:22.610> were<00:05:22.910> 202<00:05:23.750> against<00:05:24.320> them<00:05:24.470> and

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
pretty solid were 202 against them and

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.070 
pretty solid were 202 against them and
they've<00:05:25.130> beaten<00:05:25.310> us<00:05:25.490> every<00:05:25.730> time<00:05:25.910> but<00:05:26.330> I<00:05:26.660> think

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
they've beaten us every time but I think

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.150 
they've beaten us every time but I think
that<00:05:27.170> it's<00:05:27.260> just<00:05:27.380> a<00:05:27.470> matter<00:05:27.590> of<00:05:27.710> who<00:05:27.860> can<00:05:27.890> be

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
that it's just a matter of who can be

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.710 
that it's just a matter of who can be
better<00:05:28.370> really<00:05:28.730> because<00:05:29.000> I<00:05:29.090> really<00:05:29.420> like<00:05:29.570> the

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
better really because I really like the

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.150 
better really because I really like the
showing<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.140> we<00:05:30.200> had<00:05:30.350> against<00:05:30.560> TSM<00:05:30.770> this

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
showing that we had against TSM this

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.830 
showing that we had against TSM this
game<00:05:31.310> because<00:05:31.460> fella<00:05:32.060> we<00:05:32.240> were<00:05:32.360> aggressive

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
game because fella we were aggressive

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.960 
game because fella we were aggressive
this<00:05:33.230> time<00:05:33.290> around<00:05:33.590> like<00:05:34.190> maybe<00:05:34.490> they<00:05:34.700> didn't

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
this time around like maybe they didn't

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.280 
this time around like maybe they didn't
do<00:05:35.060> what<00:05:35.210> they<00:05:35.330> wanted<00:05:35.540> to<00:05:35.660> do<00:05:35.810> but<00:05:35.960> in<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.170> end

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
do what they wanted to do but in the end

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.110 
do what they wanted to do but in the end
we<00:05:36.470> managed<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.800> be<00:05:37.070> aggressive<00:05:37.730> against

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
we managed to be aggressive against

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.360 
we managed to be aggressive against
something<00:05:38.300> like<00:05:38.450> a<00:05:38.480> zigs<00:05:38.900> and<00:05:39.050> make<00:05:39.980> the<00:05:40.160> plays

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
something like a zigs and make the plays

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.650 
something like a zigs and make the plays
that<00:05:40.400> we<00:05:40.610> needed<00:05:40.790> to<00:05:40.880> do<00:05:41.030> to<00:05:41.150> win<00:05:41.270> so<00:05:41.540> that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
that we needed to do to win so that

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.000 
that we needed to do to win so that
shows<00:05:41.870> that<00:05:42.020> we<00:05:42.110> have<00:05:42.230> an<00:05:42.320> understanding<00:05:42.440> as

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
shows that we have an understanding as

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.580 
shows that we have an understanding as
to<00:05:43.040> what<00:05:43.760> we<00:05:43.940> need<00:05:44.150> to<00:05:44.300> do<00:05:44.480> to<00:05:44.690> win<00:05:45.230> the<00:05:45.410> game

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
to what we need to do to win the game

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.290 
to what we need to do to win the game
and<00:05:45.620> not<00:05:45.890> just<00:05:46.160> win<00:05:46.460> off<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:46.730> mistakes<00:05:47.090> of<00:05:47.210> the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
and not just win off the mistakes of the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.450 
and not just win off the mistakes of the
opponent<00:05:47.540> alright<00:05:48.500> well<00:05:48.650> tomorrow<00:05:49.040> you<00:05:49.160> guys

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
complexity and cloud nine what are you

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.570 
complexity and cloud nine what are you
guys<00:05:54.200> looking<00:05:54.410> to<00:05:54.620> do<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:54.920> prepare<00:05:55.070> for<00:05:55.280> those

guys looking to do to prepare for those
two<00:05:55.820> teams<00:05:56.120> anything<00:05:57.020> special<00:05:57.230> coming<00:05:57.560> out

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
two teams anything special coming out

two teams anything special coming out
well<00:05:58.280> not<00:05:58.520> really<00:05:58.760> I<00:05:58.910> mean<00:05:58.970> I<00:05:59.150> pick<00:05:59.330> some<00:05:59.480> bands

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
well not really I mean I pick some bands

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.360 
well not really I mean I pick some bands
are<00:05:59.900> just<00:06:00.050> see<00:06:00.170> only<00:06:00.350> like<00:06:00.620> crazy<00:06:00.950> thing<00:06:01.190> that

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
are just see only like crazy thing that

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.220 
are just see only like crazy thing that
you'd<00:06:01.490> be<00:06:01.610> able<00:06:01.730> to<00:06:01.850> see<00:06:01.940> but<00:06:02.420> besides<00:06:03.110> that

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
you'd be able to see but besides that

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.380 
you'd be able to see but besides that
complexity<00:06:04.040> look<00:06:04.280> really<00:06:04.640> solid<00:06:04.970> yesterday

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
complexity look really solid yesterday

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.120 
complexity look really solid yesterday
and<00:06:05.570> CLG<00:06:05.810> which<00:06:06.230> they<00:06:06.560> had<00:06:06.680> a<00:06:06.710> game<00:06:06.950> I<00:06:06.980> think

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
and CLG which they had a game I think

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.160 
and CLG which they had a game I think
like<00:06:07.400> a<00:06:07.430> 5k<00:06:07.910> goleta<00:06:08.360> tennis<00:06:08.870> which<00:06:08.990> they

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
like a 5k goleta tennis which they

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.140 
like a 5k goleta tennis which they
should<00:06:09.200> have<00:06:09.500> one<00:06:09.680> off<00:06:09.860> that<00:06:10.010> decidedly<00:06:10.670> but

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
should have one off that decidedly but

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.540 
should have one off that decidedly but
the<00:06:11.240> ended<00:06:11.420> up<00:06:11.510> throwing<00:06:11.690> a<00:06:11.900> baron<00:06:12.200> but<00:06:12.950> they

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
the ended up throwing a baron but they

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.040 
the ended up throwing a baron but they
look<00:06:13.760> really<00:06:13.940> good<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.270> they're<00:06:14.630> playing<00:06:14.810> up

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
look really good and they're playing up

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.900 
look really good and they're playing up
next<00:06:15.350> against<00:06:15.620> EG<00:06:15.950> so<00:06:16.160> just<00:06:16.430> scouting<00:06:16.730> out

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
next against EG so just scouting out

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.820 
next against EG so just scouting out
their<00:06:17.060> matches<00:06:17.420> and<00:06:17.570> just<00:06:17.780> being<00:06:18.320> able<00:06:18.560> to

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
their matches and just being able to

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.170 
their matches and just being able to
formulate<00:06:19.160> something<00:06:19.550> about<00:06:19.850> the

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
formulate something about the

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.250 
formulate something about the
information<00:06:20.570> you<00:06:20.660> can<00:06:20.750> gather<00:06:20.870> from<00:06:21.020> two

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
information you can gather from two

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.260 
information you can gather from two
matches<00:06:21.590> in<00:06:21.680> a<00:06:21.740> row<00:06:21.770> should<00:06:22.640> prepare<00:06:23.090> better

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
matches in a row should prepare better

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:24.730 
matches in a row should prepare better
plans<00:06:23.660> for<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:23.960> future<00:06:24.230> games<00:06:24.410> that<00:06:24.500> we<00:06:24.590> have

plans for the future games that we have

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.220 
plans for the future games that we have
same<00:06:25.100> thing<00:06:25.400> goes<00:06:25.430> for<00:06:25.580> c9<00:06:26.120> alright<00:06:26.900> just<00:06:27.110> to

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.190 
there a reason why that might be I never
even<00:06:44.970> thought<00:06:45.090> of<00:06:45.300> that<00:06:45.420> really<00:06:45.780> I<00:06:45.810> always

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
even thought of that really I always

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.840 
even thought of that really I always
thought<00:06:46.410> it<00:06:46.560> was<00:06:46.740> a<00:06:46.770> that<00:06:47.460> it<00:06:47.610> was<00:06:47.730> the

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:47.850 
thought it was a that it was the

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.550 
thought it was a that it was the
beginning<00:06:48.240> of<00:06:48.330> this<00:06:48.450> plane<00:06:48.720> not<00:06:48.960> in<00:06:49.140> terms<00:06:49.290> of

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
beginning of this plane not in terms of

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.860 
beginning of this plane not in terms of
days<00:06:49.890> so<00:06:50.370> I<00:06:50.400> don't<00:06:50.820> I<00:06:50.970> don't<00:06:51.060> really<00:06:51.600> know

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870
