that<00:00:39.040> I'm<00:00:39.640> completely<00:00:40.330> overpowered<00:00:41.580> so<00:00:42.930> it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
that I'm completely overpowered so it

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.500 
that I'm completely overpowered so it
shouldn't<00:00:44.260> be<00:00:44.320> too<00:00:44.500> too<00:00:44.680> hard<00:00:44.920> for<00:00:44.980> me<00:00:45.390> but<00:00:46.390> it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
shouldn't be too too hard for me but it

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.620 
shouldn't be too too hard for me but it
should<00:00:46.690> be<00:00:46.810> interesting

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
should be interesting

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.630 
should be interesting
at<00:00:49.170> least<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.680> see<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.130> they've<00:00:50.310> all

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
at least just to see what they've all

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.580 
at least just to see what they've all
been<00:00:50.820> too<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:51.900> I<00:00:51.990> believe<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.380> is<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
been too because I believe this is the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
been too because I believe this is the
first<00:00:52.860> Pokemon<00:00:53.310> game<00:00:53.580> that<00:00:53.820> has<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.420> Pokemon

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
first Pokemon game that has the Pokemon

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.690 
first Pokemon game that has the Pokemon
League<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.500> changed

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.020 

pretty<00:00:59.700> good<00:00:59.880> idea<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
pretty good idea and

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.120 
pretty good idea and
to<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.210> instituted<00:01:01.809> more<00:01:02.050> often

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
to be instituted more often

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.910 
to be instituted more often

now Hayes is pretty much mopping the
floor<00:02:48.350> with<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:49.930> year<00:02:50.930> because<00:02:51.290> i<00:02:51.700> am<00:02:52.700> level

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
floor with this year because i am level

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.440 
floor with this year because i am level
81<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.960> their<00:02:54.710> highest<00:02:55.580> level<00:02:55.910> they're<00:02:56.360> like

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
81 and their highest level they're like

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.450 
81 and their highest level they're like
at<00:02:56.570> six

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
at six

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.700 
at six
they<00:02:58.460> can<00:02:58.700> outrun<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.210> even<00:02:59.780> if

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
they can outrun it even if

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.260 
they can outrun it even if
I<00:03:01.770> think<00:03:02.070> that<00:03:02.130> if<00:03:02.430> my<00:03:02.550> gang<00:03:02.760> gar<00:03:02.910> was<00:03:03.060> more

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
I think that if my gang gar was more

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.360 
I think that if my gang gar was more
committed<00:03:03.600> level<00:03:04.020> their<00:03:04.260> Pope<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.710> wills

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
committed level their Pope on wills

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.020 
committed level their Pope on wills
Pokemon<00:03:05.820> might<00:03:06.050> fit<00:03:07.050> faster<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.370> since<00:03:08.940> i

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.440 
out to my
Thunderbolt<00:03:56.590> on<00:03:56.770> this<00:03:56.950> thing<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.450> squirrel

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
Thunderbolt on this thing and squirrel

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.930 
Thunderbolt on this thing and squirrel
buries<00:03:58.660> partially<00:03:59.380> watertight

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.240 

might<00:04:03.600> you<00:04:03.930> know<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.440> think<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.980> might<00:04:05.220> have

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
might you know I think I might have

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.760 
might you know I think I might have
needed<00:04:06.210> to<00:04:06.450> go<00:04:06.570> for<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.780> Shadow<00:04:07.050> Ball<00:04:07.320> since

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
needed to go for the Shadow Ball since

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.100 
needed to go for the Shadow Ball since
that<00:04:08.520> was<00:04:08.640> ghost<00:04:08.880> type<00:04:09.090> move<00:04:09.390> but<00:04:09.720> let's<00:04:09.960> see

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
that was ghost type move but let's see

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
that was ghost type move but let's see
how<00:04:10.230> much<00:04:10.380> Thunderbolt

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
how much Thunderbolt

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.400 
how much Thunderbolt
I<00:04:13.220> think<00:04:13.430> it's<00:04:13.520> going<00:04:13.610> to<00:04:13.670> be<00:04:13.790> one<00:04:13.940> two<00:04:14.090> tails

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
I think it's going to be one two tails

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.100 
I think it's going to be one two tails
yeah<00:04:15.410> no<00:04:15.920> problem<00:04:15.950> there<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.970> got<00:04:17.630> something

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
yeah no problem there I got something

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.960 
yeah no problem there I got something
for<00:04:18.140> some<00:04:18.500> level<00:04:18.770> here<00:04:18.980> it's<00:04:19.100> just<00:04:19.250> dark<00:04:19.850> for

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
for some level here it's just dark for

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.760 
for some level here it's just dark for
these

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
these

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.530 
these
xatu<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:23.220> stay<00:04:23.430> out<00:04:23.610> for<00:04:26.360> since<00:04:27.360> it's

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
xatu and stay out for since it's

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.870 
xatu and stay out for since it's
partially<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.200> bird<00:04:28.380> type<00:04:28.620> Pokemon<00:04:29.100> its<00:04:29.670> weak

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
partially a bird type Pokemon its weak

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.850 
partially a bird type Pokemon its weak
to<00:04:30.030> electric<00:04:30.510> and<00:04:30.720> those<00:04:31.230> type<00:04:31.440> moves<00:04:31.680> like

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
to electric and those type moves like

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.700 
to electric and those type moves like
shadow<00:04:32.100> ball<00:04:32.280> won't<00:04:32.490> affect<00:04:32.910> it<00:04:33.030> so<00:04:33.900> you<00:04:33.960> know

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
shadow ball won't affect it so you know

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.770 
shadow ball won't affect it so you know
I<00:04:35.010> have<00:04:35.310> Shadow<00:04:35.640> Ball<00:04:35.880> I'm<00:04:36.150> gonna<00:04:36.300> go<00:04:36.450> sun

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
I have Shadow Ball I'm gonna go sun

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.679 
I have Shadow Ball I'm gonna go sun
devils<00:04:37.170> I<00:04:38.150> am

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:44.600 

so<00:04:43.139> even<00:04:43.439> though<00:04:43.469> you<00:04:43.649> think<00:04:43.949> it's<00:04:44.279> a<00:04:44.339> strength

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
so even though you think it's a strength

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.159 
so even though you think it's a strength
because<00:04:45.029> you<00:04:45.119> won't<00:04:45.299> be<00:04:45.360> hit<00:04:45.569> by<00:04:45.719> ghost<00:04:45.959> type

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
because you won't be hit by ghost type

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.839 
because you won't be hit by ghost type
moves<00:04:46.499> you're<00:04:47.309> going<00:04:47.429> to<00:04:47.489> be<00:04:47.549> hit<00:04:47.729> by

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
moves you're going to be hit by

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.320 
moves you're going to be hit by
electric-type<00:04:48.509> moves<00:04:48.799> and<00:04:49.799> that's

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
electric-type moves and that's

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.170 
electric-type moves and that's
 you<00:04:50.810> up<00:04:51.430> that's<00:04:52.430> right<00:04:52.639> in<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.360> level<00:04:53.720> 82
