00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:29.233
 I never asked that. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.733
 If you want to make enemies ... 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.900
 Try to change something. 

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.267
 The year is 2027. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.267
 It is an era of exceptional innovation. 

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:55.833
 And technological advancement. 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.833
 It is also a time of chaos and conspiracy. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.200
 I do not even know which side I am. 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.133
 Recent news : 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.833

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:26.200
 a world leader in the controversial technology of human increase. 

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:29.500
 These people, Adam, are like ghosts. 

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:32.097
 Always in the shade ... 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.600
 Always hide behind lies and mercenaries. 

00:01:35.938 --> 00:01:37.243
 I want you to find them. 

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:39.362
 They can not stop us. 

00:01:39.863 --> 00:01:41.572
 They can not stop the future. 

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:43.700
 I never had a choice of what was happening to me. 

00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:48.627
 Adam! 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.001
 How do you feel, Adam? 

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:52.073
 The body can heal, 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.146
 But the mind is not always so resistant. 

00:01:59.457 --> 00:02:02.021
 Corporations are more powerful than the government. 

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:05.586
 Everyone is fighting for power. 

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:07.587
 For the control. 

00:02:07.784 --> 00:02:08.697
 Help. 

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:09.889
 Please! 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.584
 I'll take you to hell! 

00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:39.969
 Police opened fire on the crowd. 

00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:45.233
 You will never find them! 

00:02:50.163 --> 00:02:52.000
 I will never stop looking.
