00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
this is 100% organic and it is unrefined

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.319 
this is 100% organic and it is unrefined
one<00:00:50.039> thing<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.579> need<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.180> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
one thing you need to know about this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
one thing you need to know about this
though<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.809> didn't<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.320> he<00:00:53.280> does<00:00:53.489> come

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
though that I didn't know he does come

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.389 
though that I didn't know he does come
in<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.879> solid<00:00:54.239> form<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.260> comes<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.620> jar<00:00:55.860> but

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
in a solid form so it comes in a jar but

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.580 
in a solid form so it comes in a jar but
at<00:00:57.090> room<00:00:57.510> temperature<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> turns<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.469> liquid

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
at room temperature it turns to liquid

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.450 
at room temperature it turns to liquid
so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.520> was<00:01:00.390> scooping<00:01:00.770> large<00:01:01.770> amounts<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so I was scooping large amounts and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.969 
so I was scooping large amounts and
putting<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.030> my<00:01:03.059> hair<00:01:03.480> by<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> time<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.830> got

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
putting it in my hair by the time I got

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.500 
putting it in my hair by the time I got
through<00:01:05.129> my<00:01:05.280> whole<00:01:05.489> hair<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> my<00:01:06.060> hair<00:01:06.090> was

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
through my whole hair and my hair was

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.690 
through my whole hair and my hair was
drying<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.409> coconut<00:01:07.860> oil<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.280> literally

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
drying the coconut oil was literally

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
drying the coconut oil was literally
dripping<00:01:08.939> all<00:01:09.360> over<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.960> place

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
dripping all over the place

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.120 
dripping all over the place
so<00:01:10.830> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.490> don't<00:01:11.610> want<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.880> embarrassed

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
so if you don't want to be embarrassed

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.200 
so if you don't want to be embarrassed
definitely<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.280> use<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.820> bit<00:01:14.970> until

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
definitely just use a little bit until

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.690 
definitely just use a little bit until
it<00:01:15.299> turns<00:01:15.479> into<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.350> liquid<00:01:16.740> form<00:01:17.100> but<00:01:17.369> it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it turns into it's a liquid form but it

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.550 
it turns into it's a liquid form but it
works<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.150> well<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.409> been

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
works really well so I have been

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.010 
works really well so I have been
massaging<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.189> into<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.580> scalp<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> getting

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
massaging that into my scalp and getting

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
massaging that into my scalp and getting
the<00:01:22.110> ends<00:01:22.560> really<00:01:22.799> good<00:01:23.100> I've<00:01:23.880> been<00:01:24.390> using<00:01:24.659> my

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the ends really good I've been using my

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.890 
the ends really good I've been using my
bonnet<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> evening<00:01:26.189> um<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.570> know<00:01:27.659> tie

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
bonnet in the evening um to you know tie

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.960 
bonnet in the evening um to you know tie
up<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:28.049> hair<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:29.009> protected<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
up my hair so that it's protected and I

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240 
up my hair so that it's protected and I
wasn't<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:31.500> doing<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.040> in

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
wasn't really good about doing that in

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.830 
wasn't really good about doing that in
the<00:01:32.369> past<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.820> I've<00:01:32.909> been<00:01:33.180> consistent<00:01:33.780> with

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the past so I've been consistent with

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.569 
the past so I've been consistent with
that<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.189> helping<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that so I think it's really helping to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.090 
that so I think it's really helping to
protect<00:01:35.970> my<00:01:36.270> hair<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:37.259> other<00:01:37.439> thing<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.890> I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
protect my hair the other thing is I

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800 
protect my hair the other thing is I
haven't<00:01:38.460> been<00:01:38.549> using<00:01:38.729> any<00:01:39.030> heat<00:01:39.299> at<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.600> I

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
haven't been using any heat at all I

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.190 
haven't been using any heat at all I
used<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> stretch<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:41.670> curls<00:01:42.110> using<00:01:43.110> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
used to like to stretch my curls using a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.929 
used to like to stretch my curls using a
blow-dryer<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.159> think<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
blow-dryer and I think I got a lot of

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.600 
blow-dryer and I think I got a lot of
heat<00:01:45.299> damage<00:01:45.540> because<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.950> I've<00:01:47.340> cut

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
heat damage because of that so I've cut

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
heat damage because of that so I've cut
out<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.909> blow-dryer<00:01:48.329> cut<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.110> heat

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350

altogether<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.549> month<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.180> I've

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299

noticed<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.960> curls<00:01:52.229> are<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> little

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
noticed that my curls are a little

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.830 
noticed that my curls are a little
tighter<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> good<00:01:53.729> thing<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> can

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
tighter which is a good thing so I can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.450

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
getting back to its original curl

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.969 
getting back to its original curl
