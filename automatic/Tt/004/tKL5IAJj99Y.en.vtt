manage the game right away it really

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.179 
manage the game right away it really
seems<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.320> that's<00:01:37.560> what<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.799> want<00:01:37.979> him<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
seems like that's what they want him to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.350 
seems like that's what they want him to
do<00:01:38.310> they're<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.610> going<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> ask<00:01:38.970> him<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.270> go

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
do they're not going to ask him to go

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730 
do they're not going to ask him to go
out<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.630> start<00:01:39.780> slinging<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.350> like

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
out there and start slinging it like

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.050 
out there and start slinging it like
that<00:01:40.860> maybe<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.280> saw<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:41.700> bit<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that maybe we saw a little bit in the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
that maybe we saw a little bit in the
preseason<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.600> they<00:01:42.659> wanted<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> try

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
preseason because they wanted to try

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.600 
preseason because they wanted to try
that<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.710> don't<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.189> they're<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.460> try

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that I don't think they're going to try

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.830 
that I don't think they're going to try
that<00:01:44.790> anymore<00:01:44.970> here<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> regular<00:01:45.689> season

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
that anymore here in the regular season

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.330 
that anymore here in the regular season
so<00:01:46.140> I<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.290> they're<00:01:46.470> just<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.770> try<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
so I think they're just going to try and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.030 
so I think they're just going to try and
see<00:01:48.000> Adrian<00:01:48.720> Peterson<00:01:49.170> running<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.860> game

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
see Adrian Peterson running the game

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.620 
see Adrian Peterson running the game
hopefully<00:01:50.579> getting<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.060> lead<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> then

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
hopefully getting the lead and then

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.840 
hopefully getting the lead and then

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the wipies were not happy with where

they got backup offensive line wise and

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.180 
they got backup offensive line wise and
it<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.540> interesting<00:02:21.260> Andrew<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.890> offensive

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
it is interesting Andrew the offensive

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.530 
it is interesting Andrew the offensive
line<00:02:22.310> as<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.700> whole<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> thought<00:02:23.330> in<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
line as a whole I thought in the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.660 
line as a whole I thought in the
preseason<00:02:23.840> didn't<00:02:24.230> play<00:02:24.350> incredibly<00:02:24.830> well<00:02:25.040> as

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
preseason didn't play incredibly well as

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.490 
preseason didn't play incredibly well as
we<00:02:25.880> have<00:02:26.000> people<00:02:26.150> as<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.810> can<00:02:26.840> see<00:02:27.080> moving

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
we have people as you can see moving

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.080 
we have people as you can see moving
right<00:02:27.620> behind<00:02:27.890> us<00:02:28.069> this<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.489> it's<00:02:28.730> not<00:02:28.819> live

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
right behind us this is it's not live

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.960 
right behind us this is it's not live
but<00:02:29.330> it's<00:02:29.480> as<00:02:29.630> good<00:02:29.900> as<00:02:29.989> life<00:02:30.730> but<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.790> think

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
but it's as good as life but I think

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.880 
but it's as good as life but I think
what<00:02:32.060> we<00:02:32.150> saw<00:02:32.360> was<00:02:32.540> back<00:02:32.810> up<00:02:33.019> wise<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.680> team

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
being around this team on a daily basis

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:24.839 
being around this team on a daily basis
Andrew<00:05:23.889> what<00:05:24.010> do<00:05:24.099> you<00:05:24.159> think<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.400> odds<00:05:24.430> are

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
Andrew what do you think the odds are

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.060 
Andrew what do you think the odds are
that<00:05:24.909> they<00:05:25.599> not<00:05:25.930> just<00:05:26.080> only<00:05:26.440> reach<00:05:26.770> out<00:05:26.919> to

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
that they not just only reach out to

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.409 
that they not just only reach out to
infield<00:05:27.370> but<00:05:27.520> actually<00:05:27.820> make<00:05:27.970> a<00:05:28.000> hard<00:05:28.210> push<00:05:28.389> to

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
infield but actually make a hard push to

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.909 
infield but actually make a hard push to
say<00:05:28.720> come<00:05:28.960> back<00:05:29.080> for<00:05:29.289> one<00:05:29.380> season<00:05:29.590> well<00:05:29.800> from

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
say come back for one season well from

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.710 
say come back for one season well from
afraid<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.400> you<00:05:30.460> won't<00:05:30.580> practice<00:05:30.849> yeah

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
afraid and you won't practice yeah

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.450 
afraid and you won't practice yeah
exactly<00:05:31.900> but<00:05:32.380> what<00:05:32.530> Frazier<00:05:32.770> had<00:05:33.010> said<00:05:33.220> today

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
exactly but what Frazier had said today

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.860 
exactly but what Frazier had said today
was<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.820> doesn't<00:05:34.090> seem<00:05:34.360> like<00:05:34.389> he's<00:05:34.690> going<00:05:34.810> to

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
was it doesn't seem like he's going to

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.360 
was it doesn't seem like he's going to
try<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.110> push<00:05:35.409> a<00:05:35.440> Winfield<00:05:35.919> like<00:05:36.099> they<00:05:36.190> did

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
try and push a Winfield like they did

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.649 
try and push a Winfield like they did
with<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.580> Brett<00:05:36.789> Favre<00:05:37.090> when<00:05:37.300> he<00:05:37.419> was<00:05:37.539> going

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
with the Brett Favre when he was going

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.149 
with the Brett Favre when he was going
to<00:05:37.690> go<00:05:37.840> into<00:05:37.990> retirement<00:05:38.320> which<00:05:38.680> was<00:05:38.800> Childers

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
to go into retirement which was Childers

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:40.439 
to go into retirement which was Childers
right<00:05:39.310> exactly<00:05:39.820> that<00:05:39.940> was<00:05:40.030> children<00:05:40.330> so

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
right exactly that was children so

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.360 
right exactly that was children so
Frazier<00:05:40.630> Frazier's<00:05:41.349> quote<00:05:41.560> was<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:42.159> don't

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
Frazier Frazier's quote was you don't

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.159 
Frazier Frazier's quote was you don't
want<00:05:42.669> to<00:05:42.760> talk<00:05:42.909> a<00:05:42.970> guy<00:05:43.240> on<00:05:43.419> a<00:05:43.449> retirement<00:05:44.080> if

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
want to talk a guy on a retirement if

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.020 
want to talk a guy on a retirement if
that's<00:05:44.320> what<00:05:44.530> he<00:05:44.590> wants<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.889> do<00:05:45.130> so<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.789> seems

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
that's what he wants to do so that seems

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.370 
that's what he wants to do so that seems
to<00:05:46.090> be<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.210> exact<00:05:46.570> opposite<00:05:46.990> take<00:05:47.199> that

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
to be the exact opposite take that

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.510 
to be the exact opposite take that
hchildress<00:05:47.710> had<00:05:47.889> when<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:48.159> comes<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.400> these

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
hchildress had when it comes to these

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.950 
hchildress had when it comes to these
things<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:48.880> I<00:05:48.909> think<00:05:49.030> it's<00:05:49.180> really<00:05:49.270> Antoine's

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
things so I think it's really Antoine's

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.050 
things so I think it's really Antoine's
call<00:05:50.260> if<00:05:50.409> Antoine<00:05:50.800> picks<00:05:51.070> up<00:05:51.220> the<00:05:51.340> phone<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
call if Antoine picks up the phone the

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.879 
call if Antoine picks up the phone the
Vikings<00:05:52.449> will<00:05:52.539> listen<00:05:52.780> if<00:05:53.110> he<00:05:53.229> doesn't<00:05:53.650> you

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
Vikings will listen if he doesn't you

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.500 
Vikings will listen if he doesn't you
move<00:05:54.070> on<00:05:54.220> with<00:05:54.340> what<00:05:54.460> you<00:05:54.580> got<00:05:54.729> so<00:05:55.090> let's<00:05:55.300> say

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
move on with what you got so let's say

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.480 
move on with what you got so let's say

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320

Cook and Josh Robbins 10 happened you
got<00:06:02.050> to<00:06:02.199> think<00:06:02.349> that<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.979> calls<00:06:03.280> would<00:06:03.490> become

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
got to think that the calls would become

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.300 
got to think that the calls would become
more<00:06:03.909> frequent

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
more frequent

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.070 
more frequent
one<00:06:04.610> at<00:06:04.700> that<00:06:04.790> point<00:06:05.030> though<00:06:05.150> don't<00:06:05.360> you<00:06:05.450> maybe

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
one at that point though don't you maybe

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.240 
one at that point though don't you maybe
they're<00:06:06.410> gonna<00:06:06.500> have<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:06.710> see<00:06:06.830> what<00:06:06.950> they<00:06:07.070> have

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.890 
they're gonna have to see what they have
there<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:07.730> maybe<00:06:08.240> they<00:06:08.480> just<00:06:08.510> look<00:06:08.780> in<00:06:08.870> the

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
there but maybe they just look in the

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.210 
there but maybe they just look in the
free-agent<00:06:09.140> market<00:06:09.380> elsewhere<00:06:09.950> for<00:06:10.100> other
