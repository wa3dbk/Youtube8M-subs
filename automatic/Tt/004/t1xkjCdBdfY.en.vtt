 put and made from food is mushroom soup 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.810
 you can eat it now because my 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.980

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:35.219
 add exactly two pieces of it 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.640

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.320

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 you can make armor of stones which 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:34.460
 will be stronger than leather jacket 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.460
 but weaker than regular iron armor 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.700
 Well, you can also make regular cards and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.450
