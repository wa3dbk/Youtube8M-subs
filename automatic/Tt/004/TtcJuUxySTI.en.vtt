00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.820
 hello everybody like that time I already shot 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860
 video on the subject of dairy products husband 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.260
 they were talking about is it possible 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.359
 eat or not walk so much 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.430
 around this rumor and today I decided 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.320
 a little bit more and and support all of us 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.329
 we will warm about milk and many 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.240
 used to drink it since childhood right every 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.130
 a day in your life without a glass of milk 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.099
 nothing happens and somebody at all 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.680
 I do n't drink it do you think she just 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.170
 we need in childhood only when we 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 were born feeding us milk because in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.940
 it has all the nutrients proteins 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.620
 fats carbohydrates vitamins minerals and then 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 as an adult she is simply not us 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.630
 necessary in general let's support this 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.790
 The topic of course is sure to discuss this. 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.970
 all in the comments and today i will talk 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.260
 about the choice of milk for people who 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.110
 want to lose weight 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.060
 milk and losing weight, well, the first thing we do 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.490
 look yes when choosing products Assad 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.799
 milk fat but now it is not 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.360
 problem stores are full of milk with 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.460
 a small percentage of fat 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.830
 can be found even fat free that is in 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.990
 principle if not to delve into the process 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.710
 its production and picketing others 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.650
 a month and this is all scary to me and fats in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.110
 milk and this is the last thing we 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.510
 remember because there are simple 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 sugar that is lactose and you all know 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.950
 what exactly is it worth following 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.840
 because a large number of simple 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.680
 sugars for humans that follow 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 his figure 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.780
 it is rather a minus than pros and only 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 inhibits the whole process in general i am not 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.970
 would recommend milk in large 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.409
 quantities to those who want to lose weight and 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.630
 also I would not recommend it to those 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.790
 who has lactose intolerance problems 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.040
 we spoke about it too 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.380
 easy to check when you drink 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.110
 dairy products or eat something 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.770
 milky if you feel pain in 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.869
 stomach 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.549
 cut bloating and so on then 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.200
 perhaps you are the one who faces this problem 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.240
 tell the doctor and maybe dairy 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.040
 products are really adult 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.799
 age you are no longer suitable if 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.459
 talk about industry she 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.900
 came up with already and lactose-free milk but with 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.210
 points of average weight loss is not so 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.760
 good because lactose is there 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.620
 a rose in general if you look it 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.420
 the composition of milk is 100 milliliters you 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.290
 be sure to go somewhere 45 grams 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.660
 carbohydrates and in the whole liter is 50 grams 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.390
 practically sugar fast carbohydrates 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.520
 so watch the amount of milk and 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.260
 if you are used to scream, then it is not 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.660
 scary but recently I wrote a girl 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.280
 which beats him a minimum of a liter a day and 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.710
 Of course it is not surprising why he has 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.510
 there may be problems with losing weight 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.310
 I can say that listen to 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.160
 your body and make a choice and for 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.810
 or against milk me for example a 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.270
 childhood so it or now me 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.370
 I don't use it for him 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.530
 mostly cooking some dishes and sometimes 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 with places because i like eating 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.130
 correct and today I would like with 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.680
 you speculate not only on the topic 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.690
 do you drink milk or not do you think that 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.230
 you need it or not in adult 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.940
 age 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.220
 I would also like to know your opinion 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.320
 about packaged milk which 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.110
 stands on the shelves of stores like 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.690
 natural cow she is very fat not 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.150
 everyone likes its smell and packaged 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.830
 judging by all the myths and perhaps 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.230
 real stories about how she 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.270
 produced far from useful what is 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.220
 we do after all the choice of products we 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.560
 very often we get up and before such a choice 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.210
 and sometimes it seems that we have no choice 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.800
 so let's support this in 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.220
 comments it will seem to me very 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.900
 interesting there is something to discuss and everything on 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.790
 today i want to wish you lose weight 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.110
 correctly wisely and stick 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.490
 healthy lifestyle 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.490
 it will be the right choice 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.760
 Well
