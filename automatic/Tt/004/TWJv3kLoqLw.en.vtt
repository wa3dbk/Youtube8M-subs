the 174 updates now they've upgraded
from<00:00:23.609> 173<00:00:24.449> mostly<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.320> bug<00:00:25.529> fixes<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.099> the

from 173 mostly just bug fixes but the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.029 
from 173 mostly just bug fixes but the
game<00:00:26.609> does<00:00:26.910> seem<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> load<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.810> lot<00:00:28.050> nicer<00:00:28.289> still

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
game does seem to load a lot nicer still

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.320 
game does seem to load a lot nicer still
a<00:00:29.070> little<00:00:29.279> jittery<00:00:29.490> when<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.910> go<00:00:30.029> into<00:00:30.210> new

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
a little jittery when you go into new

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.359 
a little jittery when you go into new
chunks<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:30.990> that's<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.380> expected<00:00:31.410> but

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
chunks but that's to be expected but

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.060 
chunks but that's to be expected but
obviously<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.210> nice<00:00:33.450> improvement<00:00:33.840> over<00:00:34.350> 172

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
obviously a nice improvement over 172

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.850 
obviously a nice improvement over 172
because<00:00:35.370> we<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:36.420> far<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:36.899> up<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.500> 16

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
because we can see very far now up to 16

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.490 
because we can see very far now up to 16
chunks<00:00:38.190> at<00:00:38.340> least<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.850> vanilla<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.320> looks

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
chunks at least in vanilla so it looks

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530 
chunks at least in vanilla so it looks
very<00:00:40.649> nice<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.879> not<00:00:42.059> complaining<00:00:42.450> about

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
very nice and I'm not complaining about

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720 
very nice and I'm not complaining about
that<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> other<00:00:43.620> feature<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.610> was

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
