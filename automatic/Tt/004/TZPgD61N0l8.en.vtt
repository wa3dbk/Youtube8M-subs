about<00:00:34.020> short-term<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:35.100> movement<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.700> we

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
about short-term the movement so we

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.010 
about short-term the movement so we
don't<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.149> this<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> annual<00:00:36.690> rate<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
don't know this is the annual rate of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.330 
don't know this is the annual rate of
change<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.559> mean<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.190> most

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
change I mean it's the one that most

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.430 
change I mean it's the one that most
economists<00:00:38.910> are<00:00:39.059> watching<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.840> yeah<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.230> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
economists are watching so yeah so the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.020 
economists are watching so yeah so the
annual<00:00:40.800> rate<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.010> change<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> Quan

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
annual rate of change is now the Quan

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.119 
annual rate of change is now the Quan
compared<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:42.750> six<00:00:43.739> months<00:00:43.890> or<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
compared to what it was six months or a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
compared to what it was six months or a
year<00:00:44.160> ago<00:00:44.370> exactly<00:00:45.000> yeah<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.420> mean<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.020> don't

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
year ago exactly yeah I mean so I don't

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.200 
year ago exactly yeah I mean so I don't
think<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.250> continue<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:48.120> I

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
think that's going to continue because I

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.520 
think that's going to continue because I
think<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.570> think<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> government<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.289> going<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
think I think the government is going to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.220 
think I think the government is going to
continue<00:00:50.030> increasing<00:00:51.030> money<00:00:51.660> supply<00:00:52.020> me

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
continue increasing money supply me

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.380 
continue increasing money supply me
that's<00:00:52.410> even<00:00:52.710> look<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.129> look<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.789> deficits

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that's even look at look at the deficits

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
that's even look at look at the deficits
that<00:00:54.480> they<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> monetize<00:00:55.410> look<00:00:55.800> at

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
that they have to monetize look at

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.439 
that they have to monetize look at
either<00:00:56.340> look<00:00:56.640> at<00:00:56.730> what's<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.210> they're

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
dollars and of course every year you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.100 
dollars and of course every year you
know<00:01:08.400> trillions<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.180> dollars<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.570> government

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
know trillions of dollars of government

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.190 
know trillions of dollars of government
debt<00:01:10.260> matures<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.610> matures<00:01:11.990> if<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
debt matures and as it matures if the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.410 
debt matures and as it matures if the
current<00:01:13.530> holders<00:01:13.890> don't<00:01:14.640> want<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.119> then<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
current holders don't want it then the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
current holders don't want it then the
banks<00:01:15.780> or<00:01:15.960> somebody<00:01:16.350> has<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> pick<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
banks or somebody has to pick up the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.640 
banks or somebody has to pick up the
slack<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.720> that<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.930> where<00:01:19.080> all<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.380> money<00:01:19.560> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
slack so that is where all the money is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.980 
slack so that is where all the money is
going<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.640> money<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.119> being<00:01:21.420> is

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
going I think the money is being is

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.480 
going I think the money is being is
going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> government<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.220> might

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
going to the government that might

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.620 
going to the government that might

it<00:01:56.759> wants<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.030> move<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> lot<00:01:57.450> higher<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.020> I

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
it wants to move a lot higher and I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.560 
it wants to move a lot higher and I
expected<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.880> been<00:02:00.090> very<00:02:00.240> strong

you<00:03:11.209> know<00:03:11.330> stocks<00:03:11.750> went<00:03:11.989> down<00:03:12.110> around<00:03:12.350> the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
you know stocks went down around the

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.069 
you know stocks went down around the
world<00:03:12.709> but<00:03:12.920> 2009<00:03:13.790> was<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.120> fantastic<00:03:14.540> here<00:03:14.989> to

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
world but 2009 was a fantastic here to

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.050 
world but 2009 was a fantastic here to
be<00:03:15.170> long<00:03:15.380> stocks<00:03:16.130> particularly<00:03:16.730> foreign

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
be long stocks particularly foreign

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.000 
be long stocks particularly foreign
stocks<00:03:17.269> emerging<00:03:17.810> markets<00:03:18.170> commodities<00:03:18.680> and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
stocks emerging markets commodities and

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.850 
stocks emerging markets commodities and
my<00:03:19.250> inclination<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.989> is<00:03:21.200> going<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.709> be

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
my inclination is that is going to be

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.380 
my inclination is that is going to be
the<00:03:22.100> long-term<00:03:22.310> trend<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.030> mean<00:03:23.180> certainly

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
the long-term trend I mean certainly

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.360 
the long-term trend I mean certainly
stocks<00:03:24.049> are<00:03:24.260> going<00:03:24.440> to<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.650> periods<00:03:25.070> of<00:03:25.160> time

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
stocks are going to have periods of time

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.830 
stocks are going to have periods of time
where<00:03:25.549> they're<00:03:25.700> falling<00:03:26.150> in<00:03:26.390> terms<00:03:26.630> of

where they're falling in terms of

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.100 
where they're falling in terms of

there's something real there as opposed
to<00:03:42.620> paper<00:03:43.010> which<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.340> nothing<00:03:43.700> right<00:03:44.209> I<00:03:44.239> mean

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
to paper which is nothing right I mean

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.210 
to paper which is nothing right I mean
it's<00:03:44.720> not<00:03:44.870> backed<00:03:45.140> by<00:03:45.290> gold<00:03:45.470> any<00:03:45.739> more<00:03:45.980> of<00:03:46.100> the

it's not backed by gold any more of the

it's not backed by gold any more of the

just<00:03:48.290> pieces<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.650> paper<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:49.070> governments

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
just pieces of paper and governments

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.580 
just pieces of paper and governments
create<00:03:50.269> if<00:03:50.570> you<00:03:50.750> don't<00:03:50.959> want<00:03:51.140> to<00:03:51.230> be<00:03:51.320> an<00:03:51.410> asset

create if you don't want to be an asset

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.650 
create if you don't want to be an asset
than<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:52.370> alternative<00:03:52.940> is<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.150> be<00:03:53.269> in<00:03:53.360> paper

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
than the alternative is to be in paper

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.500 
than the alternative is to be in paper
and<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.680> just<00:03:55.010> think<00:03:55.220> over<00:03:55.489> time<00:03:55.519> paper<00:03:56.329> is

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
and I just think over time paper is

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.880 
and I just think over time paper is
going<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.690> lose<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> lot<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.140> value<00:03:57.590> especially

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
going to lose a lot of value especially

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.949 
going to lose a lot of value especially
since<00:03:58.549> they're<00:03:58.850> creating<00:03:59.209> so<00:03:59.390> much<00:03:59.510> of<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.840> and

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
since they're creating so much of it and

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.740 
since they're creating so much of it and
that<00:04:00.410> it<00:04:00.500> intrinsically<00:04:01.070> has<00:04:01.370> no<00:04:01.610> value<00:04:01.790> so

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
that it intrinsically has no value so

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.750 
that it intrinsically has no value so
you<00:04:03.200> know<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.320> like<00:04:03.650> owning<00:04:03.860> stocks<00:04:04.280> rather
