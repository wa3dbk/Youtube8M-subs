00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.190
 There are devices that at first glance seem 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.190
 easier than it really is. 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.190
 This is the impression that makes the Samsung ST96 - small 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.190
 camera with great features. 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.190
 This model attracts interest even after 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.190
 a quick look at the characteristics. 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.190
 CMOS Matrix, Full Video Capability 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.710
 HD, 3D photo, multiple shooting modes, image stabilizer 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.620
 - in one word there is everything you need. 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.620
 ordinary person. 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:24.500
 Equally important, the camera looks very attractive. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.430
 The black case gives the camera a gloss, by the way, it is practically 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.039
 fingerprints are not visible, and this is also important. 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.570
 Almost the entire rear panel of the camera takes up the screen, 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.550
 slightly less than 7 centimeters diagonally, its quite 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.199
 enough for any shooting conditions, and quite large 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.649
 icons will be clearly visible even to people with poor eyesight. 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.780
 Next to the display are the main control buttons, 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.249
 there are not many of them, but it is even good. 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.840
 For the first time taking the camera in hand, you can quickly figure out 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.649
 with the principles of management. 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.609
 You will hardly have to resort to help instructions. 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:00.640
 On the top panel are located the power and shutter buttons 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.140
 shutter and zoom lever. 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.269
 It does not work very smoothly, but to catch the right angle 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.269
 can be quite easy. 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.760
 Of the features of the camera, we note the possibility of charging 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.080
 from the laptop and the fact that it is quickly determined by the computer, 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.260
 Photos are easy to copy and convenient. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.160
 In daylight, the camera works fine, which 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.650
 either serious problems with focus, underflow or 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.580
 Peresvet we have not noticed. 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.720
 In automatic mode, the camera is enough 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.650
 understands shooting conditions correctly and selects the best 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:27.650
 options. 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.420
 In low light conditions, too, everything is fine. 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.650
 Thanks to the built-in flash, the ST96 copes with its 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.040
 work even at night. 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 In addition, if necessary, you can enhance the signal to 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.100
 3200 ISO units. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.740
 There is also a built-in image stabilizer, 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.450
 blurry shots due to a trembling hand will be much 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.480
 less. 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.771
 A lens with a five-fold zoom is enough for shooting 

00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:54.630
 landscapes, and for when you need to take a picture 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.680
 sufficiently remote object. 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.590
 There are several shooting modes in the Samsung ST96. 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.420
 There are both fully automatic and manual, where you can 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.530
 set the white balance, ISO, exposure or 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.349
 put on photo effects. 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.140
 Well, in most cases, the “Plot” mode is suitable. 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.200
 There are 13 programs for different shooting conditions. 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.630
 Separately, we note the mode "Panorama" - just enter 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170
 camera from one side to the other and you end up with 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 panoramic frame, this mode is perfect for those 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.310
 who travel often. 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.510
 Also in the camera provides all sorts of filters and effects, 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.440
 they can be used as for already captured shots, 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.390
 and directly during shooting. 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.480
 There are here and already become familiar detection functions. 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.450
 faces, smiles and blinks. 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.530
 Well, complete the list of advantages of this camera shooting modes 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.030
 Full HD video and 3D photo. 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.830
 By the way, many effects can also be applied to video 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.950
 the video may look like this, and like this, and, for example, like this. 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.570
 And the camera itself can create video clips. 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.620
 from the captured video and photographic materials. 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.740
 In general, the Samsung ST96 is in every sense a decent camera. 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.200
 for moderate money. 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.110
 Dozens of useful features, many modes of operation 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.140
 and opportunities will satisfy the needs of practically 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.140
 everyone. 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.140
 The video camera shoots quite well, especially if 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.140
 remember its low price. 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.140
 Shooting a video is very simple, there is no problem even 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.140
 with minimal lighting. 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.140
 But, we note that you can only shoot at minimum 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.140
 focal length, other times worth using 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.141
 tripod.
