in fact 5601 Calvin precisely now if you

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.640 
in fact 5601 Calvin precisely now if you
go<00:00:49.210> back<00:00:49.360> to<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.630> light<00:00:49.840> what<00:00:50.320> you'll<00:00:50.470> see

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
go back to the light what you'll see

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.700 
go back to the light what you'll see
here<00:00:50.680> is<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.130> is<00:00:51.250> currently<00:00:51.579> set<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:52.350> 5600<00:00:53.350> so

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
here is that is currently set to 5600 so

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.520 
here is that is currently set to 5600 so
we<00:00:53.829> are<00:00:53.950> within<00:00:54.130> to<00:00:54.579> Kelvin<00:00:55.240> of<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:56.050> specified

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
we are within to Kelvin of the specified

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.229 
we are within to Kelvin of the specified
color<00:00:56.860> temperature<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.579> an<00:00:57.700> unheard-of

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
color temperature that is an unheard-of

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.360 
color temperature that is an unheard-of
accuracy<00:00:58.810> most<00:00:59.350> lights<00:00:59.590> if<00:00:59.739> you<00:00:59.829> actually<00:01:00.040> do

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
accuracy most lights if you actually do

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.580 
accuracy most lights if you actually do
this<00:01:00.520> process<00:01:00.910> will<00:01:01.090> be<00:01:01.180> 200<00:01:01.750> or<00:01:01.870> 300<00:01:02.050> Kelvin

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
this process will be 200 or 300 Kelvin

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.200 
this process will be 200 or 300 Kelvin
out<00:01:02.710> so<00:01:03.070> we're<00:01:03.190> accurate<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.700> one<00:01:03.970> degree

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
out so we're accurate to one degree

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.359 
out so we're accurate to one degree
Kelvin<00:01:04.839> if<00:01:05.439> I<00:01:05.500> do<00:01:05.560> that<00:01:05.799> through<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:06.130> range

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
Kelvin if I do that through the range

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.090 
Kelvin if I do that through the range
anywhere<00:01:07.360> by<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.810> way<00:01:08.020> with<00:01:08.200> an<00:01:08.320> accuracy<00:01:08.590> 50

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
anywhere by the way with an accuracy 50

anywhere by the way with an accuracy 50

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
degree in Kelvin is considered film

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.639 
degree in Kelvin is considered film
great<00:01:10.810> accurate<00:01:11.170> so<00:01:11.259> I'm<00:01:11.320> going<00:01:11.439> to<00:01:11.470> take<00:01:11.560> this

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
great accurate so I'm going to take this

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.980 
great accurate so I'm going to take this
down<00:01:11.829> to<00:01:11.860> maybe<00:01:12.130> say<00:01:12.460> around<00:01:13.119> forty<00:01:13.630> four

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
down to maybe say around forty four

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.739 
down to maybe say around forty four
hundred<00:01:14.860> Kelvin<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.520> as<00:01:15.850> i<00:01:15.969> do<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.210> i<00:01:16.600> get

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
hundred Kelvin and as i do that i get

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:18.599 
hundred Kelvin and as i do that i get
that<00:01:16.960> set<00:01:17.200> on<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.469> light<00:01:17.649> if<00:01:17.950> we<00:01:18.189> get<00:01:18.280> if<00:01:18.399> we<00:01:18.429> go

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609 
that set on the light if we get if we go

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.200 
that set on the light if we get if we go
up<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.819> the<00:01:18.909> meter<00:01:19.119> it<00:01:19.539> is<00:01:19.929> currently<00:01:20.259> reading

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
up to the meter it is currently reading

up to the meter it is currently reading
4400<00:01:22.210> calvin<00:01:22.539> 4401<00:01:23.259> so<00:01:23.950> within<00:01:24.130> one<00:01:24.429> or<00:01:24.460> two

00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:24.639 
4400 calvin 4401 so within one or two

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.669 
4400 calvin 4401 so within one or two
Calvin<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.840> specified<00:01:26.319> color

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.230 
from 3152 6300 with this light I set the
light<00:01:43.929> at<00:01:44.109> 3200<00:01:44.859> Kelvin<00:01:45.279> and<00:01:45.490> if<00:01:45.939> my<00:01:46.029> colleague

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
light at 3200 Kelvin and if my colleague

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.840 
light at 3200 Kelvin and if my colleague
demonstrates<00:01:46.810> we<00:01:46.929> are<00:01:47.049> now<00:01:47.200> at<00:01:49.200> 3199<00:01:50.850> Kelvin

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
demonstrates we are now at 3199 Kelvin

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.209

so<00:01:52.060> again<00:01:52.359> within<00:01:52.659> one<00:01:53.139> Kelvin<00:01:53.529> of<00:01:53.889> the

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
so again within one Kelvin of the
