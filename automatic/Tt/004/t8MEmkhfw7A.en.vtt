you seen from Anthony Davis development

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.750 
you seen from Anthony Davis development
here<00:00:06.299> on<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.569> international<00:00:07.350> stage<00:00:07.760> well

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
here on the international stage well

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.790 
here on the international stage well
obviously<00:00:08.849> he's<00:00:09.540> got<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> ways<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.200> go<00:00:10.349> with<00:00:10.679> his

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
obviously he's got a ways to go with his

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.890 
obviously he's got a ways to go with his
game<00:00:11.040> he'd<00:00:11.670> be<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> first<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.300> admit<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.630> but

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
game he'd be the first to admit that but

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.890 
game he'd be the first to admit that but
I<00:00:12.990> think<00:00:13.049> mentally<00:00:13.650> he's<00:00:13.799> taking<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.190> step

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
I think mentally he's taking a step

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.200 
I think mentally he's taking a step
understanding<00:00:15.900> how<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:16.590> lead<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> team<00:00:17.609> every

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
understanding how to lead a team every

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.810 
understanding how to lead a team every
single<00:00:18.539> night<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:20.010> locker<00:00:20.220> room<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:20.670> more

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
single night in the locker room but more

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.400 
single night in the locker room but more
importantly<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> floor<00:00:21.750> he's<00:00:22.080> been<00:00:22.230> able

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
importantly on the floor he's been able

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.970 
importantly on the floor he's been able
to<00:00:22.710> carry<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.519> big<00:00:24.090> load<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.859> stealing<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
to carry a big load and stealing with a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.439 
to carry a big load and stealing with a
different<00:00:26.369> style<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.699> basketball<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.359> that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
different style of basketball and that

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.740 
different style of basketball and that
hasn't<00:00:27.689> changed<00:00:27.900> his<00:00:28.529> approach<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.340> so

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
hasn't changed his approach and so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.120 
hasn't changed his approach and so
mentally<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:31.080> he's<00:00:31.199> taken<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.679> step<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
mentally I think he's taken a step and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.299 
mentally I think he's taken a step and
obviously<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.630> his<00:00:33.780> game<00:00:33.989> he's<00:00:34.800> added

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
obviously I'm in his game he's added

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.670 
obviously I'm in his game he's added
some<00:00:35.340> things<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.660> really<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.140> how<00:00:37.530> much

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
some things that we really like how much

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.650 
some things that we really like how much
of<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.129> continuation<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:39.270> you

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
of this is a continuation of what you

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
of this is a continuation of what you
saw<00:00:39.870> last<00:00:40.140> season<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> NBA<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.460> much

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
saw last season in the NBA and how much

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
saw last season in the NBA and how much
of<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> new<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.809> situation<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.500> think

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
of this is new to the situation I think

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.389 
of this is new to the situation I think
a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.550> its<00:00:44.760> new<00:00:44.910> for<00:00:45.120> him<00:00:45.980> trying<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.160> leave

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
a lot of its new for him trying to leave

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.069 
a lot of its new for him trying to leave
when<00:00:47.760> you're<00:00:47.879> playing<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> few<00:00:48.570> All<00:00:48.719> Stars

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
when you're playing with a few All Stars

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
when you're playing with a few All Stars
MVP<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:51.480> still<00:00:52.190> knowing<00:00:53.190> in<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.460> heart<00:00:53.579> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
MVP and still knowing in your heart and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.310 
MVP and still knowing in your heart and
in<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.030> mind<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.750> carry<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.110> team

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
in your mind that you can carry a team

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.830 
in your mind that you can carry a team
that's<00:00:55.800> different<00:00:56.250> but<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:57.239> far<00:00:57.420> as<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.629> game

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that's different but as far as this game

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.990 
that's different but as far as this game
is<00:00:57.899> concerned<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.039> I've<00:00:59.460> seen<00:00:59.760> him

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
is concerned that you know I've seen him

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.299 
is concerned that you know I've seen him
tip<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> ball<00:01:01.170> off<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.469> rim<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> couple<00:01:02.160> times

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
tip the ball off the rim a couple times

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.090 
tip the ball off the rim a couple times
meaning<00:01:03.059> he's<00:01:03.180> thinking<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.600> game

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
meaning he's thinking the game

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.000 
meaning he's thinking the game
understanding<00:01:05.100> what<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> takes<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> win<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
understanding what it takes to win and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.890 
understanding what it takes to win and
he'll<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> first<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> say<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.790> he<00:01:09.570> has<00:01:09.720> to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
he'll be the first to say that he has to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.200 
he'll be the first to say that he has to
improve<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.619> I'll<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> second<00:01:11.790> third<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210

fourth<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.600> tell<00:01:12.780> them<00:01:12.930> in

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
fourth to tell them in

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
fourth to tell them in
it's<00:01:14.700> been<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.000> cool<00:01:15.210> for<00:01:15.420> us<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> be

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it's been really cool for us to be

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.929 
it's been really cool for us to be
together<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.860> we've<00:01:17.159> had<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.610> time

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
together because we've had a lot of time

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.139 
together because we've had a lot of time
to<00:01:18.180> talk<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.189> agree<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.399> disagree<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.850> some

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
to talk and agree and disagree on some

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.480 
to talk and agree and disagree on some
things<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.710> more<00:01:22.710> importantly<00:01:23.130> help<00:01:23.280> them

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
things and more importantly help them

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.219 
things and more importantly help them
improve<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:24.210> his<00:01:24.330> game<00:01:24.509> they<00:01:24.780> seem<00:01:25.020> so

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
improve in his game they seem so

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380 
improve in his game they seem so
well-suited<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.189> FIBA<00:01:26.520> game<00:01:26.700> why<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.149> he

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
well-suited for the FIBA game why is he

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.450 
well-suited for the FIBA game why is he
so<00:01:27.600> particularly<00:01:28.110> compatible<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.159> style

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
so particularly compatible to this style

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.450 
so particularly compatible to this style
I<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.780> shoot<00:01:31.310> it's<00:01:32.310> really

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
I think because he can shoot it's really

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.609 
I think because he can shoot it's really
tougher<00:01:32.880> guys<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.240> can't<00:01:33.479> shoot<00:01:33.619> their

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
tougher guys we can't shoot their

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.889 
tougher guys we can't shoot their
limited<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.909> pain<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.149> so<00:01:36.450> crowded

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
limited because the pain is so crowded

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.499 
limited because the pain is so crowded
he<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.039> step<00:01:38.250> outside<00:01:38.429> and<00:01:38.880> knock<00:01:39.030> down<00:01:39.060> shots

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
he can step outside and knock down shots

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
he can step outside and knock down shots
he's<00:01:39.810> been<00:01:40.259> able<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> put<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.770> ball<00:01:40.860> down<00:01:41.039> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
he's been able to put the ball down a

i think he was taking the ball away from

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.760 
i think he was taking the ball away from
the<00:01:54.149> guards<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.569> pick<00:01:54.690> and<00:01:54.840> roll<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.319> it

the guards and pick and roll and it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130 
the guards and pick and roll and it
started<00:01:56.190> our<00:01:56.310> break<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:56.880> i<00:01:57.149> think<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.929> suits
