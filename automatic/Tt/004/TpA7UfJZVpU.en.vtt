risk ins came to the draft with two
goals<00:00:31.029> in<00:00:31.210> mind<00:00:31.390> one<00:00:31.750> come<00:00:31.990> away<00:00:32.199> with<00:00:32.230> a

with<00:00:34.930> an<00:00:35.230> offensive<00:00:35.710> line<00:00:35.860> that's<00:00:36.070> rebuilt<00:00:36.550> to

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
with an offensive line that's rebuilt to

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.430 
with an offensive line that's rebuilt to
help<00:00:36.879> keep<00:00:37.090> that<00:00:37.239> franchise<00:00:37.720> quarterback<00:00:38.230> up

right<00:00:38.949> now<00:00:39.220> what<00:00:39.400> I<00:00:39.430> like<00:00:39.610> most<00:00:39.850> about<00:00:40.030> the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
right now what I like most about the

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.200 
right now what I like most about the
Redskins<00:00:40.720> draft<00:00:40.989> is<00:00:41.170> obvious<00:00:41.860> get<00:00:42.280> in<00:00:42.400> rg3<00:00:42.910> is

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
Redskins draft is obvious get in rg3 is

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.790 
Redskins draft is obvious get in rg3 is
going<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.480> be<00:00:43.570> a<00:00:43.600> huge<00:00:44.020> asset<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.559> that<00:00:44.680> team

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
going to be a huge asset to that team

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.190 
going to be a huge asset to that team
last<00:00:45.579> year<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.940> Redskins<00:00:46.390> were<00:00:46.570> in<00:00:46.750> every

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
last year the Redskins were in every

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.290 
last year the Redskins were in every
ball<00:00:47.410> game<00:00:47.710> defensively<00:00:47.920> but<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:48.879> can<00:00:49.059> tell

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
ball game defensively but you can tell

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.970 
ball game defensively but you can tell
that<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.870> quarterback<00:00:50.350> play<00:00:50.500> was<00:00:50.710> lacking

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
that the quarterback play was lacking

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.860 
that the quarterback play was lacking
and<00:00:51.280> that's<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.610> real<00:00:51.789> reason<00:00:51.820> why<00:00:52.300> they<00:00:52.809> were

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
and that's the real reason why they were

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.950 
and that's the real reason why they were
in<00:00:53.170> position<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.800> pick<00:00:54.190> rg3<00:00:54.730> now<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.420> add<00:00:55.719> this

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
in position to pick rg3 now you add this

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.439 
in position to pick rg3 now you add this
guy<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.230> an<00:00:56.739> effective<00:00:57.280> defense<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.239> risk

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
guy to an effective defense and the risk

00:00:58.449 --> 00:00:59.880 
guy to an effective defense and the risk
ins<00:00:58.629> can<00:00:58.840> possibly<00:00:59.230> make<00:00:59.469> it<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.680> the<00:00:59.770> playoffs

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
ins can possibly make it to the playoffs

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.299 
ins can possibly make it to the playoffs
this<00:01:00.520> season<00:01:00.789> I<00:01:01.559> also<00:01:02.559> like<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.980> fact<00:01:03.010> that

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
this season I also like the fact that

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.130 
this season I also like the fact that
the<00:01:03.489> risk<00:01:03.699> ins<00:01:03.910> upgrade<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.479> the<00:01:04.600> depth<00:01:04.839> on<00:01:05.020> the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
the risk ins upgrade to the depth on the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.270 
the risk ins upgrade to the depth on the
offensive<00:01:05.500> line<00:01:05.649> you<00:01:05.830> look<00:01:05.950> at<00:01:06.070> guys<00:01:06.220> like

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
offensive line you look at guys like

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.150 
offensive line you look at guys like

and uses their hands very well the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.419 
and uses their hands very well the
Redskins<00:01:20.170> offers<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.709> line<00:01:20.830> which<00:01:21.009> is<00:01:21.039> sort<00:01:21.369> of

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
Redskins offers a line which is sort of

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.699 
Redskins offers a line which is sort of
a<00:01:21.550> weakness<00:01:21.880> last<00:01:22.149> year<00:01:22.420> will<00:01:22.780> now<00:01:22.959> be<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.200> very

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:23.709 
a weakness last year will now be a very

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.330 
a weakness last year will now be a very
solid<00:01:24.220> strength<00:01:25.800> what<00:01:26.800> I<00:01:26.830> didn't<00:01:27.220> like<00:01:27.250> about

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
solid strength what I didn't like about

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.800 
solid strength what I didn't like about
the<00:01:27.580> Redskins<00:01:27.970> graph<00:01:28.179> I<00:01:28.300> had<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.569> pick

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
the Redskins graph I had to pick

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.150 
the Redskins graph I had to pick
something<00:01:29.080> I<00:01:29.380> didn't<00:01:29.709> like<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.950> fact<00:01:30.069> that

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.160 
something I didn't like the fact that

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.859 
something I didn't like the fact that
they<00:01:30.310> took<00:01:30.490> a<00:01:30.670> quarterback<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:31.270> round<00:01:31.599> four

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
they took a quarterback in round four

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:33.960 
they took a quarterback in round four
it's<00:01:32.289> not<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:32.860> don't<00:01:33.009> like<00:01:33.399> Kirk<00:01:33.700> Cousins

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
it's not that I don't like Kirk Cousins

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.699 
it's not that I don't like Kirk Cousins
it's<00:01:34.509> just<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.780> fact<00:01:34.959> that<00:01:35.110> they<00:01:35.349> needed<00:01:35.619> to

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
it's just the fact that they needed to

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:37.800 
it's just the fact that they needed to
go<00:01:35.800> with<00:01:36.130> another<00:01:36.310> impact<00:01:37.179> player<00:01:37.509> in<00:01:37.750> that

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
go with another impact player in that

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.320 
go with another impact player in that
fourth<00:01:38.619> round<00:01:38.890> maybe<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.340> safety<00:01:39.910> maybe<00:01:40.179> a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
fourth round maybe a safety maybe a

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.240 
fourth round maybe a safety maybe a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
receiver maybe it tight end maybe

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.520 
receiver maybe it tight end maybe
another<00:01:42.610> offensive<00:01:43.060> lineman<00:01:43.599> is<00:01:43.720> not<00:01:44.349> an

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
another offensive lineman is not an

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.650 
another offensive lineman is not an
