biggest one of which is the fact that
it's<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.519> such<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> great<00:00:24.060> design<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.539> works

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's got such a great design that works

so well for last and style of game types

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.900 
so well for last and style of game types
you<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> bottom<00:00:29.250> pit<00:00:29.519> area

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
you have the bottom pit area

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.970 
you have the bottom pit area
you<00:00:30.150> have<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.689> courtyard<00:00:31.199> which<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.859> at

you have the courtyard which is at

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.500 
you have the courtyard which is at
ground<00:00:32.160> level<00:00:32.340> then<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.239> several

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510

different balconies which are up above

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
different balconies which are up above
and<00:00:35.130> then<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.640> interior<00:00:35.969> play<00:00:36.390> space

and then you have an interior play space

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.049 
and then you have an interior play space
all<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.559> these<00:00:37.680> areas<00:00:37.950> work<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.579> well<00:00:38.820> off

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
all of these areas work really well off

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.549 
all of these areas work really well off
of<00:00:39.090> one<00:00:39.420> another<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.989> example<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.530> have

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
of one another for example you can have

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.750 
of one another for example you can have
somebody<00:00:40.920> who's<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.219> top<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.579> balcony

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
somebody who's on top of the balcony

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
somebody who's on top of the balcony
covering<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.450> courtyard<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.590> have

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
covering the courtyard then you can have

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.229 
covering the courtyard then you can have
somebody<00:00:43.829> inside<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> building<00:00:44.760> covering

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
somebody inside of the building covering

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.180 
somebody inside of the building covering
the<00:00:45.360> staircase<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> balcony<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
the staircase up to the balcony all the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.529 
the staircase up to the balcony all the
different<00:00:47.460> areas<00:00:47.700> work<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.149> well<00:00:48.360> with

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
different areas work really well with

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.229 
different areas work really well with
one<00:00:48.719> another<00:00:49.640> additionally<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.730> map<00:00:50.969> stands

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
one another additionally this map stands

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.639 
one another additionally this map stands
out<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.600> another<00:00:51.780> reason<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.469> its

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
out for another reason and that's its

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.200 
out for another reason and that's its
use<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.980> objects<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.610> right<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
use of objects so right here we have a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
use of objects so right here we have a
crate<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:55.050> also<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> fence<00:00:55.920> piece<00:00:56.190> then<00:00:56.610> we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
crate we also have a fence piece then we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.970 
crate we also have a fence piece then we
have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> giant<00:00:57.539> trim<00:00:57.930> piece<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.859> these

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have a giant trim piece all of these

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.470 
have a giant trim piece all of these
objects<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.460> very<00:00:59.670> important<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
objects are very important because you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
objects are very important because you
can<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.750> them<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> actually<00:01:01.530> defend<00:01:01.800> various

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
can use them to actually defend various

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
can use them to actually defend various
areas<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> map<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.570> need<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> go<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.080> pick

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
areas of the map you need to go and pick

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
areas of the map you need to go and pick
one<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.559> objects<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.159> carry<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.850> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
one of the objects up carry it to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
one of the objects up carry it to
another<00:01:06.119> location<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> map<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.260> put<00:01:07.439> it

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
another location on the map and put it

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
another location on the map and put it
down<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> trick<00:01:08.610> here<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.000> there

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
down now the trick here is that there

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.660 
down now the trick here is that there
are<00:01:09.659> only<00:01:09.930> three<00:01:10.409> objects<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.369> there<00:01:11.490> are

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
are only three objects but there are

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.070 
are only three objects but there are
tons<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> different<00:01:12.390> places<00:01:12.570> where<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> can

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
tons of different places where you can

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.170 
tons of different places where you can
actually<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.530> them<00:01:13.619> down<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> human<00:01:14.820> you

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
actually put them down so as a human you

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.300 
actually put them down so as a human you
need<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.689> decide<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.290> area<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.979> map<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
need to decide which area of the map you

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.890 
need to decide which area of the map you
actually<00:01:17.670> want<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> defend<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.600> areas

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
actually want to defend and which areas

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.260 
actually want to defend and which areas
you<00:01:18.930> want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> block<00:01:19.439> off<00:01:19.740> having<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> ability

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you want to block off having the ability

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
you want to block off having the ability
to<00:01:21.299> place<00:01:21.630> down<00:01:21.810> barricades<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> human<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to place down barricades as a human is a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.670 
to place down barricades as a human is a
huge<00:01:23.909> addition<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> map<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.350> allows

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
huge addition to the map this allows

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.499 
huge addition to the map this allows
players<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.250> choose<00:01:26.520> how<00:01:26.820> they<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.330> map

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
players to choose how they want the map

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
players to choose how they want the map
to<00:01:27.540> play<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.470> choose<00:01:28.710> where<00:01:28.979> you

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
to play out you can choose where you

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.440 
to play out you can choose where you

there aren't too many of both what we
generally<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.200> put<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.500> player<00:02:10.649> with

base but at the same time you've got to
be<00:02:16.860> careful<00:02:17.069> because<00:02:17.250> zombies<00:02:17.850> have<00:02:18.330> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
be careful because zombies have the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.760 
be careful because zombies have the
ability<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> jump<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.410> they<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.620> actually

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
ability to jump so they can actually

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.640 
ability to jump so they can actually

jump up into the tower as a human it's

around<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.870> map<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.230> check<00:02:25.470> all<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.740> various

different entrances that there are
there's<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.930> lot<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.319> different<00:02:28.620> ways<00:02:28.740> for<00:02:28.980> the

there's a lot of different ways for the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.350 
there's a lot of different ways for the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
zombies to get in so if you're not

zombies to get in so if you're not
paying<00:02:30.600> attention<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.260> zombies<00:02:31.560> can<00:02:31.739> quickly

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
paying attention the zombies can quickly

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.010 
paying attention the zombies can quickly
overthrow<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.120> humans<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.690> matter<00:02:33.930> of

to try to survive alone because chances

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.059 
to try to survive alone because chances
are<00:02:39.239> you<00:02:39.480> will<00:02:39.690> die<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.319> don't<00:02:40.530> have<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.800> radar

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
are you will die you don't have a radar

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.949 
are you will die you don't have a radar
and<00:02:41.489> it<00:02:41.700> takes<00:02:41.910> about<00:02:42.030> half<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.510> clip<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.870> an

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
and it takes about half a clip of an

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.900 
and it takes about half a clip of an
assault<00:02:43.230> rifle<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.620> kill<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.800> zombie<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.670> if

assault rifle to kill a zombie so if

assault rifle to kill a zombie so if
there<00:02:45.150> are<00:02:45.330> more<00:02:45.660> than<00:02:45.870> two<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.470> you're<00:02:46.650> not

it<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.680> works<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.130> well<00:02:56.310> for<00:02:56.550> the<00:02:56.610> last<00:02:56.760> stand

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
it that works so well for the last stand

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.580 
it that works so well for the last stand
as<00:02:57.239> well<00:02:57.660> as<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.810> fact<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.200> map<00:02:58.350> has<00:02:58.560> a

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
ton of replayability I mean no two

ton of replayability I mean no two
rounds<00:03:01.200> are<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> same<00:03:01.590> since<00:03:01.860> players<00:03:02.069> in

game can choose where they want the
barricades<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.260> go<00:03:04.410> there's<00:03:05.220> two<00:03:05.370> different
