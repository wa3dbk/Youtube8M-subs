00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.560
This is my hair and makeup stylist Furuhashi.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.920
Please enjoy the tutorial.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.200
I will pick a matching color with the wig and
draw the eyebrows.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.100
This eye shadow is from Majolica Majorca.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.740
Today's contact lenses are from DOLCE contact
and they are called Red Corona.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.280
This is a really vibrant color, so they are
perfect for cosplay.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.000
With a pink eye shadow from LUNASOL I create the eye
makeup base.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.500
With a brown cheek &amp; eye shadow from BIBA I will
create a shadow, since the eye color is really strong.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.120
With a pink eye shadow from NARS I will cover
the whole lid.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.260
I will mix some strong, glittery eye shadow from
MAKE UP FOR EVER

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.200
and fill in the inner corner of the eyes to create
a highlight.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.660
With a black gel liner from MAC I draw a line for
a dolly eyes look.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.300
Did you choose to go for dolly eyes because of the
shape of my eyes?

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:42.300
I think Chibiusa has slightly dolly eyes.
But I also think she has cat eyes.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.000
Those would come across very strong, so for now
I chose to draw the bottom for dolly eyes,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
instead of cat eyes.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.660
With a brown eye shadow from MAC,
I create a shadow on the bottom lash line.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.380
With a glittery eye shadow from Dolly Wink,
I create a highlight on the lower eyelid.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:41.480
Using a black eyeliner from Clinique,
I mark out the water line.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.960
With an eyelash curler from Shiseido,
I curl the lashes.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.080
I apply a mascara from Clinique.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.280
With a heated eyelash curler, I will curl the lashes.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.300
Next, I will add the lashes.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.400
Why did you chose these ones?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.500
The color of the contact lenses is very strong,
I therefore thought that thick lashes are better.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.820
I also chose lashes that give volume in the
middle of the lid.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.480
Depending on that, the eyes can look a little bit cuter.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.440
I will use a blush from Jill Stuart.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.160
I draw it on in a circular motion.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.640
For additional moisture I will add lip cream.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.780
I add the wig.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.420
I will adjust the twin tails so they will look cuter.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.760
I apply lip gloss.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.620
For me, Chibiusa is a character that brings back a lot
of memories.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.760
I have actually done a lot of cosplays, but I have never
cosplayed as a Sailor Moon character.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.920
That is why this time I really wanted to do it.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.780
I wanted to have my make up done,
in order to become more like the character.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.740
Once the makeup was finished, we took pictures.
I posed and realized that,

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.380
instead of becoming like the character,
I had somehow already become the character.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.388
It was a really fun shoot.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.560
Even men can become this cute.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.000
So, please take this as a reference.
