00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.910 

well<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.839> first<00:00:07.049> step<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.439> the<00:00:07.500> process<00:00:07.589> is

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
well the first step in the process is

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.150 
well the first step in the process is
getting<00:00:08.519> your<00:00:09.299> materials<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.740> get<00:00:10.980> those

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
getting your materials and I get those

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.699 
getting your materials and I get those
from<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.910> landscape<00:00:12.389> around<00:00:12.719> me<00:00:12.959> we<00:00:13.350> stripped

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:13.709 
from the landscape around me we stripped

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.890 
from the landscape around me we stripped
the<00:00:13.799> bark<00:00:14.129> off<00:00:14.760> of<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.629> plant<00:00:16.340> and<00:00:17.689> you<00:00:18.689> want

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the bark off of the plant and you want

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410 
the bark off of the plant and you want
the<00:00:19.230> inner<00:00:19.619> bark<00:00:20.010> as<00:00:20.340> opposed<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.240> outer

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
the inner bark as opposed to the outer

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.050 
the inner bark as opposed to the outer
bark<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.169> sometimes<00:00:22.589> it<00:00:22.800> needs<00:00:22.949> soaking<00:00:23.730> but

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
bark and sometimes it needs soaking but

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.200 
bark and sometimes it needs soaking but
normally<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> humidity<00:00:26.490> on<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.759> island

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
normally the humidity on the island

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.890 
normally the humidity on the island
makes<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.869> pull<00:00:28.109> off<00:00:28.289> quite<00:00:28.619> easily<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:29.900> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
makes it pull off quite easily from the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.640 
makes it pull off quite easily from the
inner<00:00:31.079> bark<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.700> next<00:00:33.000> step<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.720> actually<00:00:34.260> cut

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
inner bark the next step we actually cut

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.849 
inner bark the next step we actually cut
the<00:00:34.800> fiber<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.970> soft<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.720> it<00:00:36.900> and<00:00:37.140> also<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.560> get

00:00:37.849 --> 00:00:37.859 
the fiber to soft in it and also to get

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:40.310 
the fiber to soft in it and also to get
rid<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.039> all<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> organic<00:00:38.760> materials<00:00:39.449> that<00:00:39.809> is

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
rid of all the organic materials that is

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.229 
rid of all the organic materials that is
not<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.739> cellulose<00:00:41.190> paper<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.789> generally

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
not the cellulose paper is generally

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.660 
not the cellulose paper is generally
made<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:42.780> cellulose<00:00:43.680> fiber<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
made from cellulose fiber and this is

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.840 
made from cellulose fiber and this is
pretty<00:00:44.969> much<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:46.050> left<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.769> the<00:00:46.949> bark<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
pretty much what is left of the bark and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.240 
pretty much what is left of the bark and
you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:48.359> it<00:00:48.750> actually<00:00:48.930> has<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> new<00:00:49.920> its

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you can see it actually has a new its

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.110 
you can see it actually has a new its
own<00:00:50.429> weave<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.949> so<00:00:52.949> here<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.519> the

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
own weave to it so here we have the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.919 
own weave to it so here we have the
fiber<00:00:54.329> cooking<00:00:55.760> stewing<00:00:56.760> away<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.809> then

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
fiber cooking stewing away and then

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.419 
fiber cooking stewing away and then
we're<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.500> go<00:00:58.679> and<00:00:59.010> meet<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> by<00:01:00.239> hand

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
we're going to go and meet it by hand

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.550 
we're going to go and meet it by hand
this<00:01:02.429> is<00:01:02.609> handmade<00:01:03.050> paper<00:01:05.330> here<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this is handmade paper here we have the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.500 
this is handmade paper here we have the
fiber<00:01:07.770> after<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.370> cooked<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.940> been<00:01:09.090> rinsed

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
fiber after it's cooked it's been rinsed

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.249 
fiber after it's cooked it's been rinsed
a<00:01:09.630> bit<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> pulls<00:01:12.360> apart<00:01:12.570> on

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
a bit and you can see it pulls apart on

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.210 
a bit and you can see it pulls apart on
its<00:01:13.409> own<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.689> we<00:01:15.689> want<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.140> break<00:01:16.439> down<00:01:16.500> those

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
its own and we want to break down those

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
its own and we want to break down those
longer<00:01:17.640> fibers<00:01:18.030> into<00:01:18.270> smaller<00:01:18.750> ones<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
longer fibers into smaller ones and

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:38.359 
longer fibers into smaller ones and
basically<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.759> feed<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.329> to<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> pulp<00:01:34.009> I<00:01:37.189> do<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
basically we feed it to a pulp I do it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.580 
basically we feed it to a pulp I do it
in<00:01:38.460> stages

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
in stages

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.690 
in stages
I'll<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.799> done<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.130> once<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:43.310> after<00:01:44.310> we

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I'll get done at once you know after we

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.300 
I'll get done at once you know after we
beat<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.210> pulp<00:01:45.649> which<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.860> what<00:01:47.100> this

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
beat it to a pulp which is what this

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.920 
beat it to a pulp which is what this
looks<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:48.680> yeah<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:52.070> pretty<00:01:53.070> much<00:01:53.180> weigh<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
looks like yeah I pretty much weigh the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.010 
looks like yeah I pretty much weigh the
amount<00:01:55.289> that<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.649> want<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:57.090> about<00:01:57.270> 250

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
amount that I want and it's about 250

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.099 
amount that I want and it's about 250
grams<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.770> pulp<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:01.049> should<00:02:01.439> cover<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:09.550 

screen<00:02:07.109> this<00:02:07.380> size

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
screen this size

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:23.330 
screen this size
so<00:02:21.260> get<00:02:22.260> rid<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.530> some<00:02:22.769> of<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.920> air<00:02:23.069> bubbles

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
so get rid of some of the air bubbles

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.890 
so get rid of some of the air bubbles
running<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.000> me<00:02:26.450> this<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> very<00:02:29.900> long-winded

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
running to me this is a very long-winded

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.339 
running to me this is a very long-winded
way<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.470> making<00:02:31.800> paper<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.569> effect<00:02:34.050> is

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
way of making paper but the effect is

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.990 
way of making paper but the effect is
quite<00:02:34.640> unique<00:02:36.200> from<00:02:37.200> other<00:02:37.349> methods<00:02:38.000> another

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
quite unique from other methods another

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.360 
quite unique from other methods another
handmade<00:02:39.720> paper<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:45.290> did<00:02:46.290> teach<00:02:46.560> myself<00:02:46.830> how<00:02:47.220> to

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
handmade paper I did teach myself how to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.240 
handmade paper I did teach myself how to
make<00:02:47.910> paper<00:02:48.510> on<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.349> very<00:02:49.620> rudimentary<00:02:49.829> level

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
make paper on a very rudimentary level

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.270 
make paper on a very rudimentary level
in<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.150> Western<00:02:51.630> method<00:02:51.930> of<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.829> dipping<00:02:55.280> but

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
in the Western method of the dipping but

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.039 
in the Western method of the dipping but
I<00:02:56.489> have<00:02:56.760> studied<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.390> I've<00:02:57.540> done<00:02:57.569> lots<00:02:57.930> of

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
I have studied it I've done lots of

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.970 
I have studied it I've done lots of
workshops<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.890> travel<00:02:59.480> we<00:03:00.480> do<00:03:00.660> things<00:03:00.989> study

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
workshops of travel we do things study

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.220 
workshops of travel we do things study
different<00:03:02.640> ways<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.420> I've<00:03:03.540> adapted<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
different ways and I've adapted the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.030 
different ways and I've adapted the
methods<00:03:05.930> according<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.349> facilities<00:03:07.860> that

methods according to the facilities that

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.309 
methods according to the facilities that
I<00:03:08.099> have<00:03:08.430> available<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:09.269> me<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.840> materials

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
I have available to me and the materials

I have available to me and the materials
I<00:03:10.500> have<00:03:10.700> available<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:12.000> me<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:13.110> was<00:03:13.349> amazing<00:03:14.010> to

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
I have available to me it was amazing to

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.819 
I have available to me it was amazing to
be<00:03:14.280> able<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.790> transform<00:03:15.450> something<00:03:15.840> that's

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
be able to transform something that's

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.879 
be able to transform something that's
growing<00:03:17.430> outside<00:03:17.850> into<00:03:18.750> something<00:03:19.200> that's<00:03:19.590> a

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
growing outside into something that's a

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.430 
growing outside into something that's a
flat<00:03:20.250> piece<00:03:20.639> of<00:03:20.670> material<00:03:21.450> that<00:03:22.049> can<00:03:22.260> be

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
flat piece of material that can be

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.729 
flat piece of material that can be
folded<00:03:22.859> into<00:03:23.400> a<00:03:23.609> piece<00:03:23.819> of<00:03:23.970> origami<00:03:24.269> or<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.470> be

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
folded into a piece of origami or can be

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.500 
folded into a piece of origami or can be
molded<00:03:26.700> into<00:03:26.880> a<00:03:27.090> bowl<00:03:27.630> or<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.530> can<00:03:28.769> be<00:03:29.000> cut<00:03:30.000> to

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
molded into a bowl or it can be cut to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.030 
molded into a bowl or it can be cut to
create<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.900> pattern<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.470> there's<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:31.769> much<00:03:31.889> you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
create a pattern and there's so much you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.729 
create a pattern and there's so much you
can<00:03:32.190> do<00:03:32.310> with<00:03:32.430> paper<00:03:32.609> I<00:03:32.760> love<00:03:32.910> it<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:34.440> fibre

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
can do with paper I love it the fibre

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.390 
can do with paper I love it the fibre
likes<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:36.049> go<00:03:37.049> in<00:03:37.079> certain<00:03:37.620> directions<00:03:37.739> you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
likes to go in certain directions you

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:47.290 
likes to go in certain directions you
have<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.760> force<00:03:39.000> it

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.110 

now<00:03:48.300> I'm<00:03:48.450> going<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.840> slowly<00:03:51.440> lift<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:53.120> I'm

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
now I'm going to slowly lift it I'm

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.890 
now I'm going to slowly lift it I'm
draining<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.990> water<00:03:55.170> out<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.750> we're

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
draining the water out of it so we're

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:06.890 
draining the water out of it so we're
just<00:03:57.930> left<00:03:58.200> with<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.940> fiber<00:04:03.710> and<00:04:05.150> I<00:04:06.150> take<00:04:06.750> it

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
just left with the fiber and I take it

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.620 
just left with the fiber and I take it
outside<00:04:07.080> to<00:04:07.710> dry<00:04:08.840> so<00:04:09.840> we've<00:04:10.709> got<00:04:10.890> our<00:04:11.630> sheet

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
outside to dry so we've got our sheet

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.410 
outside to dry so we've got our sheet
formed<00:04:13.200> here<00:04:13.620> I'm<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.520> good<00:04:14.700> sunny<00:04:14.970> day<00:04:15.180> like

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.780 
formed here I'm on a good sunny day like
today<00:04:15.630> it'll<00:04:16.079> probably<00:04:16.320> take<00:04:16.650> half<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.190> day<00:04:17.400> or

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
today it'll probably take half a day or

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.350 
today it'll probably take half a day or
a<00:04:18.329> day<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.989> dry<00:04:20.480> and<00:04:22.490> it's<00:04:23.490> ready<00:04:23.730> to<00:04:23.820> be<00:04:23.940> peeled

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
a day to dry and it's ready to be peeled

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.130 
a day to dry and it's ready to be peeled
off<00:04:24.510> of<00:04:24.750> its<00:04:24.900> frame<00:04:25.260> just<00:04:25.950> do<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.280> right<00:04:26.490> now

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
off of its frame just do that right now

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.350 
off of its frame just do that right now
I'm<00:04:28.140> gonna<00:04:28.260> just<00:04:28.560> press<00:04:28.770> on<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.430> cloth<00:04:29.790> behind

around<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.380> edges<00:04:31.800> to<00:04:32.190> break<00:04:32.490> it<00:04:32.700> free<00:04:33.000> from

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
around the edges to break it free from

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.380 
around the edges to break it free from
the<00:04:33.419> wood<00:04:33.800> I'm<00:04:34.800> gonna<00:04:35.010> start<00:04:35.430> in<00:04:35.610> one<00:04:35.790> corner

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.440 

slowly<00:04:42.390> but<00:04:42.750> surely<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:43.650> comes<00:04:44.340> off<00:04:47.450> nice

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
slowly but surely it comes off nice

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.629 
husk here and seaweed Spanish bayonet
which<00:05:30.840> was<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.050> particularly<00:05:31.440> tough<00:05:31.800> fiber<00:05:32.160> it

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
which was a particularly tough fiber it

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.080 
which was a particularly tough fiber it
goes<00:05:32.880> all<00:05:33.060> over<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.330> island<00:05:34.610> banana<00:05:35.610> leaves

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
goes all over the island banana leaves

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.110 
goes all over the island banana leaves
and<00:05:39.200> we<00:05:40.200> have<00:05:41.419> what<00:05:42.419> else<00:05:42.919> onion<00:05:43.919> skin<00:05:44.340> which

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
and we have what else onion skin which

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.659 
and we have what else onion skin which
is<00:05:45.270> also<00:05:45.479> really<00:05:46.229> good<00:05:46.620> ugly<00:05:46.950> and<00:05:47.100> crinkly<00:05:47.550> I

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
is also really good ugly and crinkly I

learn a lot by trial and error and
that's<00:05:52.770> how<00:05:53.010> I<00:05:53.040> have<00:05:53.430> learnt<00:05:53.880> most<00:05:54.300> of<00:05:55.430> the
