00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.110
 carbon fiber housing 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.509
 that makes it really super 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.520
 light is in this video take in everyone 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.520
 case the 13 inch variant under the microscope 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.640
 in the box there is one next to the firepro itself 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 ac adapter and mains voltage cable 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.419

 minimalist design and also a compact 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.240
 sized and collapsed it is very thin and 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.930
 it is very easy with one hand 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.030
 to lift 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.860
 because it weighs just over a kilo 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.750
 this of course due to its carbon fiber 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.950
 housing so it is light enough to 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.870
 easy to take with you 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.160
 but certainly strong enough to make rice 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.800
 to withstand the problems 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.660
 thanks to the strong carbon plates below 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.770

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.200
 silver aluminum plate and the 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.570
 hinges of fencing are like that 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.340
 smooth that you can easily fold in and out 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.800

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.290
 you can also see how this sony vaio pro is 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.300

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.280
 touch screen and you can put it next to it 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.510
 directly on the keyboard 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.100

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.330

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.250
 it has a solid surface 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.560

 see you very well when you start 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.520
 because he's not here at all 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.630

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.220
