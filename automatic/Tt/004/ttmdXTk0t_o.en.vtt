up your tub with warm water and then you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.560 
up your tub with warm water and then you
can<00:00:34.920> take<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.340> first<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.880> your<00:00:36.000> two<00:00:36.180> colors

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to the tub of water I did say to use a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.209 
to the tub of water I did say to use a
toothpick<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.660> found<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:46.770> quite

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
toothpick but I found that it was quite

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.830 
toothpick but I found that it was quite
hard<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.550> use<00:00:47.789> because<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.360> nail<00:00:48.539> polish

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
hard to use because the nail polish

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
hard to use because the nail polish
would<00:00:49.050> dry<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.829> don't<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
would dry I don't know if it's the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.350 
would dry I don't know if it's the
specific<00:00:51.719> kind<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.850> can

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
specific kind that I have but you can

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.290 
specific kind that I have but you can
try<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> swirl<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.770> around<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.820> bit<00:00:56.969> but

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
try to swirl it around a little bit but

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
try to swirl it around a little bit but
as<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.690> see<00:00:57.750> mine<00:00:58.260> got<00:00:58.500> stuck<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.789> was

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
as you can see mine got stuck and it was

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.130 
as you can see mine got stuck and it was
just<00:01:00.059> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.300> knowing<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.960> kind<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
just kind of knowing so I just kind of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.820 
just kind of knowing so I just kind of
went<00:01:01.320> with<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.010> kept<00:01:02.309> dipping<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.830> just

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
went with it and I kept dipping I just

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.380 
went with it and I kept dipping I just
kept<00:01:04.979> splattering<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.700> nail<00:01:05.820> polish<00:01:06.090> around

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
kept splattering the nail polish around

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.600 
kept splattering the nail polish around
and<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.750> came<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.170> cute<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.430> can

and see what you like I just went for

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
and see what you like I just went for
like<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> splatter<00:01:13.590> paint<00:01:13.920> look<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.580> was

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.790 

so<00:01:21.060> basically<00:01:21.360> I'm<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.630> alternating<00:01:22.260> colors

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
so basically I'm just alternating colors

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.110 
so basically I'm just alternating colors
and<00:01:23.300> swirling<00:01:24.300> what<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.480> can<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:25.940> yeah<00:01:26.940> that

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
and swirling what I can around yeah that

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.320 
and swirling what I can around yeah that
was<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> fail<00:01:27.480> but<00:01:27.890> then<00:01:28.890> I'm<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.190> gonna

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
was a fail but then I'm just gonna

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.660 
was a fail but then I'm just gonna
horizontally<00:01:30.330> dip<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.200> mug<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.370> it<00:01:32.520> at

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
horizontally dip my mug in and do it at

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.090 
horizontally dip my mug in and do it at
an<00:01:32.790> angle<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.510> that<00:01:33.540> way<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.290> won't<00:01:34.560> reach<00:01:34.830> up

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
an angle so that way it won't reach up

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
an angle so that way it won't reach up
to<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.310> completely<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> top<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.050> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
to the completely up to the top of the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.960 
to the completely up to the top of the
lid<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:37.980> not<00:01:38.130> want<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.580> be<00:01:38.730> all

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
lid because you do not want it to be all

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.430 
lid because you do not want it to be all
the<00:01:39.360> way<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.690> top<00:01:39.870> because<00:01:40.080> then<00:01:40.230> you<00:01:40.320> will

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
the way to the top because then you will

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.080 
the way to the top because then you will
taste<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.950> nail<00:01:41.100> polish<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.550> guess<00:01:41.730> when<00:01:41.970> you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
taste the nail polish I guess when you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
taste the nail polish I guess when you
drink<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.480> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> don't<00:01:43.470> recommend<00:01:43.800> that<00:01:43.860> so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
drink it so I don't recommend that so

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.070 
drink it so I don't recommend that so
now<00:01:44.670> that's<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.030> first<00:01:45.300> dip<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.990> gonna

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
now that's the first dip I'm just gonna

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.590 
now that's the first dip I'm just gonna
go<00:01:46.410> back<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.670> can<00:01:47.850> either<00:01:48.000> wash<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.450> bowl

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
go back in you can either wash the bowl
