 give us the opportunity to feel extremely well 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.420
 personal fulfillment 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.309
 this world taught us that we have to work hard 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.819

 have tranquility opas interior 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.350
 and as we walk in life we ​​forget something fundamental and that is 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.700
 we postpone the essential 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030
 it's like when we focus so much on 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.110

 social that has a high performance we forgot to talk about love 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.240
 there are times when we forget the essential things in the name of other things that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.360
 being important they would seem superfluous 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.970
 a lot of attention 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.030
 a long time ago he killed himself, he discovered what stretches 20% d let's say it like that 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.690
 aspect its causes that were responsible for 80% of consequences or results 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.710
 o'keefe cough 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.290
 If a seller has 100 clients it is very likely that around 20 of their 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.470
 customers 80% of billing occurs 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.640
 because those are the 20,500 most productive 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.120
 let's stop for a moment 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.780
 that's not where priority should be made 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.369
 other clients should not be neglected 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.319
 they have only among all of them that 80% of customers the ability to 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.480
 produce only 20% of turnover 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.300
 and obviously the income 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
 who are going to pay all family expenses 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.329
 but little 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.079
 How about we keep our whole life around attending 80% 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.559
 of situations people things activities that demand our 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.290
 attention and that only produce minimal possibilities for results 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.839
 positive in our life 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.739
 A lot of tension 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.139
 20% of the things we do imply 80% quality of life 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.450
 20% of things we do we say we think 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.740
 of decisions we make or make 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:04.840
 imply an impact of the polo sits for percent d happiness fullness abundance 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.130
 prosperity feelings of feeling loved iv range 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.269
 that are without that 20% of important things we put as a priority 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.889
 inner peace 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:22.549
 what would happen in your life and in my life 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.849
 maybe we would begin to realize that through that inner peace 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.389
 we can be better husbands better wives 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.679
 better children 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:36.069
 better parents better citizens better bosses better collaborators 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.749
 better politicians 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.919
 it's so important to be aware 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.250
 that if we put our priorities in order 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.379
 everything will be better 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.529
 And that's just what we're going to achieve in the very simple way 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.109
 and it is our purpose today to make decisions based on the filter 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.469
 have inner peace 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.929
 If you feel something is going to take away peace for brands 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:05.249
 If you feel that something is going to cause harm, do not do it 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.589
 I invite you to take a look at this 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:13.639
 it seems like it was not too essential but for only 15 days give me 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.680
 three weeks 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.049
 try that every decision that you make otones 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.159
 has been based on the filter of having inner peace as having 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.569
 there will be things that require sacrificing a bit of peace but not sacrificing 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:27.499
 all 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.049
 obviously to have inner peace you have to be acting from honesty 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.330
 from the fullness of our true worship 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:38.639
 of our true vision of life 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.309
 that there is coherence 

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:43.229
 that there is a disposition to love 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.559
 a provision for acceptance 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:49.559
 how about starting to act every day 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:51.249
 of forms 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.420
 to bring us the inner peace around us 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.319
 ourselves 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.540
 I invite you to make a change in our priorities 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.560
 and that from today, inner peace will be 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.340
 something of the most important thing that we are going to place 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.580
 in that fundamental scale of hierarchies of what we want to achieve in peace life 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.450
 inside 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.660
 first priority
