00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.849
 today I give you my opinion on 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:11.040
 the critical mark to me to know that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.379
 I tested his four flowers there that are 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 lilac silver sky blue and fire i also 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.109
 tested the yellow I got more 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.400
 what's his name and in pink but 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.660
 I was able to do it so I will judge 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 other brands according to five criteria 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.360
 difference so that's gone we have 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.100
 judged that a column 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.050
 in terms of the choice of colors we can 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.370
 really say nothing there are more than 27 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.500
 different colors and every year there 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.490
 so add on this point the crazy 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.990
 color that's how it's done fast enough 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.640
 but it's not a scandal either 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.530
 I know that for example wealth 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.330
 hold a little better by cons I tested 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.890
 colors like yellow and silver 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.280
 who have not taken anything on my 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.390
 hair 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.250
 so maybe I do not have them 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.080
 leave on for a long time but 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.520
 I estimate that 45 minutes an hour is 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.110
 still already a big time is laying so 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.460
 I did not really understand what happened 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.790
 yet I had blond hair 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.280
 White 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.870
 so I think it's not hyper 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.970
 practice a mix with the after shampoo 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.130
 I remember for example that the blue one 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.710
 found the 16,2 me lumps of 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.090
 color inside so if we do a 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.440
 not that and we start to apply and 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.290
 that suddenly it regroups 1 which we 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.649
 is a big snow blue firecracker 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.090
 not the top what does it find enough 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.710
 easily in France at all 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.280
 wholesalers where I went I found 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.930
 this brand 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.830
 so it's really hyper appreciated by 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.970
 compared to other brands that I 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.180
 know that I am obliged to order 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.390
 and by cost account at the price level 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.850
 we find them at 723 it seems to me in 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.140
 store is quite expensive especially its has the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.240
 very long hair that we do not use 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.440
 not my technique of baht l1 but by 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.700
 relative to the trust of the down payment 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.860
 it's pretty reasonable at the 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.090
 price 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.020
 that's how we are 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.270
 practice after that depends in fact if we 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.860
 must really put a mini back on it 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.570
 can be tricky on my rains that have 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.640
 a little too late it's not top of the top 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.870
 but let's say that if we do not want to 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.000
 put everywhere you do not want to have 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.020
 bowls with brushes and so on 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.340
 it's pretty much like packaging 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.870
 it's an English brand really a 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.400
 English mark with his against the 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.020
 tests on vegan animals etc 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.399
 but this I know not print 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.869
 so that's challenging packaging but 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.320
 even on the new ones there is no 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.030
 accuracy of the genre so it's not live 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.720
 no more and it's surely tested on 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.400
 animals 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.840
 so that's why I had 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.010
 direct to other brands 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.900
 if we are not hyper attached to these 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.720
 values ​​there is a very good brand 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.120
 we find easily learned quite moderate 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.920
 and he does pretty well the job with 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.350
 many different colors 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.510
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.040
 will have pleased I will very soon obviously 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.870
 do the same thing for the brand the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.270
 rich and panicky mania I will try 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.700
 to get me benchmark 2 and soon 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.810
 I'm having arctic fox so we're going 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.970
 to be able to do a lot of swirls 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.470
 difference while waiting for their heart on 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.470
 you and soon a video
