00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.820
 where the people 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.250
 this is another video of the physical channel 23 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.599
 1 is the beginning of the video already I ask for you 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.100
 I did not like the idea. 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:32.080
 no video to add favorite videos 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.860
 and you too if you have no channel in 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.440
 youtube you create a youtube account 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.629
 because otherwise you will not receive the videos 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.780
 when you make new videos 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:48.700
 I'll talk about it if it works. 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:53.969
 We have several types of lso themes 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.969
 more grinder harder 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:02.980
 is another plastic material is a fiber is 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:07.539
 a soft plastic I'll tell you something 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:11.140
 important the propeller people have a 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:15.460
 American standard of measurement by itself and 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.310
 you hear talk is 8 by 6 8 by 58 by 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.840
 four what's up there maybe because 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:26.590
 What are these measures for you? 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 and I'll also talk about balancing 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.250
 dr 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:42.280
 the length of the first and the first number 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:53.470
 namely that r inch 788 inch 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:54.670
 It is 2.5 cm 2.5 cm and weighing 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.210
 one inch 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:02.710
 is equal to one inch 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:07.890
 All right, let's go, then you have one. 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:14.010
 propeller 8 for 6 1 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:17.970
 eight times two and a half she gives 25 of the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 tip to another it gives 20 centimeters 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.430
 here I have a different one than 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.920
 she is seven 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:31.980
 then for example two and mail instead 7 is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:38.970
 equal to 17 cm point 5 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:43.459
 She's 17.5 centimeters from now to 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:49.430
 second letter of it I will give example in the 88 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.430
 both times this here as this is the 8 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.550
 Now let's talk about the second number 16 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:03.060
 in the case of mine, which is number 6, 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:07.380
 being 4 can be 356 and so on 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:12.329
 the 6 that I know that a lot of people do not 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.180
 You know how a l6 works, this is 8 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:17.820
 inches 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.930
 here is also 6 inches 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.230
 but what is this second 6 notes that the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.989
 he has a twist 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.530
 works like this when she's standing 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:35.640
 she gives a 360 degrees 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:43.380
 that is, it is a turn each round 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:47.150
 she gives it six inches forward six 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.150
 times 2.5 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.870
 This is the one in the air. 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:57.290
 If you do not have friction, do not 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.549
 airplane and so we could little free her 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:06.959
 each turn a good turn under 1 and if a 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.239
 I swiveled a quarter inch to the 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.640
 front or 6 inch matches 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:15.930
 one centimeter or so will move the 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:19.349
 airplane 15 centimeters each time it 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.079
 took a walk that's where you see the 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:24.500
 airplane speed 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.810
 you have a high rpm engine if you are 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.169
 calculate put by the turns that it will give 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.750
 pure per minute if you are going to have a 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.539
 value that is the distance that goes 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.060
 go through it 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:42.800
 well then , I'll talk about the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.460
 balancing many new candles they 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.699
 come unbalanced you I'll get a 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.289
 Propeller here is you go in a store 99 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.659
 You can pick a little something 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.849
 has less friction can find 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:05:00.740
 defends and 99 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:03.229
 you put in the center of the s as you 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.830
 Do you know if it's balanced? 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:10.360
 you have in any position without 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:14.060
 shake it to the diagonal 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:17.389
 I'll put it in the middle. 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:29.690
 it has to always stop at the position it 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:33.620
 You put aside she has to stop. 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.389
 In the place that you put her there 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.969
 balanced 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:41.020
 I will sacrifice a propeller can here 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:41.020
 swing for you 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.220
 This part of the work we are going to do 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.220
 new 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:06.259
 joking down because he looks 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:09.000
 I put the tip I know is to see 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:14.759
 a little bit smaller than the ranking 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.229
 from the tip of the elle and she already has 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:22.469
 unbalance or it will stay 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:28.469
 shake when you are in the engine 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:31.860
 motor engine 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:37.169
 so often new it comes 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:42.659
 unbalance so it always falls 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:44.279
 side to low weight in that has more weight 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.389
 on this bottom of what you do 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:53.729
 you cut a little bit a millimeter 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:56.969
 again to fall in the cut a piece yes there 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:03.569
 goes to the former stop in the position to put 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:07:05.729
 the train stops there is balanced from the side 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:09.870
 that was down 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:14.639
 Good people there, I'm talking about propellers. 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.050
 the propeller pitch is because I'm going to 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.969
 second video in the third video here 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.960
 Now that you're going to talk about a plane here. 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:21.589
 okay 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.589
 thank you all
