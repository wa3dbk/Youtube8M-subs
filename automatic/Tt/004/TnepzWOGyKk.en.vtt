the current gen versions of the game I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.830 
the current gen versions of the game I
basically<00:00:17.279> got<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> game<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:18.060> both<00:00:18.180> ps3<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
basically got the game for both ps3 and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590 
basically got the game for both ps3 and
ps4<00:00:18.960> on<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> same<00:00:19.770> day<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:20.850> shocked<00:00:21.359> by

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
ps4 on the same day and I was shocked by

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.420 
ps4 on the same day and I was shocked by
how<00:00:21.750> big<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.020> difference<00:00:22.529> was<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.920> terms<00:00:23.160> of

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
how big the difference was in terms of

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.939 
how big the difference was in terms of
detail<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.449> that's<00:00:25.140> mainly<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.619> big

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
detail and that's mainly the big

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.950 
detail and that's mainly the big
difference<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:27.000> ps4<00:00:27.300> version<00:00:27.750> has<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
difference here the ps4 version has a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.839 
difference here the ps4 version has a
much<00:00:28.289> more<00:00:28.500> detailed<00:00:29.010> design<00:00:29.400> with<00:00:29.580> broken

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
much more detailed design with broken

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
much more detailed design with broken
glass<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> ground<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> rubble<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.590> are

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
glass on the ground and rubble that are

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.190 
glass on the ground and rubble that are
oftentimes<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.640> displayed<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.270> empty

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
oftentimes just displayed as empty

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.920 
oftentimes just displayed as empty
textures<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.190> ps3<00:00:35.460> edition<00:00:36.120> apart<00:00:36.840> from

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
textures on the ps3 edition apart from

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
textures on the ps3 edition apart from
details<00:00:37.530> there's<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> huge<00:00:38.790> difference<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
details there's a huge difference in

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.200 
details there's a huge difference in
resolution<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.040> ps3<00:00:41.550> version<00:00:41.579> runs

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
resolution as well the ps3 version runs

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.410 
resolution as well the ps3 version runs
in<00:00:42.390> 720p<00:00:43.070> whereas<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> ps4<00:00:44.640> version<00:00:44.940> runs<00:00:45.180> in

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
in 720p whereas the ps4 version runs in

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.319 
in 720p whereas the ps4 version runs in
1080p<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.160> much<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.340> sharper<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.180> look

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
1080p so it's much more sharper to look

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.810 
1080p so it's much more sharper to look
at<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.809> ps4<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.070> me<00:00:50.190> personally<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
at on the ps4 which to me personally is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
at on the ps4 which to me personally is
important<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.600> fast<00:00:51.870> paced<00:00:52.170> games<00:00:52.530> such<00:00:52.860> as

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
important in fast paced games such as

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
important in fast paced games such as
call<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.460> duty<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.570> try<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.780> kill

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
call of duty when you try to kill

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
call of duty when you try to kill
enemies<00:00:55.350> far<00:00:55.620> away<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.070> long<00:00:56.280> distances<00:00:56.820> it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
enemies far away on long distances it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
enemies far away on long distances it's
much<00:00:57.390> more<00:00:57.629> comfortable<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> play<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.829> ps4

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
much more comfortable to play on ps4

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.369 
much more comfortable to play on ps4
because<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.120> image<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> sharper<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.109> it

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
because the image is sharper and it

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.619 
because the image is sharper and it
doesn't<00:01:01.710> require<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.309> much<00:01:02.850> subconscious

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
doesn't require as much subconscious

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.170 
doesn't require as much subconscious
focus<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.320> strain<00:01:04.650> from<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> player<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.580> terms

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
focus or strain from the player in terms

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.630 
focus or strain from the player in terms
of<00:01:06.420> framerate<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.080> ps3<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.590> actually<00:01:08.369> still

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
of framerate the ps3 is actually still

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
of framerate the ps3 is actually still
doing<00:01:08.939> 60<00:01:09.390> frames<00:01:09.630> per<00:01:09.720> second<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
doing 60 frames per second just like the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.850 
doing 60 frames per second just like the
ps4<00:01:11.250> version<00:01:11.820> does<00:01:12.030> which<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.020> impressive<00:01:13.680> but

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
ps4 version does which is impressive but

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.340 
ps4 version does which is impressive but
at<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.130> same<00:01:14.280> time<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.270> solid<00:01:15.659> framerate<00:01:15.930> has

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
at the same time the solid framerate has

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.770 
at the same time the solid framerate has
always<00:01:16.500> been<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.280> trademark<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> Call<00:01:18.750> of

the ps4 version which interfered with

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.539 
the ps4 version which interfered with
the<00:01:49.350> flow<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.740> multiplayer<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the flow of the multiplayer and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
the flow of the multiplayer and
thankfully<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.930> an<00:01:52.140> issue<00:01:52.380> with

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
thankfully this is not an issue with

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.219 
thankfully this is not an issue with
advanced<00:01:53.280> warfare<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:54.450> least<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:54.869> hasn't<00:01:55.049> been

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
advanced warfare at least it hasn't been

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
advanced warfare at least it hasn't been
to<00:01:55.439> me<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> I've<00:01:56.280> played<00:01:56.640> through<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
to me and I've played through the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
to me and I've played through the
single-player<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> made<00:01:58.380> it<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.710> level<00:01:58.890> 30

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
single-player and made it to level 30

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.399 
single-player and made it to level 30
something<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.149> multi<00:02:00.450> players<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.049> think<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
something in multi players so I think I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.840 
something in multi players so I think I
would<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.649> noticed<00:02:01.799> by<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.460> there<00:02:02.640> was

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
would have noticed by now if there was

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.789 
would have noticed by now if there was
any<00:02:03.090> issue<00:02:03.360> with<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> framerate<00:02:03.990> dropping<00:02:04.710> in

any issue with the framerate dropping in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.590 
any issue with the framerate dropping in
the<00:02:04.829> game<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.310> should<00:02:05.909> also<00:02:06.030> mention<00:02:06.180> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the game I should also mention that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.960 
the game I should also mention that
YouTube<00:02:07.229> videos<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.890> never<00:02:08.160> look<00:02:08.399> quite<00:02:08.789> as

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
YouTube videos will never look quite as

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.880 
YouTube videos will never look quite as
pretty<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.720> game<00:02:09.840> itself<00:02:10.170> looks<00:02:10.470> when<00:02:10.770> you

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
pretty as the game itself looks when you

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.190 
pretty as the game itself looks when you
play<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.430> big<00:02:11.970> screen<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.930> it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
play it on the big screen because it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.020 
play it on the big screen because it
jost<00:02:13.290> goes<00:02:13.500> through<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> lot<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.340> processes

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
jost goes through a lot of processes

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.479 
jost goes through a lot of processes
like<00:02:15.270> rendering<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.140> uploading<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.770> by<00:02:17.190> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
least somewhat how different the old gen

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.130 
least somewhat how different the old gen

warfare<00:02:32.849> looks<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.239> ps4<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.900> it's<00:02:34.500> definitely

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
warfare looks on ps4 and it's definitely

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.740 
warfare looks on ps4 and it's definitely
among<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.550> prettier<00:02:35.940> games<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.450> console

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
among the prettier games on the console

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.839 
among the prettier games on the console
at<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.319> moment<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.220> been<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> huge<00:02:38.610> step

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
at the moment and it's been a huge step

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.420 
at the moment and it's been a huge step
up<00:02:39.030> for<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.390> franchise<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.290> I<00:02:41.160> think<00:02:41.370> the

up for the franchise and I think the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.280 
up for the franchise and I think the
facial<00:02:41.849> animations<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.540> game<00:02:42.750> has<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.260> be

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
facial animations in the game has to be

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.289 
facial animations in the game has to be
among<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.590> top<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.340> bunch<00:02:44.519> in<00:02:44.790> general
