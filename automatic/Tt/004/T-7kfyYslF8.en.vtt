move less we've already done that so

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.129 
move less we've already done that so
let's<00:06:50.199> try<00:06:50.409> right<00:06:50.680> nope<00:06:51.279> up<00:06:51.789> nope<00:06:52.300> down<00:06:52.749> note

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:53.139 
let's try right nope up nope down note

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:57.179 
let's try right nope up nope down note
and<00:06:53.349> left<00:06:54.189> yes<00:06:55.349> you're<00:06:56.349> passing<00:06:56.860> does<00:06:57.009> not

00:06:57.179 --> 00:06:57.189 
and left yes you're passing does not

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:59.339 
and left yes you're passing does not
bring<00:06:57.399> me<00:06:57.550> to<00:06:57.669> the<00:06:57.759> tube<00:06:57.969> I<00:06:58.300> do<00:06:58.749> not<00:06:58.990> know<00:06:59.169> if

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
bring me to the tube I do not know if

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.920 
bring me to the tube I do not know if
this<00:06:59.529> is<00:06:59.559> on<00:06:59.949> purpose<00:07:00.189> because<00:07:00.610> the<00:07:01.029> demo<00:07:01.539> or

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
this is on purpose because the demo or

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.159 
this is on purpose because the demo or
the<00:07:02.259> hack<00:07:02.469> is<00:07:02.620> over<00:07:03.120> or<00:07:04.120> if<00:07:04.539> your<00:07:04.689> path<00:07:04.960> thing

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
the hack is over or if your path thing

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:07.860 
the hack is over or if your path thing
is<00:07:05.259> messed<00:07:05.499> up<00:07:05.819> so<00:07:06.819> the<00:07:06.939> author<00:07:07.120> of<00:07:07.449> this<00:07:07.479> hack

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
is messed up so the author of this hack

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.659 
is messed up so the author of this hack
I'm<00:07:08.229> going<00:07:08.469> to<00:07:08.620> save<00:07:08.889> it<00:07:08.919> and<00:07:09.159> reset<00:07:09.639> it

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
I'm going to save it and reset it

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.360 
I'm going to save it and reset it
because<00:07:10.270> I'm<00:07:10.360> sure<00:07:10.599> it<00:07:10.749> tells<00:07:10.930> me<00:07:10.990> the<00:07:11.169> author

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.370 
because I'm sure it tells me the author

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.869 
because I'm sure it tells me the author
somewhere<00:07:12.899> it<00:07:13.899> does<00:07:14.199> not<00:07:14.379> it<00:07:15.099> does<00:07:15.339> not<00:07:15.550> tell

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879 
somewhere it does not it does not tell

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:39.249 
that is the end that is all I got those

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:40.439 
that is the end that is all I got those
are<00:07:39.370> the<00:07:39.459> only<00:07:39.550> two<00:07:39.789> things<00:07:39.969> because<00:07:40.330> I've

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:40.449 
are the only two things because I've

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:45.809 
are the only two things because I've
tried<00:07:40.629> down<00:07:41.639> down<00:07:42.779> right<00:07:43.779> up<00:07:44.370> only<00:07:45.370> that<00:07:45.490> works

00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:45.819 
tried down down right up only that works

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:48.899 
tried down down right up only that works
and<00:07:46.269> we've<00:07:47.019> beaten<00:07:47.289> that<00:07:47.529> I<00:07:47.889> don't<00:07:48.550> see<00:07:48.729> why

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:48.909 
and we've beaten that I don't see why

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:50.969 
and we've beaten that I don't see why
you<00:07:48.969> would<00:07:49.269> do<00:07:49.569> a<00:07:49.599> douche<00:07:49.899> bag<00:07:50.139> move<00:07:50.169> now<00:07:50.589> and

00:07:50.969 --> 00:07:50.979 
you would do a douche bag move now and

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:52.920 
you would do a douche bag move now and
make<00:07:51.159> a<00:07:51.189> second<00:07:51.669> secret<00:07:52.120> exit<00:07:52.569> that<00:07:52.719> only

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
make a second secret exit that only

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.719 
make a second secret exit that only
brings<00:07:53.199> me<00:07:53.319> to<00:07:53.439> the<00:07:53.499> tube<00:07:53.740> when<00:07:54.459> you<00:07:54.550> haven't

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:54.729
