striker was viewed my co is kind of a
emerging<00:03:04.269> competitor<00:03:04.719> somewhat<00:03:05.139> of<00:03:05.169> a<00:03:05.260> threat

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
emerging competitor somewhat of a threat

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.220 
emerging competitor somewhat of a threat
now<00:03:06.519> they<00:03:06.669> buy<00:03:06.819> them<00:03:06.969> out<00:03:07.120> at<00:03:07.359> a<00:03:07.419> pretty<00:03:07.750> pretty

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
now they buy them out at a pretty pretty

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.289 
now they buy them out at a pretty pretty
big<00:03:08.409> premium<00:03:08.620> eighty-five<00:03:09.159> percent<00:03:09.340> makes<00:03:10.180> me

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
big premium eighty-five percent makes me

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.490 
big premium eighty-five percent makes me
think<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.540> they're<00:03:10.750> really<00:03:11.019> just<00:03:11.290> trying<00:03:11.439> to

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
think that they're really just trying to

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.050 
think that they're really just trying to
get<00:03:11.620> past<00:03:11.799> any<00:03:12.010> competing<00:03:12.280> bids<00:03:12.579> with<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.879> with

get past any competing bids with it with

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.300 
get past any competing bids with it with
a<00:03:13.090> huge<00:03:13.540> eighty-five<00:03:14.349> percent<00:03:14.439> move<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:14.889> it

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
a huge eighty-five percent move so it

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.309 
a huge eighty-five percent move so it
makes<00:03:15.489> sense<00:03:15.609> and<00:03:16.090> /<00:03:16.659> Mako<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:17.230> know

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
into that do-it-yourselfer we've got a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.920 
into that do-it-yourselfer we've got a
lot<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.579> old<00:03:39.849> cars<00:03:40.060> out<00:03:40.329> on<00:03:40.449> the<00:03:40.509> roads<00:03:40.720> there

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
lot of old cars out on the roads there

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.509 
lot of old cars out on the roads there
but<00:03:41.259> the<00:03:41.500> nice<00:03:41.709> thing<00:03:41.739> is<00:03:41.949> these<00:03:42.099> cars<00:03:42.400> are

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
but the nice thing is these cars are

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.520 
but the nice thing is these cars are
built<00:03:42.699> to<00:03:42.879> last<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.269> little<00:03:43.389> bit<00:03:43.509> longer<00:03:43.750> so<00:03:44.500> I

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
built to last a little bit longer so I

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.509 
built to last a little bit longer so I
think<00:03:44.620> that's<00:03:44.769> playing<00:03:44.979> in<00:03:45.099> autosomes

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.759 
think that's playing in autosomes
advantage<00:03:46.419> there<00:03:46.569> they're<00:03:46.840> bigger<00:03:47.139> than

advantage there they're bigger than

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.559 
advantage there they're bigger than

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
personally because of that dynamic of

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.700 
personally because of that dynamic of
the<00:05:15.090> business<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.569> you<00:05:15.870> know<00:05:15.960> China<00:05:16.259> to<00:05:16.500> date

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
the business and you know China to date

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.290 
the business and you know China to date
has<00:05:16.860> been<00:05:16.889> very<00:05:17.250> careful<00:05:17.550> about<00:05:17.849> what<00:05:18.120> they've

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
has been very careful about what they've

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.179 
has been very careful about what they've
allowed<00:05:18.599> on<00:05:18.840> their<00:05:18.960> internet<00:05:19.379> and<00:05:19.560> censorship

00:05:20.179 --> 00:05:20.189 
allowed on their internet and censorship

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:21.860 
allowed on their internet and censorship
certainly<00:05:20.969> is<00:05:21.029> a<00:05:21.090> concern<00:05:21.419> there<00:05:21.599> but<00:05:21.779> they

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
certainly is a concern there but they

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.899 
certainly is a concern there but they
are<00:05:22.020> starting<00:05:22.319> to<00:05:22.500> loosen<00:05:23.039> it<00:05:23.159> up<00:05:23.219> just<00:05:23.550> even<00:05:23.849> a

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
are starting to loosen it up just even a

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.480 
are starting to loosen it up just even a
little<00:05:24.090> bit<00:05:24.210> right<00:05:24.479> baby<00:05:24.779> steps<00:05:25.289> and<00:05:25.590> so<00:05:26.460> I

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
little bit right baby steps and so I

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.219 
little bit right baby steps and so I
think<00:05:26.610> what<00:05:26.939> is<00:05:27.029> it<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.240> Shanghai<00:05:28.020> free-trade

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
think what is it the Shanghai free-trade

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.200 
think what is it the Shanghai free-trade
zone<00:05:28.919> now<00:05:29.129> you're<00:05:29.340> going<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.520> have<00:05:29.639> some

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
zone now you're going to have some

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.700 
zone now you're going to have some
access<00:05:30.419> to<00:05:30.719> some<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.050> these<00:05:31.139> types<00:05:31.379> of<00:05:31.500> social

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
access to some of these types of social

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.409 
access to some of these types of social
sites<00:05:32.069> and<00:05:32.159> I<00:05:32.219> think<00:05:32.460> that<00:05:32.610> scene<00:05:32.879> is<00:05:33.029> as<00:05:33.150> a

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
sites and I think that scene is as a

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.390 
sites and I think that scene is as a
potential<00:05:33.810> boon<00:05:34.080> for<00:05:34.289> something<00:05:34.650> like<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:35.039> Cena

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
potential boon for something like a Cena

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.100 
potential boon for something like a Cena
because<00:05:35.699> of<00:05:35.819> Weibo<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.330> so<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.629> think<00:05:36.870> that

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
because of Weibo and so I think that

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.420 
because of Weibo and so I think that
Cena<00:05:37.409> shares<00:05:37.680> today<00:05:37.830> look<00:05:38.069> a<00:05:38.159> little<00:05:38.250> bit

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
Cena shares today look a little bit

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.700 
Cena shares today look a little bit
undervalued<00:05:39.029> compared<00:05:39.449> to<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:39.719> the<00:05:39.990> upside

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
undervalued compared to the the upside

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.409 
undervalued compared to the the upside
that<00:05:40.740> Weibo<00:05:41.250> could<00:05:41.400> bring<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.699> company<00:05:41.879> all

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
that Weibo could bring the company all
