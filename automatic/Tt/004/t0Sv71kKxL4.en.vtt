00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
most of the things you may need in a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
most of the things you may need in a
photo<00:02:06.270> shoot<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> bottom<00:02:07.770> we've<00:02:07.860> got<00:02:07.890> your

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
photo shoot on the bottom we've got your

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.469

photo<00:02:08.310> compartment<00:02:08.849> as<00:02:08.940> well<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.420> think

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
photo compartment as well and I think

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.609 
photo compartment as well and I think
this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.840> actually<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> very<00:02:10.410> good<00:02:10.470> idea

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
this is actually a very good idea

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190 
this is actually a very good idea
because<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.790> you're<00:02:12.060> traveling<00:02:12.480> for<00:02:12.840> example

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
because if you're traveling for example

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.820 
because if you're traveling for example
even<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.620> very

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
even in a very

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.560 
even in a very
crowded<00:02:14.220> place<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.730> may<00:02:14.850> worry<00:02:15.120> about<00:02:15.390> your

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
crowded place you may worry about your

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.060 
crowded place you may worry about your
camera<00:02:15.840> being<00:02:16.170> stolen<00:02:16.680> your<00:02:16.740> grandpa

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
camera being stolen your grandpa

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.950 
camera being stolen your grandpa
somebody<00:02:17.370> else<00:02:17.520> out<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.910> your<00:02:18.030> bag<00:02:18.240> but<00:02:18.810> with

somebody else out of your bag but with

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.630 
somebody else out of your bag but with
it<00:02:19.110> being<00:02:19.320> behind<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.800> back<00:02:20.010> there's<00:02:20.340> no

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
it being behind your back there's no

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.730 
it being behind your back there's no
chance<00:02:20.940> anybody<00:02:21.360> would<00:02:21.660> be<00:02:21.750> able<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.110> take

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
chance anybody would be able to take

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.410 
chance anybody would be able to take
your<00:02:22.890> camera<00:02:23.160> or<00:02:23.400> anything<00:02:23.580> at<00:02:23.970> least<00:02:24.210> while
