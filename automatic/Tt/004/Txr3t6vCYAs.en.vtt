 Name address etc. from s5

 But it is to introduce this time 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.580
 Trajectory recognition of 28 layer users' desires 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.220
 It is not something that features high crude oil 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.980
 It's a so-called scanner 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.670

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.350
 Is it kind? 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.320
 Before the Air Force, there is a question of whether or not I was involved in a bill collision 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.880
 You 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.060
 Wintering 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.380
 Anything in a business card 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.530
 I can get a connect 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.560
 Like a scanner 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.970
 I'm not good with a second camera 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.480
 You may think that it is overwintering 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.840
 There is one feature 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.310
 In words 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.620

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.620

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.460
 If it is eco-friendly 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.460
 Germinal germs, but from here you can see 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:35.399
 Green departure 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:37.799
 The mark will come out 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.079
 It's like a business card with a store name 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.999
