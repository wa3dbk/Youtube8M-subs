idea that people aren't using reference
is<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.229> mean<00:01:58.860> some<00:01:59.100> artists<00:01:59.430> can<00:01:59.670> but<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> lot<00:02:00.360> of

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
is I mean some artists can but a lot of

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
is I mean some artists can but a lot of
artists<00:02:00.840> need<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.140> use<00:02:01.290> reference<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.070> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
artists need to use reference now if you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
artists need to use reference now if you
can<00:02:02.280> see<00:02:02.990> let's<00:02:03.990> kind<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.229> break<00:02:04.380> down<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
can see let's kind of break down the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.469 
can see let's kind of break down the
hand<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.040> every<00:02:05.280> anatomy<00:02:05.880> book<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.210> drawing

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
hand in every anatomy book a drawing

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.809 
hand in every anatomy book a drawing
look<00:02:06.719> there's<00:02:07.110> always<00:02:07.380> some<00:02:07.920> sort<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.459> how

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
look there's always some sort of how

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.270 
look there's always some sort of how
easy<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.690> hand<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.470> usually<00:02:10.709> I've<00:02:10.979> seen

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
easy the hand is and usually I've seen

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.699 
easy the hand is and usually I've seen
things<00:02:11.550> too<00:02:11.730> where<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.660> circle

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
things too where it's a circle

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.420 
things too where it's a circle
and<00:02:13.799> then<00:02:14.069> they<00:02:14.219> draw<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:15.349> series<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.500> lines<00:02:16.890> and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
and then they draw a series of lines and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.130 
and then they draw a series of lines and
then<00:02:17.519> they<00:02:17.640> tell<00:02:17.849> you<00:02:17.939> that<00:02:18.120> there's<00:02:18.599> a<00:02:18.689> circle

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
then they tell you that there's a circle

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.979 
then they tell you that there's a circle
here<00:02:19.439> or<00:02:19.829> maybe<00:02:20.519> it'll<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:20.849> a<00:02:20.879> square<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.780> then

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
here or maybe it'll be a square and then

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.369 
here or maybe it'll be a square and then
they<00:02:22.459> you<00:02:23.459> know<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:24.060> little<00:02:24.719> balls<00:02:24.989> and

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
they you know it's the little balls and

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.720 
they you know it's the little balls and
they're<00:02:25.530> trying<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.799> show<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.099> whether<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
they're trying to show you whether the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.920 
they're trying to show you whether the
joints<00:02:27.150> are<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:28.430> okay<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:30.209> doesn't<00:02:30.540> really

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
joints are and okay this doesn't really

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.599 
joints are and okay this doesn't really
help<00:02:31.230> out<00:02:31.439> in<00:02:31.620> my<00:02:31.769> opinion<00:02:32.189> because<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.519> it

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
help out in my opinion because if it

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.069 
help out in my opinion because if it
helped<00:02:32.849> out<00:02:32.969> then<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.329> hands<00:02:33.450> wouldn't<00:02:33.689> be<00:02:33.870> so

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
helped out then the hands wouldn't be so

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.149 
helped out then the hands wouldn't be so
difficult<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.680> draw<00:02:36.560> when<00:02:37.560> you're<00:02:37.709> drawing<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
difficult to draw when you're drawing a

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.559 
difficult to draw when you're drawing a
hand<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.549> first<00:02:38.760> thing<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.150> have<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
hand the first thing that you have to

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.670 
hand the first thing that you have to
remember<00:02:39.780> there's<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.319> difference<00:02:40.620> between

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
remember there's a difference between

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.129 
remember there's a difference between
drawing<00:02:41.189> a<00:02:41.280> fist<00:02:43.069> okay<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.540> by<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.599> way<00:02:45.840> when

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
drawing a fist okay and by the way when

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.679 
drawing a fist okay and by the way when
you<00:02:46.230> start<00:02:46.560> drawing<00:02:46.739> hands<00:02:47.340> rough<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.909> out<00:02:48.090> it

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
you start drawing hands rough it out it

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.190 
you start drawing hands rough it out it
doesn't<00:02:49.169> have<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.769> perfect<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.989> know<00:02:51.989> that

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
doesn't have to be perfect you know that

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.119 
doesn't have to be perfect you know that
this<00:02:52.349> is<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> fist<00:02:52.889> right<00:02:54.139> more<00:02:55.139> or<00:02:55.200> less<00:02:55.349> it

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
this is a fist right more or less it

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.899 
this is a fist right more or less it
doesn't<00:02:56.370> look<00:02:56.489> perfect

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
doesn't look perfect

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:58.369 
doesn't look perfect
I<00:02:56.939> don't<00:02:57.150> need<00:02:57.299> for<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:57.569> to<00:02:57.599> look<00:02:57.780> perfect<00:02:57.930> I

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
I don't need for it to look perfect I

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.559 
I don't need for it to look perfect I
just<00:02:58.650> need<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.189> get<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.459> down<00:03:01.760> anyway<00:03:02.760> when

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
just need to get it down anyway when

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.940 
just need to get it down anyway when
you're<00:03:03.659> looking<00:03:03.900> at<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.169> hand<00:03:04.439> there<00:03:04.769> are<00:03:04.799> a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
you're looking at the hand there are a

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.129 
you're looking at the hand there are a
series<00:03:05.430> of<00:03:05.790> curves<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.359> your<00:03:06.510> hand<00:03:06.719> there's<00:03:07.079> a

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
series of curves in your hand there's a

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.780 
series of curves in your hand there's a
curve<00:03:07.439> here<00:03:07.969> there's<00:03:08.969> one<00:03:09.180> here<00:03:10.579> even<00:03:11.579> if<00:03:11.700> you

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
curve here there's one here even if you

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.020 
curve here there's one here even if you
turn<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.959> hand<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.409> the<00:03:13.439> side<00:03:13.769> so<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.939> is

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
turn your hand to the side so this is

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.520 
turn your hand to the side so this is
the<00:03:15.120> main<00:03:15.299> part<00:03:15.569> of<00:03:15.689> your<00:03:15.810> hand<00:03:15.989> if<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.200> just

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
the main part of your hand if you just

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.960 
the main part of your hand if you just
look<00:03:16.709> at<00:03:16.829> your<00:03:16.889> hand<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.430> could<00:03:17.549> see<00:03:17.790> that

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
look at your hand you could see that

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.960 
look at your hand you could see that
your<00:03:18.180> fingers<00:03:18.690> even<00:03:18.930> curved<00:03:19.379> up<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:20.489> your

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
your fingers even curved up so your

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.770 
your fingers even curved up so your
whole<00:03:21.150> hand<00:03:21.359> actually<00:03:21.629> curves<00:03:22.109> and<00:03:23.540> you<00:03:24.540> know

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
whole hand actually curves and you know

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.119 
whole hand actually curves and you know
me<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.019> don't<00:03:25.260> know<00:03:25.349> what<00:03:25.470> position<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.919> thumb

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
me I don't know what position the thumb

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.219 
me I don't know what position the thumb
will<00:03:26.489> just<00:03:26.669> put<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.970> position<00:03:27.569> of<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> thumb

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
will just put the position of the thumb

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.159 
will just put the position of the thumb
right<00:03:28.500> here<00:03:28.560> for<00:03:29.549> now<00:03:29.729> but<00:03:30.389> there<00:03:30.569> is<00:03:30.599> a<00:03:30.720> series

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
right here for now but there is a series

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.050 
right here for now but there is a series
of<00:03:31.199> curves<00:03:31.709> all<00:03:32.159> the<00:03:32.310> way<00:03:32.400> like<00:03:32.639> this<00:03:32.879> is<00:03:33.030> a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
of curves all the way like this is a

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.960 
of curves all the way like this is a
curve<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.599> webbing<00:03:33.989> in<00:03:34.139> between<00:03:34.609> your<00:03:35.609> your

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
curve the webbing in between your your

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.420 
curve the webbing in between your your
thumb<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:37.340> forefinger<00:03:39.829> there<00:03:40.829> is<00:03:40.949> a<00:03:40.979> series

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
thumb and forefinger there is a series

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.550 
thumb and forefinger there is a series
of<00:03:41.459> curves<00:03:42.889> and<00:03:44.299> so<00:03:45.299> once<00:03:45.689> you<00:03:45.780> start<00:03:46.169> to

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
of curves and so once you start to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.379 
of curves and so once you start to
recognize<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.400> there's<00:03:47.819> curves<00:03:48.180> everywhere

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
recognize that there's curves everywhere

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.199 
recognize that there's curves everywhere
on<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:49.169> hand<00:03:49.470> then<00:03:50.400> that'll<00:03:50.729> help<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:51.000> draw

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
on your hand then that'll help you draw

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:52.879 
on your hand then that'll help you draw
a<00:03:51.239> little<00:03:51.540> bit<00:03:51.659> better<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:52.199> know<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.769> this

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
a little bit better I know that this

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.860 
a little bit better I know that this
hand<00:03:53.159> right<00:03:53.370> here<00:03:53.609> isn't<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.060> proportion<00:03:54.689> all

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
hand right here isn't in proportion all

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.390 
hand right here isn't in proportion all
that<00:03:55.079> great<00:03:55.319> but<00:03:55.349> that's<00:03:55.709> okay<00:03:56.009> because<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.370> can

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
that great but that's okay because I can

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.469 
that great but that's okay because I can
always<00:03:56.639> fix<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:58.459> now<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.790> few<00:04:00.150> things<00:04:00.329> about

always fix that now a few things about

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.039 
always fix that now a few things about
the<00:04:00.810> hand<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.729> general<00:04:02.729> if<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.540> noticed<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
the hand in general if you noticed I

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.569 
the hand in general if you noticed I
kind<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.349> just<00:04:04.530> laid<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.919> out<00:04:05.159> let's<00:04:05.430> lay

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
kind of just laid this out let's lay

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.759 
kind of just laid this out let's lay
this<00:04:05.699> out<00:04:05.849> even<00:04:06.180> more<00:04:06.209> simpler<00:04:06.810> because<00:04:06.989> right

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
this out even more simpler because right

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.929 
this out even more simpler because right
now<00:04:07.979> in<00:04:08.519> order<00:04:08.939> to<00:04:09.090> teach<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.449> this<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:10.790> want<00:04:11.790> to

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:17.120 
now in order to teach you this I want to
teach<00:04:12.120> this<00:04:12.419> is<00:04:13.459> primitive<00:04:14.459> as<00:04:14.909> possible<00:04:16.130> so

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
teach this is primitive as possible so

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.279 
teach this is primitive as possible so
we<00:04:17.459> can<00:04:17.579> see<00:04:17.880> we<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.209> representation<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:19.199> a

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
we can see we have a representation of a

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.490 
we can see we have a representation of a
hand<00:04:19.560> right<00:04:19.859> here<00:04:20.099> it's<00:04:20.669> not<00:04:20.699> perfect<00:04:21.500> not

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
hand right here it's not perfect not

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.180 
hand right here it's not perfect not
even<00:04:22.529> close

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
even close

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.209 
even close
but<00:04:23.370> I'm<00:04:23.789> also<00:04:23.969> going<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.300> fix<00:04:24.479> this<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:25.680> you

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:26.219 
but I'm also going to fix this if you

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:27.390 
but I'm also going to fix this if you
notice<00:04:26.610> if<00:04:26.909> you<00:04:27.060> look

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
that these two fingers are going to be

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.480 
that these two fingers are going to be
closer<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.320> each<00:04:35.350> other<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.800> know<00:04:35.860> this<00:04:36.250> one<00:04:36.460> is

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
let's fix that now these two fingers

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.189 
let's fix that now these two fingers
right<00:04:44.289> here<00:04:45.300> I'm<00:04:46.300> gonna<00:04:46.449> change<00:04:46.690> colors<00:04:47.020> here

be pretty close to each other all right

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.800 
be pretty close to each other all right
and<00:04:55.780> your<00:04:56.080> your<00:04:56.410> pinky<00:04:56.889> is<00:04:57.130> kind<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.210> just<00:04:58.660> off

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
and your your pinky is kind of just off

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.810 
and your your pinky is kind of just off
to<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.050> side<00:04:59.380> it's<00:04:59.770> kind<00:05:00.100> of<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:00.430> hanging

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
out away from everybody else and this is

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.120 
out away from everybody else and this is
probably<00:05:04.870> your<00:05:05.110> most<00:05:05.229> expressive<00:05:05.620> finger

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130

out<00:05:37.300> when<00:05:37.510> I'm<00:05:37.630> just<00:05:37.870> sketching<00:05:38.080> stuff<00:05:38.470> out<00:05:38.710> I

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
out when I'm just sketching stuff out I

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.839 
out when I'm just sketching stuff out I
try<00:05:39.849> to<00:05:39.910> keep<00:05:40.090> these<00:05:40.330> two<00:05:40.599> fingers<00:05:40.960> together

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
then I'll go ahead and put this one in

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:47.700 
then I'll go ahead and put this one in
right<00:05:46.449> here<00:05:46.690> these<00:05:46.930> two<00:05:46.990> fingers<00:05:47.500> are<00:05:47.620> about

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710

right here these two fingers are about
the<00:05:47.860> same<00:05:48.010> size<00:05:49.289> and<00:05:50.289> then<00:05:50.440> we<00:05:50.530> got<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.770> pinky

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
the same size and then we got the pinky

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.120 
the same size and then we got the pinky
hanging<00:05:51.430> out<00:05:51.580> here<00:05:52.500> now<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.530> know<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.770> got<00:05:53.979> to<00:05:54.070> go

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
hanging out here now I know I got to go

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.460 
hanging out here now I know I got to go
back<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.460> adjust<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.909> but<00:05:55.300> again<00:05:55.470> that's

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
back and adjust that but again that's

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.719 
back and adjust that but again that's
just<00:05:56.590> something<00:05:56.860> that<00:05:57.010> I'm<00:05:57.159> gonna<00:05:57.280> do<00:05:57.520> later

00:05:57.719 --> 00:05:57.729
