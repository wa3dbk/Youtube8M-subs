00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.920
 today we are going to see is an issue that 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.520
 other channels have already treated it 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.370
 is the curtain tony and go to several 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.370
 several you 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.190
 several acquaintances there on youtube this 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 but well, maybe this is the best 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.079
 people who do not know them and I 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.180
 have me this then I go back to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.760
 prove that this topic is called the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.070
 padded this good I'm going to show it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.479
 that planted them tobacco as well because 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.390
 lately in lion it was raining 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:01:00.059
 enough or yes if not all 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.070
 days this and good here what happens to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.850
 tobacco plants 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.840
 is that when the water falls, what happens is 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.590
 that the earth 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.439
 Fill the leaves with dirty 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.359
 land east and well this looks apart 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.100
 that looks bad on plants can be 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:23.840
 harmful because the plants can not 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.789
 breathe well for the leaves then 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.369
 this also what can happen is that 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.590
 if the earth completely covers the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.780
 plant and good this is going to be harmful 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.930
 since there may be this 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.310
 another faction or the plant can die is 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.920
 just this good since 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.950
 I just cut the grass that I have 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.759
 I 'm going to show you the balloon quilt 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.600
 be with grass already cut this I what 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.860
 I left one day this so they are fixed 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.409
 lose a bit of color and you do 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.659
 amarillito and good what we are going to do 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.399
 here is let's place some 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.799
 lawn around the plants 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.470
 tobacco not scrubbed to the stem because 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.660
 also this is harmful this one but 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.019
 around nothing else this is going to help 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.620
 apart from that you will not avoid so much 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:19.190
 the earth this is going to help keep the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.850
 humidity of the plants which indicates that 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.099
 is what leads to watering less this 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.840
 This study was applied by tobacco 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.540
 versatility since I already explained 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.830
 previously but good this one this 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.330
 Padding can be applied to 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.480
 any type of crop this one 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.300
 If I'm wrong, do not hesitate to correct me 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.610
 but only that I understand there is no 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.940
 no crop that does not require this 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.420
 this or rather that is indispensable 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.790
 neither this this is simply either 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.400
 for aesthetics that look better executive 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:58.330
 it will be a little greener this or by 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.640
 beware that this is the maintain 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.700
 wet the plant to avoid watering so 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.680
 followed 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.680
 and good for what is going to show 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.159
 and how it looks if it is not stuck to the stem 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.040
 it should not be stuck to the stem this is 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.010
 you can apply either with lawn be with 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.920
 you can if you 're in with plastic this one 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.530
 can do with 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.290
 I have a Spanish friend who does it 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.910
 with rock puts them rocks on the sides 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.069
 so that even when watering do not splash 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.260
 so much this this matter of the earth does not 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.620
 move so much can be done with 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.209
 Dry straw can be made with leaves 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.160
 can be done with material that you 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.650
 see but well this has two advantages 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.110
 a good rather 31 splashed 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.230
 maintains moisture and this third 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.610
 maintains is a contribution of extra nitrogen 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.290
 is an equal subscriber this one since good 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.670
 that the leaves contain nitrogen and 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.810
 moment they are here 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.959
 Alice and drying it off 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.290
 slowly and this is beneficial for the 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.400
 plant this good I will take advantage for 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.739
 show them how the plants are going after 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.340
 of I think it's two weeks of 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.340
 transplant 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.789
 and well, the biggest one is this 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:25.000
 bigger than we have that I have here 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.590
 It was very beautiful very large leaves 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.289
 a little white fly but good 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.620
 that gets fixed easy then I'll show you 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.130
 how I'm good this has been all for 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.370
 today 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.000
 this filled show a photo at the end 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.310
 of how the plants are already with this one 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.990
 I hope you liked it but 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.990
 mostly served and until next time
