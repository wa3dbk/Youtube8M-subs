00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
it as a ghost rider motorcycle now

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.199 
it as a ghost rider motorcycle now
because<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.319> didn't<00:02:37.530> pick<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.610> motorcycle

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
because I didn't pick up the motorcycle

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.000 
because I didn't pick up the motorcycle
to<00:02:39.330> ghost<00:02:39.510> rider<00:02:39.810> when<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.140> got<00:02:40.350> my<00:02:40.500> ghost<00:02:40.709> rider

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
to ghost rider when I got my ghost rider

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.850

so<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:43.470> true<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:44.310> has<00:02:44.660> translucent<00:02:45.660> um<00:02:45.989> tires

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
so it's true it has translucent um tires

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.880 
so it's true it has translucent um tires
as<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:48.000> can<00:02:48.090> see<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:49.320> flat<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.800> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
bottom so I thought this wouldn't be
