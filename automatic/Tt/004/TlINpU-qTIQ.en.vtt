00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.410 
it doesn't really last forever put it
that<00:02:44.050> way<00:02:44.500> treat<00:02:45.130> it<00:02:45.160> gently<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.300> will

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
that way treat it gently and it will

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.190 
that way treat it gently and it will
last<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:47.110> long<00:02:47.500> time<00:02:47.610> now<00:02:48.610> one<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.720> causes

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
last a long time now one of the causes

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.190 
last a long time now one of the causes
for<00:02:50.230> breakage<00:02:50.950> is<00:02:51.280> if<00:02:51.580> you<00:02:51.730> use<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.000> an<00:02:52.810> onion

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
for breakage is if you use a an onion

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.920 
for breakage is if you use a an onion
that's<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:54.030> too<00:02:55.030> large<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:58.390> larger

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
that's a too large so it it's larger

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.630 
that's a too large so it it's larger
than<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.200> cutting<00:02:59.560> surface<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:01.350> now<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:03.610> just

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
than the cutting surface and now it just

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.350 
than the cutting surface and now it just
won't<00:03:04.080> cut<00:03:05.080> through<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.440> onion<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:06.360> you

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
won't cut through the onion and you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.190 
won't cut through the onion and you
could<00:03:07.870> break<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.440> thing<00:03:08.709> now<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.550> other

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
could break the thing now the other

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.330 
could break the thing now the other
problem<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.590> may<00:03:11.769> run<00:03:12.400> into<00:03:12.580> is<00:03:14.340> older

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
problem that you may run into is older

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.449 
problem that you may run into is older
softer<00:03:16.180> onions<00:03:16.750> will<00:03:17.140> tend<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.590> spread<00:03:18.070> out

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
softer onions will tend to spread out

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.560 
softer onions will tend to spread out
and<00:03:19.320> they<00:03:20.320> too<00:03:20.890> will<00:03:21.280> go<00:03:21.610> past<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.150> cutting

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
and they too will go past the cutting

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.500 
and they too will go past the cutting
surface<00:03:22.810> by<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.739> virtue<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.340> their<00:03:24.549> spread

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
surface by a virtue of their spread

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.069 
surface by a virtue of their spread
ability<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.470> that<00:03:27.180> could<00:03:28.180> cause<00:03:28.390> problems<00:03:28.900> too

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
ability so that could cause problems too

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.420 
ability so that could cause problems too
so<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.860> like<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.730> use<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.880> nice<00:03:31.150> fresh<00:03:31.540> onion<00:03:32.110> and

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
so I like to use a nice fresh onion and

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.610 
so I like to use a nice fresh onion and
I<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.480> cut<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.280> along<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.760> axis<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
I like to cut it along this axis the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.600 
I like to cut it along this axis the
axis<00:03:38.860> of<00:03:39.959> from<00:03:40.959> the<00:03:41.200> from<00:03:41.769> where<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.160> roots

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
axis of from the from where the roots

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.199 
axis of from the from where the roots
and<00:03:43.000> where<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.019> stem<00:03:44.620> come<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.850> reason

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
and where the stem come and the reason

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.090 
and where the stem come and the reason
is<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.510> think<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.840> get<00:03:46.989> better<00:03:47.019> dice<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.860> way

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
is I think you get better dice that way

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.580 
is I think you get better dice that way
and<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.360> I'll<00:03:49.450> just<00:03:49.690> chop<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:49.989> in<00:03:50.350> half

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.979 

foolishly<00:03:53.590> not<00:03:54.280> taking<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.180> skin<00:03:55.450> off<00:03:55.480> first

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
foolishly not taking the skin off first

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.620 
foolishly not taking the skin off first
but<00:03:56.519> that's<00:03:57.519> not<00:03:57.760> really<00:03:58.060> too<00:03:58.269> much<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.450> a

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
but that's not really too much of a

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.600 
but that's not really too much of a
problem

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
problem

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.759 
problem
couple<00:04:00.610> quick<00:04:00.850> cuts<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:02.579> on<00:04:03.579> our<00:04:03.820> way<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.769> now

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
couple quick cuts and on our way so now

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.840 
couple quick cuts and on our way so now
