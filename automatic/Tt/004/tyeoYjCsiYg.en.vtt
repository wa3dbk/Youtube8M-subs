00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
it to be a little thicker when I was

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
layered and then I kind of space it out

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.859 
layered and then I kind of space it out
just<00:01:17.310> four<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> five<00:01:17.909> inches<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.540> started

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
cutting all the way down and from here I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.450 
cutting all the way down and from here I
need<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.290> two<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.770> cuts<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.280> i'm

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
need to do two more cuts because i'm

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.710 
need to do two more cuts because i'm
actually<00:01:26.610> going<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.060> doing<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.420> grade

instead of a twist keep in mind to leave

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.880 
instead of a twist keep in mind to leave
a<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.210> space<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.780> top<00:01:30.840> then<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.740> time

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
a little space at the top then it's time

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.950 
a little space at the top then it's time
to<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.250> basket<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.329> i'm<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.600> pin

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to do the basket and here i'm just pin

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.289 
to do the basket and here i'm just pin
spacing<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.740> out<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.159> i<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.430> room<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:36.090> my

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
spacing it out so i have room to do my

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
spacing it out so i have room to do my
braid<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.350> leave<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> through<00:01:38.040> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
braid and then to leave it through and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
braid and then to leave it through and
this<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.119> kind<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.420> what<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.570> product<00:01:39.869> should

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
this is kind of what the product should

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
this is kind of what the product should
like<00:01:40.350> afterwards<00:01:41.040> some<00:01:41.369> spacing<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
like afterwards some spacing for you to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.940 
like afterwards some spacing for you to
use<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:42.780> place<00:01:42.899> my<00:01:43.229> fabric<00:01:43.619> just<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.920> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
use and then i place my fabric just in a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
use and then i place my fabric just in a
random<00:01:44.280> area<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> starting<00:01:45.299> point<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> then

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
random area as a starting point and then

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.319 
random area as a starting point and then
spread<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.530> all<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> my<00:01:46.920> strings<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> hooked

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
spread out all of my strings and hooked

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
spread out all of my strings and hooked
a<00:01:48.479> few<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.780> them<00:01:48.899> under<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.950> wasn't

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
a few of them under so that it wasn't

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
a few of them under so that it wasn't
going<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.820> end<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.659> place<00:01:51.960> from

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
going to end up going out of place from

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.859 
going to end up going out of place from
here<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.159> started<00:01:53.460> braiding<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.750> i

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
here I just started braiding and then i

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.050 
here I just started braiding and then i
use<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.409> braid<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.250> actually<00:01:56.700> wind

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
use the braid to actually wind

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.539 
use the braid to actually wind
underneath<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.380> help<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.920> fabric<00:01:59.250> stay<00:01:59.430> in

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
underneath to to help the fabric stay in

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.520 
underneath to to help the fabric stay in
place<00:01:59.759> then<00:02:00.090> when<00:02:00.659> you're<00:02:00.810> using<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.320> for
