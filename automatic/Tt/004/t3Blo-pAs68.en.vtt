my<00:01:31.920> lockscreen<00:01:32.880> turn<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.900> sideways<00:01:34.340> it<00:01:35.340> goes

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
my lockscreen turn it sideways it goes

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.030 
my lockscreen turn it sideways it goes
sideways<00:01:36.560> like<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.780> bit

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
sideways like so this is a little bit

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.429 
sideways like so this is a little bit
buggy<00:01:41.040> guys<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.119> beta<00:01:42.439> that's

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
buggy guys because it is in beta that's

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.590 
buggy guys because it is in beta that's
why<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.920> sort<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:45.180> bit<00:01:45.299> glitchy

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
why it's sort of a little bit glitchy

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
why it's sort of a little bit glitchy
but<00:01:46.079> they<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.890> updates<00:01:47.100> for<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.700> guy

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
but they will have updates for this guy

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.469 
but they will have updates for this guy
so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.659> will<00:01:48.990> be<00:01:49.159> full<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.490> great<00:01:50.970> i<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
so it will be full and great i know you

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.460 
so it will be full and great i know you
guys<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.500> most<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.950> remember<00:01:54.470> SB

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
guys I think most of you remember SB

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.100 
guys I think most of you remember SB
rotator<00:01:55.950> which<00:01:56.250> rotates<00:01:57.090> your<00:01:57.360> springboard

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
rotator which rotates your springboard

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.469
