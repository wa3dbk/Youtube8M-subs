at<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.890> end<00:01:37.009> of<00:01:37.100> p3<00:01:37.610> but<00:01:38.450> anyway<00:01:38.900> um<00:01:39.170> I<00:01:39.560> just

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
at the end of p3 but anyway um I just

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.399 
at the end of p3 but anyway um I just
think<00:01:40.700> that<00:01:40.850> some<00:01:41.150> people<00:01:41.180> go<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.720> p3<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
think that some people go to p3 and

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.910 
think that some people go to p3 and
their<00:01:42.920> life<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:44.210> know<00:01:44.360> they<00:01:44.740> think<00:01:45.740> they<00:01:45.890> have

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
their life you know they think they have

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920 
their life you know they think they have
some<00:01:46.250> freedom<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:46.790> then<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.450> think<00:01:47.689> they<00:01:47.780> get<00:01:47.869> a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
some freedom and then I think they get a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.920 
some freedom and then I think they get a
little<00:01:48.020> carried<00:01:48.350> away<00:01:48.470> with<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:49.729> starches<00:01:50.509> or

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
little carried away with the starches or

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.350 
little carried away with the starches or
carbs<00:01:51.439> or<00:01:51.650> just<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.159> food<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.549> general<00:01:52.759> and

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
carbs or just the food in general and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.910 
carbs or just the food in general and
then<00:01:53.570> they<00:01:53.689> don't<00:01:53.810> exercise<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:54.650> of<00:01:54.770> course

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
then they don't exercise so of course

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.999 
then they don't exercise so of course
it's<00:01:55.159> going<00:01:55.189> to<00:01:55.400> stay<00:01:55.579> on<00:01:55.610> you<00:01:56.030> you<00:01:56.780> know<00:01:57.009> the

Saints exercise I don't think it's

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.429 
Saints exercise I don't think it's
