00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.300 

and<00:00:47.660> his<00:00:47.810> job<00:00:47.990> from<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:48.410> sinks<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:48.980> fourth

and his job from the sinks to the fourth
to<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.640> second<00:00:50.180> string

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.340 

voila<00:00:57.130> it's<00:00:58.130> good<00:00:58.309> stuff<00:00:58.809> very<00:00:59.809> comfortable

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
voila it's good stuff very comfortable

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.650 
voila it's good stuff very comfortable
to<00:01:00.559> at<00:01:01.100> least<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.610> know<00:01:01.730> for<00:01:02.059> that<00:01:02.150> fingering

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
to at least you know for that fingering

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.260 
to at least you know for that fingering
so<00:01:04.059> D<00:01:05.059> major<00:01:05.330> 7<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.440> major<00:01:06.650> 7th<00:01:07.160> arpeggio<00:01:07.850> in

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
so D major 7 the major 7th arpeggio in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.080 
so D major 7 the major 7th arpeggio in
case<00:01:08.450> you<00:01:08.630> don't<00:01:08.750> know<00:01:09.020> out<00:01:09.200> there<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.800> 1st

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
case you don't know out there is the 1st

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:20.680 
case you don't know out there is the 1st
3rd<00:01:11.090> 5th<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.729> 7th<00:01:13.729> note<00:01:19.210> what<00:01:20.210> we're<00:01:20.330> gonna<00:01:20.450> do

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
3rd 5th and 7th note what we're gonna do

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.280 
3rd 5th and 7th note what we're gonna do
then<00:01:20.899> for<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.800> first<00:01:22.100> shape<00:01:22.869> we're<00:01:23.869> going<00:01:24.110> to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
then for the first shape we're going to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.800 
then for the first shape we're going to
have<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.100> last<00:01:25.369> no<00:01:25.700> it'd<00:01:25.850> be<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.210> root<00:01:26.390> so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
have the last no it'd be the root so

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.550 
have the last no it'd be the root so
I'll<00:01:26.990> start<00:01:27.290> on<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.530> 3rd<00:01:27.770> 3rd<00:01:29.110> go<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.350> 5th

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
I'll start on the 3rd 3rd go to the 5th

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:40.740 
I'll start on the 3rd 3rd go to the 5th
and<00:01:31.399> then<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.640> 7<00:01:32.440> so<00:01:33.440> you<00:01:33.470> got<00:01:33.680> this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.330 

and<00:01:41.750> you<00:01:41.840> saw<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.200> just<00:01:42.470> displaced<00:01:42.920> it<00:01:43.160> in<00:01:43.250> two

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
and you saw I just displaced it in two

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.390 
and you saw I just displaced it in two
octaves<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:46.610> next<00:01:46.850> one<00:01:47.830> will<00:01:48.830> start<00:01:49.130> on

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
octaves so the next one will start on

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.200 
octaves so the next one will start on
the<00:01:49.910> fifth<00:01:50.150> then<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.260> would<00:01:51.410> have<00:01:51.560> fifth

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
the fifth then I would have fifth

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:05.400 
the fifth then I would have fifth
seventh<00:01:53.210> root<00:01:55.480> third<00:01:56.620> that<00:01:57.620> was<00:01:57.770> pretty<00:01:57.980> comfy

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.320 

you<00:02:06.410> probably<00:02:06.650> hear<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.830> lot<00:02:07.010> of<00:02:07.330> shredders

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
you probably hear a lot of shredders

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:16.930 
you probably hear a lot of shredders
play<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:13.340> next<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:15.670> starts<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.820> the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
play that the next one starts on the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.520 
play that the next one starts on the
seventh<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.510> this<00:02:17.630> one<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:17.990> by<00:02:18.170> far<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
seventh and this one is by far the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.800 
seventh and this one is by far the
comfiest<00:02:19.220> one<00:02:19.670> you're<00:02:20.000> likely<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.510> come

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
comfiest one you're likely to come

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.660 
comfiest one you're likely to come
across<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:23.630> have<00:02:23.840> seven<00:02:24.470> one<00:02:25.010> three

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
across and so you have seven one three

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.360 
across and so you have seven one three
five

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.740 

and<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.580> next<00:02:34.760> one<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.239> probably<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
and the next one is probably the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.039 
and the next one is probably the
trickiest<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.370> major<00:02:37.640> seventh<00:02:38.360> or<00:02:38.629> to

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
trickiest of the major seventh or to

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.660 
trickiest of the major seventh or to
note<00:02:39.290> for<00:02:39.500> string<00:02:39.739> are<00:02:39.860> pages<00:02:40.540> where<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.569> have

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
note for string are pages where I have

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.000 
note for string are pages where I have
one<00:02:43.670> three<00:02:44.330> five<00:02:45.110> seven

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
one three five seven

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:57.009 
one three five seven
so<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.640> would<00:02:46.790> be<00:02:46.819> root<00:02:47.120> position<00:02:55.870> there<00:02:56.870> you

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
so that would be root position there you

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.350 
so that would be root position there you
go<00:02:58.780> where<00:02:59.780> we<00:02:59.930> started<00:03:00.260> from<00:03:01.209> starting<00:03:02.209> on<00:03:02.299> the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
go where we started from starting on the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:12.220 
go where we started from starting on the
third<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.910> those<00:03:08.870> are<00:03:09.079> good<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.590> you<00:03:10.489> can<00:03:11.230> you

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
third so those are good and you can you

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.180 
third so those are good and you can you
could<00:03:12.410> play<00:03:12.590> any<00:03:12.620> seventh<00:03:13.510> chord<00:03:14.510> arpeggio

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
could play any seventh chord arpeggio

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.550 
could play any seventh chord arpeggio
using<00:03:16.190> those<00:03:16.340> shapes<00:03:17.109> instead<00:03:18.109> of<00:03:18.349> major

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
using those shapes instead of major

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.150 
using those shapes instead of major
seven<00:03:19.129> I<00:03:20.950> can<00:03:21.950> play<00:03:22.099> a<00:03:22.129> dominant<00:03:22.430> seventh

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.480 

and<00:03:27.570> spec<00:03:28.570> flatting<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.020> seventh<00:03:29.460> like<00:03:30.460> a

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
and spec flatting the seventh like a

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.520 
and spec flatting the seventh like a

sequence that I like to do with that

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.480 
sequence that I like to do with that
comfy<00:03:45.480> one<00:03:48.170> basically<00:03:49.170> where<00:03:50.100> I'll<00:03:50.220> play<00:03:50.460> a

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
comfy one basically where I'll play a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:04:02.000 
comfy one basically where I'll play a
slow<00:03:50.820> first<00:03:59.510> and<00:04:00.510> also<00:04:00.990> employing<00:04:01.380> hybrid

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
slow first and also employing hybrid

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.510 
slow first and also employing hybrid
picking

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.090 

I<00:04:07.580> use<00:04:08.090> hybrid<00:04:08.300> picking<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.780> lot<00:04:09.050> when<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:09.920> have

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
I use hybrid picking a lot when I have

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.949 
I use hybrid picking a lot when I have
to<00:04:10.250> play<00:04:10.430> between<00:04:10.640> strings<00:04:11.270> as<00:04:11.510> opposed<00:04:11.870> to

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
to play between strings as opposed to

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.870 
to play between strings as opposed to
alternate<00:04:12.440> picking<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:13.100> kind<00:04:13.340> of<00:04:13.430> developed

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
alternate picking just kind of developed

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.970 
alternate picking just kind of developed
over<00:04:14.030> time

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.810 

yeah<00:04:21.220> so<00:04:22.380> that's<00:04:23.380> pretty<00:04:23.680> groovy<00:04:23.980> I'll<00:04:24.580> take

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
yeah so that's pretty groovy I'll take

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.310 
yeah so that's pretty groovy I'll take
it<00:04:24.970> up<00:04:25.090> again<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.630> I'll<00:04:25.690> finish<00:04:25.930> with<00:04:26.170> that

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
it up again and I'll finish with that

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:39.860 
it up again and I'll finish with that
tapping<00:04:28.650> pattern<00:04:33.660> let's<00:04:34.660> try<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.900> again

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.060 

so<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:40.930> can<00:04:41.110> stretch<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:41.350> out<00:04:41.590> like<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:41.860> saw<00:04:42.040> me

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
so I can stretch it out like you saw me

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:54.960 
so I can stretch it out like you saw me
to<00:04:42.250> do<00:04:42.340> a<00:04:42.370> little<00:04:42.610> bit<00:04:42.730> before<00:04:50.310> not<00:04:51.310> bad<00:04:51.960> enjoy
