a big debate here you know there's so

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.050 
a big debate here you know there's so
many<00:02:32.800> other<00:02:33.069> things<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.730> they're<00:02:33.849> putting

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
many other things that they're putting

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.390

on that tray outside of the chocolate

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.040 
on that tray outside of the chocolate
milk<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.880> think<00:02:37.180> maybe<00:02:37.360> we<00:02:37.510> need<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.810> start

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
milk that I think maybe we need to start

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.630 
milk that I think maybe we need to start
there<00:02:38.319> I<00:02:38.500> think<00:02:38.739> the<00:02:38.800> chocolate<00:02:39.040> milk<00:02:39.370> is<00:02:39.519> the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
there I think the chocolate milk is the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.869 
there I think the chocolate milk is the
least<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.180> their<00:02:40.360> worries<00:02:40.390> yeah<00:02:41.610> yeah<00:02:42.610> well
