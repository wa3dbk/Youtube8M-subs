00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
think it's time that I switch to another

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
think it's time that I switch to another
carrier<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.430> American<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:38.940> united<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
carrier like American are united and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
carrier like American are united and
this<00:00:40.110> question<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> know<00:00:40.710> New<00:00:40.860> York<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.129> have

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
this question you know New York we have

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
this question you know New York we have
a<00:00:41.340> lot<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.610> options<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.930> first

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
a lot of options so I think the first

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.569 
a lot of options so I think the first
thing<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> geographically<00:00:44.100> where<00:00:44.370> do<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
thing is geographically where do you

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.069 
thing is geographically where do you
live<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.850> New<00:00:44.879> York<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.840> switch<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

United they're moving all their JFK

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
United they're moving all their JFK
flights<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.239> newark<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.500> be

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
flights to newark is that going to be

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.650 
flights to newark is that going to be
convenient<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:51.239> it's<00:00:51.480> not

hour to your commute I think you have to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.450 
hour to your commute I think you have to
factor<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.829> cost-benefit

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
factor that into the cost-benefit

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.099 
factor that into the cost-benefit
analysis<00:00:56.910> yes<00:00:57.180> united<00:00:57.480> miles<00:00:57.780> are<00:00:57.960> more

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
analysis yes united miles are more

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.439 
analysis yes united miles are more
valuable<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:59.309> isn't<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.609> time<00:00:59.879> worth<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.300> lot

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
valuable but isn't your time worth a lot

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.720 
valuable but isn't your time worth a lot
more<00:01:00.480> Delta's<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> great<00:01:01.579> amount<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
more Delta's got a great amount of

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.149 
more Delta's got a great amount of
traffic<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.500> LaGuardia<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.890> big<00:01:05.040> new

traffic out of LaGuardia and a big new
terminal<00:01:05.519> JFK<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.299> have<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.540> of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
changing your flights which can save a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
changing your flights which can save a
lot<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.509> money<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.740> American<00:01:35.130> but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
lot of money so I like American but

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.880 
lot of money so I like American but
American<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.939> lower<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> mid<00:01:36.570> tears

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
American at the lower and mid tears

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.109 
American at the lower and mid tears
isn't<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.159> great<00:01:38.400> in<00:01:38.549> my<00:01:38.640> opinion<00:01:38.670> so

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
isn't really that great in my opinion so

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.630 
isn't really that great in my opinion so
I<00:01:39.150> would<00:01:39.360> say<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.600> you're<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.900> mid<00:01:40.049> tears

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
I would say if you're in the mid tears

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.679 
I would say if you're in the mid tears
you<00:01:41.640> know<00:01:41.729> Delta<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.119> not<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> worst<00:01:42.509> option

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
you know Delta is not the worst option

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.539 
you know Delta is not the worst option

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
yes they're devaluing but the beautiful

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.580 
yes they're devaluing but the beautiful
thing<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.229> airline

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
thing about that is this the airline

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.310 
thing about that is this the airline
that<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.890> fly<00:01:47.250> doesn't<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that you fly doesn't have to be the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.630

airline that you collect all your miles
in<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.180> recommend<00:01:51.479> diversify<00:01:52.380> get<00:01:52.680> other

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
in I would recommend diversify get other

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.160 
in I would recommend diversify get other
credit<00:01:53.220> cards<00:01:53.520> sapphire<00:01:54.329> preferred<00:01:54.570> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
credit cards sapphire preferred to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.230 
credit cards sapphire preferred to
diversify<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.189> able<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.369> transfer<00:01:56.820> United
