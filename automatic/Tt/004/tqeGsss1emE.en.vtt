00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.750
 hello let's continue with the cooking course for students watching the 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.199
 The last part of the course is the winter menu 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.499
 of first course we have a zucchini purÃ©e 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.300
 let's see how it's done 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.920
 to do it we will need the zucchini a good and good potato 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.439
 the quesitos if you do not have that if we can all use saints cheese 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.300
 think people 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.760
 to be able to make this recipe 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.830
 let's use a frying pan 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.830
 A mixer 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.610
 the first thing we have to make wake of the zucchini and potato and placed 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.710
 in a pot to hurt them 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.090
 we gave him a little salt for the wolf pyro 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.290
 almost better to take with salt than to throw it afterwards when it's time to beat 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.390
 so 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.490
 we throw a little salt and important very little water 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.920
 you have to steam it because the water is going to catch the taste of the zucchini 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.300
 icon we are not going to pass the glass beater we can use this water 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.110
 to throw it too 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.110
 and that is not also made no longer a little heavier 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.760
 we have here the zucchini and the potato to see the water level 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.980
 and we put him there 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.110
 then love the onion and we associate it to put it in a pan 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.260
 with very little to pee suffer 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.780
 here we see the pan with the oil and the onion at this point we add a 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.080
 little bit of water so that it is plastered a little and does not stay 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.100
 Panseca at the time of friction 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.350
 first the water will evaporate then with the curfew is expected to be left 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.660
 this way we have to keep an eye on the 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.350
 when we see that this one does 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.350
 we do not have to go through the line so it stays crispy 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.440
 and we retired well 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.070
 when we have cooked or the zucchini and parota we have to go down 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.320
 so 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.150
 punctured sentenced to check if the potato is already cooked when we see that 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.340
 the potato can be punctured we remove 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.660
 the not to do it is with a spoon we will go passing the pieces to the beaten glass 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.940
 when we have already won them all the shake glass they will be left in the pot 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.930
 this water as it has all the flavor of it the zucchini we can throw it if not 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.359
 it's a lot in the glass, whipped up as much as we can for what was left, something not so 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.349
 dense and we beat 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.310
 now we add the quesitos and we beat again as we have said the quesitos 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.189
 you can start of any kind 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.489
 not as long as they are from their controls 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.589
 we beat, we live like in the bottom of the beating glass, the cheese is seen 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.279
 giving the puree and consistency to the mash 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:45.189
 and to finish we add the onion israel move with the same mixer 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.369
 eye you do not have to have it long because it exhibits scam onion on plain 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.999
 we will achieve the goal of we wanted that was to leave the crispy 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.639
 a little to mix that onion with the rest of the mash 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.729
 ours for the zucchini ready to take 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:03.359
 We hope you like it
