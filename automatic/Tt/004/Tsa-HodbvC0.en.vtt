 Regular parliament 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.490
 It is a condition such as where the mountain and the sea can be done 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:29.099
 The destination of the mountain today is also decided, among them 80,000 people 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.069
 of course 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.069
 I want to go around 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.090

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.870
 wind 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.940
 I can not get it sideways, it's a traffic texture 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.390
 Furthermore it is this form 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.310
 A temporary blackout in front of you This demonstrates one of the measures to prevent splashing 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.400
 It might have been the next time 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.240
 It became Ozeki 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.910
 Sukagawa 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.870
 And there is no one 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.290

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.170
 Wreck 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.550
 Therefore the castle 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.500
 1. 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.960
 If you come to Ozeki 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.580
 A man has come for night on white 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.580
 Live attendance 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.580
