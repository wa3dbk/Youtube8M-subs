00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.870 

I<00:02:51.970> mean<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:53.440> doesn't<00:02:53.800> have<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.280> sense<00:02:54.460> of<00:02:54.700> like

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
I mean it doesn't have the sense of like

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.820

I<00:02:55.060> mean<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.600> don't<00:02:55.960> think<00:02:56.080> anyone's<00:02:56.470> ever<00:02:56.530> gonna

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
I mean I don't think anyone's ever gonna

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.860 
I mean I don't think anyone's ever gonna
touch<00:02:57.160> like<00:02:57.430> Heath<00:02:57.640> Ledger's<00:02:58.000> Joker<00:02:58.030> in<00:02:58.600> terms

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
touch like Heath Ledger's Joker in terms

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.290 
touch like Heath Ledger's Joker in terms
of<00:02:59.050> just<00:02:59.290> some<00:02:59.800> larger-than-life<00:03:00.640> character

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
of just some larger-than-life character

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.520 
of just some larger-than-life character
but<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:03.670> place<00:03:04.090> of<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.810> for<00:03:05.080> this<00:03:05.170> movie<00:03:05.470> I

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
but in place of that for this movie I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.100 
but in place of that for this movie I
think<00:03:05.740> the<00:03:05.890> true<00:03:06.160> star<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.300> this<00:03:07.630> story<00:03:07.959> that

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
think the true star is this story that

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.360 
think the true star is this story that
they've<00:03:08.380> developed<00:03:08.650> it's<00:03:08.980> got<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> lot<00:03:09.340> of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
they've developed it's got a lot of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.510 
they've developed it's got a lot of
moving<00:03:09.610> parts<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:11.410> they<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.070> everything

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
moving parts and they and everything

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.670 
moving parts and they and everything
kind<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.880> gets<00:03:13.030> tied<00:03:13.480> together<00:03:13.660> nicely<00:03:14.080> so

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
kind of gets tied together nicely so

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.510 
kind of gets tied together nicely so
