gonna show you panel lines I did this
about<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.490> year<00:00:11.940> ago<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.540> well<00:00:12.780> but<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:13.740> a

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
about a year ago as well but that was a

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.820 
about a year ago as well but that was a
pretty<00:00:14.099> bad<00:00:14.370> video<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.809> thought<00:00:15.870> I'd<00:00:16.260> tackle

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
pretty bad video so I thought I'd tackle

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.210 
pretty bad video so I thought I'd tackle
this<00:00:17.070> again<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.230> hope<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.560> one<00:00:19.740> works<00:00:20.010> out

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
this again and hope this one works out

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.380 
this again and hope this one works out
better

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
better

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.409 
better
the<00:00:22.660> basics<00:00:23.170> is<00:00:23.529> just<00:00:24.160> to<00:00:24.340> put<00:00:24.580> paint<00:00:25.000> in<00:00:25.269> the

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
the basics is just to put paint in the

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.109 
the basics is just to put paint in the
panel<00:00:25.720> lines<00:00:26.099> over<00:00:27.099> the<00:00:27.220> edge<00:00:27.400> as<00:00:27.609> well<00:00:27.820> and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
panel lines over the edge as well and

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.710 
panel lines over the edge as well and
then<00:00:28.300> just<00:00:28.329> wipe<00:00:29.140> it<00:00:29.410> off<00:00:29.590> with<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.800> q-tip<00:00:30.130> or

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
then just wipe it off with a q-tip or

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.630 
then just wipe it off with a q-tip or
something<00:00:31.720> else<00:00:31.899> that<00:00:32.199> doesn't<00:00:32.710> scratch<00:00:33.579> the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
something else that doesn't scratch the

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:54.560 
something else that doesn't scratch the
paint

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.360 

I<00:00:54.770> use<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:56.160> humbrol<00:00:56.700> acrylic<00:00:57.690> paints<00:00:58.050> that's

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
I use some humbrol acrylic paints that's

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.000 
I use some humbrol acrylic paints that's
water-based<00:00:59.370> I<00:01:00.020> basically<00:01:01.020> used<00:01:01.350> water-based

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
water-based I basically used water-based

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.110 
water-based I basically used water-based
so<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.870> if<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.110> goes<00:01:04.290> wrong<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:04.970> wipe<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:06.120 
so that if it goes wrong I can wipe it

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.990 
so that if it goes wrong I can wipe it
off<00:01:06.300> with<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.720> water<00:01:06.990> or<00:01:07.430> just<00:01:08.430> scrape<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
off with some water or just scrape it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.120 
off with some water or just scrape it
off<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.690> doesn't<00:01:10.290> really<00:01:10.409> stick<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
off but it doesn't really stick that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.770 
off but it doesn't really stick that
well<00:01:11.600> if<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.810> hasn't<00:01:13.170> completely<00:01:13.320> cured<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
well if it hasn't completely cured and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.870 
well if it hasn't completely cured and
also<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> advantage<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.680> when<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.670> put

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
also the advantage is that when you put

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.380 
also the advantage is that when you put
it<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:19.020> dries<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.590> about<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.190> minute<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it on it dries in about a minute and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.830 
it on it dries in about a minute and
then<00:01:21.530> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.740> its<00:01:23.310> touch<00:01:23.580> dry<00:01:23.910> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> can

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
then you can its touch dry and you can

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.399 
then you can its touch dry and you can
work<00:01:25.140> with<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.530> rest<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.800> the<00:01:25.920> model<00:01:26.190> as<00:01:26.280> well

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.390 

you<00:01:35.040> could<00:01:35.400> also<00:01:35.729> use<00:01:36.270> some<00:01:36.659> enamel<00:01:37.439> paints<00:01:37.830> or

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you could also use some enamel paints or

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.660 
you could also use some enamel paints or
thinner<00:01:39.060> based<00:01:39.330> inks<00:01:39.689> or<00:01:39.840> whatever<00:01:40.490> since<00:01:41.490> I

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
thinner based inks or whatever since I

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.109 
thinner based inks or whatever since I
painted<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.720> model<00:01:43.080> with<00:01:43.200> 2k<00:01:43.440> clear<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.250> let

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
painted this model with 2k clear and let

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.310 
painted this model with 2k clear and let
it<00:01:45.240> dry<00:01:45.479> well<00:01:45.780> enough<00:01:46.080> for<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.950> week

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
it dry well enough for about a week

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.870 
it dry well enough for about a week
attacking<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.470> some<00:01:49.830> dinners<00:01:50.460> wouldn't

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
attacking it with some dinners wouldn't

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.789 
attacking it with some dinners wouldn't
hurt<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.270> things<00:01:51.479> as<00:01:51.840> long<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.440> wipe<00:01:52.619> it

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
hurt the things as long as you wipe it

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.010 
hurt the things as long as you wipe it
off<00:01:52.950> fast<00:01:53.640> enough<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:54.210> leave<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.690> on<00:01:54.960> for

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
off fast enough and then leave it on for

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.580 
off fast enough and then leave it on for
hours<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.770> hours

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.060 

as<00:02:03.070> you<00:02:03.579> can<00:02:03.729> see<00:02:04.000> I<00:02:04.030> used<00:02:04.540> some<00:02:04.810> black<00:02:05.070> you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
as you can see I used some black you

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.120 
as you can see I used some black you
could<00:02:06.280> also<00:02:06.490> use<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.360> gray<00:02:07.750> or<00:02:08.080> mix<00:02:08.679> up<00:02:08.860> your<00:02:08.890> own

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
could also use a gray or mix up your own

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.360 
could also use a gray or mix up your own
color<00:02:09.429> depending<00:02:10.030> on<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.360> body<00:02:10.509> part<00:02:11.370> perhaps

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
color depending on the body part perhaps

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.660 
color depending on the body part perhaps
on<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:13.270> white<00:02:13.660> body<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.440> was<00:02:14.650> not<00:02:14.980> really<00:02:15.310> one

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
on a white body it was not really one

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.420 
on a white body it was not really one
who<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.000> black<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:16.750> more<00:02:17.470> at<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.860> light<00:02:18.069> gray

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
who is black but more at the light gray

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:33.809 
who is black but more at the light gray
or<00:02:18.780> really<00:02:19.780> dark<00:02:20.050> white

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.270 

also<00:02:34.810> when<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.319> are<00:02:35.439> applying<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.950> paint

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
also when you are applying the paint

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.880 
also when you are applying the paint
with<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.640> brush<00:02:36.790> make<00:02:37.360> sure<00:02:37.659> you<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.109> into

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
with the brush make sure you get into

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.420 
with the brush make sure you get into
the<00:02:38.980> panel<00:02:39.340> eyes<00:02:39.519> really<00:02:40.269> deep<00:02:41.040> because<00:02:42.040> when

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
the panel eyes really deep because when

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.390 
the panel eyes really deep because when
you<00:02:42.579> just<00:02:42.879> lay<00:02:43.420> it<00:02:43.540> over<00:02:43.719> it<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.590> won't<00:02:44.859> get<00:02:45.159> in

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
you just lay it over it it won't get in

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.089 
you just lay it over it it won't get in
the<00:02:45.489> panel<00:02:45.819> lines<00:02:45.969> as<00:02:46.209> well<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.920> might

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
the panel lines as well and you might

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.610 
the panel lines as well and you might
have<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.400> re<00:02:49.120> add<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.629> couple<00:02:49.870> of<00:02:50.019> times<00:02:50.260> or

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
have to re add it a couple of times or

00:02:50.620 --> 00:03:48.360 
have to re add it a couple of times or
do<00:02:51.099> it<00:02:51.280> over<00:02:51.579> again

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.730 

also<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.430> need<00:03:49.640> to<00:03:49.700> keep<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.210> mind<00:03:50.240> to<00:03:51.170> not<00:03:51.380> do

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
also you need to keep in mind to not do

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.840 
also you need to keep in mind to not do
really<00:03:52.280> big<00:03:52.520> sections<00:03:53.090> at<00:03:53.240> one<00:03:54.490> for<00:03:55.490> instance

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
really big sections at one for instance

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
really big sections at one for instance
around<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.780> window<00:03:57.110> trimmer<00:03:57.380> you<00:03:57.560> could<00:03:57.770> do

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
around the window trimmer you could do

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.250 
around the window trimmer you could do
it<00:03:58.160> all<00:03:58.370> at<00:03:58.520> once<00:03:58.730> but<00:03:59.090> with<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> feint<00:04:00.020> I'm

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
it all at once but with the feint I'm

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.760 
it all at once but with the feint I'm
using<00:04:00.730> when<00:04:01.730> you<00:04:01.850> go<00:04:02.030> around<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.870> eventually

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
using when you go around and eventually

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.520 
using when you go around and eventually
start<00:04:04.070> working<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.610> up<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.600> paint<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:06.230> where

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
start working it up the paint that where

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.830 
start working it up the paint that where
you<00:04:06.650> where<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.370> started<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.880> apply<00:04:08.270> it<00:04:08.330> will

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
you where you started to apply it will

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.460 
you where you started to apply it will
already<00:04:09.110> be<00:04:09.350> dry<00:04:10.000> now<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:11.930> is<00:04:12.200> not<00:04:12.440> really

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
already be dry now this is not really

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.340 
already be dry now this is not really
that<00:04:12.860> big<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.250> a<00:04:13.430> problem<00:04:13.460> but<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.840> does<00:04:15.110> get<00:04:15.290> a

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
that big of a problem but it does get a

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:44.890 
that big of a problem but it does get a
little<00:04:15.560> harder<00:04:16.040> to<00:04:16.280> remove<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.760> paint

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.860 

it's<00:04:45.770> also<00:04:46.160> very<00:04:46.610> important<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.390> switch<00:04:47.540> out

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
it's also very important to switch out

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.900 
it's also very important to switch out
q-tips<00:04:48.470> every<00:04:49.070> once<00:04:49.280> in<00:04:49.400> a<00:04:49.490> while<00:04:49.550> because

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
q-tips every once in a while because

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.820 
q-tips every once in a while because
they<00:04:50.660> do<00:04:50.720> fill<00:04:51.140> up<00:04:51.260> with<00:04:51.440> paint

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
they do fill up with paint

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.820 
they do fill up with paint
and<00:04:52.120> they<00:04:53.120> won't<00:04:53.330> remove<00:04:53.810> any<00:04:54.110> more<00:04:54.350> paint<00:04:54.650> if

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
and they won't remove any more paint if

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:50.179 
and they won't remove any more paint if
it's<00:04:55.010> all<00:04:55.190> filled<00:04:55.460> up

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:53.329 

the<00:05:50.939> first<00:05:51.209> side<00:05:51.479> is<00:05:51.509> now<00:05:51.809> completed<00:05:52.439> and<00:05:52.709> I'm

00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:53.339 
the first side is now completed and I'm

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:54.799 
the first side is now completed and I'm
going<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.639> show<00:05:53.819> you<00:05:53.879> the<00:05:54.089> second<00:05:54.449> side<00:05:54.629> as

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:54.809 
going to show you the second side as

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.059 
going to show you the second side as
well<00:05:54.989> but<00:05:55.259> this<00:05:55.559> is<00:05:55.619> going<00:05:55.889> to<00:05:55.949> be<00:05:56.039> a

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
well but this is going to be a

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.279 
well but this is going to be a
fast-forward<00:05:56.639> because<00:05:57.479> it<00:05:57.719> might<00:05:58.020> get<00:05:58.229> a

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
fast-forward because it might get a

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.369 
fast-forward because it might get a
little<00:05:58.589> boring<00:05:58.830> if<00:05:59.219> I<00:05:59.369> just<00:05:59.610> show<00:06:00.539> two<00:06:01.019> sides

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
little boring if I just show two sides

00:06:01.379 --> 00:07:25.970 
little boring if I just show two sides
and<00:06:01.769> it<00:06:02.399> won't<00:06:02.639> take<00:06:02.789> too<00:06:02.849> long

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.620
