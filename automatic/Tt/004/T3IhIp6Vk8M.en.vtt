00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.990
 how has this situation been that I lived 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.600
 let's continue in the help race and the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 recovery to get back to the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.189
 highly competitive cycling that has been 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.289
 at the beginning difficult truth because apart 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.829
 it has been a year it was a very hard year 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.119
 2014 for me I was already getting a 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:30.540
 little bit fit and good for 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.290
 surprise of mine is a fall that thanks to 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 God took as cheap as say 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.890
 because I had until she stay for 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 all there good you have to see the finger 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.519
 index of the right hand and I think that that 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.530
 I was lucky rather it has been a 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.050
 recovery a bit slow because 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.860
 was circulation will be a very 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.020
 important hand today 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.110
 it's a bit slow to recover but good 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.700
 he had the patience that was needed 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.700
 that we exceed one hundred percent 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.770
 well could you tell us right now of 2014 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.560
 15 starts with new tour winds 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.450
 from san luis what is that objective for 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.000
 let's say for you for the team and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.110
 for all your relatives and hopes to do 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.880
 on the tour of san luis really 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.880
 I would love to be in town 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:40.429
 but in the key moments of the race 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.710
 we're going to be there but that's what he's going to do 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.990
 I think the mentality is already so 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.360
 important we carry it the preparation has 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.030

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.020
 to start the year well 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.270
 account to the public as we say the 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.159
 workouts or good preparation in 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.729

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:12.890
 physical that is the same and a little bit a little 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:21.079
 more than three travel bicycle 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:23.299
