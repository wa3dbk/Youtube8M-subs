the<00:01:12.360> course<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> year<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:14.130> wanted

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the course of a year and and we wanted

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.039 
the course of a year and and we wanted

to kind of show you how much of this

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
to kind of show you how much of this
stuff<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.560> eat<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.040> have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> demonstration

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
stuff you eat so we have a demonstration

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.929 
stuff you eat so we have a demonstration
we<00:01:18.090> calculate<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.110> eat<00:01:19.259> about<00:01:19.380> 59<00:01:20.040> pounds<00:01:20.430> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
we calculate you eat about 59 pounds of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.050 
we calculate you eat about 59 pounds of
of<00:01:21.930> this<00:01:22.380> clay<00:01:22.710> over<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> course<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.030> year

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of this clay over the course of a year

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.109 
of this clay over the course of a year
and<00:01:24.479> that's<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.869> 59<00:01:25.470> pounds<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.790> stuff

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
and that's what 59 pounds of this stuff

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.380 
and that's what 59 pounds of this stuff
looks<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.320> mean<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.590> cannot<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.400> good

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
looks like I mean this cannot be good

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.080 
looks like I mean this cannot be good
for<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:32.280> it's<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.850> interesting

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
for you and it's it's interesting

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.179 
for you and it's it's interesting
because<00:01:33.540> individuals<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.500> suffer<00:01:34.829> from

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
because individuals that suffer from

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.490 
because individuals that suffer from
what<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.549> call<00:01:35.729> gia<00:01:36.060> Fuji<00:01:36.540> which<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.079> eating

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
what we call gia Fuji which is eating

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
what we call gia Fuji which is eating
things<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.799> soils<00:01:38.340> or<00:01:38.549> dirts<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.180> of

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
things like soils or dirts and all of

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.819 
things like soils or dirts and all of
those<00:01:39.420> kind<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> things<00:01:39.750> sometimes<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
those kind of things sometimes is

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.010 
those kind of things sometimes is
actually<00:01:41.040> cultural<00:01:42.030> where<00:01:42.600> different

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
actually cultural where different

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
actually cultural where different
cultures<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.829> very<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.640> norm<00:01:44.970> and

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
cultures this is very much the norm and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.940 
cultures this is very much the norm and
we<00:01:45.210> wouldn't<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:46.110> wouldn't<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> diagnosable

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
we wouldn't it wouldn't be a diagnosable

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.940 
we wouldn't it wouldn't be a diagnosable
thing<00:01:47.430> but<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.600> alarming<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.770> to
