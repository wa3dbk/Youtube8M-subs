of<00:00:41.040> us<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> close<00:00:41.760> proximity<00:00:42.000> also<00:00:42.960> means

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of us so the close proximity also means

of us so the close proximity also means
less<00:00:43.829> swell<00:00:44.460> decay<00:00:44.820> over<00:00:45.030> time<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.660> eight<00:00:46.440> to

cranking and we are stoked I will take a
look<00:01:47.970> at<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> swell<00:01:48.360> period<00:01:48.840> generated<00:01:49.530> by

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.679 
look at the swell period generated by
some<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.040> these<00:01:50.130> systems<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:51.180> current<00:01:51.479> one

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
some of these systems the current one

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.719 
some of these systems the current one
today<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> disappointment<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.640> were

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
today was a disappointment we were

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.609 
today was a disappointment we were
hoping<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.060> four<00:01:54.479> maybe<00:01:54.780> five<00:01:54.869> feet<00:01:55.110> out<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
hoping for four maybe five feet out of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.770 
hoping for four maybe five feet out of
the<00:01:55.770> Northwest<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.969> was<00:01:57.060> only<00:01:57.240> three<00:01:57.570> feet

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the Northwest it was only three feet

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.709 
the Northwest it was only three feet
maybe<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.320> plus<00:01:59.270> definitely<00:02:00.270> wednesday<00:02:00.479> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
maybe a plus definitely wednesday is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
maybe a plus definitely wednesday is
going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> day<00:02:01.320> right<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:02.070> then

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
going to be the day right there and then

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.480 
going to be the day right there and then
the<00:02:03.000> big<00:02:03.450> bigger<00:02:03.840> event<00:02:04.229> right<00:02:04.409> there<00:02:04.710> on

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the big bigger event right there on

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.850 
the big bigger event right there on
saturday<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.320> big<00:02:07.619> one

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
saturday and then the really big one

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.609 
saturday and then the really big one
right<00:02:08.069> there<00:02:08.670> coming<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> look<00:02:10.470> at

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
right there coming in take a look at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.440 
right there coming in take a look at
those<00:02:10.739> slow<00:02:10.979> period<00:02:11.340> swell<00:02:11.610> trains<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
those slow period swell trains and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.820 
those slow period swell trains and
against<00:02:12.900> what<00:02:13.080> periods<00:02:13.530> are

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
against what periods are

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400 
against what periods are
servet<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> value<00:02:14.820> swell<00:02:15.540> Heights<00:02:15.840> lose<00:02:16.110> half

approximately<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.140> swell<00:02:22.380> periods<00:02:22.920> remain

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
approximately the swell periods remain

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.370 
approximately the swell periods remain
rather<00:02:23.790> constant<00:02:24.390> that's<00:02:24.600> why<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:25.020> can<00:02:25.200> get

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
rather constant that's why we can get

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.400 
rather constant that's why we can get
swells<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:26.670> 20<00:02:27.030> seconds<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.630> six<00:02:28.020> feet<00:02:28.230> from

Wednesday Thursday again we are these

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.590 
Wednesday Thursday again we are these
systems<00:02:44.520> are<00:02:44.610> getting<00:02:44.850> close<00:02:45.060> enough<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.480> us

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
systems are getting close enough to us

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.330 
systems are getting close enough to us
to<00:02:45.750> break<00:02:46.020> up<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.470> trade<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.070> pattern

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
to break up the trade one pattern

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.790 
to break up the trade one pattern
leading<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.210> an<00:02:48.300> East<00:02:48.510> Southeast<00:02:49.020> flow<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
leading to an East Southeast flow to the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.370 
leading to an East Southeast flow to the
winds<00:02:50.270> there<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.360> go<00:02:51.480> see<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.840> system<00:02:52.200> right

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
winds there you go see that system right

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.010 
winds there you go see that system right
there<00:02:52.590> yeah<00:02:53.130> that's<00:02:53.340> an<00:02:53.459> out<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.610> season

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
there yeah that's an out of season

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.100 
there yeah that's an out of season
winter<00:02:55.020> caliber<00:02:55.620> system<00:02:56.520> although<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.450> track

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
winter caliber system although the track

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.750 
winter caliber system although the track
by<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.470> time<00:02:58.770> it<00:02:58.950> gets<00:02:59.070> out<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.459> east<00:02:59.670> of

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
by the time it gets out to the east of

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.120 
by the time it gets out to the east of
New<00:02:59.910> Zealand<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.390> weakens<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.110> moves<00:03:01.890> more

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
New Zealand it weakens and moves more

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.250 
New Zealand it weakens and moves more
zonal<00:03:02.670> or<00:03:02.820> west<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.180> east<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.660> we're<00:03:04.080> not

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
zonal or west to east so we're not

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.110 
zonal or west to east so we're not
expecting<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.890> whole<00:03:04.920> lot<00:03:05.280> from<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.490> that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
expecting a whole lot from that that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.990 
expecting a whole lot from that that
would<00:03:06.270> be<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.420> run<00:03:06.660> februari<00:03:07.530> 5th<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.760> at<00:03:08.910> least

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
would be a run februari 5th but at least

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.870 
would be a run februari 5th but at least
we're<00:03:09.540> keeping<00:03:09.900> an<00:03:10.140> eye<00:03:10.290> on<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.800> then<00:03:11.730> that

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
we're keeping an eye on it and then that

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.370 
we're keeping an eye on it and then that
one<00:03:12.060> tracks<00:03:12.300> down<00:03:12.480> into<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.900> Ross<00:03:13.080> Ice<00:03:13.320> Shelf

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
one tracks down into the Ross Ice Shelf

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.660 
one tracks down into the Ross Ice Shelf
we're<00:03:13.830> not<00:03:13.920> going<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.130> see<00:03:14.220> anything<00:03:14.430> from

we're not going to see anything from

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.240 
we're not going to see anything from
that<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.390> I'm<00:03:15.630> sorry<00:03:15.840> this<00:03:16.080> one<00:03:16.290> if<00:03:16.620> it'll<00:03:16.950> just
