00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
uh and based on a design of the human

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.249 
uh and based on a design of the human
body<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.299> only<00:01:45.479> swing<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:45.930> married

physics and physiology together and and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.080 
physics and physiology together and and
that's<00:01:48.840> why<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> works<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:50.729> why<00:01:50.939> we

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
when I get to the end I have no way of

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.490 
when I get to the end I have no way of
knowing<00:03:26.060> what<00:03:26.450> their<00:03:26.600> physical<00:03:26.959> condition<00:03:26.989> is

knowing what their physical condition is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.560 
knowing what their physical condition is
maybe<00:03:27.800> they<00:03:27.950> can<00:03:28.100> do<00:03:28.250> that<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.670> be<00:03:29.120> just<00:03:29.390> fine

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
maybe they can do that and be just fine

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
if I did that one day I probably would

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.800 
if I did that one day I probably would
not<00:03:31.700> be<00:03:31.850> able<00:03:31.940> to<00:03:32.090> get<00:03:32.269> my<00:03:32.390> butt<00:03:32.570> out<00:03:32.600> of<00:03:32.750> the
