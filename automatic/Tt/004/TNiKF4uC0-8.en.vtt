00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 when you are here we are in minecraft 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:08.550
 1.8 let's see a mod a mod that is 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.700
 pretty cool and it's that it adds a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.160
 foundry to be able to recycle objects the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:21.170
 truth is that we have a lot of the foundry 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.170
 foundry here foundry but you know 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 what is then I do not know if it will be with God 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.300
 a neighbor the end I do not know but the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.450
 question is that this is super useful and that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.770
 have this for the 1.8 uncle because this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.460
 I had the series of motorcycles but without 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.170
 think better without thinking it is here 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.789
 casting or something like this these dresses 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.149
 yacht with the same as an oven but with 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.129
 normal stone weave simplicar or stone 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.000
 good I call him the other bad leg 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.000
 vibrates poop 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.540
 the point is that we can put coal 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.580
 and we can recycle if we have a lot 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.140
 of iron swords for example that 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.000
 this is very cool for the demos series 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.130
 with the packs over because the bugs 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.530
 they always end up dropping a lot of 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.120
 crap then you put her here 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.580
 You see iron 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.220
 the bad thing is clear the only bad thing is that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.060
 you can be the swords for example 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.780
 where that can be a little bit more 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.000
 patatero but let's burn this 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.479
 and this and we can also burn other 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.909
 little gold things for example gold swords and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.979
 This moves me a lot because you see that here 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.470
 there is iron because we are putting now 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:42.330
 a golden sword is an example 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.510
 let's see here to be filled 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.450
 the beauty material residual ingots 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.750
 Gold 2 can be up to 16 material 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.870
 residual then we remove the iron 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:02.310
 it's super good many many things 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.310
 for example diamond 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.259
 perfect or to recycle scheme 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 this super good and an apple does not 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.670
 may not 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.159
 I'm not sure if it can be wrong 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.280
 we say it with this fact I did not know 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.220
 Whether it works or not by being an apple 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:28.680
 if you can if it gives us in the eight gold 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.890
 it's super good, we'll get one 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.890
 Torch 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.020
 to charcoal 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.660
 we can lie little things with coal in 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.810
 Seriously, well, I'm going to do a test 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.270
 with atocha 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.950
 because I have stayed in this residual 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.510
 then maybe we can burn 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.870
 directly from here but out of 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.380
 here could be very cool I'll try 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.210
 removing the coal 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.500
 the only bad thing is that you can burn the 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.500
 rest of the game 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.920
 075 there that low we're not going to burn a 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.930
 lots to have a lot here because no 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.790
 we are simply going to inning coal not 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.340
 it's wrong that you have to get to one 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.610
 of residual material to give us one of 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.440
 carbon 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.090
 it's not bad the time I thought that what 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.490
 it would be better also fuel continues 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.260
 obviously serves because now with the 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.070
 next is going to be one more coal and 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.070
 here we can put it here 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:39.310
 but now the only thing that comes out very 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.310
 often but good is pretty cool 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.660
 because we can look like we can 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:51.160
 recycle pretty little things 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:54.030
 is very cool is 4 future BRICS do not know 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.930
 what are we going to get from here a jukebox 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.930
 that can give us the grip 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:05.489
 and they give us a clear diamond that does 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.590
 change is light 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.719
 this is the way in which monkey hand the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.310
 took the time in the review that kauai 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:19.509
 you want to take care here, do not go 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.459
 that he's worth if he gives us 5 iron and 0.33 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.100
 until we get one we can do 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.949
 things but it stays saved does not cool a 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:35.020
 bunch in this way but good the 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:38.190
 description 1.8 a shame because 1.8 that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.190
 You liked it 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.289
 bye
