00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the techniques that have worked for me

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
the techniques that have worked for me
throughout<00:00:53.699> my<00:00:53.789> career<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.449> basically

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
try and have a strategy and that's

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.800 
try and have a strategy and that's
basically<00:02:32.550> broken<00:02:33.550> down<00:02:33.700> into<00:02:34.060> different

aspects one of which is seasonal

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.600 
aspects one of which is seasonal
patterns<00:02:37.320> okay<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.380> ask<00:02:38.800> yourself<00:02:39.190> what<00:02:39.370> time

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
patterns okay you ask yourself what time

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.100 
patterns okay you ask yourself what time
of<00:02:39.640> year<00:02:39.820> am<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.180> going<00:02:40.360> through<00:02:40.510> this<00:02:40.660> body<00:02:40.900> of

of year am I going through this body of
water<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.650> then<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.520> try<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.940> incorporate<00:02:43.690> the

most sense at that time if I'm going in

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.410 
most sense at that time if I'm going in
the<00:02:49.030> spring<00:02:49.150> then<00:02:49.660> I'm<00:02:49.780> not<00:02:49.900> worried<00:02:50.500> about

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the spring then I'm not worried about

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.860 
the spring then I'm not worried about
