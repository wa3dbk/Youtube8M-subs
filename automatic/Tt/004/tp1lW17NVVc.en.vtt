guys what's really nice about the new

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
guys what's really nice about the new
update<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.720> don't<00:00:27.900> know<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.590> me<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> feel

and<00:00:33.989> lean<00:00:34.110> game<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> really

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and lean game so I don't know I really

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.670 
and lean game so I don't know I really
like<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.510> anyways<00:00:36.780> let's<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:37.469> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
like that but anyways let's get right to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130 
like that but anyways let's get right to
this<00:00:37.770> tutorial<00:00:38.129> here<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.760> obviously<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:40.020> you

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
this tutorial here so obviously what you

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
this tutorial here so obviously what you
need<00:00:40.290> in<00:00:40.649> order<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.950> make<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.250> you're<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
need in order to make it you're going to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.170 
need in order to make it you're going to
need<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.510> nether<00:00:42.870> reactor<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.730> find<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
need the nether reactor so you find the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
need the nether reactor so you find the
block<00:00:45.420> right<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:46.230> another<00:00:46.770> reactor<00:00:47.219> core<00:00:47.489> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
block right there another reactor core I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
block right there another reactor core I
should<00:00:47.789> say<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.239> then<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.600> also<00:00:48.750> needed<00:00:49.110> gold

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
should say and then you also needed gold

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.260 
should say and then you also needed gold
so<00:00:49.649> once<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.980> have<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:51.030> pretty<00:00:51.180> much

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
so once you have that you're pretty much

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.529 
so once you have that you're pretty much
golden<00:00:51.780> no<00:00:52.260> pun<00:00:52.500> intended<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.579> also<00:00:54.090> make

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
golden no pun intended but also make

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.779 
golden no pun intended but also make
sure<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.809> also<00:00:55.020> have<00:00:55.280> grab<00:00:56.280> some<00:00:58.789> some

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
sure you also have grab some some

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.100 
sure you also have grab some some
cobblestone<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.570> oh<00:01:00.600> my<00:01:00.840> god<00:01:01.050> leave<00:01:01.559> my<00:01:01.770> work

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
cobblestone see oh my god leave my work

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
cobblestone see oh my god leave my work
anyways<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.650> any<00:01:04.920> other<00:01:05.100> thing<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.519> want

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
I'm gonna actually delete this block

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.480 
I'm gonna actually delete this block
here's<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.390> little<00:01:09.600> awfully<00:01:10.049> nice<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.860> nice<00:01:11.159> flat

the sand right perfect this is a perfect
spot<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.409> another<00:01:17.250> reactor<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.780> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
spot for another reactor so what you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
spot for another reactor so what you
want<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.799> want<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> put<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.729> the

in the middle of it you want to put the
another<00:01:39.270> reactor<00:01:39.780> core<00:01:40.439> right<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.340> top<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
another reactor core right on top of the

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.600 
another reactor core right on top of the
middle<00:01:41.970> one<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:43.049> followed<00:01:43.590> by<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:44.399> want
