00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.740
 modern kabul is not at all like 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.830
 ghost town 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.030
 from the 90s western government 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.619
 invested in afghanistan more than 100 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.960
 billion dollars after the overthrow 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.090
 Taliban but now the country is waiting 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.670
 faecal precipice because help from abroad 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.189
 is more than half the budget and with 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.170
 the departure of the contingent on the end of the year west 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.119
 may stop helping afghanistan 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.640
 many fear that the military economy 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.770
 cash flow will soon come to naught 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.200
 made a bubble out of the economy which is not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.850
 we can provide for ourselves we cannot 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.489
 forever live off what 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.559
 there is of course it hurt us so 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.860
 how contributed to the development of corruption and 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.260
 decorated to understand what awaits Afghanistan 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 just look at the cabul dear 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.520
 mansions and high-rise buildings became monuments 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.609
 construction boom which subsequently 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 crashed sales fell a number 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.199
 free housing is growing on average 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.330
 Afghan gets about 500 dollars in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.490
 a year before the rent of such a house could 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.860
 go up to ten thousand dollars a month 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.020
 the market was supported by an influx of thousands 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.909
 employees of international organizations 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.299
 now they leave afghanistan and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.159
 Realtors' finest hour is over 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.259
 business is not at all going situation with 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.420
 security worsened and all my 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.130
 customers leave the country because of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 uncertainty everyone is afraid 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.020
 invest the collapse of the housing market only 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.360
 one of the symptoms of a larger problem 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.009
 over the past 12 years is not international 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.979
 community is not the government of afghanistan 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.899
 did not develop good programs to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.630
 meet the needs of society and 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.909
 no order people in afghan economy 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.170
 we do not have the necessary production 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.200
 you have to import everything 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.750
 you have them find the floor produced 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.350
 in Afghanistan it is surprisingly difficult even 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.820
 burqa 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.990
 here they are imported from China 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.210
 produce them in the traditional way 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.950
 it was too expensive that 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.470
 western economic assistance program 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.270
 make afghanistan more independent 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.489
 us built an industrial zone 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 cost 7 million dollars but we 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.019
 found that most 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.090
 production is minimized before these weaving 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.160
 machines used for sewing military 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.220
 and police uniforms commissioned by nato and usa 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.420
 but once a thriving factory already two 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.819
 year stands idle 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.299
 foreigners leave the country and contracts 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.890
 there are no more jobs before 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.989
 here was one of the largest factories 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.330
 Kabula is now over a thousand of her 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.340
 employees left without work paradox 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.500
 is that war is simultaneously 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.720
 destroyed the economy of Afghanistan and 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.250
 it supported and and it played on 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.500
 hand afghan construction and 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.670
 transport companies but no one else 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.220
 no NATO and the US forces spent more 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.720
 100 billion dollars even if part 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.329
 this money fell into the economy 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.700
 Afghanistan, this amount is significant 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.120
 Now this money will disappear like many 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.120
 enterprises 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.100
 many but not all to the factory then barefoot 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.950
 raisin comes from all over the country 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.109
 here it is sorted washed and packaged 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.079
 For export, success looks like 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.850
 afghan sex with many afghan 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.489
 businessmen seek a contract 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.320
 from foreigners and do not build factories if 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.780
 would they develop a country situation now 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.000
 it would be much better but due to problems with 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.790
 security people fear long term 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.859
 investment to overcome these fears will 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.720
 hard over ten years afghanistan 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.400
 flooded with easy money as a result 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.350
 the state became dependent on 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.950
 foreign aid and mired in 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.049
 corruption 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.000
 the country will soon be headed by a new president 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.680
 but people understand that he will face everything 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.810
 with the same problem how to revive 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.790
 economy after financial bullets 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.560
 the country is almost stopped
