working<00:01:34.490> with<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.760> calf<00:01:35.000> but<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.260> cat<00:01:36.440> we

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
working with the calf but the cat we

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.430 
working with the calf but the cat we
used<00:01:36.710> was<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.950> neck<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:37.700> so<00:01:37.850> he<00:01:38.030> was<00:01:38.180> really

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
used was the neck and so he was really

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.920 
used was the neck and so he was really
trained<00:01:39.440> with<00:01:39.620> cat<00:01:40.610> food<00:01:40.820> and<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.330> they

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
trained with cat food and and they

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.930 
trained with cat food and and they
trained<00:01:42.260> them<00:01:42.440> whatever<00:01:43.010> this<00:01:43.340> shot<00:01:43.580> is<00:01:43.760> to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
trained them whatever this shot is to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.870 
trained them whatever this shot is to
sit<00:01:44.180> to<00:01:44.540> be<00:01:44.660> held<00:01:44.900> to<00:01:45.140> be<00:01:45.230> pet<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.800> rub<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.430> so

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
sit to be held to be pet to rub and so

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.970 
sit to be held to be pet to rub and so
that<00:01:47.090> was<00:01:47.210> really<00:01:47.450> challenging<00:01:48.110> because<00:01:48.680> the

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
that was really challenging because the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.230 
that was really challenging because the
cat<00:01:49.190> has<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.400> little<00:01:49.670> bit<00:01:49.760> of<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.910> learning<00:01:50.030> curve

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
cat has a little bit of a learning curve

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.660 
cat has a little bit of a learning curve
every<00:01:50.630> time<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:50.870> change<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.230> shot<00:01:51.520> Wendy<00:01:52.520> right

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
every time we change a shot Wendy right

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.640 
every time we change a shot Wendy right
now<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.090> small<00:01:53.660> example<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.410> something

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
now is a small example of something
