we're doing an air filter change which

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.130 
we're doing an air filter change which
is<00:00:23.189> uh<00:00:23.220> there's<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.210> housing<00:00:24.420> over<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.930> which

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
is uh there's a housing over here which

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.050 
is uh there's a housing over here which
is<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.410> right<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.810> goes<00:00:27.810> over<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> engine

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
is this right here goes over the engine

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
is this right here goes over the engine
air<00:00:30.060> filter<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.480> actually<00:00:30.929> inside<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.650> box

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
air filter is actually inside this box

air filter is actually inside this box
hold<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:32.820> by<00:00:32.940> seven<00:00:33.360> Torx<00:00:34.320> bit<00:00:34.530> screws<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
hold on by seven Torx bit screws you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.630 
hold on by seven Torx bit screws you
have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.969> release<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.450> from<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.340> cover<00:00:38.340> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
have to release this from the cover and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.760 
have to release this from the cover and
this<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> actually<00:00:40.050> broken<00:00:40.379> we'll<00:00:40.680> be

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
this this is actually broken we'll be

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
this this is actually broken we'll be
replacing<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.250> too<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.020> get<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> new

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
replacing that too or just get a new

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.319 
replacing that too or just get a new
sleeve<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.710> then<00:00:44.430> we're<00:00:44.579> doing<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.000> spark<00:00:45.270> plug

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
sleeve and then we're doing a spark plug

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.510 
sleeve and then we're doing a spark plug
change<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.960> pretty<00:00:46.170> simple<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.950> know<00:00:47.070> one

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
change it's pretty simple you know one

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.040 
change it's pretty simple you know one
side<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> cover<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.420> spark<00:00:48.690> plugs<00:00:48.870> right

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
side to cover up for spark plugs right

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.549 
side to cover up for spark plugs right
here<00:00:49.309> 5/8<00:00:50.309> socket<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.780> spark<00:00:52.050> plugs<00:00:52.289> these

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
here 5/8 socket put spark plugs these

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.810 
here 5/8 socket put spark plugs these
are<00:00:52.710> ten<00:00:52.890> millimeter<00:00:53.219> bolts<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> remove<00:00:55.820> once

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
are ten millimeter bolts to remove once

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.869 
are ten millimeter bolts to remove once
you<00:00:56.879> get<00:00:56.969> them<00:00:57.059> out<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.360> gap<00:00:57.539> them<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.879> that's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
you get them out you gap them and that's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.220 
you get them out you gap them and that's
about<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:00.660> stirring<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:00.960> brakes

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
about that well stirring to do brakes

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.650 
about that well stirring to do brakes
and<00:01:01.440> rotors<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.890> calipers<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.430> here<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
and rotors and calipers in here and I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
and rotors and calipers in here and I
will<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> video<00:01:04.409> when<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.949> also

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
will do the video when we do that also

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.250 
will do the video when we do that also
will<00:01:05.729> change<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.330> pretty<00:01:06.869> simple<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
will change but that's pretty simple you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.120 
will change but that's pretty simple you
know<00:01:07.320> drain<00:01:07.500> oil<00:01:07.530> oil<00:01:07.979> filters<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.430> here<00:01:10.130> we

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
know drain oil oil filters right here we

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.710 
know drain oil oil filters right here we
use<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> crescent<00:01:12.210> wrench<00:01:12.299> got<00:01:12.600> this

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
use the just a crescent wrench got this

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
use the just a crescent wrench got this
off<00:01:12.960> put<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> new<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.830> on<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
off put the new one on it's not that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
off put the new one on it's not that

pull the filter out for a new one in and
we'll<00:01:23.970> update<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.360> when<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.810> brakes

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.319 

nine<00:01:28.259> Chevy<00:01:28.860> HHR<00:01:29.159> continue<00:01:29.970> there's<00:01:30.210> the

nine Chevy HHR continue there's the

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.270 
nine Chevy HHR continue there's the
brakes<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.560> we're<00:01:31.650> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> place<00:01:32.040> now

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
brakes then we're going to place now

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.429

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
breaks around here the rotor customer

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.710 
breaks around here the rotor customer
thinks<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> cap<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.009> bad<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.479> it's<00:01:42.479> probably

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
thinks the cap is bad but it's probably

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.740 
thinks the cap is bad but it's probably
not<00:01:42.840> will<00:01:43.200> inspect<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.860> see<00:01:44.659> plead<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
not will inspect it and see plead the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.120 
not will inspect it and see plead the
brave<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.829> rotors

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
brave so with that but I know the rotors

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.289 
brave so with that but I know the rotors
are<00:01:47.159> bad<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> can<00:01:47.640> feel<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> grooves<00:01:48.180> right

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
are bad you can feel the grooves right

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.999 
are bad you can feel the grooves right
here<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.259> could<00:01:49.380> see<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.649> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> video

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
here if you could see them on the video

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.179 
here if you could see them on the video
you<00:01:50.670> probably<00:01:50.820> could<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.750> um<00:01:52.189> you

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
you probably could actually but um you

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.620 
you probably could actually but um you
can<00:01:53.340> feel<00:01:53.520> there's<00:01:53.790> no<00:01:53.909> screws<00:01:54.149> everywhere

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
can feel there's no screws everywhere

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.389 
can feel there's no screws everywhere
I'm<00:01:54.930> assuming<00:01:55.380> these<00:01:55.439> brakes<00:01:55.740> are<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.100> real

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
I'm assuming these brakes are in real

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.370 
I'm assuming these brakes are in real
bad<00:01:56.579> shape<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.840> want<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.140> break<00:01:58.229> these

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
bad shape I just want to break these

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.510 
bad shape I just want to break these
bumps<00:01:58.770> back<00:01:58.920> here

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.809 

let's<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:07.250> alright<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.489> as<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.759> see

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
let's do that alright so as you can see

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
let's do that alright so as you can see
we<00:02:09.149> broke<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.539> bolt<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.899> wasn't<00:02:10.140> even<00:02:10.200> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
we broke the bolt it wasn't even on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.400 
we broke the bolt it wasn't even on
there<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:12.840> all

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
there actually at all

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.280 
there actually at all
so<00:02:14.269> we'll<00:02:15.269> see<00:02:15.540> could<00:02:16.230> have<00:02:16.319> just<00:02:16.470> been<00:02:18.290> one

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so we'll see could have just been one

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.449 
so we'll see could have just been one
since<00:02:21.349> hey<00:02:22.349> once<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.709> get<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.950> boat<00:02:23.190> broken

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
since hey once you get this boat broken

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:35.920 
since hey once you get this boat broken
there's<00:02:23.700> one<00:02:23.819> on<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.060> top<00:02:24.239> one<00:02:24.540> on<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.440> bottom

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.720 

never<00:02:36.930> want<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.140> let<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.410> caliper<00:02:37.920> hang<00:02:38.130> when

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
never want to let the caliper hang when

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.880 
never want to let the caliper hang when
you're<00:02:38.849> doing<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.269> uh<00:02:39.500> just<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.680> sake<00:02:40.860> of

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.220 
you're doing but uh just for the sake of
the<00:02:41.790> video<00:02:41.940> which<00:02:42.239> gonna<00:02:42.390> hold<00:02:42.599> it<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.930> I'll

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the video which gonna hold it and I'll

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.229 
the video which gonna hold it and I'll
hang<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.500> when<00:02:44.069> we're<00:02:44.250> done<00:02:44.280> so<00:02:44.880> that's<00:02:45.030> one

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
hang it when we're done so that's one

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:45.620 
hang it when we're done so that's one

it's pretty much right there on the
bottom<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.900> see<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.610> let's<00:02:50.610> see<00:02:50.730> how

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
bottom you can see it let's see how

00:02:50.849 --> 00:03:03.380 
bottom you can see it let's see how
tight<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.239> one<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.900> one<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.260> a<00:03:02.390> that's

can see that's the caliper here's your
piston<00:03:29.400> inside<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.790> theirs<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.470> pretty

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
piston inside of theirs it's pretty

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.310 
piston inside of theirs it's pretty
rusty<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.100> pretty<00:03:33.310> bad<00:03:33.490> but<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.730> mean<00:03:34.320> that's

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
see the copper boot is actually broken

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.920 
see the copper boot is actually broken
as<00:03:40.540> CalPERS<00:03:40.810> might<00:03:41.170> be<00:03:41.350> bad

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
as CalPERS might be bad

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.960 
as CalPERS might be bad
we'll<00:03:43.930> see<00:03:44.140> we<00:03:44.290> compress<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.850> see<00:03:45.850> what

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
we'll see we compress it see what

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.350 
we'll see we compress it see what
happens

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
happens

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.850 
happens
she<00:03:46.630> had<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> counter<00:03:47.110> personal<00:03:47.410> push<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.800> go

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
she had the counter personal push and go

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.300 
she had the counter personal push and go
ahead<00:03:47.980> and<00:03:48.100> replace<00:03:48.280> them<00:03:49.830> not<00:03:50.830> much<00:03:50.980> harder

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
ahead and replace them not much harder

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.820 
ahead and replace them not much harder
not<00:03:51.550> much<00:03:51.670> different<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.410> that's<00:03:53.410> what<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:53.680> do

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
not much different so that's what you do

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.530 
not much different so that's what you do
to<00:03:54.250> get<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.460> brakes<00:03:54.640> off<00:03:54.850> and<00:03:55.060> as<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.180> can<00:03:55.390> see

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
to get the brakes off and as you can see

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.720 
to get the brakes off and as you can see
you<00:03:55.630> just<00:03:56.370> pull<00:03:57.370> them<00:03:57.460> right<00:03:57.520> out<00:03:59.490> right<00:04:00.490> here

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
you just pull them right out right here

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.830 
you just pull them right out right here
down<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.870> side<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:03.940> can<00:04:04.060> see<00:04:04.090> this<00:04:04.420> see

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
down this side and you can see this see

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.470 
down this side and you can see this see
how<00:04:04.960> this<00:04:05.110> big<00:04:05.950> pad<00:04:06.160> has<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> good<00:04:07.210> amount<00:04:07.300> of

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
how this big pad has a good amount of

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.030 
how this big pad has a good amount of
meat<00:04:07.600> on<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.320> can<00:04:08.410> also<00:04:08.530> see<00:04:08.770> how<00:04:08.890> it's

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
meat on it you can also see how it's

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.750 
meat on it you can also see how it's
kind<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.310> warped<00:04:09.930> sloped<00:04:10.930> if<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.260> would<00:04:11.760> yeah

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
kind of warped sloped if you would yeah

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.740 
kind of warped sloped if you would yeah
that's<00:04:13.630> not<00:04:13.840> good<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:15.010> one<00:04:15.720> has<00:04:16.720> no

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
that's not good and this one has no

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.500 
that's not good and this one has no
brake<00:04:17.320> pad<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:17.710> it's<00:04:18.640> sloped<00:04:18.910> down<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.420> the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
brake pad and it's sloped down to the

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.430 
brake pad and it's sloped down to the
middle<00:04:19.860> real<00:04:20.860> bad<00:04:21.010> situation

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
middle real bad situation

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.690 
middle real bad situation
so<00:04:23.440> that's<00:04:23.620> not<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:24.010> then<00:04:24.160> once<00:04:24.340> you<00:04:24.430> get<00:04:24.550> this

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
so that's not it then once you get this

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.610 
so that's not it then once you get this
off<00:04:24.940> we're<00:04:25.810> going<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:25.990> hoist<00:04:26.200> this<00:04:26.380> up

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
off we're going to hoist this up

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.310 
off we're going to hoist this up
probably<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.190> hook<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.460> here<00:04:28.230> we're<00:04:29.230> going

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
probably and hook it to here we're going

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.620 
probably and hook it to here we're going
to<00:04:29.380> get<00:04:29.560> this<00:04:30.520> whole<00:04:30.790> bracket<00:04:31.180> off<00:04:31.270> right<00:04:31.480> here

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
to get this whole bracket off right here

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.200 
to get this whole bracket off right here
which<00:04:31.750> is<00:04:31.780> this<00:04:32.050> bolt<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.910> bolt<00:04:33.940> down

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
which is this bolt and the bolt down

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.570 
which is this bolt and the bolt down
there<00:04:34.420> this<00:04:34.540> comes<00:04:34.750> off<00:04:34.990> rotor<00:04:35.620> comes<00:04:35.860> out<00:04:36.040> and

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
there this comes off rotor comes out and

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.080 
there this comes off rotor comes out and
see<00:04:36.820> well<00:04:36.970> date<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.180> video<00:04:37.360> later

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
see well date the video later

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.480 
see well date the video later
all<00:04:39.660> right<00:04:39.810> so<00:04:39.960> we<00:04:40.050> did<00:04:40.199> go<00:04:40.320> ahead<00:04:40.440> replace<00:04:41.220> the

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
all right so we did go ahead replace the

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.610 
all right so we did go ahead replace the
cab<00:04:42.330> with<00:04:42.540> this<00:04:42.660> new<00:04:42.810> cab<00:04:43.020> right<00:04:43.260> here

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
cab with this new cab right here

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.439 
cab with this new cab right here
oh<00:04:43.650> yeah<00:04:44.280> it's<00:04:44.520> easier<00:04:44.760> place<00:04:45.000> once<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.330> get

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
oh yeah it's easier place once you get

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.590 
oh yeah it's easier place once you get
off<00:04:45.600> take<00:04:46.230> this<00:04:46.820> screw<00:04:47.820> off<00:04:47.970> that<00:04:48.150> holds<00:04:48.389> the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
off take this screw off that holds the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.530 
off take this screw off that holds the
brake<00:04:49.229> line<00:04:49.440> on<00:04:49.940> some<00:04:50.940> will<00:04:51.060> pour<00:04:51.210> out<00:04:51.240> just

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
brake line on some will pour out just

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.610 
brake line on some will pour out just
tilt<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.750> caliper<00:04:52.080> right<00:04:52.229> up<00:04:52.380> when<00:04:52.500> you're

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
tilt the caliper right up when you're

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.590 
tilt the caliper right up when you're
done<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.400> dad<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.729> will<00:04:53.820> come<00:04:53.970> out<00:04:54.060> put

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
done like the dad and will come out put

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.330 
done like the dad and will come out put
the<00:04:54.750> new<00:04:54.930> one<00:04:55.080> on<00:04:55.110> right<00:04:55.350> away<00:04:55.470> can't<00:04:56.250> the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
the new one on right away can't the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.610 
the new one on right away can't the
bleed<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.580> brakes<00:04:56.790> anyway<00:04:57.120> so<00:04:57.380> it's<00:04:58.380> an<00:04:58.470> easy

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
bleed the brakes anyway so it's an easy

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.080 
bleed the brakes anyway so it's an easy
easy<00:04:59.520> install<00:05:00.060> removal<00:05:00.780> install<00:05:01.080> whatever
