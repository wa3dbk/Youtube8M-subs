better than icons for a couple of

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.340 
better than icons for a couple of
reasons<00:01:11.579> they<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> little<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:12.990> space

reasons they have a little more space
for<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> app<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.280> show<00:01:14.520> its<00:01:14.729> personality<00:01:15.180> like

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
for the app to show its personality like

it we introduced a new platform based on

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.999 
it we introduced a new platform based on
standard<00:01:23.850> web<00:01:24.000> technologies<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.869> html5<00:01:25.859> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
standard web technologies so html5 and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.090 
standard web technologies so html5 and
JavaScript<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:27.479> allows<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.619> millions<00:01:28.950> of

the way into the middle of the screen
and<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.879> designed<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.329> thumbs<00:02:57.629> lab<00:02:57.930> which

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
and so we designed this thumbs lab which

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.349 
and so we designed this thumbs lab which
is<00:02:58.379> sort<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> more<00:02:58.829> ergonomic<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.549> it<00:03:00.060> feels

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
is sort of more ergonomic and it feels

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.830
