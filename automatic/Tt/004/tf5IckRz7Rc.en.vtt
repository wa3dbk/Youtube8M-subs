optical<00:00:23.670> phase<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.269> anyone<00:00:24.750> who<00:00:24.840> actually

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
optical phase or anyone who actually

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.500 
optical phase or anyone who actually
Snipes<00:00:25.410> at<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> will<00:00:27.000> notice<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.330> i

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
Snipes at all so you will notice that i

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.120

have<00:00:27.539> actually<00:00:27.840> sped<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.830> part

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
have actually sped up this first part

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.370 
have actually sped up this first part
because<00:00:29.400> i'm<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.820> sniper<00:00:30.119> at<00:00:30.510> all<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.199> it

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
because i'm not a sniper at all and it

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.139 
because i'm not a sniper at all and it
did<00:00:31.529> take<00:00:31.740> me<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.949> significant<00:00:32.700> sort<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.969> time

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
did take me a significant sort of time

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.990 
did take me a significant sort of time
to<00:00:33.300> warm<00:00:33.480> up<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.860> end<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:35.910> I

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to warm up but it at the end I think I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.700 
to warm up but it at the end I think I
sort<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.239> got<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.480> job<00:00:36.630> done<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.110> ended<00:00:37.620> up

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
sort of got the job done I ended up

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.229 
sort of got the job done I ended up
coming<00:00:37.920> back<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.489> pretty<00:00:38.820> sort<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
coming back from a pretty sort of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.229 
coming back from a pretty sort of
significant<00:00:39.870> loss<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.860> suppose<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> thought

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
significant loss I suppose so I thought

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.130 
significant loss I suppose so I thought
that<00:00:42.300> there<00:00:42.510> should<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> those

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that there should be one of those

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.930 
that there should be one of those
