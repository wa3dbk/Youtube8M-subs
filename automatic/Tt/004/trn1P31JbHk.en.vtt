00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
to show you how to get started on this

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.440 
to show you how to get started on this
recipe<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.980> our<00:00:38.190> ready-made<00:00:38.640> pie<00:00:38.879> shell

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
recipe we have our ready-made pie shell

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.770 
recipe we have our ready-made pie shell
now<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:41.040> could<00:00:41.280> set<00:00:41.550> this<00:00:41.760> pie<00:00:42.030> shell<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.629> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
now you could set this pie shell if you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.229 
now you could set this pie shell if you
would<00:00:42.930> like<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.680> typically<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.460> set<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:44.820> pie

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
would like and I typically do set my pie

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.450 
would like and I typically do set my pie
crusts<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.500> reason<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.280> is

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
crusts and the reason that I do that is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.740 
crusts and the reason that I do that is
because<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.149> have<00:00:48.360> something<00:00:48.600> that's

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
because when you have something that's

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.180 
because when you have something that's
going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.140> cooking<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> long

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
going to be cooking in it for a long

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.490 
going to be cooking in it for a long
period<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.670> time<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.780> bottom<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> pie

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
period of time the bottom of the pie

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.790 
period of time the bottom of the pie
shell<00:00:52.890> can<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> little<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:54.899> little<00:00:55.410> soggy

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
shell can get a little a little soggy

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.860 
shell can get a little a little soggy
tasting<00:00:56.579> when<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.940> set<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
tasting when you set it it's going to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.840 
tasting when you set it it's going to
kind<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> provide<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.770> barrier<00:00:59.129> between<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
kind of provide a barrier between the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
kind of provide a barrier between the
liquid<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> pie<00:01:00.719> shell<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.920> may<00:01:02.039> hold

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
liquid and the pie shell so it may hold

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.830 
liquid and the pie shell so it may hold
its<00:01:02.430> form<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.910> little<00:01:03.059> bit<00:01:03.239> better<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.629> course

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
its form a little bit better of course

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.660 
its form a little bit better of course
as<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.559> sits<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.250> gonna<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
as it sits you're gonna get that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.880 
as it sits you're gonna get that
sogginess<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> bottom<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.170> this

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
sogginess on the bottom so this

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.770 
sogginess on the bottom so this
particular<00:01:08.250> pie<00:01:08.610> crust<00:01:08.939> I'm<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.270> gonna<00:01:09.420> set

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
particular pie crust I'm not gonna set

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240 
particular pie crust I'm not gonna set
because<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.260> has<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.470> cook<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> oven

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
because this has to cook up in the oven

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
because this has to cook up in the oven
for<00:01:11.760> about<00:01:11.850> 45<00:01:12.360> 50<00:01:12.720> minutes<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.500> think<00:01:13.860> it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
for about 45 50 minutes so I think it's

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.920 
for about 45 50 minutes so I think it's
gonna<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.340> okay<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.240> we're<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.540> start<00:01:15.630> by
