we're<00:00:18.830> starting<00:00:19.010> this<00:00:19.280> very<00:00:19.490> clearly<00:00:19.790> by

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
we're starting this very clearly by

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.910 
we're starting this very clearly by
setting<00:00:20.540> up<00:00:20.600> strategies<00:00:21.230> to<00:00:21.350> understand<00:00:21.770> how

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
setting up strategies to understand how

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.130 
setting up strategies to understand how
can<00:00:22.369> we<00:00:22.490> best<00:00:22.670> reduce<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.420> our<00:00:23.660> corporate

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
can we best reduce the our corporate

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.560 
can we best reduce the our corporate
footprint<00:00:24.860> and<00:00:25.040> this<00:00:26.000> can<00:00:26.210> take<00:00:26.240> many

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
footprint and this can take many

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.690 
footprint and this can take many
different<00:00:26.680> methods<00:00:27.680> in<00:00:27.980> many<00:00:28.160> different<00:00:28.340> ways

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
different methods in many different ways

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.060 
different methods in many different ways
I<00:00:28.960> mean<00:00:29.960> simple<00:00:30.320> little<00:00:30.530> things<00:00:30.740> for<00:00:30.950> example

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
I mean simple little things for example

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.549 
I mean simple little things for example
as<00:00:31.599> closing<00:00:32.599> the<00:00:32.720> lights<00:00:32.989> when<00:00:33.170> you<00:00:33.260> leave<00:00:33.290> the

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
as closing the lights when you leave the

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.590 
as closing the lights when you leave the
room<00:00:33.739> in<00:00:34.190> all<00:00:34.400> honesty<00:00:34.850> I<00:00:34.879> don't<00:00:35.000> think<00:00:35.390> that

allow<00:00:44.420> us<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.750> reduce<00:00:45.229> the<00:00:45.739> utilization<00:00:46.220> of

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
allow us to reduce the utilization of

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.520 
allow us to reduce the utilization of

costs<00:01:55.310> for<00:01:55.430> company<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:55.909> think<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.659> is<00:01:56.780> a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.300 
costs for company I think it is a
natural<00:01:57.230> tendency<00:01:57.350> for<00:01:57.740> companies<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.100> want

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
natural tendency for companies to want

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.220 
natural tendency for companies to want
to<00:01:58.460> turn<00:01:58.670> towards<00:01:59.450> utilizing<00:02:00.140> these

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
to turn towards utilizing these

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.800 
to turn towards utilizing these
facilities<00:02:00.860> to<00:02:01.310> reduce<00:02:01.460> one<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.420> footprint

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
facilities to reduce one the footprint

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.970 
facilities to reduce one the footprint
which<00:02:02.960> is<00:02:03.080> good<00:02:03.230> for<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.409> environment<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.920> to
