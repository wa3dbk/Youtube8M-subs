00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 friends with you kavkaz pictures today we 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.899
 with you we will hack big races 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.840
 hacking will take us through 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.190
 program here this reference to it you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.799
 can find in our group or in 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.269
 description or can be broken off through 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.720
 official website but I will do through 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.100
 the application we go into it so further 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.660
 choose a server through which we play 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.119
 in my case i play through 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.080
 classmates 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:35.809
 write login write password write as I sit 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.600
 I will write gold on white 30 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:42.809
 so we do not need silver 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:48.090
 Credits do not need from tournaments do not need so 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:51.329
 everyone wrote it is important that you neither 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.219
 they were saying that you hacked us all 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.050
 don't write too much 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.989
 amount of gold this can lead to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.570
 bam no account loss 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:05.280
 under the currency successfully added go 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.830
 big races to us 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.460
 get our coins gotta do 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.310
 several times the race on wim race here on 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.450
 two hundred and twenty coins so he's a little bit 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.450
 minutes am not touch probably 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.810
 so that everything started spinning 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:40.460
 initially we had there how many of us 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:45.050
 220 loans were my twitter plate 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:51.880
 220 gold we had we now have 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:56.149
 should be that is, body 50 should be 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:00.460
 if I live you got only part of the lure 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.890
 don't panic it will all be like that 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.490
 booted until part of the gold as 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.770
 our application is running this application 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.830
 works through 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.590
 the task that you have it type and 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.640
 mounts their implementation and thanks to him 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:23.390
 you get the gold here and so it is 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.150
 works also can get silver and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.150
 loans 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.150
 here 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:39.590
 now here is seconds and 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:44.970
 I think it's time to go there 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:49.739
 I think it will be enough and this is probably 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:53.930
 We already do the corresponding gumba to 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:03:02.489
 see what we got from this 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:06.450
 now all push the race here are golden 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.010
