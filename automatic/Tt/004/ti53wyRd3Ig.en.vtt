00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.490 

hey<00:00:45.460> everyone<00:00:45.790> at<00:00:45.940> RC<00:00:46.300> Jose<00:00:46.750> thought<00:00:47.200> I'd<00:00:47.320> make

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
hey everyone at RC Jose thought I'd make

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.310 
hey everyone at RC Jose thought I'd make
an<00:00:47.650> updated<00:00:47.980> video<00:00:48.310> of<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.690> video<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:50.200> had

battery<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:56.230> suppose<00:00:56.620> you're<00:00:56.830> flying<00:00:57.220> a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
battery so suppose you're flying a

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
battery so suppose you're flying a
quadcopter<00:00:57.610> or<00:00:58.390> an<00:00:58.870> airplane<00:00:59.320> or<00:00:59.830> you're

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
quadcopter or an airplane or you're

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.500 
quadcopter or an airplane or you're
driving<00:01:02.170> around<00:01:02.290> an<00:01:02.680> RC<00:01:03.130> truck<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.790> you<00:01:04.059> leave

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
driving around an RC truck and you leave

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.330 
driving around an RC truck and you leave
the<00:01:04.630> battery<00:01:04.839> connected<00:01:05.380> overnight<00:01:05.830> or<00:01:06.100> you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
the battery connected overnight or you

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.060 
the battery connected overnight or you
lost<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.240> plane<00:01:07.480> and<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:07.990> know<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.170> got<00:01:08.290> stuck

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
lost the plane and you know it got stuck

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.890 
lost the plane and you know it got stuck
overnight<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.730> tree<00:01:10.030> or<00:01:10.450> whatever<00:01:10.660> and<00:01:10.810> you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
overnight in a tree or whatever and you

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.390 
overnight in a tree or whatever and you
covered<00:01:11.170> recovered<00:01:11.800> at<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.920> next<00:01:12.100> morning

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
covered recovered at the next morning

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.610 
covered recovered at the next morning
and<00:01:12.670> then<00:01:13.120> you<00:01:13.210> go<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.360> charge<00:01:13.660> it<00:01:13.870> and<00:01:14.080> on<00:01:14.470> your

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
and then you go to charge it and on your

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.880 
and then you go to charge it and on your
charger<00:01:15.070> you<00:01:15.250> get<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.640> low-voltage<00:01:16.330> error<00:01:16.890> so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
charger you get a low-voltage error so

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.090 
charger you get a low-voltage error so
that<00:01:18.130> means<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.550> your<00:01:19.590> batteries<00:01:20.590> total

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
that means that your batteries total

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.480 
that means that your batteries total
voltage<00:01:21.250> has<00:01:21.640> gone<00:01:21.790> down<00:01:21.970> below<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.840> minimum

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
voltage has gone down below the minimum

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.710 
voltage has gone down below the minimum
so<00:01:24.490> if<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.760> have<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.020> 7.4<00:01:26.020> battery<00:01:26.440> to<00:01:27.400> sell

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
so if you have a 7.4 battery to sell

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.660 
so if you have a 7.4 battery to sell
usually<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.810> minimum<00:01:28.900> is<00:01:29.259> about<00:01:29.530> three<00:01:30.369> volts

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
usually the minimum is about three volts

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.650 
usually the minimum is about three volts
per<00:01:30.820> cell<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.300> it's<00:01:31.420> six<00:01:31.780> volts<00:01:32.170> if<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.250> have<00:01:33.460> a

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
per cell so it's six volts if you have a

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.230 
per cell so it's six volts if you have a
3<00:01:34.660> cell<00:01:34.990> 11<00:01:35.470> point<00:01:35.860> one<00:01:36.130> volt<00:01:36.369> battery<00:01:36.759> it

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
3 cell 11 point one volt battery it

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.440 
3 cell 11 point one volt battery it
would<00:01:37.360> be<00:01:37.479> around<00:01:37.690> nine<00:01:38.050> volts<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:40.180> what<00:01:40.330> you

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
would be around nine volts so what you

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.420 
would be around nine volts so what you
need<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.869> recover<00:01:41.380> it<00:01:41.650> our<00:01:42.160> first<00:01:42.640> obviously<00:01:43.240> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
need to recover it our first obviously a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.520 
need to recover it our first obviously a

so<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:12.630> way<00:03:12.720> you<00:03:12.810> recover<00:03:13.140> it<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.380> take<00:03:14.370> your

so the way you recover it is take your

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.820 
so the way you recover it is take your

whichever<00:05:25.260> one<00:05:25.410> you<00:05:25.440> want<00:05:25.940> make<00:05:26.940> sure<00:05:26.970> that

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
whichever one you want make sure that

whichever one you want make sure that
your<00:05:27.540> amperage<00:05:28.080> is<00:05:28.290> set<00:05:28.470> correctly

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
your amperage is set correctly

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.360 
your amperage is set correctly
usually<00:05:30.090> it's<00:05:30.240> 1<00:05:30.600> amp<00:05:30.840> for<00:05:31.170> every<00:05:31.470> 1000<00:05:32.220> mAh

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
that's how I've been taught make sure

that's how I've been taught make sure
that<00:05:36.090> your<00:05:36.270> voltage<00:05:36.720> is<00:05:36.870> set<00:05:37.050> correctly<00:05:37.080> and

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
that your voltage is set correctly and

that your voltage is set correctly and
