okay now we just stay in between the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.280 
okay now we just stay in between the
matrix<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> real<00:01:27.659> world<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.170> stay

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
matrix in the real world so we just stay

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.390 
matrix in the real world so we just stay
here<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> rest<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.920> our<00:01:28.979> lives
