today<00:00:52.379> on<00:00:52.649> my<00:00:53.010> twitter<00:00:53.399> feed<00:00:53.489> i<00:00:53.699> found<00:00:54.210> at

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
today on my twitter feed i found at

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.119 
today on my twitter feed i found at
least<00:00:54.600> three<00:00:55.050> items<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.620> talked<00:00:55.860> about

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
least three items that talked about

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
least three items that talked about
specific<00:00:56.760> foods<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.270> their<00:00:57.390> health<00:00:57.600> benefits

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
specific foods and their health benefits

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 
specific foods and their health benefits
and<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.890> thing<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.670> can't<00:01:00.000> look

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
and the thing is is that you can't look

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.529 
and the thing is is that you can't look
at<00:01:00.539> specific<00:01:01.109> foods<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.739> actually<00:01:02.730> really

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
at specific foods and actually really

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
at specific foods and actually really
conclude<00:01:03.960> anything<00:01:04.250> because<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.400> don't<00:01:05.610> do

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
conclude anything because we don't do

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.050 
conclude anything because we don't do
studies<00:01:06.479> where<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.900> would<00:01:07.049> take<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.890> know

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
studies where we would take you know

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.370 
studies where we would take you know
thousands<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.150> people<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.750> feed<00:01:10.200> them

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
thousands of people and feed them

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.219 
thousands of people and feed them
otherwise<00:01:10.799> identical<00:01:11.340> diets<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.540> substitute

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
otherwise identical diets but substitute

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.410 
otherwise identical diets but substitute
one<00:01:13.680> difference<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.520> their<00:01:14.729> diets<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
one difference in their diets and so

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.510 
one difference in their diets and so
what<00:01:15.630> happens<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> rely<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:16.979> these

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
what happens is we have to rely on these

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.600 
what happens is we have to rely on these
really<00:01:18.060> large<00:01:18.320> observational<00:01:19.320> studies<00:01:20.280> where

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
really large observational studies where

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.570 
really large observational studies where
we<00:01:20.640> watch<00:01:21.570> thousands<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> people<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.400> many

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
we watch thousands of people for many

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.520 
we watch thousands of people for many
many<00:01:23.729> years<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.390> try<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> tease<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
many years and we try to tease out the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.440 
many years and we try to tease out the
differences<00:01:26.040> between<00:01:26.100> those<00:01:26.549> people<00:01:26.970> but

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
differences between those people but

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.510 
differences between those people but
it's<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.630> very<00:01:27.659> challenging<00:01:28.170> thing<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.860> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
it's a very challenging thing to do so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.160 
it's a very challenging thing to do so
where<00:01:29.759> do<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.329> people<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.840> though<00:01:30.990> with

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
where do what do people do though with

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.090 
where do what do people do though with
the<00:01:31.290> information<00:01:31.470> i<00:01:31.740> mean<00:01:31.860> you've<00:01:31.950> got<00:01:31.979> some

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the information i mean you've got some

so where are we left with I think the

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.820 
so where are we left with I think the
simplest<00:03:59.700> rule<00:04:00.060> for<00:04:00.390> consumers<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.230> just<00:04:01.500> eat

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830
