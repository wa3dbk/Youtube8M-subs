00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.610
 Well, this is a living circle that goes forward this month and that these 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.029
 that the losses that although we expected so much we were all eager 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.199
 that is how we can see is how are the criteria that if camps do not 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.019
 has nothing to do the cnn the only one of the things that I like the most is that 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.109
 we have won two side screens 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.779
 to the sides that is one of the most interesting things I found 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.390
 let's watch 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.189
 against the most interesting things that parents that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 anti holding down here we can see the little screens in tiny 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930
 of gas that we like 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.940
 and another of the things that more than giving did not appear 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.380
 for example 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.800
 the new car 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.160
 it's a way so that if we leave when connecting to the car 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.190
 can be here it appears then we need to with we are driving that 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.550
 it's mine 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.130
 clear that are not in fact what is 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.560
 well we go back to what would be the phone that the goal is that pretty 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.260
 faster than before although here 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.140
 it seems that it is going to stop a little 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 we see that they have the canals buttons criterion to be able to activate the trial 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.750
 that you 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.190
 one that the gps and all the other 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.190
 and below you can move what I'm saying I'm in a couple 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.460
 hundred that part is one of the things that I liked the most 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.860
 and is that for example enter the agenda 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.660
 and they selected contact 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.290
 how could it 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.469
 select machine would leave the options for here 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.180
 telephony and every time there is more than the message is that I do not know what 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.990
 so that it could be that exquisiteness by selecting 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.940
 that is active on both facebook 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.780
 if you enter on facebook as in any of the other elected things the contact 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.370
 the two teams example 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.410
 I'll speak with 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.850
 with turn-on aquino miki oca or city 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.800
 below 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.680
 for this reason he will not leave the toc, he will not see a conversation with koke 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.060
 then with myself 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.390
 almerÃ­a - that for example by selecting in the image of che 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.590
 kinky tiki-tiki what is this 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.740
 He did not deserve a menu that has all the options to win 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.239
 ii everything then would be much more interesting because we do not want 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 make propaganda of the shock 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:23.139
 j the things that are going to be candidates is for example the menu that is no longer a 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.869
 little eye that describe themselves no 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.049
 a menu on black background 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.049
 alhama and while that each 3d option that is forbidden to 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.519
 for him three dimensions that goes for the background chroma green that one of the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.159
 things that I miss the most 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.779
 actually 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:42.379
 i 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.859
 that more options have to improve my mind when I get to the corner of 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 streets that will happen is that we can not use alguazas 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:54.680
 and the rest is quite visual quite fast I liked it especially when 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.200
 when we jump out of anything as it opens out as very curred by 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.069
 example occurred the both 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.069
 how it unfolds that was or not 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.519
 this is the PSOE that has installed and who is behind the lectern that 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.269
 they operated 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.659
 let's go back to the beginning narrated to touch the screen to show that it's 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.999
 the one fixing a modification 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:24.659
 another thing that is the jewel in the crown for newspapers what more 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.659
 is less with the famous gallery so we go to the liguilla 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.329
 what 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.089
 they talk about joy 

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:54.329
 and here we are for example consistent and select the rows k the text is not 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.199
 see in the photos that we have houses in the folders 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.079
 as they take quite the so interesting 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.729
 also if we enter the gallery we could see 

00:04:04.279 --> 00:04:06.079
 how they lean 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.279
 the guidelines that the sides 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:10.189
 and for example 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.509
 Well, one of the most interesting things, like every day 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:17.629
 esquea we can expand the photos as children candle telethon see that they are not 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.139
 as good as you think 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.159
 we can choose 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.330
 and it is already 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.509
 and this gallery is impressive that we associate with greater photos in 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.569
 cook grids selecting technical status and here if they place us by 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:32.849
 dates 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.849
 so that kenya for example all we have done in December 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.069
 here 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.069
 joaquin clubs all we have done then 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.099
 now at Christmas 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.099
 we go back to the gallery 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.840
 or good we can and the day 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.870
 and the next year 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.050
 and nothing this series to 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.080
 the magic conclude 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.930
 since the pse has liked 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.360
 and that it be committed g 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.440
 until the next meeting
