this<00:00:07.410> hover<00:00:08.280> crop<00:00:17.480> it's<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.690> two-man

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
this hover crop it's a two-man

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.099 
this hover crop it's a two-man
hovercraft<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.890> got<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.090> main<00:00:21.090> drive<00:00:21.390> fan<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
hovercraft it's got a main drive fan and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170 
hovercraft it's got a main drive fan and
it's<00:00:22.560> got<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> centrifugal<00:00:23.250> lift<00:00:23.730> fan<00:00:23.939> down

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it's got a centrifugal lift fan down

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.839 
it's got a centrifugal lift fan down
there<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.560> runs<00:00:25.740> off<00:00:25.890> one<00:00:26.609> motor

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
there and so it just runs off one motor

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.150 
there and so it just runs off one motor
and<00:00:27.119> then<00:00:27.689> once<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.140> pick<00:00:28.410> up<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> speed<00:00:28.890> it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and then once you pick up the speed it

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.009 
and then once you pick up the speed it
pressurizes<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.880> skirt<00:00:30.269> underneath<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
pressurizes the skirt underneath it and

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
pressurizes the skirt underneath it and
the<00:00:31.320> whole<00:00:31.470> thing<00:00:31.500> lifts<00:00:31.920> up<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.250> hovers<00:00:32.910> a

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the whole thing lifts up and hovers a

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
the whole thing lifts up and hovers a
bit<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.899> once<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.530> starting<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
bit and then once it's starting to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
bit and then once it's starting to
hovering<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.880> push<00:00:36.120> fan<00:00:36.329> starts<00:00:36.660> working

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
hovering the the push fan starts working

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
hovering the the push fan starts working
and<00:00:37.110> then<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.380> off<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.620> go

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
and then you off you go

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.200 
and then you off you go
have<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> run<00:00:38.460> over<00:00:38.520> any<00:00:38.730> people<00:00:39.239> lately<00:00:40.040> no<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
think that's probably a very good idea

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
think that's probably a very good idea
