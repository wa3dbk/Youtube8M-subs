this<00:00:45.629> idea<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.559> college<00:00:47.370> admissions

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
this idea that a college admissions

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.950 
this idea that a college admissions
officer<00:00:48.149> someone<00:00:48.570> thought<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.930> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
officer someone thought to be a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.569 
officer someone thought to be a
gatekeeper<00:00:49.559> wanted<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.219> give<00:00:50.399> them

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
gatekeeper wanted to just give them

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.860

information<00:00:50.850> but<00:00:51.480> people<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.809> really

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
information but people have really

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.660 
information but people have really
latched<00:00:52.230> onto<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.620> idea<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> have

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
latched onto that idea so I have

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.910 
latched onto that idea so I have
counselors<00:00:54.090> who<00:00:54.809> will<00:00:54.930> call<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.260> email<00:00:55.379> me<00:00:55.559> and
