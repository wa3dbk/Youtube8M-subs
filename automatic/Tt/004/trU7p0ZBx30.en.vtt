 hello guys are facing today you to 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.780
 format a laptop lenovo s400 looks 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.000
 no windows 7 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.439
 as you may already know, he does not have 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.829
 input for neither dvd nor cd 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:25.419
 so you will have to use a pendrive 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:28.960
 bootable or a usb recorder 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:33.940
 in my case I'm using the usb recorder 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.540
 here is the blue usb recorder and it's already 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:42.700
 connected for sale 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.450
 so let's read the fm laptop safely 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:52.150
 and press f2 to enter the boot entered 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:57.850
 in the boot you go in a boat here mode 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.750
 much and if legacy puts support at boot 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.530
 priority 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.240
 you put legacy supposed to pick up 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:10.690
 in case it does not even mean gastritis 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.680
 So now that you've seen that you have not yet 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.140
 appeared 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.120
 My label has to appear. 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.930
 underneath that bout should be 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.780
 priority 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.720
 then it will appear in the hope that it gives 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.860
 a tutorial on the notebook 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:32.470
 then press fn and f10 to give the 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:38.080
 to start a notebook 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:41.290
 then this athlete has and fnf 2 for 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.340
 enter the boot of the new center in the face 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.840
 again it will be realized that the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.460
 recorder appeared she's right in the middle 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.280
 So you have to go now to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.409
 the recorder up and down until you 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.430
 first 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:03.570
 then hold fm again and press the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.440
 f6 it goes up thousand 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:13.250
 so now it's easy, it's just six fm push 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:17.350
 f10 again to save 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.270
 start new notebook so it will go 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:31.220
 dalmut to be able to be formatted in the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:35.920
 windows 7 is that the peta to have and is now 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.920
 just wait to load who will load 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.600
 usually in a notebook format 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:56.120

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.850
