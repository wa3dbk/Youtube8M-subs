00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 or the days all living beings have 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.899
 a characteristic smell let's say it's not 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.349
 very good 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.480
 so as I do not waste or defect you 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.400
 skunk pain look if you had 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.900
 read and reviewed what we are going to tell 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.970
 today you would know that the skunk is not the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.890
 animal that smells worse on the planet today in 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.939
 bestiary the five animals that worse 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.939
 they smell of the world 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.650
 in position number 5 the beetle 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.830
 bomber when he feels scared 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.239
 It releases a very strong odor by the tail that 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.630
 They can also do it up to 29 times 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.630
 followed 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.730
 and now yes in number 4 the skunk 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.199
 striped and it's that it has earned its fame to 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.629
 pulse since this animal when it 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.000
 Feeling scared releases an odor that is 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.949
 unbearable in such a way and to everything that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 the tribe is approached to go terrified 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.129
 and you, as you continue like that, are going to get 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.129
 scare me 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.890
 and in the third place we find ourselves 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.990
 the bug if you find one at home 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.910
 serves better than running has 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 a very powerful smell and in this case not 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.430
 they use them for fear to get away 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.320
 the predators do not use it to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.060
 help with the females that's why you do not 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.060
 you do not because you're looking for an azzurri 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.900
 and in number 2 the anteater this 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.910
 animal does not have much fame among the most 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.250
 painful but can smell worse 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.440
 that a skunk and even four times 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.240
 more it is strange that such an animal 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.920
 peaceful that only with ants can 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.110
 get to see so bad 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.380
 and also about you remember we only saw 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.590
 in this video 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.119
 and in number 1 the common fox that 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.009
 smelly others you can smell it 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.689
 kilometer away in the bars it 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.689
 note a lot in yesteryear 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.619
 in some native towns they used 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.970
 this substance as perfume and 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.710
 currently some hunters the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.399
 they use to camouflage themselves when they go to 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.070
 to sing 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.030
 what disgust people 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.030
 they are disgusting 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.330
 good that we passed the foxes or not 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.709
 but you can also comment 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.240

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.409
