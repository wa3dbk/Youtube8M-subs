 hello in this video I'm going to you 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.340
 show how to replace the processor 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.480
 CPU of a laptop 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.950
 So you need a screwdriver to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 Phillips screwdriver of different 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.420
 sizes and a knife that's it can 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.439
 always serve a knife so me there 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.650
 have to find on your computer 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.990
 notebook the biggest cash there is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.910
 so I dream so the processor is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.690
 here it is fixed by 5 screws so it has a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.120
 the one to one the city there I you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 resume when I unscrew and unscrew 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.149
 so yokes davis and levis so a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.000
 Once the lilies are up, he will know there 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.770
 there may be dust on the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.010
 radiator here so you blow everything 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.199
 it's going to take it off so you put it on 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.560
 processor is here and here there is here I 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.270
 do not know if you really want a 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.979
 screws that are the real 90 places so 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:21.270
 you put the screw in the screw 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:25.329

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:30.170

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.829
 you can remove your processor 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.340
 so here you change you put 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.539
 the other you see you can not 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.780
 you mislead meaning that if you 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:54.350
 put it in bad sense it does not fit 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:58.690
