00:00:00.774 --> 00:00:05.619
 Mister, I'm tired of this! Every time I get a pass, Messi angrily looks at me if I don’t give the ball to him. 

00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:09.367
 Mister, are you listening to me? 

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:19.756
 Guardiola goes more costume than you 

00:00:20.345 --> 00:00:26.853
 Oh god It seems that what the press wrote about my game is true: Villa has disappeared. Now people don't see me. 

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:32.205
 I'm like that weird boy with a cold breath from the movie with Bruce Willis. 

00:00:33.513 --> 00:00:38.646
 Sorry. I did not listen to you. I hung on the song Stronger. 

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:40.846
 "What does not kill you makes you stronger ..." 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.264
 Speak, speak now. What did you want? 

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:46.030
 Messi looks at me with malice when I do not pass him 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.775
 You have to talk to someone who controls everything here. 

00:00:48.775 --> 00:00:50.470
 And who controls everything here? Aren't you? 

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:52.765
 Sandro Rossel? 

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.087
 Bilderberg club? 

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:03.931
 Looks like you have no idea how everything is arranged here. I'm just an adviser, sit down, please. 

00:01:09.104 --> 00:01:12.070
 Villa, Villa, Villa 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.930
 You come here, to my office on the day of my son's baptism, and you tell me that you don’t like to give in 

00:01:19.277 --> 00:01:22.601
 No, I do not like it when you look at me angrily, even worse than Ozil! 

00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:25.986
 But what have I done that you treat me like that? 

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:30.632
 I do not remember that you ever gave me a good pass 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.845
 Last time I gave a couple 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.394
 Oh, so you were really on the field yesterday? 

00:01:35.706 --> 00:01:37.822
 Great joke, Don Messino 

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:42.408
 But why Don Messino? Who controls everything in Barça? Messi? 

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:48.839
 Villa, son, in Barca manages those who score goals, and those who don't score ... 

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:50.882
 Togo drown in the Mediterranean River! 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.764
 Sorry, Godfather, but not the Mediterranean River, but the Mediterranean Sea 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.103
 Although there is certainly a river, very beautiful and picturesque. 

00:02:04.318 --> 00:02:11.306
 Villa, understand, Barca is a family, and Messi is the Godfather. And if the Godfather wants you to pass him, you 

00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:14.242
 Graze him 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.274
 Very good, very good 

00:02:16.765 --> 00:02:19.249
 I see you understand 

00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:25.063
 Now you can kiss your Messino's hand and go home. 

00:02:34.627 --> 00:02:40.139
 He is a good guy, but so that he does not forget exactly, put a horse's head in his bed 

00:02:40.507 --> 00:02:44.736
 We no longer have horse heads. Laporta ate everything.
