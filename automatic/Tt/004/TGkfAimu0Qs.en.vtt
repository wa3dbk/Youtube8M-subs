00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I'll give you a great example this piece

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.149 
I'll give you a great example this piece
of<00:01:20.430> corn<00:01:20.810> if<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.080> piece<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> corn<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.890> sprayed

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
of corn if this piece of corn is sprayed

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.770 
of corn if this piece of corn is sprayed
with<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> chemical<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.150> caterpillar<00:01:24.600> goes

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
with a chemical and the caterpillar goes

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.100 
with a chemical and the caterpillar goes
on<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> eats<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.680> dies<00:01:26.869> that's<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
on it it eats it and dies that's not the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.719 
on it it eats it and dies that's not the
corn<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.220> my<00:01:29.369> butt<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.700> my

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
corn that I want to put on my butt in my

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
corn that I want to put on my butt in my
bed<00:01:30.060> example<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> difference

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
bed example right so the difference

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.260 
bed example right so the difference
between<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.220> caterpillar<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
between the caterpillar which is this

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
between the caterpillar which is this
big<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.659> me<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.049> sighs<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.220> pesticides

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
big and me is sighs so pesticides

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
big and me is sighs so pesticides
accumulate<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> fat<00:01:37.229> cells<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.159> it's

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
accumulate in the fat cells so it's

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.160 
accumulate in the fat cells so it's
