00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 ok welcome back to my channel yo 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.509
 I'm brenzy and in today's video we're going 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.300
 talking about hair as you can see the 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.610
 title is a homemade recipe and I must say 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.219
 that I love videos like 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.690
 these are cool and especially those of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 the things that are like homemade recipe to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.250
 I love them in their video I play well 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.470
 that I like more than makeup 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.390
 I do it so often because I fail 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 share a recipe bottle of the first 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.529
 I try it and I make sure that a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.109
 recipe that I really like or that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.940
 really give results and what are 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.680
 the results it gives then that takes 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.290
 like a little while because I also 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.960
 investigated well as the property of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.490
 after the ingredient and things like that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.550
 on Tuesdays the video 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.510
 or that we are going to need avocado, we are going to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.880
 also need a banana or banana 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.890
 the complete banana but only the 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.100
 half and the avocado also only 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.460
 like a bit and we're going to need to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.430
 coconut milk that more like coconut cream 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.440
 because they are not there is not liquid is more 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.080
 as a cream as the name says 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.600
 that if they get coconut cream or a 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.140
 coconut milk so thicker much better and 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.670
 Honey is optional honey that is yes 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.650
 you want if you do not have it at hand 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.320
 it does not matter but if they have it it would be good 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.140
 that they throw a little bit to the mixture like this 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.190
 that we begin to mix the first thing that 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.610
 they will do is put all the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.100
 ingredients inside a blender or 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.750
 good blender that's the only thing we're going 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.180
 to do because it will be the way to prepare 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.610
 the mix that we are going to put in the in 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.520
 head and when they have something else or 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.619
 less so can you then pass it to a 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.930
 I talk to something and this is applied in the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.210
 hair as they see I only have one 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.890
 little bit and look at the amount of hair 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.470
 that I have so I do not 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.590
 they need so much just with a little 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.750
 it's enough and I started applying it 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.210
 by the tips and then I took it 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.970
 directly towards the root and if you 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.380
 can be seen as a massage in the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.630
 scalp 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.119
 now with the banana and the avocado 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.340
 that they do not waste it because 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.780
 let's do something then put on later 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.450
 that apply all that put the hair 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.660
 as well as in a bun and cover it with a 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.520
 with a plastic bag or a hat 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.500
 plastic you are the ones who know I do not 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.380
 I had a hat so good and leave 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 There it for about an hour in the head and 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.180
 if you can more time can much better 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.190
 remember that I told them that they did not vote what 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.740
 I had more than enough, so I did something 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.650
 I ate with what I had left and so on 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.690
 I was waiting for him to do the process and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.520
 make the mask effect because I went 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.319
 eating and then in the end just 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.680
 wash my head like I do all 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.599
 the days and the comb as I always do 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.819
 and well that was it for today's video 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.129
 I hope you liked the video 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.780
 true that you can be that took advantage 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.099
 because being the main reason for the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.079
 which I upload video because he wants 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.930

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.269
 another person can benefit from that 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.189

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.409
