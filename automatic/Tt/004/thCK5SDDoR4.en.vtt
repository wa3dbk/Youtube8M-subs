00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.420 
doesn't classify that it takes 130 metal
to<00:01:11.130> teleport<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:14.189> kind

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to teleport but now you know this kind

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
to teleport but now you know this kind
of<00:01:14.520> prevents<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.909> from<00:01:14.939> quickly<00:01:15.630> building

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
of prevents you from quickly building

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.249 
of prevents you from quickly building
other<00:01:16.320> stuff<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:16.860> no<00:01:17.340> due<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.150> teleport<00:01:18.689> they

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
other stuff or no due to teleport they

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.080 
other stuff or no due to teleport they
can<00:01:19.439> move<00:01:19.530> basically<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.340> entire<00:01:20.610> central

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
can move basically your entire central

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.260 
can move basically your entire central
nest<00:01:21.270> if<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:22.520> minus<00:01:23.520> one<00:01:23.729> building<00:01:24.150> of

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
nest if you like minus one building of

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.660 
nest if you like minus one building of
course<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.990> even<00:01:25.159> replacing<00:01:26.159> many

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
course or just even replacing many

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.730 
course or just even replacing many
centuries<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.270> different<00:01:27.570> locations<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
centuries in different locations to that

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.800 
centuries in different locations to that
effect<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.220> cheaper<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:29.970> rebuild<00:01:30.630> your

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
effect it's cheaper to just rebuild your

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.830 
effect it's cheaper to just rebuild your
mini<00:01:31.020> center<00:01:31.460> but<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.729> imagine<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.659> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
mini center but just imagine the kind of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.590 
mini center but just imagine the kind of
tricks<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:35.000> grief<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
tricks and the kind of grief and you can

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
tricks and the kind of grief and you can
do<00:01:36.900> which<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.259> teleporting<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.070> level<00:01:38.340> 3

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
do which is teleporting your level 3

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.420 
do which is teleporting your level 3
century<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> weird<00:01:39.689> location<00:01:40.439> due<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
century into a weird location due to the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.010 
century into a weird location due to the
fact<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.850> just<00:01:41.970> build<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> safe<00:01:42.720> spot

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
fact you can just build on a safe spot

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.520 
fact you can just build on a safe spot
and<00:01:43.259> teleport<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.869> safe<00:01:46.200> spot

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
and teleport it to a not so safe spot

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.679 
and teleport it to a not so safe spot
there's<00:01:47.189> only<00:01:47.250> two<00:01:47.549> limits<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.420> am

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
there's only two limits to it and I am

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
there's only two limits to it and I am
thinking<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:49.829> change

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
thinking that they will change

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
thinking that they will change
especially<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.909> range<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
especially the range of it because the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.660 
especially the range of it because the
range<00:01:51.960> right<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.500> far<00:01:52.710> as<00:01:52.770> I've<00:01:52.950> seen<00:01:52.979> it's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
range right now as far as I've seen it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.179 
range right now as far as I've seen it's
pretty<00:01:53.820> much<00:01:54.299> unlimited<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:55.350> long<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:55.950> you're

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
pretty much unlimited as long as you're

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.480 
pretty much unlimited as long as you're
able<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.820> spot<00:01:57.030> your<00:01:57.960> building<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.920> can

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
able to spot your building you can

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.959 
able to spot your building you can
teleport<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.450> for<00:02:01.110> 130<00:02:01.860> metal<00:02:02.280> there's<00:02:02.759> no

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
teleport it for 130 metal there's no

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
teleport it for 130 metal there's no

to<00:02:07.710> see<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> building<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.550> you're<00:02:08.789> good<00:02:08.970> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
to see the building and you're good to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.839 
to see the building and you're good to
go<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.539> top<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.709> if<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.099> actually<00:02:11.370> do

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
go on top of that if you actually do

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.820 
go on top of that if you actually do
pick<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.300> your<00:02:12.450> building<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.170> marked<00:02:13.500> for

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
pick up your building you get marked for

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.710 
pick up your building you get marked for
but<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.640> also<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> case<00:02:15.030> if<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.330> pick<00:02:15.600> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
but this is also the case if you pick it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.310 
but this is also the case if you pick it
up<00:02:15.810> with<00:02:16.470> your<00:02:16.920> wrench<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.810> basically<00:02:19.020> a

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
up with your wrench so it's basically a

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.440 
up with your wrench so it's basically a
permanent<00:02:19.950> DeMuth<00:02:20.310> every<00:02:20.580> time<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.970> pick<00:02:21.210> a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
permanent DeMuth every time you pick a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.320 
permanent DeMuth every time you pick a
building<00:02:22.110> up<00:02:22.260> when<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.100> are<00:02:23.250> wearing<00:02:23.520> or<00:02:24.090> have

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
building up when you are wearing or have

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.780 
building up when you are wearing or have
to<00:02:24.450> rescue<00:02:24.720> Ranger<00:02:25.560> equipped<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.550> will<00:02:26.700> get

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
to rescue Ranger equipped you will get

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.980 
to rescue Ranger equipped you will get
marked<00:02:27.150> for<00:02:27.300> death<00:02:27.480> so<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.660> become

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
marked for death so you become

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.320 
marked for death so you become
significantly<00:02:28.650> more<00:02:29.000> vulnerable<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.210> be

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
significantly more vulnerable so be

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.930 
significantly more vulnerable so be
extra<00:02:30.540> careful<00:02:30.960> with<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.350> in<00:02:31.950> addition<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
extra careful with that in addition to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.030 
extra careful with that in addition to
that<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.480> also<00:02:33.720> allows<00:02:33.990> you<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> heal<00:02:34.650> your

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
that it also allows you to heal your

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.530 
that it also allows you to heal your
buildings<00:02:35.460> from<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> very<00:02:35.880> large<00:02:36.090> distance

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
buildings from a very large distance

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.570 
buildings from a very large distance
because<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:36.990> I<00:02:37.560> stated<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:38.040> feels<00:02:38.280> more<00:02:38.400> like<00:02:38.460> a

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
because as I stated it feels more like a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.910 
because as I stated it feels more like a
rail<00:02:38.880> gun<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> rifle<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> projectile

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
rail gun or a rifle with a projectile

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.980 
rail gun or a rifle with a projectile
this<00:02:41.370> allows<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.880> shoot<00:02:42.060> across<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.720> map

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
this allows you to shoot across the map

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.900 
this allows you to shoot across the map
if<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:43.980> good<00:02:44.160> aim<00:02:44.370> you

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
if you like so if you have good aim you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.390 
if you like so if you have good aim you
can<00:02:45.090> repair<00:02:45.510> your<00:02:45.540> buildings<00:02:46.260> from<00:02:46.980> across
