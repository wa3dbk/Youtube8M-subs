00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
this mod because the Hydra jet obviously

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.710 
this mod because the Hydra jet obviously
can<00:00:24.119> hover<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> works<00:00:25.740> perfectly

public anyway so let's go check out the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.170 
public anyway so let's go check out the
cones<00:01:53.619> egg<00:01:53.799> a<00:01:53.979> gerenuk<00:01:54.580> stand<00:01:54.880> Here<00:01:55.030> I<00:01:55.060> am

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
cones egg a gerenuk stand Here I am

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.850 
cones egg a gerenuk stand Here I am
flying<00:01:55.720> into<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.140> building<00:01:56.619> like<00:01:57.399> a<00:01:57.460> doofus<00:01:57.820> and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
flying into a building like a doofus and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.100 
flying into a building like a doofus and
the<00:01:59.860> next<00:02:00.340> vehicle<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:01.030> have<00:02:01.270> here<00:02:01.600> is<00:02:01.810> the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
the next vehicle we have here is the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.100 
the next vehicle we have here is the
Cohen<00:02:02.740> sag<00:02:03.130> egg<00:02:03.460> era<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.180> this<00:02:04.360> replaces<00:02:04.899> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
Cohen sag egg era so this replaces the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.040 
Cohen sag egg era so this replaces the
entity<00:02:05.680> XF<00:02:06.220> in<00:02:06.430> your<00:02:06.580> game<00:02:06.880> files<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.720> for

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
entity XF in your game files and for

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.259 
entity XF in your game files and for
good<00:02:08.170> reason<00:02:08.530> because<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:09.250> entity<00:02:09.640> basically

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
good reason because the entity basically

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.850 
good reason because the entity basically
was<00:02:10.420> based<00:02:10.660> off<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.050> Cohen's<00:02:11.410> egg<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.709> can

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
was based off the Cohen's egg you can

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.309 
was based off the Cohen's egg you can
see<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.130> back<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.310> still<00:02:12.730> very<00:02:13.420> similar<00:02:14.050> to
