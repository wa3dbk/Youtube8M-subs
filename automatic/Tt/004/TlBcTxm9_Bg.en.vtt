00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.660
 others on our next video - and how to turn your computer into the 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.550
 northeast 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.520
 in the other five months 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.189
 How does cpc work? 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:13.629
 you and internet search engineers without conviction perfect path starts 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.759
 came improved on windows vista 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.779
 this meeting in 2 7 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.579
 in this aspect of not falling from staying with the unconscious time was me 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.650
 one of the few things that really 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.800
 the good cd view 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.800
 now the profiles had at hand of 2010 you research in the port and on if 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.569
 there was here 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:35.179
 it needs a machine with a little more advanced for you to 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:37.100
 can use the superkite 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 river - the day of the incident 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.690
 you will find on behalf of microsoft recently 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.840
 on the same day at least 2 GB of memory 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.020
 for what you put use of the service 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.130
 why is it a very interesting selection but as a service that 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.870
 background stands for you do not use service 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.850
 he really like a little bit of that memory and you start in June them 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.220
 are a little slow your machine is 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.790
 It really is a class crowd. 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.150
 so it's very simple the perfect ivanoska you kitsune en makes this site it stays 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.050
 background actually 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.480
 is sanctioned 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.360
 Pack your machine 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.880
 the responsible is better 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.890
 I will give an example here for example of application the profiles of it 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.650
 it is difficult to understand how these are the main applications but the date 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.790
 Let's add that the goal is always very good 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.250
 nextel 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.070
 so he will actually catch up with the temporary costs 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.310
 daughter of each leg after temporary market run and when it was done 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.479
 evident when temporary automatically 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.869
 I'm going to be here more in fact the season the Sao Paulo-Pauline will typically be the march 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.549
 that it was thus temporary sagittarius and liu or could be 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.079
 I want to leave, it's going to be faster Sevilha goes to memory 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.100
 is already used faster the small craftsman of the game program anyway what 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.670
 Are you more accustomed to sitting to your brand? 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.380
 so come on, let's start showing you guys, they'll need it. 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.700
 Firstly 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.970
 the record type of the two at the same time we have so bad for you 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.080
 jobs in the world in my classes show you 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.630
 the incident 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.630
 and it sure happens in the ana in the machine studies we 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.529
 and it's important not only for you to really want 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.889
 ibope shows solution let's go there 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:18.299
 let's open first with the record of these records 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.080
 Ok I'm from those of edit not here. 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.369
 in this open attack 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:23.919
 we also took care of 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.809
 our sport in the bus service then changes that yesterday as well 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.599
 in this range open time to render this service of our 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.469
 consuming go to dublin 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.009
 let's minimize 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.169
 and let's do next you will have to now create two risk areas of 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.039
 record 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:43.099
 for 120 to work 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.419
 because otherwise he will get a message from Kim 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.719
 is not used on this operating system as it is now that the 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.339
 modric service and service 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.339
 feel just clicking here or you press the s key between the keyboard 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.389
 the trend here 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.749
 up to 7 7 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:01.339
 surface click here two 20ยบ 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.709
 I think they are keeping and improving deter system over time 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.809
 or it is true because over time your brand ends up getting a bit more 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.449
 my family to call me 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:12.909
 already gives a recovered one of a breathed in his machine more or less 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.329
 what I told you about earlier 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.999
 when the attack is the type of automatic view cvt start 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.859
 it will automatically go as it appears with the apply 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.439
 have to give an error because the three areas are starting 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.759
 on high trying and discrimination can start from these computer profiles 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:35.799
 this operation is not configured to be that we do not create 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.799
 those from the state records contacted who 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.989
 disable 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.099
 to apply 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.139
 let's minimize us now that wants to have a record basket will be who 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.289
 quel such a martini and already let open that it trafficked space 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.200
 insist 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.950
 is that for now the site 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.269
 said 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.899
 session manager 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.479
 in the morning deserving 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.989
 and present fact to have parameters for the surface 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.980
 only you click here in the state the mayor for us 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.409
 automatically davi that was born right ends up such you just level buti 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.959
 boot frenzy vitro 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.199
 he's in me already I've seen all options and that we can have one of two 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.359
 options here 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.969
 so come on 

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.389
 let's think they create the cult of the project by then 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.710
 worth of wall street the petistas if it is not my part you only put in the 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.319
 Wednesday 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.170
 and said he felt 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.479
 he is good 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.069
 by this system the one who has good persists exactly costs 7 that in the screen 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.419
 hot 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.400
 clicked on top 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.629
 data of value 3 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:48.889
 Whenever there is trouble here 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.699
 and we'll have one more 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.650
 Let's have the focus right now. 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.919
 super cub 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.919
 Ok let's go to 92 Pit Bull where he died 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.280
 now you will call and deny the superkite 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.219
 exactly this way here 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:04.860
 and every time teaching 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.790
 and given seasonal center logo 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.839
 number three 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.539
 to minimize it may be that it is already working the opponents but 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.219
 we create 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:14.889
 here and services 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.529
 tequila surfaces 

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:17.990
 activated tanks 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.349
 two time up type of nationalization as automatic tac a pickup nissan 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:23.490
 It will already appear 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.479
 start 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.289
 I wish it now goes no further 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.389
 only the service 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:29.550
 initiated 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.759
 in the 80's that we should stop if we want to fund here 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.210
 We are going to close 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.629
 we close this register 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.099
 tabitha machine system that really wants to give one more searched between 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.349
 these people because in thesis is even threatened in the consequent actually asks 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.520
 a lot of time here 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.060
 So it's okay, I'll go, Paulo.
