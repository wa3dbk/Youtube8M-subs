00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.400
 he wants to resume market leadership 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.799
 and for that it got bigger and bet on a 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.120
 visual but a new 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.070
 When will she have to pass the test? 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.050
 from the reader of the online car here 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.200
 whether in fact will be able to overcome the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.390
 honda civic and you will say that you 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.580
 liked the inner space of the new corolla 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.040
 It is very spacious and has plenty of space. 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.990
 for the legs very comfortable 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.030
 Do you think there was a lack of door here in the 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.339
 internal space is not thought to be missing 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.370
 door and also a support for the 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.370
 arm 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.679
 And here you found the look of the 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.210
 new corolla 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.600
 well actually I found a visual 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.629
 quite sporty does not play enough 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.940
 Exquisite a profile a little more 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.550
 Gentlemen, but I would buy a car from that. 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.289
 my team the financial condition allows 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.710
 that 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.350
 the edit is okay that you found then 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.160
 of the driving position of the new corolla 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.350
 looks incomplete team has a series of 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.070
 settings on the bank where you can 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.680
 need to match your height to your column 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.990
 in the competition actor the steering wheel 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.759
 has 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.130
 it is here in the column that position that you 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 pull the steering wheel forwards or backwards 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.040
 according to its position not only 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.240
 community is very interesting and 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.680
 comfortable and very pleasant to drive 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.149
 then it is probable that this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.450
 here is the input version of the new 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.390
 corolla for 69,990 with the exchange 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.729
 and engine 1.8 in this version 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.310
 some equipment such as 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.830
 leather central multimedia do you think 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.110
 for this price you need these items more 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.619
 I really miss it, I really miss it. 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.640
 which takes a lot of traffic in the city of são 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.459
 Paulo 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.720
 the multimedia center is here to have fun 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.850
 a little 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.519
 the exchange rate is good but it lacks a bank 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.530
 leather for a name corolla né 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.110
 already has that tendency like my other 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.480
 car truck 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.120
 I think I'd put an alloy wheel 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.860
 take also 18 né perón design has a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.470
 little more invoked 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.670
 lack a little more pizzazz 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 which would be the largest wheel 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.640
 But hey, you were commenting to me. 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.220
 that the panel is a bit strange what 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 you think of him I did not like the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.849
 watches do not think legal 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.430
 the information is more per passenger and the 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.170
 driver driver and you got it 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.420
 take the most talked about view of the 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 Left here I found it very big here 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.610
 We're cool, just the issue here. 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.290
 the information design has three more 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.290
 that the driver of the passenger type 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.140
 It's okay that you found the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.640
 here is the new corolla that the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.970
 behind the car 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.489
 Good, I finally liked the whole car. 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.459
 because the design he thought was kind of like this 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.980
 an older crowd so I thought 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.160
 this new snub at home another one 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.110
 younger staff, everything else that I 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.480
 I also liked the trunk so I did not 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.640
 I know if the one before the type a little 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.530
 smaller and he is much bigger but I 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:35.299
 I really liked it and I will have this system 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:35.299
 to open the trunk in the key in the year 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.230
 have to insure we program I 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.330
 I really liked it 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.390
 find it will ease at the time of you 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.030
 supplies after the market on a journey 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.190
 facilitate is certainly even when 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.890
 if it's inside the car 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.060
 someone is going to load I work with bari 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.220
 I need someone 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.570
 finally, it carries things for me, it's great 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.570
 to connect it 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.629
 It's worth playing, and you praised the 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.150
 trunk is fit enough thing not 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.250
 fits a hair your brother koerich sack 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.150
 put it inside but it gets super 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.150
 comfortable there
