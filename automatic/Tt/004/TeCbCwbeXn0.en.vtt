sort<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.819> mixture<00:00:06.120> between<00:00:06.270> Minecraft<00:00:07.140> and

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
sort of a mixture between Minecraft and

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.020 
sort of a mixture between Minecraft and
Terraria<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.069> found<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.460> on<00:00:08.639> planet

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
Terraria I found this on planet

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.509 
Terraria I found this on planet
minecraft<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:10.440> thought<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.040> was<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> mod<00:00:11.400> at

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
minecraft and I thought it was a mod at

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.240 
minecraft and I thought it was a mod at
first<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:12.120> it's<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.900> completely<00:00:13.380> different<00:00:14.040> or

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
first but it's a completely different or

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.269 
first but it's a completely different or
new<00:00:14.700> game<00:00:15.089> basically<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.680> collected<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
new game basically and I collected a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
new game basically and I collected a
little<00:00:17.789> piece<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.029> wood<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.449> we<00:00:19.020> can<00:00:19.050> actually

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
little piece of wood so we can actually

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.349 
little piece of wood so we can actually
go<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.890> place<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.760> inventory<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.330> can

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.910 
go and place it in the inventory you can
only<00:00:21.570> place<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> bottom<00:00:22.590> left<00:00:22.800> hand

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
only place it in the bottom left hand

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.759

my head is looking at and let's go place

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.529 
my head is looking at and let's go place
down<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.050> actual<00:00:46.440> umm<00:00:47.090> crafting<00:00:48.090> table<00:00:48.420> it's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
down the actual umm crafting table it's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.299 
down the actual umm crafting table it's
right-click<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.440> create<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.920> pickaxe

exploring<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.120> bit<00:00:54.390> I'll<00:00:54.809> guess<00:00:55.079> I'll

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
exploring a little bit I'll guess I'll

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.660 
exploring a little bit I'll guess I'll
leave<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.920> sort<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> little

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
leave it like sort of like that a little

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.670 
leave it like sort of like that a little
bit<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> let's<00:00:57.300> play<00:00:57.600> sort<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> I'll<00:00:58.410> play

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
bit of a let's play sort of I'll play

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
bit of a let's play sort of I'll play
for<00:00:58.940> 15-20<00:00:59.940> minutes<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.629> kind<00:01:01.050> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
for 15-20 minutes see what kind of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
for 15-20 minutes see what kind of
shenanigans<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.070> get<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:03.000> I've

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
shenanigans we can get up to now I've

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.880 
shenanigans we can get up to now I've
only<00:01:03.660> really<00:01:04.379> done<00:01:05.180> just<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.510> dug<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
only really done just really dug this is

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.200 
only really done just really dug this is
probably<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> furthest<00:01:08.640> I've<00:01:08.790> dug<00:01:09.000> before

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
probably the furthest I've dug before

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.230 
probably the furthest I've dug before
and<00:01:10.070> we<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.220> back<00:01:11.400> you're<00:01:11.580> going<00:01:11.700> pretty<00:01:11.939> far

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and we go back you're going pretty far

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.270 
and we go back you're going pretty far
where<00:01:12.659> diggy<00:01:13.020> diggy<00:01:13.140> holy<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.860> we're<00:01:14.159> going

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
where diggy diggy holy and we're going

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
where diggy diggy holy and we're going
to<00:01:14.340> see<00:01:14.580> how<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> actually<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.659> mechanics<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to see how it actually the mechanics of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.719 
to see how it actually the mechanics of
it<00:01:16.470> works<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.979> need<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.280> place<00:01:17.490> down

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it works do we need to place down

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.149 
it works do we need to place down
torches<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.600> what<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.680> sort<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> other

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
torches or what what sort of other

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
torches or what what sort of other
shenanigans<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:21.000> can<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.330> up<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.750> think

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
shenanigans we can get up to and I think

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.870 
shenanigans we can get up to and I think
there's<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.229> cave<00:01:22.470> over<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.549> we'll<00:01:23.700> just

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
there's a cave over here so we'll just

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
there's a cave over here so we'll just
go<00:01:24.240> over<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.600> oh<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
go over here and oh this is just a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.789 
go over here and oh this is just a
normal<00:01:26.119> version<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.450> Minecraft<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.470> no

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
normal version of Minecraft I have no

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.219 
normal version of Minecraft I have no
idea<00:01:29.130> what<00:01:29.340> how<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> stumbled<00:01:29.970> across<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.689> but

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
idea what how I stumbled across this but

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
idea what how I stumbled across this but
I<00:01:31.259> managed<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> find<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.670> thought<00:01:32.880> why

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
I managed to find it and I thought why

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
I managed to find it and I thought why
not<00:01:33.180> I'll<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.630> play<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.439> make<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> video

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
not I'll just play it and make a video

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
not I'll just play it and make a video
on<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.270> looks<00:01:36.450> pretty<00:01:36.540> cool<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
on it because it looks pretty cool and I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.670 
on it because it looks pretty cool and I
should<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.829> jump<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.299> sure<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.930> if

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
should we jump I'm not sure I don't if

plays oh that seems quite interesting
and<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.770> wonder<00:05:00.070> what<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.400> might<00:05:00.940> be<00:05:01.180> that's

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
and I wonder what that might be that's

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.420 
and I wonder what that might be that's
probably<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.720> brewing<00:05:02.110> that's<00:05:03.040> it<00:05:03.220> but<00:05:03.340> that's

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
probably a brewing that's it but that's

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.460 
probably a brewing that's it but that's
a<00:05:03.580> different<00:05:03.790> I<00:05:04.030> sort<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.300> animation<00:05:04.870> icon

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
a different I sort of animation icon

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.500 
a different I sort of animation icon
basically<00:05:06.160> this<00:05:06.220> is<00:05:06.430> probably<00:05:06.760> hopefully
