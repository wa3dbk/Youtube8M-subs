00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
barrier so I still have to be there I'm

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.260 
barrier so I still have to be there I'm
holding<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.140> door<00:01:29.320> open<00:01:29.350> but<00:01:29.740> my<00:01:29.920> pets<00:01:30.280> cannot

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
get out and this is really made out of a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.970 
get out and this is really made out of a
material<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.870> they<00:01:34.930> can't<00:01:35.380> really

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
material that they can't really

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.960

compromise<00:01:36.790> absolutely<00:01:37.750> it's<00:01:37.960> an<00:01:38.080> opaque<00:01:38.410> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
compromise absolutely it's an opaque a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.880 
compromise absolutely it's an opaque a
single<00:01:39.970> sheet<00:01:40.270> opaque<00:01:41.020> material<00:01:41.230> so<00:01:41.770> they

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
single sheet opaque material so they

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.770 
single sheet opaque material so they
