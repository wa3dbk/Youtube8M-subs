00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.860
 have enjoyed so many finals in the 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.619
 last time in these last two years 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.000
 that have a different flavor this 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.009
 because you are down in the 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.970
 marker for the first time talking about the 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:22.130
 local tournament how difficult it means to 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.140
 you this challenge of having to overcome 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.840
 an adverse marker by the minimum 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 difference thanks we are a little 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.300
 used to playing late but in 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.590
 this time with an equal result are 1 to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.810
 0 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.350
 we have already lived in the semifinal against 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.500
 Santa Fe 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.500
 and we can give it back here at home 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.949
 that tomorrow we have another final 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.219
 difficult and turn it around 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.589
 the group is psyched that this 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.640
 match can be turned can be 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.690
 come out champion so let's go with that idea 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.489
 they are three games and that athletic 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.690
 national score goal does not count 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.250
 any equipment would be normal but not 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.920
 national as well a team of very many 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.960
 goals that so what happened has a 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.280
 little bit of anxiety like this is football does not 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.319
 wants to enter the ring was closed with 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.000
 those three games that analyzes do 

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:14.830
 you especially you who is one of 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.050
 the framed as a man is goal of 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.899
 the national medication has been 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.300
 characterized by having a lot of volume of 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.490
 attack for creating many goal options 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.230
 and I think we've demonstrated we 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.990
 created but as you say we have been 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.120
 closed to the arch I think we're 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.120
 mentalized that tomorrow 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.310
 we can reverse this is a 1 to 0 what 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.770
 we could achieve against santa fe we know 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.590
 that we are with our people we have 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.560
 to be psyched that tomorrow is 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.930
 the last game we have to leave 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.030
 life to return to be champion 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.240
 jefferson at the end of the practice we saw 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.170
 who tried shots from the penalty point 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.090
 also free throws in case a 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.460
 closed that you can only match 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.520
 and take it to those instances of the criminal 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.280
 you contemplate that possibility by 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.649
 that they were asked or was emphasized by 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.770
 part of you and the teacher thank you I think 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.580
 which is the last thing that has been thought of in 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.000
 team we want 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.800
 define the series as soon as possible 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.270
 to not get to that instance I think that 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.880
 as you saw it was the last thing 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.610
 it was practiced and not and it was not practiced 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.710
 many were practiced only two passes 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.540
 of criminal and then we are not 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.640
 mentalized that we're going to go to 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.380
 instances we want to turn the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.030
 marker as soon as possible that 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.400
 I would recommend adjusting the partners to 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.080
 counteract those team momentum 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.720
 junior or as we did in 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.620
 barranquilla 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.570
 in Barranquilla , what comes against is the 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.170
 front of attack of juniors with 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.170
 fast players 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.910
 and the defense controlled control every 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.700
 game action of each of them 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.660
 so tomorrow do the same thing do what 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.250
 same we know that we need to look for two 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.640
 doubles to win champions 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.850
 then go find those goals but 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.550
 you're fine signing back do not give 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.820
 deconcentrate is pending of each 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.290
 then mark more or less the same as 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.290
 it was done in the previous match
