00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 I realized for now are you okay 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.830
 italy is fine then they are regular and 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.550
 then with the flag on the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.280
 shoulders, boroughs, here we are, then 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.350
 tells her that in short, however, it is not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.439
 outside of politics is an economist is 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.420
 was one of the main architects of the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.359
 anti-euro battle in the country 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.630
 election says that someone says she's a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.490
 ideologue of salvini of the league at least 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.550
 economically 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.410
 certainly on the economic level we are 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.980
 responsible economic officer 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.239
 of the Northern League 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.730
 they made it responsible and or however on the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 economic plan we tell uneasiness 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.309
 of the pitchforks and its while the story 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.360
 in front of montecitorio of employees 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.930
 of the Italian red cross 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.180
 iraq and these guys 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.280
 from tomorrow greenback work in the moment in 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.750
 which this becomes a private entity 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.969
 then there are so many stories 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.140
 every day there is only the embarrassment of the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.460
 chosen every day in Italy slowly 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.950
 closes something 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.159
 and pity that not only is not done 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.880
 nothing but damage and in fact me 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.909
 when I saw the stories 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.039
 let's say the dl of the degradation of Rome mi mi 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.320
 makes a double regret because first thing 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:31.009
 I see a disgust that I wouldn't like 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.369
 see second what these stories 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.920
 then they distract from other stories that are 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.360
 maybe a little bit cleaner but that 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.939
 they do even more damage 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.700
 I don't know, for example, I quote two yesterday 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.829
 we found that brilliant 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.289
 battle for made in italy that 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.390
 it had to be the flagship of the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.310
 presidency semester of renzi is over 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.619
 in 0 in nothing 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.009
 we find out that the south stream pipeline 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.530
 that maybe something was needed both at 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.630
 ours to our economy is the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.890
 our main company namely 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:10.579
 that we deleted it because of the gods 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.940
 sanctions to the police and I wonder but 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.680
 since things are not just these 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.829
 there the list is starting to become 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.340
 a little bit long because that's fine 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:25.069
 rome but we don't know for example 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:28.220
 montepaschi we have orsoni in venice 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.470
 always pd we have deputy pd of 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.569
 renzi because it was the leopolda noah of 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.010
 stefano who has the news I see that 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.019
 he was in Switzerland with millions in 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.709
 briefcases with millions of cash 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.280
 I say 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.290
 what is the limit for which the pd makes moves 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.100
 from home and a little bit and does a bit of 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.470
 pause 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.000
 then I can give I would like to remember 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.769
 such means one thing the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.870
 wants to remember but I would like to remember 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.239
 something that in Piedmont, however, reimbursement 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.799
 costs of 40 euros 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.889
 I would like to mention that in Piedmont for a 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.480
 reimbursement of expenses of 40 euros the famous ones 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.500
 shorts the alloy were used still 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.359
 a ride 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.329
 no problem that is in the sense one 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.940
 even wrong for just 40 euros and then yes 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.069
 stay a ride is okay so me 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.750
 I ask what the level is, what the cost is 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.730
 because the pd is at home a ride 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.780
 we have to wait to get to a billion 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.340
 we have to wait to get to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.310
 bankruptcy we have to wait to arrive 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.900
 less 5 of pil I don't know, they tell me 5 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.459
 after at least we know when it comes to 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.849
 answer that they make a whistle to 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.220
 home I remember belsito lovers 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.370
 I remember the situations of the lovers of 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.920
 site first I repeat we have 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.530
 paid yes yes you were at home a ride e 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.000
 then do not give to the party was not a 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.769
 damage to the Italians was a damage to the 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.930
 Parma looks and was giving me reason 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.489
 strength I'm giving reason for this I'm 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.480
 arguing that if there are any 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.370
 bad apples 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.470
 we must treat them like bad apples 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.239
 but it goes without saying that the apple 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.819
 march represents a whole movement 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.459
 all a party if in Stefano's and there 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.860
 are the responsibilities extend 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.200
 state responsibilities extend into 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.000
 time when there is a system with use 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.250
 the moment they are the people but 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.310
 in the parties there are lights exist neither 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:16.039
 with a nod you spoke earlier of the kneading trough 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.949
 in 2014, the ministerial cupboard did 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:21.739
 a strong decree which is the decree that 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.870
 allows to commission the abbots 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.450
 this I repeat the only we remember also 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.310
 that berlusconi and who the francisco vintage 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:34.700
 why not no no and then in the end how it is 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.450
 it's cleaner I call it lusi I don't want 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.770
 to know why they can guide public 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.849
 sooner or later they will have to talk because 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.789
 they cannot continue to do the 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.280
 autistic and always talk to each other 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:50.120
 in their myths for their facebook goes 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.280
 well, villages that said I saw it is 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.930
 but if they speak we hear a moment 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.250
 moment we do not hear Milan 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.200
 let's try to understand why but better 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.940
 so yes now so that's better 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.010
 I meant that a watershed 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.940
 important of the 5 stars were the 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.700
 European elections 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.650
 because now these are details but 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.090
 at the beginning we say so of the end is 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.090
 occurred in the European elections where 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.539
 there had to be overtaking and this was it 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.120
 unfortunately for me for all the fault of a 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.300
 wrong strategy because I had them 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.000
 probed trying to see if they were there 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.920
 possibility to make a 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.930
 large common front against the euro e 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.550
 Europe in the European elections 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.650
 as I remember this attempt 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.710
 approaching but then cricket away 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.540
 racing with no result with then 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.210
 the league was the only party that went 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.740
 together, the Italian brothers convicted 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.120
 against the euro, they are Europe 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.370
 they presented with a position 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.960
 absolutely absurd and unfortunately 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.060
 began to be punished by the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.120
 voters and when to start 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.040
 it grows so much and growth takes place 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.630
 then interrupts it is dangerous and not 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.640
 however, it is no longer possible to recover vi 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.240
 I also give the news because until now 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.830
 we always have always talked about 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.200
 alternative 5 star only alternative to 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.770
 rose if you were going to vote a 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.360
 rome for any reason binds it 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.450
 matteo salvini's league will be 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.990
 absolutely the field and with trying to 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:16.360
 bring this ideas and skills 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:19.510
 our giove aes also who could 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.340
 being in the field we will not discuss 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.570
 carefully because we will have to because 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.160
 obviously we didn't expect it 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.229
 an acceleration of events of this 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.410
 type but I assure you that it will be chosen with 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.940
 maximum transparency and competence as 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.669
 we did then later for emilia 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.190
 plaintive romagna financing will be 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.950
 a Roman chosen a Roman will be chosen 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.560
 that is salvini could apply to do 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.650
 I do not believe the mayor of Rome 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.120
 honestly however basic as we have 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.630
 decided to do in emilia romagna is 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.930
 better than 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.250
 the rulers come from the places though 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.610
 she does not even exclude Sir e 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.200
 to govern but I don't know I don't exclude 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.230
 nothing for seven years that Roman has a 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.910
 Mayor to roma is since yesterday in Rome 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.010
 tract but at home law that in streaming 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:08.020
 true for extremes with the director 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.020
 I don't think that it was like saying
