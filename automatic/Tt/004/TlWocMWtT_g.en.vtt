cuber and again something that pc does
very<00:03:59.910> nicely<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:01.500> capture<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:02.489> artists

with any accessories the it's the best

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.640 
with any accessories the it's the best
part<00:04:16.079> about<00:04:16.169> them<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.940> long<00:04:18.650> drooping

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650

and<00:04:28.500> that's<00:04:29.500> about<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.340> figure<00:04:30.730> doesn't

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
and that's about it the figure doesn't

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.909 
and that's about it the figure doesn't
he<00:04:32.080> really<00:04:32.889> requires<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.520> stand<00:04:34.770> because<00:04:35.770> he's

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
he really requires a stand because he's

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:42.210 
he really requires a stand because he's
kind<00:04:36.699> of<00:04:37.110> oddly<00:04:38.110> balanced<00:04:39.780> and<00:04:41.010> there's<00:04:42.010> not

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
kind of oddly balanced and there's not

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.900 
kind of oddly balanced and there's not
much<00:04:43.320> in<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.410> way<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.560> plausibility<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:47.910> would

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
much in the way of plausibility so would

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:56.460 
much in the way of plausibility so would
