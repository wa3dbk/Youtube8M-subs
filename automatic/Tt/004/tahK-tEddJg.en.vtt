00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:21.029
 plain and simple 1946 "This is the fairly simple name of the newest and most up-to-date 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 at the same time in the last add-ons for the now legendary 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.630
 flight simulation 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.130
 the Else where Stondzik we have now as in many plants now classic 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.580
 Flight simulation which is slightly victory over TuS though weapon often 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.040
 or the 19 46 extension flair it's sweeping on the runway then flying 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.080
 Aircraft the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.700
 l at the end of World War II on the Rails boards at most the 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 but they had never come into combat in reality 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.690
 or where it is relatively unsure if they have ever flown Hello 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.770
 and welcome to our test 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 the first machine we want to watch together short video this 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.750
 definitely not in World War II in combat mission flown that's the crux 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.000
 83 from the development program advantage of his mark also the developer of 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.610
 legendary Focke Wulf 190 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.380
 and the gun with which the four are equipped and not the right one 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.600
 also fired that this is the Dietz 4 air air missile which is mine 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.969
 After all, not even in combat mission flown in World War II 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.520
 works quite similar to a diva in the game 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.929
 loathe the light at the back of the rocket and then steer it with you 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:28.340
 the arrow keys to the finish 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.190
 Of course, not only the Luftwaffe gets its future everyone but 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.410
 So also the woman for the time being so the Soviet Air Force here we see 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.360
 Example in Büchen hunter mic 9 Dr actually flown after the war 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.910
 is and was also in active use at the attack in Russian 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.660
 Air forces in total are 32 new aircraft in there that we can fly 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.670
 Overall, with all the other add-ons that are also present then often 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.370
 So we come to a number on a truly astronomical number of 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.539
 229 aircraft 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.410
 which we are allowed to fly 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.230
 and as usual in the now where series they cockpits all these 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.580
 it should be really beautiful from the Aussie with new ones too i saw 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.980
 consider them to be the right place for the fpö instruments that work 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.909
 all the caption voices all 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.799
 Let's go from Metro now and that will probably be in the near future 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.029
 probably only from the new game of Ola - namely surpassed by the double 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.029
 become 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.340
 who knows where not yet but nevertheless for the aviation and for the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.809
 World War II can inspire 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.949
 or who maybe now where already hard and h the previous expansion 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:45.639
 has not bought the should definitely have 19 46 probably mine 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.119
 Opinion, because there is currently nothing comparable to Marc 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.619
 This is a huge package with over 200 aircraft with an incredible number 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:55.550
 Painting on rental rates mission 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.110
 with percent of the possibility to record videos with campaigns though right now 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.690
 in my opinion they are still the weak point of the game 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.290
 Even though the developers keep claiming it during Lina Mischa 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.550
 At any rate, some campaigns are very dynamic in my opinion they are 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.140
 not really dynamic 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.990
 settle the whole but conflict is so very very limited it is 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.400
 no comparison with that in seven campaigns of Verden 4 0 for example 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.010
 But that's also the sum for the only thing you really accuse the game 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.489
 can 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.259
 Above all, one must also be concerned 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.590
 how cold the series basically is 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.370
 and it's even more amazing how good the part still looks like 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.690
 it still feels like it 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.900
 what extent it offers and that is 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.569
 even today in 2006 the reference for al al can to 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.189
 Nations Cup 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.479
 or e-mails and his team have really worked hard with the 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.600
 last expansion for the original now where Sturmovik 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.290
 because here everything is actually represented, what ever Anett us 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.800
 officially called us by developers was producing and list of 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.640
 Airplanes is really so long ago that you can not count them anymore 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.390
 can here in a conclusion but yes nothing special because the original 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.230
 Problems of the game persist even if the developers insist 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.960
 that her campaign is a dynamic campaign No, that's not her 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.960
 compare comparable with percent hold 4 0 for example is at all 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.459
 not because now it still feels like we're constantly around 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.280
 in the living room would fly because the cards are just too small and it 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.150
 just does not really happen much outside of what the player does 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.640
 This mission does not have to be a major problem in your career 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.380
 from now where if they can live with it if they are not on a campaign 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.470
 So much value is just impossible with as many as possible now 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.160
 one is as typical as possible and Orco was simulated World War II 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.220
 Aircraft wanting to get rescued by the area is the thing mandatory purchase
