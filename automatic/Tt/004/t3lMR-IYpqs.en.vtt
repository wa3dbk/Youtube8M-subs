00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
by how much sympathy I had for Zod at a

by how much sympathy I had for Zod at a
certain<00:00:22.480> point<00:00:22.660> once<00:00:23.019> he<00:00:23.170> explains<00:00:23.650> what's

couple of punches you know or a kick or
you<00:01:45.610> know<00:01:45.729> jumping<00:01:46.450> off<00:01:46.630> something<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:48.340> thing

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
you know jumping off something the thing

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.810 
you know jumping off something the thing
that's<00:01:48.820> very<00:01:48.880> exhausting<00:01:49.720> is<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:51.040> belly<00:01:51.430> pan

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
that's very exhausting is the belly pan

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.450 
that's very exhausting is the belly pan
which<00:01:52.240> Henry<00:01:52.750> actually<00:01:52.930> has<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.380> do<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.799> lot<00:01:54.220> I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
which Henry actually has to do a lot I

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.310 
which Henry actually has to do a lot I
didn't<00:01:54.700> have<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.940> do<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.090> that<00:01:55.299> much<00:01:55.540> but<00:01:55.869> when

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
didn't have to do it that much but when

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.899 
didn't have to do it that much but when
you're<00:01:56.440> trying<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.799> float<00:01:57.130> trying<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.520> stay<00:01:57.729> on

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
you're trying to float trying to stay on

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.740 
you're trying to float trying to stay on
the<00:01:58.119> oh<00:01:58.479> my<00:01:58.840> god<00:01:59.049> yeah<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.770> takes<00:01:59.979> a<00:02:00.100> lot<00:02:00.310> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
the oh my god yeah that takes a lot of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.390 
the oh my god yeah that takes a lot of
that<00:02:01.750> takes<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.020> lot<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.170> energy<00:02:02.350> I've<00:02:03.070> got<00:02:03.310> to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
that takes a lot of energy I've got to

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.679 
that takes a lot of energy I've got to
think<00:02:03.549> the<00:02:03.640> scenes<00:02:03.880> with<00:02:04.030> Russell<00:02:04.420> must<00:02:04.570> have

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
think the scenes with Russell must have

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.000 
think the scenes with Russell must have
