mechanic that is to say who will inherit
the<00:02:20.440> throne<00:02:20.470> when<00:02:21.370> your<00:02:21.550> current<00:02:22.000> ruler<00:02:22.300> dies

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
the throne when your current ruler dies

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.050 
the throne when your current ruler dies
the<00:02:22.840> character<00:02:23.230> you're<00:02:23.350> playing<00:02:23.700> say<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.730> have

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
the character you're playing say I have

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.250 
the character you're playing say I have
a<00:02:26.100> daughter<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.220> three<00:02:27.730> sons<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:29.200> the

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
a daughter and three sons now the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.350 
a daughter and three sons now the
daughter<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:29.860> eldest<00:02:30.250> child<00:02:30.490> so

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
daughter is the eldest child so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.810 
daughter is the eldest child so
according<00:02:31.990> to<00:02:32.080> some<00:02:32.350> maybe<00:02:33.280> she<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
according to some maybe she is the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.630 
according to some maybe she is the
rightful<00:02:34.180> heir<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.410> what<00:02:36.070> will<00:02:36.220> happen<00:02:36.250> then

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
rightful heir so what will happen then

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.190 
rightful heir so what will happen then
when<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.820> die<00:02:36.940> is<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> daughter<00:02:37.930> will

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
when I die is that the daughter will

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.460 
when I die is that the daughter will
inherit<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.910> sons<00:02:40.180> might<00:02:41.050> very<00:02:41.410> well

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
inherit but the sons might very well

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.830 
inherit but the sons might very well

in the period it's set in medieval times
you<00:03:39.100> have<00:03:39.250> more<00:03:39.489> than<00:03:39.640> 10,000<00:03:40.450> characters<00:03:40.720> you

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
you have more than 10,000 characters you

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.630

so it's both open-ended and historical

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.430 
so it's both open-ended and historical
which<00:03:53.920> sounds<00:03:54.880> like<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.030> paradox<00:03:55.390> but<00:03:56.079> then<00:03:56.320> we

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
which sounds like a paradox but then we

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.130 
which sounds like a paradox but then we
are<00:03:56.590> pirates
