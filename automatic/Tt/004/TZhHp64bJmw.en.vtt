00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.680
 we have to wait 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.770
 very good to all we are here a 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.960
 more week in this video I'm going to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.510
 teach how to make a braid that is going to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 take a lot this season we have 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800
 several seasons wearing braids and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 Well, well, in this video, I'm going to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.400
 teach an amazing braid that has 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 all the pros that you can take for 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.510
 example can do as the effect 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.980
 visual that we have more hair can 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 make as a visual effect that also what 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 we have much longer 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.870
 and on top it's easy to make more 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.930
 You can ask for everything we can 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 wish this video is in collaboration 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.250
 with a youtuber that has started 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.379
 very little is called roxana muñoz ella 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.600
 is going to make the video with makeup 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.460
 spring a makeup that we started on 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.470
 day and how can we turn it into a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.810
 evening makeup I'll leave you the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.940
 video here and also in the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.420
 information box for you to go to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.149
 your channel I hope you like it and inside 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.580
 video let's start by taking a 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.380
 partition where we want to start from 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 the braid the higher the better because 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.160
 the visual effect is a longer braid 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.530
 that is, the longer hair and what 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.390
 we are going to do is that when we introduce 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.430
 the two fingers we get three 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.190
 partitions three different strands 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.619
 As you can see, what I do is cross the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.990
 two lateral locks down and then 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.149
 the superior gets between the two 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.970
 always below this is a braid of 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.090
 normal root but inverse 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.910
 and now all the time is the same to the 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.540
 Once I put a strand I added a little 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:01.750
 amount of that side side 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.750
 and it has been continuously 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.710
 and 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.310
 As I told you this about the same time 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.860
 I put the images from here for 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.640
 that you see it clearer and I'm lame 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.440
 side amount and I put it in the middle 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 that we are left in a medium for 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.420
 move it to the next side is important 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.120
 that every time we 're going to do not the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.640
 braid more or less in half and then never 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.530
 and then until the end we will go 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.349
 opening a little hair so that 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.940
 already go taking shape the hair in the 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.680
 area of ​​the neck is very important that 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.190
 we stick a lot to the scalp 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.150
 so that it does not remain loose and is well 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.560
 made the braid now and next phase 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.569
 when we arrived at hours never as I have 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 said let's open the hair without 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:03.750
 fear that there seems to be good quantity 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.750
 let a good 30 come out and there we go 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.060
 i 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.790
 once we finish the braid 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.020
 we specify there well highlighting what and 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.240
 is already 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.450
 this is all as you see is one remains 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.220
 super lucid and elegant braid and that 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.280
 besides being a braid from so 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.180
 up does a crest effect 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.710
 You see of beautiful voluminous lateral and 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.960
 it looks like we have a braid 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.410
 impressive and a quantity of hair 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.810
 of nvidia or without viticultural make the 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.190
