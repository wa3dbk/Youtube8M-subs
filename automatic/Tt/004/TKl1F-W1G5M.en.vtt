00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.859
 I will also do with a very guest 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.350

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.350
 I would present it then the beginning 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.900
 Y 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.900
 First 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:42.170
 of the ingredients we have I'm going to do 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.170
 pure as a kind of lastras 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.780
 yes 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.940
 where there are charges 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:10.360
 I come 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:15.460
 with this premise do not let eggs and 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.200
 ham cheese and us with stone so 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.190
 we have previously counted on some 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.190
 inmates younger than you 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.820
 good to the tray of our oil 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.180
 and until the next 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.750
 wait a minute now let's put them 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.010
 well in this case we have enough 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.050
 we have to do it in two runs but 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.460
 the personal we have this science 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.630
 of the things that are learned from 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.229
 patience 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.229
 good 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.450
 why 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:21.230
 but we can help while we have 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.000
 oven capacity and not having to do 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.520
 we are preparing the other dish that 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.750
 do in this case the british and 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.730
 we are sorry but they are 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.570
 pressing because the onion is that 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.570
 It was very cool 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.140
 as you see, we use half an hour 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.819
 if not more 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.819
 well we are here you know 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.310
 White 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:03.040
 and a toast and without alcohol 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.040
 eating we're going marina 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.849
 well here we are preparing the 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.849
 minimal 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.680
 we are here with the snacks 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.430
 zucchini we throw the ham and now 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.739
 what we are going to do is to take a 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.710
 quesito the same type of cheese is never 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.410
 with as long as it's only that 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.270
 then we cut also in portions 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.400
 individual 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.780
 and we put it 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.780
 my mate marta 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.230
 from the source 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:14.909
 then we are going to fold and the ham is going 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.909
 to stay but we are going to do it 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.310
 The special moment is to double the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.210
 we take with a fork of another small 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.590
 so as not to burn us, they are forming 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:37.630
 crush so that those are the ones that 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:39.690
 say and then we'll see that they went to 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.470
 Jubilee will be finished 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.970
 that very well enough 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.220
 while it is oriented, the sofrito ends 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.450
 I'm going to put this in the oven so that 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.450
 she melts the cheese 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.960
 I want it to fall a lot 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.900
 sometimes from soliman 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.580
 for money 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.050
 if it 's good 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.050

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.740
 the crumbs of toledo there we will not leave 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.590
 to talk that if we do not throw them to 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.600
 clarity 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.670

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.590
