00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 and then to a street organ for it 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.529
 street organ not only if 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.120
 accompaniment instrument but if 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.799
 a full member of one that is it 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.150
 new concept of the pierement are out 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.889
 the window down 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.690
 the organ that is digitally controlled 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.099
 is an idea from patrick marcelissen 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.170
 singer of wc experience 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.730
 He then makes his childhood dream come true anyway 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.609
 going to show the instrument in Germany 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.119
 to build 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.119
 poor king 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.280
 janus des watched it separately if smaller 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.100
 of course also discussed with the machine 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.449
 fusion of the conventional 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.150
 whom I played instruments by us 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:50.800
 with the nostalgic just rolling 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:53.290
 error started idea from the past is out 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.210
 actually with my dad always the whole 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.449
 often said i want to turn it over 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 all along with less mine 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.320
 and that's how the idea came about 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.970
 at that time with the swing word came 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.970
 had a lot to add as ago 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.510
 he played a few minutes ago 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.490
 through the city 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.590
 second all sad when I think in 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.119
 the distance and when I was already fighting one 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.340
 organ sound and then i came upon it 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.369
 I just thought at once again 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.409
 make that dream come true 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.610
 inconveniences and I already looked like me 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.259
 I already had within minutes I already 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.259
 really seen through 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.930
 of course a barrel organ has been around for centuries 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.640
 old but it's actually the way 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.810
 then the devil is controlled 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.820
 I would really like something new 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:48.360
 and so coming to payment gives me that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 you put the foil we dance one for example 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.690
 We thereby adjust this program 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.319
 instruments of the organ 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.880
 pipes the the xylophone and the drum set 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.229
 And with this you can therefore have a region where you 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.690
 to this i see you is actually next 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.929
 sort of map from an old book 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.300
 work of a book scroll this me 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.740
 smile and you can be with this note 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.789
 dots can make the notes longer 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.160
 hard soft 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.000
 higher and louder your sound 20 new year 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.260
 rip shad the crazy thing that we also just the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.880
 craziest arguments run out on suitcases 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.220
 from work to complete with 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.799
 clear and tulips from Amsterdam 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.930
 but then all with the met 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.459
 nostalgic organ sounds 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.070
 this fun awesome the craziest things 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.760
 can do with the dutch 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.760
 Dutch sound 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.370
 half an hour 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.990
 job worked because it is unique i think 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.660
 very unique for both you all kinds of mine 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.140
 can create numbers and pickled it already 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.550
 keep a specific culture are 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.400
 pipe in and everything 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.170
 and a fat distortion hippie for that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.550
 throwing in taro gives a very special one 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.550
 atmosphere very nice 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.740
 how expensive are all Paul very beautiful 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.740
 cars with the I do not say 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.280
 what will this music be called in van dale 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.710
 well i think must also combines that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.290
 with something modern today nostalgia 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.320
 mostar that kind of yes 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.350
 susan is a new genius rl yes thank you 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.350
 well 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.030
 and if you have an album ruble see us as 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.910
 the on and started to German party or something 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.950
 and beer festival or 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.520
 can be used anywhere within this 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.520
 couple of americans 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.530
 is then a question why could be here 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.310
 say an organ is actually something 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.160
 wondered 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.180
 machines precisely because we then we day the 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:09.090
 modern 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:12.040
 songs on release top 40 repertoire and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.360
 yes , feathers still have something special now 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.360
 remain current 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.479
 nice party
