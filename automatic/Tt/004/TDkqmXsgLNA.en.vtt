00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.730 

okay<00:01:25.079> this<00:01:26.079> is<00:01:26.229> very<00:01:27.070> fragile<00:01:28.469> which<00:01:29.469> I<00:01:29.680> know

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
okay this is very fragile which I know

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.410 
okay this is very fragile which I know
oh<00:01:30.159> he's<00:01:30.610> moving

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.450 

it's<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.600> red<00:01:37.810> here<00:01:37.929> slider<00:01:39.149> with<00:01:40.149> literally<00:01:40.570> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it's a red here slider with literally a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
it's a red here slider with literally a
mohawk<00:01:42.460> on<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.880> back<00:01:43.030> of<00:01:43.210> its<00:01:43.360> shell

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
mohawk on the back of its shell

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.569 
mohawk on the back of its shell
basically<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:46.030> was<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.799> was<00:01:51.159> about<00:01:51.310> to

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
basically it was like it was about to

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:54.059 
basically it was like it was about to
turn<00:01:51.759> into<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.689> two-headed<00:01:53.500> turtle<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:54.039> the

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
turn into a two-headed turtle but the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.419 
turn into a two-headed turtle but the
shell<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.670> guess<00:01:55.119> like<00:01:55.740> split<00:01:56.740> in<00:01:56.950> a<00:01:57.069> certain

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
shell I guess like split in a certain

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.809 
shell I guess like split in a certain
way<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:58.140> made<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.909> bottom<00:02:00.909> of<00:02:01.000> his<00:02:01.149> shell

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
way that made the bottom of his shell

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.630 
way that made the bottom of his shell
like<00:02:03.819> this<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.240> see<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.509> bottom<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.929> show

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
like this you see the bottom of the show

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.610 
like this you see the bottom of the show
half<00:02:06.640> of<00:02:06.849> it<00:02:07.000> or<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:07.780> went<00:02:08.049> to<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.259> top<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.690> so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
half of it or so went to the top so so

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.940 
half of it or so went to the top so so
you<00:02:11.709> get<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> good<00:02:12.099> close-up<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.950> it's

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
you get a good close-up of it it's

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.880 
you get a good close-up of it it's
really<00:02:15.250> cool<00:02:15.579> it's<00:02:15.760> like<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:16.200> mohawk<00:02:17.200> on<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
size of a little bit smaller than a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.039 
size of a little bit smaller than a
quarter<00:02:28.980> shoot<00:02:29.980> he's<00:02:30.280> really<00:02:30.549> cold<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.959> he
