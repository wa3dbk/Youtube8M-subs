00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
roof light and hanging space so if you

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.580 
roof light and hanging space so if you
do<00:05:16.240> get<00:05:16.419> your<00:05:16.599> wet<00:05:16.720> coat<00:05:16.960> which<00:05:17.169> hopefully<00:05:17.379> you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
do get your wet coat which hopefully you

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.110 
do get your wet coat which hopefully you
won't<00:05:17.800> you've<00:05:18.310> got<00:05:18.460> somewhere<00:05:18.699> to<00:05:18.759> hang<00:05:18.940> them

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
won't you've got somewhere to hang them

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.649 
won't you've got somewhere to hang them
maybe<00:05:19.960> be<00:05:20.199> wetsuits<00:05:20.650> instead<00:05:21.069> that<00:05:21.250> be<00:05:21.370> nicer

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
maybe be wetsuits instead that be nicer

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
to be fair it's not unique but it is not

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.119 
to be fair it's not unique but it is not

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
often seen in mow times is that you can

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.399 
often seen in mow times is that you can
drop<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:42.490> part<00:05:42.849> down<00:05:43.060> which<00:05:43.300> is<00:05:43.419> your<00:05:43.599> bed<00:05:43.780> so

your sleeping arrangements I'll just see

your sleeping arrangements I'll just see
if<00:05:52.539> I<00:05:52.599> can<00:05:52.719> capture<00:05:52.900> that<00:05:53.080> we'll<00:05:53.349> put<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.590> on

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
if I can capture that we'll put it on

the side here and showing you through
how<00:05:55.569> that<00:05:55.780> works<00:05:56.610> who's<00:05:57.610> going<00:05:57.789> to<00:05:57.879> handle<00:05:58.030> the

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
how that works who's going to handle the

how that works who's going to handle the
top<00:05:58.629> here<00:05:58.870> would<00:05:59.530> you<00:05:59.650> pull<00:05:59.889> them<00:06:00.159> in<00:06:00.310> this

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
top here would you pull them in this

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.430 
top here would you pull them in this
whole<00:06:00.759> section<00:06:01.389> just<00:06:01.629> drops<00:06:01.870> right<00:06:02.139> the<00:06:02.289> way

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
whole section just drops right the way

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.010 
whole section just drops right the way
down<00:06:02.819> you<00:06:03.819> do<00:06:03.969> have<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.270> take<00:06:04.389> the<00:06:04.509> headrests

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
down you do have to take the headrests

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.439 
down you do have to take the headrests
off<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.949> so<00:06:06.219> it<00:06:06.310> comes<00:06:06.430> down<00:06:06.580> completely<00:06:07.300> but

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
off and so it comes down completely but

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:08.670 
off and so it comes down completely but
you<00:06:07.479> get

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
you get

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.200 
you get
not<00:06:09.680> too<00:06:09.860> difficult<00:06:10.099> to<00:06:10.370> do<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.759> headrests

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.210 
not too difficult to do the headrests

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.080 
not too difficult to do the headrests
come<00:06:11.360> off<00:06:11.479> very<00:06:11.509> easily<00:06:12.009> and<00:06:13.009> it<00:06:13.189> does<00:06:13.400> make

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
come off very easily and it does make

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.129 
come off very easily and it does make
the<00:06:14.270> best<00:06:14.539> of<00:06:14.689> the<00:06:14.840> space<00:06:16.689> giving<00:06:17.689> you<00:06:17.810> a<00:06:17.840> large

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
the best of the space giving you a large

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:25.600 
the best of the space giving you a large
lounge<00:06:20.800> and<00:06:21.800> then<00:06:22.099> giving<00:06:22.340> you<00:06:22.370> the<00:06:22.460> bed<00:06:22.639> above

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.290 

very<00:06:26.180> clever<00:06:26.419> system<00:06:26.720> from<00:06:26.990> Adria

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300

I'm<00:06:31.630> just<00:06:31.870> have<00:06:31.990> a<00:06:32.020> pan<00:06:32.289> around<00:06:32.620> just<00:06:32.860> you<00:06:33.039> can

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
I'm just have a pan around just you can

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.650 
I'm just have a pan around just you can
have<00:06:33.250> a<00:06:33.280> good<00:06:33.430> look<00:06:33.610> without<00:06:33.759> me<00:06:34.000> talking<00:06:34.210> over

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
have a good look without me talking over

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.750 
have a good look without me talking over
it
