awesome<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.930> then<00:04:27.930> down<00:04:28.139> here<00:04:28.200> at<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.590> bottom

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
awesome and then down here at the bottom

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.300 
awesome and then down here at the bottom
of<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:30.120> front<00:04:30.389> we<00:04:31.260> do<00:04:31.410> have<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> dolphin<00:04:31.889> in<00:04:32.160> the

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
of the front we do have a dolphin in the

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.280 
of the front we do have a dolphin in the
set<00:04:32.520> which<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:32.850> awesome<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:33.450> one<00:04:34.080> thing<00:04:34.230> I

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
hadn't really noticed before I guess is

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.330 
hadn't really noticed before I guess is
that<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.930> can<00:04:37.080> actually<00:04:37.110> attach<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.950> dolphin

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
that you can actually attach the dolphin

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.740 
that you can actually attach the dolphin
tails<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.250> plate<00:04:41.250> which<00:04:41.550> is<00:04:41.580> really<00:04:42.210> kind

set<00:05:44.910> which<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.990> awesome<00:05:46.200> I've<00:05:46.740> always<00:05:47.460> liked

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
set which is awesome I've always liked

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.390 
set which is awesome I've always liked
found<00:05:48.240> it<00:05:48.419> and<00:05:48.630> he<00:05:48.660> was<00:05:49.440> in<00:05:49.740> one<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.100> the<00:05:50.250> other

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
found it and he was in one of the other

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.210 
found it and he was in one of the other
sets<00:05:50.970> also<00:05:51.240> so<00:05:51.690> not<00:05:52.500> necessarily<00:05:52.620> a<00:05:53.039> new

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
sets also so not necessarily a new

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.190 
sets also so not necessarily a new
figure<00:05:53.610> but<00:05:53.850> I'm<00:05:54.479> certainly<00:05:54.840> not<00:05:54.990> complaining

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
figure but I'm certainly not complaining

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.950 
figure but I'm certainly not complaining
that<00:05:55.560> they<00:05:55.770> included<00:05:56.340> him<00:05:56.510> although<00:05:57.510> they

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
that they included him although they

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.020 
that they included him although they
really<00:05:58.560> should<00:05:58.770> have<00:05:58.889> included<00:05:59.070> King<00:05:59.610> Triton

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
really should have included King Triton

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.600 
really should have included King Triton
that's<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.350> number<00:06:01.620> one<00:06:01.770> thing<00:06:01.830> I<00:06:02.160> feel<00:06:02.400> like

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
that's the number one thing I feel like

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.120 
that's the number one thing I feel like
is<00:06:02.789> missing<00:06:03.210> from<00:06:03.300> this<00:06:03.660> set<00:06:03.930> I<00:06:04.169> would<00:06:04.919> also

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
is missing from this set I would also
