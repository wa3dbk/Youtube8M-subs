00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
and weapon attachments are a big new
thing<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.190> guess<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.490> whole<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:54.000> whole

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
thing so I guess the whole the whole

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
thing so I guess the whole the whole
scavenging<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.470> much<00:01:55.979> more

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
scavenging thing now is much more

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.630 
scavenging thing now is much more
implemented<00:01:58.050> than<00:01:58.260> when<00:01:58.470> then<00:01:59.070> when<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.369> showed

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
implemented than when then when I showed

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.940 
implemented than when then when I showed
you<00:01:59.850> also<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:00.960> been<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> lot<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.380> time<00:02:01.680> working

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you also it's been a lot of time working

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.000 
you also it's been a lot of time working
on<00:02:02.330> player<00:02:03.330> animations<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.260> choir<00:02:04.440> movement

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
on player animations and choir movement

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.310 
on player animations and choir movement
so<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.610> feel<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> lot<00:02:06.119> more<00:02:06.150> fluid<00:02:06.869> get<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so they feel a lot more fluid get the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.770 
so they feel a lot more fluid get the
basic<00:02:07.680> idea<00:02:07.800> and<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.610> how<00:02:08.850> now<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
basic idea and you can see how now the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.230 
basic idea and you can see how now the
zombies<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.830> knock<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.340> over<00:02:11.820> and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
zombies can actually knock you over and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
things like that so we wanted to make

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.370 
things like that so we wanted to make
the<00:02:14.459> make<00:02:15.360> everything<00:02:15.660> feel<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.050> lot<00:02:16.350> more

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
the make everything feel a lot more

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.350 
the make everything feel a lot more
fluid<00:02:17.010> yeah<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.520> engine<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:17.970> actually

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
fluid yeah the engine is actually

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.600 
fluid yeah the engine is actually
designed<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.930> function<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.380> an<00:02:19.680> MMO<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:20.459> we

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
designed to function like an MMO so we

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.710 
designed to function like an MMO so we
can<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:22.100> 150<00:02:23.100> 200<00:02:23.880> players<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.480> man

can have like 150 200 players on a man

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.470 
can have like 150 200 players on a man
that's<00:02:25.530> amazing<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.070> it<00:02:26.520> can<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.030> 200

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
that's amazing so it can go up to 200

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.740 
that's amazing so it can go up to 200

experiences in the cities a day and
night<00:02:42.840> exactly<00:02:43.620> around<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:44.190> game<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:45.000> to

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
night exactly around the game just to

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.210 
night exactly around the game just to
reiterate<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.780> when<00:02:46.140> it<00:02:46.260> comes<00:02:46.440> out<00:02:46.709> it's

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.380 
reiterate that when it comes out it's
going<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.610> be<00:02:47.760> an<00:02:48.030> alpha<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:50.120> you're<00:02:51.120> very

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
going to be an alpha so and you're very

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.210 
going to be an alpha so and you're very
much<00:02:51.690> so<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.260> then<00:02:52.500> that's<00:02:52.860> kind<00:02:53.160> of

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
much so and then that's kind of

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.259 
much so and then that's kind of
important<00:02:53.790> to<00:02:53.850> our<00:02:54.000> our<00:02:54.989> approach<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:56.269> we've

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
important to our our approach like we've

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.650 
important to our our approach like we've
done<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.720> much<00:02:57.930> now<00:02:58.620> I'm<00:02:58.680> going<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:58.890> die<00:02:59.660> we've

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
done so much now I'm going to die we've

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.170 
done so much now I'm going to die we've
done<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.079> much<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:02.670> need<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:03.060> get

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
done so much that we need to get

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.850 
done so much that we need to get
people's<00:03:03.570> feedback<00:03:03.660> there's<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.380> lot<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.590> stuff

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
people's feedback there's a lot of stuff

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.729 
people's feedback there's a lot of stuff
that's<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.310> change<00:03:05.579> the<00:03:06.510> base<00:03:07.110> level<00:03:07.410> we

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
that's going to change the base level we

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.440 
that's going to change the base level we
want<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.040> provide<00:03:08.310> when<00:03:08.579> it<00:03:08.700> comes<00:03:08.910> out<00:03:09.090> as<00:03:09.269> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
want to provide when it comes out as the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.530 
want to provide when it comes out as the
varies<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.769> base<00:03:11.070> experience<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.910> dayz<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
varies the base experience of dayz the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.530 
varies the base experience of dayz the
very<00:03:12.920> foundation<00:03:13.920> experience<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.730> from<00:03:15.239> that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
very foundation experience and from that

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.780 
very foundation experience and from that
after<00:03:16.170> we've<00:03:16.620> released<00:03:16.920> over<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.310> next<00:03:17.610> six

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
