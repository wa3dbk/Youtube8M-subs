 that we are going to put to bake our came out 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.980
 which is so that they remain al dente ie 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.960
 soft on the outside and a little duritos 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.300

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.550
 They already knew my dreams I already have in 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.410
 a butter pan and now already after 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.100
 of having drained well very well 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.740
 sticks are going to be placed 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.920
 We are going to move it well, well, we are going to 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.960
 rectify pepper salt and since 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.820
 it is perfectly well of flavor 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.159
 we are going to place terkes 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.220
 I already put the cheese now what we are going to 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.380
 to do is to lower the fire to the minimum and 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.380
 we are going to cover it up please so that 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.170
 gratin and ready to wait for it to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.360
 this delicious dish remains the truth 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.190
 very rich is ideal to accompany a 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.390
 meat or even to eat it well 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.310
 alone is perfect then let me 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.960
 we wait for the cheese to melt to 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.090
 see how it looks 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.000
 this is how our delicious 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.700
 stew as I tell you and it is delicious 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.640
 you can if you want to do it like you can not 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.740
 put butter and put cheese 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 light but the truth if it is very rich and 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.360
 if this time nothing else I started this in 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.550
 instead of also eating a fatty meat and 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.390
 all of that is not really affecting you 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.220
