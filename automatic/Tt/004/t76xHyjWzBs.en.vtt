00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
that I'll be coming back upper and it

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.400 
that I'll be coming back upper and it
was<00:05:12.520> even<00:05:12.910> just<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.330> second<00:05:13.630> loop<00:05:13.780> really<00:05:14.169> was

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
was even just the second loop really was

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.870 
was even just the second loop really was
you<00:05:14.590> know<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.979> seek<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.250> loop<00:05:15.400> of<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.610> start

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
you know you to seek a loop of the start

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.370 
you know you to seek a loop of the start
where<00:05:16.150> you've<00:05:16.270> got<00:05:16.450> climbing<00:05:16.930> up<00:05:17.050> so<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:17.260> need

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
where you've got climbing up so you need

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.170 
where you've got climbing up so you need
to<00:05:17.470> do<00:05:17.560> that<00:05:17.740> twice<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:19.270> um<00:05:20.250> yes<00:05:21.250> I<00:05:21.520> was<00:05:21.820> gonna

to do that twice so um yes I was gonna

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.180 
to do that twice so um yes I was gonna
get<00:05:22.390> but<00:05:22.630> concerned<00:05:23.050> about<00:05:23.320> my<00:05:23.470> legs<00:05:23.650> but<00:05:23.950> um

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
get but concerned about my legs but um

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.500 
get but concerned about my legs but um
on<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.240> way<00:05:25.510> back<00:05:25.720> from<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:26.020> launch<00:05:26.229> I<00:05:26.440> just<00:05:26.710> I

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
on the way back from the launch I just I

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.960 
on the way back from the launch I just I
wanted<00:05:28.510> us<00:05:28.690> just<00:05:29.050> now<00:05:29.380> my<00:05:29.950> on<00:05:30.250> my<00:05:30.280> home<00:05:30.370> run<00:05:30.760> now

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
wanted us just now my on my home run now

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.570 
wanted us just now my on my home run now
and<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.270> just<00:05:31.539> and<00:05:31.990> I<00:05:32.200> by<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.740> time<00:05:33.039> I<00:05:33.070> came<00:05:33.250> out

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
and I just and I by the time I came out

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.730 
and I just and I by the time I came out

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
to that 2k I could see where the other

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.469 
to that 2k I could see where the other
girls<00:05:35.979> were<00:05:36.100> positioned<00:05:36.520> so<00:05:36.789> I<00:05:36.820> kind<00:05:37.120> of<00:05:37.240> knew

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
girls were positioned so I kind of knew

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.690 
girls were positioned so I kind of knew
because<00:05:38.140> i<00:05:38.289> was<00:05:38.560> running<00:05:38.770> Skeeter<00:05:39.310> books<00:05:39.490> of

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
because i was running Skeeter books of

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.430 
because i was running Skeeter books of
what<00:05:39.910> half<00:05:40.120> hour<00:05:40.330> behind<00:05:40.510> our<00:05:40.930> there<00:05:41.169> you<00:05:41.320> know

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
what half hour behind our there you know

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.820 
what half hour behind our there you know
but<00:05:42.400> um<00:05:42.640> I<00:05:43.050> knew<00:05:44.050> after<00:05:44.229> that<00:05:44.380> Tariq<00:05:44.710> a
