00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:11.316
 VIDEO FRAMES 141: EoC Mashup / Legacy Mode and RS Update of Old 

00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:15.508
 RuneScape's combat has undergone tremendous changes in recent years, 

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:18.963
 but where can you test all the latest changes? 

00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:20.697
 What a coincidence you ask this! 

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:26.021
 Beta servers are an environment for you to test the game as we test. 

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:30.881
 They are basically a copy of the main version of the game, but you do not receive any reward or lose your equipment. 

00:00:31.214 --> 00:00:34.760
 We beta-test the new content to ensure the highest possible quality, 

00:00:34.798 --> 00:00:37.039
 avoiding unpleasant surprises for you. 

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:40.032
 We are currently testing the Legacy / EoC mode mashup in beta. 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.250
 To activate the Legacy / EoC mashup mode, you need to access the game settings 

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:47.200
 and select whether the RS3 interfaces, 

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:52.290
 the EoC combat, the Legacy combat or the Legacy interfaces. You can actually choose how you want to play. 

00:00:52.544 --> 00:00:56.117
 We decided to test the Legacy / EoC mashup based on player feedback. 

00:00:56.173 --> 00:01:01.091
 The community has said before that it did not like to have made big changes in the game without first asking for their opinion, 

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:05.208
 so now let's hear your feedback, correct the errors and introduce the modifications in the game at the right time. 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.384
 At the moment, along with the mashup mode of the Legacy / EoC, we are testing the removal of the limit in Soul Start in Legacy Mode, 

00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:15.225
 changes in two-handed features and several changes in PVP. 

00:01:15.626 --> 00:01:20.242
 And soon we will do a complete update of death and a new mechanics of looting for you to test. 

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:26.101
 To access the beta servers, read the news about the Legacy / EoC mashup, click the link and you will go directly to the server. 

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:29.826
 If players want to give feedback or report bugs, the best place is the English forum. 

00:01:29.883 --> 00:01:36.458
 And for those who are very good at the tests, we have created the title "O / A Break-game", which will only be given by Jagex. 

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.723
 There are no criteria, there is a list of requirements, few people will receive it. 

00:01:40.452 --> 00:01:46.874
 And not only that ... The RuneScape of the Ancient has had a year and so much so far, with incredible additions, 

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:50.206
 so we called the Mod Matt K to update us. 

00:01:51.047 --> 00:01:55.275
 The two major upgrades we recently made are the permanent free access version and the Grand Exchange. 

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:58.790
 The permanent free access version is just that: a free version that is permanent. 

00:01:58.874 --> 00:02:03.865
 As in 2007, you get access to a large part of the game. 

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:05.447
 There are only a few minor changes. 

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:11.858
 For example, you can not trade for the first 24 hours of game time. This is to combat the bots and is working very well. 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:16.973
 The other thing that we put in the game was the General Market, which is proving very popular. Many players are trading around. 

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:22.803
 As we are well at the beginning of the General Market, prices are kind of crazy. We have to wait a few weeks for them to stabilize. 

00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:26.217
 But we'll get there, and players will be able to trade with confidence there in no time. 

00:02:26.437 --> 00:02:29.125
 The players have been asking for a free version since the first day of the RS of the Old. 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:32.617
 We had to do a lot of research to see if that was the right thing to do. 

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:38.707
 And we saw that, yes, it was the right thing to do, so we brought it to the game. The players voted, the modification was elected and the fruits are being harvested now. 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:42.852
 We have ten new diaries of achievements coming soon. That is, they will be 11 in total. 

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:45.412
 It will be a huge amount of content for players to have fun. 

00:02:45.534 --> 00:02:49.581
 In addition to the achievement diaries, we are also bringing in the Signature Notes in mid-March. 

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:55.428
 They will allow players to use their wealth in the game to purchase Notes, which can only be converted into subscription credits. 

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:58.539
 If you want to watch more videos of RS of the Antiques, visit the YouTube channel in English. 

00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:01.962
 There you can see some videos of gameplay and also a little more behind the scenes. 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.677
 If you want to watch live streams, go to our Twitch channel. 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.652
 At 9:00 pm (game time) on Wednesdays, Ronan makes his broadcast, and at 5:00 pm on Thursdays, we are all there. 

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:15.380
 Next week, we go back to the lab with Mod Luna to get the latest news about RuneLabs.
