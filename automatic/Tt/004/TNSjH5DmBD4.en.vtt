 a game now if we put hardcore 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.110
 Clau notice that this is one of those games 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.180
 that if you buy it right now it's 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.939
 as an investment because I imagine that 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.910
 about two or three years the cost is going to 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.070
 be up friend is about 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.099

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.240
 fabulous peter also study with you 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.370

 Now that it has reached all stores 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.989
 gamers and April 16 ears kuyt no 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:46.780

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.979
 the games are left and they did not arrive 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.610

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:55.089
 it came so limited is where is it 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.860
 I also think that you were already going 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.619
 to buy it and especially if you are 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.729

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:03.640

 that are vite mods half arcades but 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.430
 super complexes of difficult ones 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.100
 this one should do this mobile number 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.110
 mole number title is more a 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.790
 great game together what you have to 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.250
 the character design is fantastic 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.200
 the graphic part is very attractive mocking 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.640
 and once again they show us Japanese 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.770

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.080

 an eye to drinks with yes indeed there 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.460
 between God and it's about art where 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.820
 of course I think that between king man legends 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.820
 and they looked for the first 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.520
 I can not stop recommending dragons 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.979
 with an excellent exclusive title of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.080

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.700

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.880
 recommendation of the week of this great 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:05.979
 game we are already seeing bands and 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.600
 gamers recommendations dragons count a 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.429
 mid 90's 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.680
 georg captain and collaborated in the creation 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.380
 of two games to which renowned as 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.030
 Adam Jones and Dragons this series 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.430
 revolutionized role-playing games 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.040
 equip them with victim elements or something 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.989
 new for the time however he did not let 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.390
 that the concept died and with the 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.330
 back of the cross brings it back in 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.340
 dragons ground the title takes up the 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.800
 bases that made mythical in some 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.110
 circles to the success that capcom brought to the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.420
 Machines you have several kinds of 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.790
 characters each with their own 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.100
 skills are from the power of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.980
 dwarf and the fighter to the charm of 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.340
 characters like the sorceress and the Amazon itself 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.580
 do not 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.800
 and the sorcerer the story is very 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.810
 similar to paper RPGs 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.760
 You must advance fulfilling missions to 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.650
 be able to reach other lands in 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.050
 dungeons plagued by enemies 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.000
 defeat annihilate 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.250
 experience to make you stronger 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.680
 while every time you fall in combat 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.410
 you will have to pay literally with something 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.269
 gold if it's a game with perspective in 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.549
 two dimensions but that's not why 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.190
 linear to each dungeon is full of 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:17.410
 nooks to explore you can even 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.410
 decide to your liking certain missions by 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.360
 take through the judges so much 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.340
 each game will be different 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.290
 you can join allies to your part to 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.630
 resurrect his remains 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.400
 the base is to hit your enemies but 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.950
 This does not limit you from using and themes 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.370
 classics like potions skills like 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.750
 magic and even additional weapons 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.239
 uses all the resources to win 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.970
 experience since it will require the same 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.610
 to be able to advance in certain parts the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.400
 visual design is beautiful beyond the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.010
 aesthetics of his characters backgrounds in 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.400
 tuti and they look like worked by hand and 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.110
 is it so 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.049
 of effects that increase your 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.200
 spectacularly undoubtedly a detail that 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:01.780
 highlights the role is not for everyone and less 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.209
 beating the format however if 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.329
 you are a fan of these adventures the dragon 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.189
 Spawn is highly recommendable either 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.730
 for its gameplay or its charm 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:14.340
 visual worth a checada both 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.780
 work is not for less 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.570
 Dust off your dice and throw yourself
