00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.760 
it will work just as fine what I'm going
to<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.330> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.630> put<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:07.110> acetone

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
to do is I'm going to put some acetone

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340 
to do is I'm going to put some acetone
on<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> q-tip<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.330> you're<00:01:09.930> going<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
on the q-tip and then you're going to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.460 
on the q-tip and then you're going to
put<00:01:10.590> some<00:01:10.860> acetone<00:01:11.400> over<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.900> mark<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
put some acetone over the mark and you

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
put some acetone over the mark and you
can<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.130> already<00:01:14.310> removing<00:01:15.000> some

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
can see that it's already removing some

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.789 
can see that it's already removing some
but<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.500> work<00:01:16.799> better

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
but it will work better

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
but it will work better
once<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.979> use<00:01:20.040> magic<00:01:20.610> eraser<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.240> would<00:01:21.509> use

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
once you use magic eraser I would use

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.929 
once you use magic eraser I would use
q-tip<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.009> cover<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.310> small<00:01:23.430> area

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
q-tip if I have to cover a small area

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.840 
q-tip if I have to cover a small area
because<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.259> wouldn't<00:01:25.560> want<00:01:25.799> acetone<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
because you wouldn't want acetone to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.880 
because you wouldn't want acetone to
touch<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.420> part<00:01:27.720> because<00:01:28.140> as<00:01:28.380> soon<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
touch this part because as soon as the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.950 
touch this part because as soon as the
acetone<00:01:29.340> touches<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.880> area<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.509> paint<00:01:30.750> will

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
acetone touches this area the paint will

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.560 
acetone touches this area the paint will
come<00:01:31.290> off<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> work<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.360> small

work<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.210> large<00:01:36.360> area<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.930> will<00:01:37.079> put<00:01:37.229> some

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.889 
just dip it in and then take it right
out<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.280> then<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:44.970> into<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> pony<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
out and then go right into the pony it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.700 
out and then go right into the pony it
that<00:01:46.439> will<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.950> too<00:01:47.189> much<00:01:47.399> acetone<00:01:48.000> so

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
that will be just too much acetone so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.230 
that will be just too much acetone so
dip<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> into<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.159> acetone<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:51.090> bit

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
dip it into your acetone a little bit

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.620 
dip it into your acetone a little bit
and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:51.509> squeeze<00:01:52.020> out<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.180> extra

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and then squeeze out you know the extra

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.830 
and then squeeze out you know the extra
acetone<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.680> go<00:01:56.240> work<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.420> your<00:01:57.630> phony

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
acetone and then go work on your phony

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.510 
acetone and then go work on your phony

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
so

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.639 
so
I<00:01:58.549> have<00:01:58.850> gone<00:01:59.090> ahead<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.719> put<00:01:59.930> some<00:01:59.960> acetone

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
I have gone ahead and put some acetone

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.459 
I have gone ahead and put some acetone
on<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.429> magic<00:02:01.969> eraser<00:02:02.450> sometimes<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.320> won't

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
on this magic eraser sometimes you won't

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.620 
on this magic eraser sometimes you won't
be<00:02:03.649> able<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.890> get<00:02:04.159> everything<00:02:04.549> out<00:02:04.820> because

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
be able to get everything out because

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.770 
be able to get everything out because
the<00:02:06.020> chances<00:02:06.439> are<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:08.060> stain<00:02:08.330> was<00:02:08.509> there

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the chances are if the stain was there

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.869 
the chances are if the stain was there
for<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> long<00:02:09.259> time<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.800> has<00:02:09.950> already<00:02:10.129> stained<00:02:10.700> a

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
for a long time it has already stained a

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:23.350 
for a long time it has already stained a
plastic<00:02:11.360> permanently<00:02:21.730> okay<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:22.910> did<00:02:23.209> my

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
best but um it's not really coming off

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.850
