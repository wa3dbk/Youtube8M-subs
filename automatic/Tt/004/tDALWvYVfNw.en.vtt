00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.469
 back then I pretty much have it 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.440
 unlocked late or yes beautiful 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:19.279
 reference to the master of the kit account 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.170
 bruce lee this is an undercover 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.560
 policeman lived in usa for a long time 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 is originally from Hongkong and 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.830
 worked undercover is but above all 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.080
 gangster in its new role 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.550
 and yes let's get started right away 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.010
 Here's an informant of him 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.000
 catching a snarled image 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.559
 and there you can see very wonderful 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.329
 which gameplay elements are in there 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.329
 For example, shooting on a motorcycle 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 everything was a little bit gta moderate 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.840
 yes it's an asset strong though 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.230
 thanks to the settings had very different 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.230
 own taste 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.290
 and the mission is always the same 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.490
 pleasantly varied there have the 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.810
 Developer thinks about that one 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.850
 stop skipping every now and then 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.630
 must or how blows up here 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.630
 always cabbage 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.130
 f bomb also fly through the air as 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.600
 if there was no tomorrow 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.310
 Here we see a bit of shooter 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.570
 I do not show that component that much 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.970
 in the video because they are so synonymous 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.649
 really only 18 is working completely 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.149
 solid is for me a bit 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.060
 the worst part of the game because of it 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.770
 just does not completely convince me and 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.210
 is not that good game integrated that 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.440
 driving and flogging is much more fun 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.130
 and we'll see that as well 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.130
 much more 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.670
 and I want that too interesting 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.990
 The explanation that you do not have so much 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.789
 ballet has to do with that in 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.899
 Hong Kong has other laws and apply 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.729
 that his weapon is pretty good 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.379
 crass and that people is he with 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.340
 the fists or with extensive 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.500
 start each other 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.269
 Anyway, have made a joke now 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.190
 packed this in the trunk and 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.500
 drive now in an uncertain future 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.819
 that's one of the example mission and there 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.230
 still have a little time there 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:36.880
 one after the other and one is 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:38.680
 really hearty this cross-country English 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.090
 for it succeeded perfectly and the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.470
 humor comes across well and that many 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.299
 Chinese interspersed again and again 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.319
 is classically done a bit 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.019
 Assassin's creed 2 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.940
 which also ran so half Italian and 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.299
 the ftd of mentioned are so 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.000
 bad words here had next 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.920
 mission here we have this yes 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.540
 leader of an opposing gang 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.220
 catch because he is really bad 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.319
 has made'd better not talk 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.969
 and moms pretty sour 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.590
 and we follow him on a boat 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.180
 Everywhere around Hongkong, there are still some 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.139
 amount of water and illegal casinos 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.139
 outside on the coast 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.239
 and I invite two of them I have in there 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.239
 let us have an impression 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.250
 it definitely gets intentionally 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.000
 so another important part of the game 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.560
 Freerunning well, that's nice 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.239
 is the pretty staged as you at 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.769
 these chase chases, so to speak, the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.579
 running behind the target is that 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.400
 very straightforward 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.569
 You can not go wrong 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.099
 It reminds me a bit about Elena 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.109
 yes, these chases too 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:51.120
 so a little bit but it's just 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.760
 then also net in other gameplay stuff 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.170
 over and the beating are clearly so the 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.790
 the core of the story we see 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.139
 also afterwards a much longer where 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:04.859
 I explained that only in detail in the 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:06.480
 second part of the video or after 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.030
 grab us grab as before 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.829
 the boot a car of one 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.790
 Colleagues and then again 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.379
 like as time on the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.379
 Passenger side everything 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.810
 And cars are exploding like in Hollywood 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.389
 Immediately three you have to mature 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.440
 shoot then turns and you 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.150
 maybe you can see the game is running too 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.060
 Both the percent liquid it sees 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.710
 not so cool it will come out with 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.509
 Blur effects just so around 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.070
 but overall it is reasonably 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.050
 coherent and I find the atmosphere 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:46.720
 comes back reminds me of such a 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:49.229
 Hong Kong dollar surprise and it 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.850
 her mother is learning candy is great 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.850
 a bad old chinese girl 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.030
 but that's also big points for 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.099
 Game speaks all this Chinese 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.449
 culture is in it reasonably well 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.250
 authentic and with many 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.009
 interesting details that gives 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.449
 This game is a very special seasoning if 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.310
 it would not have been it just 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:28.960
 a gta imitation is already something 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:31.900
 special has the same charm as 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.910
 your favorite series here, yes, of course 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.669
 not quite that crazy and silly though 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:41.940
 definitely entertaining 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.940
 i like to play business
