00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
is completely free of any mind

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.280 
is completely free of any mind
because

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
because

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.470 
because
you're<00:02:56.680> white<00:02:56.920> square<00:02:57.370> or<00:02:57.579> your<00:02:57.760> white<00:02:57.969> pixel

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
you're white square or your white pixel

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.039 
you're white square or your white pixel
here<00:02:58.739> appeared<00:02:59.879> therefore<00:03:00.879> it<00:03:01.420> just<00:03:01.780> tells

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
here appeared therefore it just tells

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.860 
here appeared therefore it just tells
you<00:03:02.319> that<00:03:02.879> whatever<00:03:03.879> it<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.299> you're<00:03:04.450> pointing

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
you that whatever it is you're pointing

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.180 
you that whatever it is you're pointing
at<00:03:04.989> it's<00:03:05.859> free<00:03:06.159> from<00:03:06.310> n<00:03:06.519> mine<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.540> this<00:03:08.049> is<00:03:08.079> safe

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
at it's free from n mine so this is safe

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.070 
at it's free from n mine so this is safe
check<00:03:10.820> second<00:03:11.300> one<00:03:11.510> second<00:03:11.990> one

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
check second one second one

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.850 
check second one second one
if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.710> look<00:03:13.860> at<00:03:14.100> your

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
if you look at your

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.180 
if you look at your
upper<00:03:16.580> left<00:03:16.790> corner<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.930> white<00:03:18.200> square

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
upper left corner the white square

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.510 
upper left corner the white square
disappeared<00:03:19.850> it's<00:03:20.780> because<00:03:21.170> your<00:03:22.130> second

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
disappeared it's because your second

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.520 
disappeared it's because your second
tile<00:03:22.780> contains

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
tile contains

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.400 
tile contains
in<00:03:26.010> mine

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
in mine

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.050 
in mine
but<00:03:27.680> rather<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:29.180> black<00:03:29.770> pixel<00:03:30.770> is<00:03:30.950> seen<00:03:31.220> so<00:03:31.760> it

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
but rather the black pixel is seen so it

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.320 
but rather the black pixel is seen so it
just<00:03:32.120> basically<00:03:32.810> means<00:03:33.140> that

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
just basically means that

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.410 
just basically means that
that<00:03:34.930> particular<00:03:35.110> tile<00:03:35.680> contains<00:03:36.310> in<00:03:37.270> mind

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
that particular tile contains in mind

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.360 
that particular tile contains in mind
going<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.750> continue<00:03:39.050> third<00:03:39.740> is<00:03:40.190> safe

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
going to continue third is safe

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.430 
going to continue third is safe
or<00:03:41.940> at<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.060> safe

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.040 

this<00:03:50.010> one<00:03:50.190> is<00:03:50.310> safe

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.090 

this<00:03:54.290> is<00:03:54.440> not<00:03:54.650> safe<00:03:54.980> this<00:03:55.910> one<00:03:56.090> is<00:03:56.180> safe

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.850 

this<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.640> safe

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
this is not safe

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.750 
this is not safe
so<00:04:01.430> basically

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
so basically

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.649 
so basically
it<00:04:03.239> helps<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:03.950> identify<00:04:05.150> which<00:04:06.150> styles

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
it helps you identify which styles

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.500 
it helps you identify which styles
contain<00:04:07.370> her<00:04:08.370> mind

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
contain her mind

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.120 
contain her mind
or<00:04:09.840> your<00:04:10.200> minds

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.520 

I'm<00:04:13.460> going<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:13.910> click<00:04:14.120> or<00:04:14.330> I'm<00:04:14.960> going<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.260> point

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
I'm going to click or I'm going to point

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.320 
I'm going to click or I'm going to point
that<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.860> second<00:04:16.220> tile<00:04:16.370> again<00:04:16.550> and<00:04:16.970> I'm<00:04:17.180> going

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
that the second tile again and I'm going

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.330 
that the second tile again and I'm going
to<00:04:17.420> show<00:04:17.510> you<00:04:17.660> that

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.300 

the<00:04:20.519> white<00:04:21.290> pixel<00:04:22.290> disappeared<00:04:22.889> but<00:04:23.100> rather

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
the white pixel disappeared but rather

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.640 
the white pixel disappeared but rather
the<00:04:23.550> black<00:04:23.760> appeared<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.230> click<00:04:25.290> on<00:04:25.590> this
