but<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.479> they're<00:02:00.659> doing<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.229> basic<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
but what they're doing is very basic and

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.090 
but what they're doing is very basic and
it's<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> reactive<00:02:03.689> policy<00:02:04.290> more<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.860> than<00:02:05.040> a
