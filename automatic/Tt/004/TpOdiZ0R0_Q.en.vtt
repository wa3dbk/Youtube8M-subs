00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.220
 700 thousand 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.219
 it's pretty much a rule to expect games based on movies to be bad 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.719
 only one or the other is saved especially those who do not 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.890
 We need to get to the stores. 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.659
 his movie debut 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.020
 is what seems to have happened with this flashes case 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.430
 it took me a long time to finish, I'm sure it 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.900
 top finish 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.489
 fidelity to material 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.570
 The story takes place in 1991 two years after Ghostbusters 2 when the 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.480
 group rescued new york and tyrannical ghost threat threat 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.580
 suddenly a supernatural explosion is going through a bad phase and the 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.270
 ghost hunter predicts difficult times 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.320
 confronted with the old and new subject 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 the player plays the role of a fifth wait 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.780
 at the moment the team does not want to create a bond should something happen to it 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.610
 action is what can be expected from a game so the team conference is a 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.610
 central layoffs and also on-site 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.580
 who is familiar with the films can easily predict the operation 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.830
 of the thing we need to take the ghosts out with a proton beam to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.430
 to weaken them to drag them to trap set in the ground 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.600
 and your suitcase at the right time 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.280
 they are not limited to this to the famous special phantom sensors of 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.360
 length of sight for the first person allowing the player to search 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.190
 by paranormal activity clues by the evidence gathering and raul scenarios 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.580
 to collect the remaining essential money to arrange the suit was 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.560
 between the four types of attacks available, it is important to emphasize 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.910
 the concern of developers to try to create an environment 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.640
 cinematographic 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.880
 outside the menu screens of some messages on the screen the idea seems to have 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.900
 been created a kind of narrative race using polygonal graphics 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.930
 six times and actors of flesh and blood 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.560
 is evident by the absence of meters other common indicators in games of the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.509
 style at the ammo level or energy of the character 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.319
 the caprice in the creation of the son 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.420
 is visible from the first moment said that the incident created me 3d 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 of the characters and original scenes with an incredible wealth of 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.889
 Details 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.459
 as it is a game they want to give me a movie even for having been 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.039
 based on a cinematographic script the narrative is quite laughter there is not 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.199
 plenty of room for improvisation and lives on the farm 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:34.809
 even the title 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.689
 miami has entered the wave and creates situations for up to four players 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:38.730
 to form 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.519
 the department of ghost hunting 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.419
 by a different developer this aspect of which it presents six 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:48.540
 modalities I received today to play to gain richer 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.879
 elements of the scenario were destroyed 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.650
 nothing really more fun to explore bacterial aspects of the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.629
 mythology 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.040
 video game folders is a great job done very carefully for 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.090
 fans of the old film series since the third 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.760
 movie never came out of paper this is the best opportunity to revisit 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.950
 the ghost hunter quartet was an incredible degree of involvement 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:19.699
 infidelity with whimsical production inspired dialogues and lots of action is 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.120
 certainly one of the most remarkable releases of 2 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.169
