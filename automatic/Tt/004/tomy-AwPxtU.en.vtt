00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
before they all went out and at some

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.429 
before they all went out and at some
point<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.610> think<00:01:41.670> Blair<00:01:42.210> had<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> fantastic

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.980 
point I think Blair had the fantastic
idea<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.640> Serena<00:01:45.090> wanted<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.810> was

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
idea that what Serena wanted to do was

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.889 
idea that what Serena wanted to do was
to<00:01:46.140> keep<00:01:46.290> drinking<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.520> Blair<00:01:47.909> gave<00:01:48.270> her<00:01:48.509> shots

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
