mixed berries along with my protein
powder<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.300> sometimes<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.230> just<00:02:12.290> use<00:02:12.490> Powerade

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490

which has a lot of gaxx Rossa so I get

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.550

protein shake just sipping on a bit by

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.680 
protein shake just sipping on a bit by
bit<00:02:31.650> along<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.760> along<00:02:34.209> with<00:02:34.239> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
bit along with that and along with the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.759 
bit along with that and along with the
creatine<00:02:35.170> I've<00:02:35.410> got<00:02:35.650> my<00:02:36.550> vitamin<00:02:37.150> C<00:02:37.660> vitamin<00:02:38.019> C

creatine I've got my vitamin C vitamin C
stops<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.400> rise<00:02:39.580> of<00:02:39.880> cortisol<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:40.720> cortisol

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
stops the rise of cortisol so cortisol

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.759 
stops the rise of cortisol so cortisol
increases<00:02:42.730> muscle<00:02:42.910> breakdown<00:02:43.680> during<00:02:44.680> a

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
increases muscle breakdown during a

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.070 
increases muscle breakdown during a
workout<00:02:45.130> but<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.550> process<00:02:45.849> carries<00:02:46.569> on<00:02:46.780> for

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
workout but that process carries on for

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.630 
workout but that process carries on for
the<00:02:47.140> three<00:02:47.410> hours<00:02:47.560> after<00:02:47.830> work<00:02:48.130> oh<00:02:48.340> so<00:02:48.550> you

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
the three hours after work oh so you

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.930 
the three hours after work oh so you
want<00:02:49.620> vitamin<00:02:50.620> C<00:02:50.860> along<00:02:51.489> with<00:02:51.760> your

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
want vitamin C along with your

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.930 
want vitamin C along with your
post-workout<00:02:52.330> shake<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.890> very<00:02:54.430> important

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
post-workout shake and very important

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.150 
post-workout shake and very important
and<00:02:55.150> zinc<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.900> also<00:02:56.200> very<00:02:56.440> important<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.920> start

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
and zinc is also very important to start

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.390 
and zinc is also very important to start
to<00:02:57.489> stop<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.390> rise<00:02:58.600> of<00:02:58.840> estrogen<00:02:59.590> it<00:03:00.010> actually

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
to stop the rise of estrogen it actually

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.030 
to stop the rise of estrogen it actually
stops<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.870> rise<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.080> will<00:03:02.440> roll<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.799> taste

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
stops the rise that will roll the taste

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.949 
stops the rise that will roll the taste
and<00:03:03.310> Roman<00:03:03.640> tastes<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:04.000> precursor<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.569> estrogen

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
and Roman tastes a precursor to estrogen

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.680 
and Roman tastes a precursor to estrogen
so<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:06.040> zinc<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.580> athletic<00:03:07.030> greens<00:03:07.239> is<00:03:07.390> also

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
so the zinc and athletic greens is also

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.270 
so the zinc and athletic greens is also
important<00:03:08.080> in<00:03:08.140> your<00:03:08.200> post-workout<00:03:08.560> shake<00:03:08.830> and

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
important in your post-workout shake and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.680 
important in your post-workout shake and
then<00:03:09.819> vitamin<00:03:10.299> D<00:03:10.450> vitamin<00:03:10.630> D<00:03:11.069> helps<00:03:12.069> free<00:03:13.000> -
