 better quality than photos you with

 1020 always saves the full picture of the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.420
 Of course, the big camera sensor also falls 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.950
 in the form of the device on the camera 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.479
 stands out and you can do that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.070

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.020
 recordings 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.310
