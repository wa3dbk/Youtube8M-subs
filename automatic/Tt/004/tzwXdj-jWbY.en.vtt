so<00:00:06.160> first<00:00:06.400> of<00:00:06.460> all<00:00:06.490> we<00:00:06.640> take<00:00:06.760> a<00:00:06.820> piece<00:00:07.060> of<00:00:07.090> pink

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.390 
so first of all we take a piece of pink

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.840 
so first of all we take a piece of pink
baseplate<00:00:07.960> wax<00:00:08.280> run<00:00:09.280> it<00:00:09.400> under<00:00:09.580> warm<00:00:09.760> water

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:09.850 
baseplate wax run it under warm water

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.339 
baseplate wax run it under warm water
until<00:00:10.270> it's<00:00:10.450> soft<00:00:10.690> fold<00:00:11.620> it<00:00:11.830> in<00:00:11.950> half<00:00:13.170> fold<00:00:14.170> it

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
until it's soft fold it in half fold it

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.620 
until it's soft fold it in half fold it
in<00:00:14.410> half<00:00:14.440> again<00:00:14.740> and<00:00:15.160> then<00:00:16.059> fold<00:00:16.360> it<00:00:16.510> in<00:00:16.570> half

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
in half again and then fold it in half

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.230 
in half again and then fold it in half
one<00:00:17.050> more<00:00:17.320> time<00:00:17.560> so<00:00:18.340> now<00:00:18.490> we<00:00:18.550> have<00:00:18.790> this<00:00:18.939> thick

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
one more time so now we have this thick

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.570 
one more time so now we have this thick
piece<00:00:19.540> of<00:00:20.099> bait<00:00:21.099> plate<00:00:21.390> base<00:00:22.390> plate<00:00:22.690> wax<00:00:22.960> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
piece of bait plate base plate wax and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.390 
piece of bait plate base plate wax and
then<00:00:24.580> we<00:00:24.730> guide<00:00:24.940> the<00:00:25.119> jaw<00:00:27.689> forward<00:00:28.689> and<00:00:29.400> center

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
then we guide the jaw forward and center

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.820 
then we guide the jaw forward and center
it<00:00:30.609> forward<00:00:31.060> a<00:00:31.090> little<00:00:31.210> bit<00:00:31.300> farther<00:00:31.600> a<00:00:31.930> little

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
it forward a little bit farther a little

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:40.860 
it forward a little bit farther a little
bit<00:00:32.949> farther<00:00:33.190> close<00:00:34.090> lightly<00:00:37.019> stop<00:00:38.019> and<00:00:38.909> open

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
bit farther close lightly stop and open

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.020 
bit farther close lightly stop and open
now<00:00:41.650> we<00:00:41.710> should<00:00:41.950> have<00:00:41.980> indentations<00:00:42.790> of<00:00:42.910> the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
now we should have indentations of the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.740 
now we should have indentations of the
upper<00:00:43.270> teeth<00:00:43.480> and<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:44.380> lower<00:00:44.590> teeth<00:00:44.950> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
upper teeth and the lower teeth and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.479 
upper teeth and the lower teeth and
there<00:00:46.750> are<00:00:46.900> not<00:00:47.200> many<00:00:47.380> indentations<00:00:48.130> in<00:00:48.250> that

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
there are not many indentations in that

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.830 
there are not many indentations in that
so<00:00:48.700> we're<00:00:48.850> going<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.150> do<00:00:49.270> it<00:00:49.390> again

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
so we're going to do it again

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.260 
so we're going to do it again
I'll<00:00:50.290> get<00:00:50.500> another<00:00:50.760> reheat<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.059> we're

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
I'll get another reheat it and we're

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.170 
I'll get another reheat it and we're
going<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.450> do<00:00:52.600> it<00:00:52.690> again<00:00:53.790> after<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.030> base

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
going to do it again after the base

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.280 
going to do it again after the base
plate<00:00:55.510> wax<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:57.070> folded<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.780> slide<00:00:59.080> it<00:00:59.230> in

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
plate wax is folded just slide it in

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.180 
plate wax is folded just slide it in
guide<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.440> jaw<00:01:02.650> forward<00:01:03.660> forward<00:01:04.660> farther<00:01:05.229> or

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
guide the jaw forward forward farther or

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:14.730 
guide the jaw forward forward farther or
protrusion<00:01:07.180> close<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:11.850> stop<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.149> open<00:01:13.990> now

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
protrusion close and stop and open now

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.469 
protrusion close and stop and open now
that<00:01:14.800> gives<00:01:15.130> us<00:01:15.280> our<00:01:15.399> indentations<00:01:16.210> of<00:01:16.360> the

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
that gives us our indentations of the

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.800 
that gives us our indentations of the
upper<00:01:16.750> teeth<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.119> lower<00:01:19.300> teeth<00:01:19.600> and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
upper teeth and of the lower teeth and

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.130 
upper teeth and of the lower teeth and
the<00:01:19.869> models<00:01:20.229> can<00:01:20.410> now<00:01:20.590> be<00:01:20.820> positioned<00:01:21.820> in<00:01:21.910> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the models can now be positioned in that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.200 
the models can now be positioned in that
what<00:01:23.140> we<00:01:23.259> want<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.619> want<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:23.979> lower<00:01:24.130> jaw<00:01:24.430> just

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
what we want to want the lower jaw just

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.320 
what we want to want the lower jaw just
past<00:01:25.479> in<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.110> end<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:27.310> way<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.910> lower<00:01:28.060> jaw

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
past in the end this way the lower jaw

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.380 
past in the end this way the lower jaw
position<00:01:28.509> just<00:01:28.990> past<00:01:29.259> in<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.770> end<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.460> open

about<00:01:31.509> five<00:01:31.869> to<00:01:32.050> six<00:01:32.229> millimeters<00:01:32.500> make<00:01:33.369> sure

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
about five to six millimeters make sure

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.700 
about five to six millimeters make sure
your<00:01:33.700> wax<00:01:33.940> is<00:01:34.210> thick<00:01:34.450> enough<00:01:34.479> so<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.020> when

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
your wax is thick enough so that when

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.469 
your wax is thick enough so that when
they<00:01:35.830> close<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.340> still<00:01:36.520> have<00:01:36.700> about<00:01:36.880> five<00:01:37.180> to

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
they close you still have about five to

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.740 
they close you still have about five to
six<00:01:37.630> millimeters<00:01:37.899> of<00:01:39.300> Interac<00:01:40.300> lose<00:01:40.509> all

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
six millimeters of Interac lose all

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.120 
six millimeters of Interac lose all
space<00:01:41.110> I<00:01:43.140> think<00:01:44.140> that's<00:01:44.500> well<00:01:44.710> then<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:45.009> can

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
space I think that's well then you can

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.090 
space I think that's well then you can
add<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.580> whole<00:01:45.819> bunch

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100
