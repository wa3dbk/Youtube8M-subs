on number two and it worked great and it
worked<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.269> work<00:02:28.079> awesome<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.920> got<00:02:29.069> in

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
worked for work awesome you got in

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.809 
worked for work awesome you got in
phinney<00:02:29.459> folders<00:02:29.970> for<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.870> dollar<00:02:31.170> ninety-nine

phinney folders for a dollar ninety-nine

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.050 
phinney folders for a dollar ninety-nine
what<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:32.970> does<00:02:33.239> is<00:02:33.510> eliminate<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:35.610> limit<00:02:35.940> of
