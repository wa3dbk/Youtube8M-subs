00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:11.979
 I followed elena in elena asins along with 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.159
 today I'm going to show you how I make the invisible joints 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.960
 with a technique called graciela meshing 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.499
 it was in English that the sitges cinema 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:23.909
 this technique is used a lot to close the shoulders of the garments 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.140
 pomp the tip of the boxes for example 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.080
 we can compare them with the little shirt since we already have to finish it 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.020
 first 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.729
 when we finished the garment 

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:40.340
 we have to carry the points normally 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.050
 but enabling 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.590
 unit of another color 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.050
 nor as you can see here is not closed normal 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.960
 but to use nor the most credit 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.390
 This allows us 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.840
 that we can see the points clearly 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 to pick them up for sewing 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.230
 when we cut and sold the main color of the garment 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.580
 do not leave it a little bit 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.060
 to be able to use it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.940
 for cela sewing 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.940
 ok let's start 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.790
 we face the two pieces that we have to join right versus right 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.880
 there are no important limits 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.330
 we always have to have 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.010
 the reverse 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.500
 outside 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 then it was not generated and lion a needle 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.480
 we'll see 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.980
 we have the level of oxygen in the last point one as has been 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.110
 when we have closed 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.650
 now we have to take the first point from the other side 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.150
 pass the thread 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.060
 the texts are staining like this 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.090
 valencia mons 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.000
 n you have to throw them percent 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.530
 enough but not too much 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.430
 it's about that the attention is similar to that of the laps we already have 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.779
 made so that the seam is really invisible 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.369
 while the steering wheel is pulled 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.549
 good 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:13.829
 firm white 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.959
 but without pressing because if we press it will be very emotional 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.649
 very ugly 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.840
 well then now we look where we have wounded 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.409
 one 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.369
 on this side 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:28.319
 we take 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.589
 the point that is next 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:33.589
 as a child 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:40.189
 we took this point and we go back to the nile, that is, the point of the 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.189
 that we have left 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.469
 we were a little 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.469
 bad now we have Emilio on this side 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.019
 as always the point that is next to the injured 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.899
 and we put everything back in the deceased we've left 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.589
 now we have the Indian here 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.099
 this point did not come out 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.459
 let's take the time that it is next to the child 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.519
 the same 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.519
 from which the child came 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.709
 let's repeat it 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.009
 aquesta el inau 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.009
 the next point 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.009
 and we return 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.169
 to the point 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.869
 where does this same one come from? 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:44.379
 this same point do not fail last minute 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.519
 before this year 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.519
 we take the point on the child's side 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:04.089
 and we return 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:07.089
 the day before yesterday 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:14.449
 fifteen minutes 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.449
 we take the side point 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.659
 we will not go back 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.659
 the previous 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.150
 she is turning the tissue 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.400
 Chao make the tissue that goes half say 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.219
 the normal points of the normal turn 

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:44.659
 so that the position that the invisible actually look at all the time is the same 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 let's do with one minute to go 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.589
 small than a girl 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.259
 the last points 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.710
 minoru suzuki blue 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.710
 take the belt 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.650
 you have to be careful not to get hooked to the thread but colon but good is unfaithful 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.789
 more than anything, how easy finance does not happen either 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.849
 peak then we will take it out 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.009
 the only thing that the Imperials will expel us from doing and we have to give it a 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.949
 conflict with the scissors but also neither 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:34.919
 well, we have 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.919
 Kim here we are at the last point 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.849
 just when the Salamanca team 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.289
 I thought that if a blemish though it eliminated 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.240
 nothing happens 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.520
 india launched the last point of this other side we return 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.080
 to the last one 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.460
 iniesta 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.009
 now here 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.110
 we can hook again to ensure the sewing 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:12.009
 we improve with a 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:13.629
 with a milestone 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:16.629
 what we have thought 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.159
 Well here you have your sewing and it's over 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.909
 Now what we have to do is to say those centuries 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.909
 proximities 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.369
 This is very easy 

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:35.569
 much easier if it has not been spotted 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.729
 But let's go easy anyway, the first thing to do is 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:39.389
 take 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.960
 the thread of the first point 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.069
 and strips 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.379
 if it has not been stained it will go out alone 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:47.960
 perfect 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.960
 now we do the same thing commented 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.710
 we turn 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.710
 here is a little bit spotted a foul 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.210
 mimicha smudges a little 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.889
 similarly we simply give a little cut with the tucita much care of 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.889
 do not cut hands of the short 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.830
 and that we have our position and do tomorrow 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.169
 go here 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:26.490
 as you can see 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.490
 it is practically invisible 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.550
 and it does not leave any kind of 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.419
 blacks are an expense 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:39.749
 perfect in front and behind 

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:42.609
 thank you very much for divine power and see you soon
