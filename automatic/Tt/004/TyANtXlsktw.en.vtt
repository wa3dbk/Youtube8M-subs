eventually we're able to break them down

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.000 
eventually we're able to break them down
pretty<00:03:14.450> quickly<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.989> simply<00:03:15.320> without<00:03:15.739> too

much hassle detector may seem to be an

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.280 
much hassle detector may seem to be an
easy<00:03:19.280> encounter<00:03:19.730> but<00:03:19.970> he<00:03:20.090> is<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.209> mini<00:03:20.420> boss<00:03:20.600> and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
easy encounter but he is a mini boss and

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.840 
easy encounter but he is a mini boss and
because<00:03:21.620> we<00:03:21.890> got<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.130> clear<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.520> entire

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
because we got to clear the entire

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.550 
because we got to clear the entire
flashpoint<00:03:23.420> I've<00:03:23.930> got<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.170> pretty<00:03:24.380> good

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
flashpoint I've got a pretty good

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.650 
flashpoint I've got a pretty good
perspective<00:03:24.920> on<00:03:25.630> how<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.690> whole<00:03:27.020> five<00:03:27.650> point

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
perspective on how the whole five point

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.380 
perspective on how the whole five point
is<00:03:28.810> an<00:03:28.930> entire<00:03:29.490> dungeon<00:03:30.490> kind<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.880> progresses

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
is an entire dungeon kind of progresses

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.110 
is an entire dungeon kind of progresses
and<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:32.440> start<00:03:32.680> off<00:03:32.860> very<00:03:33.070> simple<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.030> it

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
and you start off very simple and it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.600 
and you start off very simple and it
kind<00:03:34.300> of<00:03:34.330> eases<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.870> in<00:03:35.020> to<00:03:35.710> boss<00:03:36.070> flights<00:03:36.400> and

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
kind of eases you in to boss flights and

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.370 
kind of eases you in to boss flights and
encounters<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.300> progressively<00:03:37.900> makes<00:03:38.230> the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
encounters and progressively makes the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.130 
encounters and progressively makes the
more<00:03:38.560> difficult<00:03:38.710> to<00:03:39.040> get<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:39.610> yes<00:03:40.480> detector<00:03:40.960> is

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
more difficult to get so yes detector is

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.170 
more difficult to get so yes detector is
simple<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.620> easy<00:03:41.860> but<00:03:42.760> there's<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> lot<00:03:43.150> more

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
simple and easy but there's a lot more

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
lot more health than the left and the

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.520 
lot more health than the left and the

right droids welcome the right droids
are<00:04:40.650> essentially<00:04:41.040> bodyguards<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:41.910> you'll

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
are essentially bodyguards and you'll

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.000 
are essentially bodyguards and you'll
see<00:04:42.780> in<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.050> beginning<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.470> left<00:04:43.680> has<00:04:43.890> an

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
see in the beginning the left has an

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.560 
see in the beginning the left has an
orange<00:04:44.370> shield<00:04:44.760> which<00:04:45.090> is<00:04:45.240> actually<00:04:45.420> a

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
orange shield which is actually a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.330 
orange shield which is actually a
reflective<00:04:46.110> shield<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.500> any<00:04:46.680> damage<00:04:46.740> done<00:04:47.100> to

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
reflective shield so any damage done to

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.420 
reflective shield so any damage done to
him<00:04:47.580> reflect<00:04:48.540> back<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.900> you<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:50.070> droid<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.400> the

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
him reflect back to you the droid on the

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.220 
him reflect back to you the droid on the
right<00:04:50.640> side<00:04:50.880> has<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.330> blue<00:04:51.540> absorb<00:04:51.930> shield

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
right side has that blue absorb shield

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.720 
right side has that blue absorb shield
so<00:04:52.470> any<00:04:52.620> damage<00:04:52.710> done<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.220> him<00:04:53.490> will

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
so any damage done to him will

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.580 
so any damage done to him will
effectively<00:04:54.090> be<00:04:54.240> nothing<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.290> point<00:04:55.320> of

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
effectively be nothing so the point of

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.050 
effectively be nothing so the point of
the<00:04:55.680> fight<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.040> essentially<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.610> attack<00:04:56.910> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
the fight is essentially to attack the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.520 
the fight is essentially to attack the
droid<00:04:57.300> that<00:04:57.480> doesn't<00:04:57.750> have<00:04:57.900> a<00:04:57.930> shield<00:04:58.320> and

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
droid that doesn't have a shield and

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.230 
droid that doesn't have a shield and
this<00:04:59.040> changes<00:04:59.460> throughout<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.790> encounter

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
