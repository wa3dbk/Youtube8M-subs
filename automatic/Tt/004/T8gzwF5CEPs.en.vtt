00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.540
 Hi, I'm Joltter from Unisport WebTV - 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.260
 - Team Unisport is again on the go - 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.480
 - And today we are in Munich for a Nike Tiempo event. 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.760
 Later in the evening, Jerome Boateng comes to visit, - 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.100
 - But first we tried the new Tiempo Legend V in action. 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.300
 Come with me! 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 We have just finished testing the new Tiempo at this underground location in Munich, - 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.060
 - massage of fun and I scored some goals - 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.500
 - and we got the game a little ball with a whole bunch of media people from around Europe, - 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:35.040
 - great experience, but now I think we should go back to the event area and wait for Mr. Boateng. 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 We are here to celebrate Tiempo, - 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.380
 - the new Tiempo V, - 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.780
 - and the launch of the best leather boot in football, - 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.640
 - as well as the launch of the new Tiempo 94 shoes, - 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.980
 - taking the Tiempo from the football field and passing it on to life outside. 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.820
 It is an exciting feature from us, to make this boot with everything Nike innovation and a different roof on design - 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.680
 - and then transfer it to a product used away from the track - 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.560
 - where we can honor our heritage - 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.180
 - and there is the great plague, the obvious connection - 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.620
 - It really lets people think about how they're going to look outside the pitch and how they look like football players. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.360
 I sit here with that one, Jerome Boateng - 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.980
 - thank you for coming. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.420
 Hey. 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.740
 How important is good style and fashion to you on and off the pitch? 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.080
 It's probably more important away from the track - 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.160
 - I'm not better at looking better - 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.940
 - But away from the track I like to experiment and have shoes not everyone has. 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.760
 What is the best thing about working with Nike? 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.740
 It is always interesting we have plenty of things to do - 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.960
 - we have meetings and work on things, as with Tiempo V - 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.460
 - it's always good - 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.700
 - and they are really creative and I really like what they do on the clothes and shoes front. 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.920
 I'm really happy to be with Nike. 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.000
 It is difficult to know where you are going if you do not know where you come from - 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.140
 - Tiempo as a silo reminds us that we must respect our heritage - 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.640
 - but at the same time we can risk things - 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.580
 - and with this boots we take some chances, especially with the design - 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.240
 - and to pass it on to life outside the field is not something we have done before - 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.980
 - But something we feel is right when you think of the legacy and Tiempo's place at Nike Football - 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.060
 - and something we know is critical for young people who want to be football players both on and off the pitch. 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.300
 The light will soon be extinguished here for the event in Munich - 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.900
 - and it's been an exciting day - 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.260
 - We tried the boots and talked to Jerome Boateng - 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.460
 - and heard about the story behind Tiempo V, - 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.000
 - as well as the new tiempo 94. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.540
 Germany was super cool and we are hopefully back soon - 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.940
 - meanwhile, you can see more cool videos from us at Unisport WebTV. 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.600
 I'm gone! 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.700
 Hi, I'm Jerome Boateng and I see Unisport WebTV.
