00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
explaining it basically previously cydia

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.200 
explaining it basically previously cydia
was<00:00:28.439> ran<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:28.920> root<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.730> every<00:00:29.939> time<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.179> open

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
was ran as root so every time you open

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.790 
was ran as root so every time you open
up<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> application<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:31.109> was<00:00:31.199> ran<00:00:31.380> his<00:00:31.529> route

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
up the application it was ran his route

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.620 
up the application it was ran his route
now<00:00:32.070> at<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.399> point<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.880> actually<00:00:33.210> run<00:00:33.450> as

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
now at this point is actually run as

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.229 
now at this point is actually run as
mobile<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.010> that's<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.579> basically<00:00:35.910> give

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
mobile so that's going to basically give

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.119 
mobile so that's going to basically give
the<00:00:36.390> developers<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> ability<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.590> theme

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the developers the ability to theme

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.790 
the developers the ability to theme
cydia<00:00:39.000> for<00:00:39.510> us<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.140> install<00:00:40.379> tweaks

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
cydia for us so we can install tweaks

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.049 
cydia for us so we can install tweaks
and<00:00:41.010> they're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.399> take<00:00:41.610> effect<00:00:41.969> within

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and they're going to take effect within

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.330 
and they're going to take effect within
cydia<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.930> usually<00:00:43.379> when<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> download<00:00:44.309> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
cydia so usually when you download a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.910 
cydia so usually when you download a
tweak<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.239> open<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.570> cydia<00:00:45.780> no<00:00:46.469> changes

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
tweak and you open up cydia no changes

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
tweak and you open up cydia no changes
take<00:00:47.250> effect<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.820> cydia<00:00:48.239> city<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.719> usually

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
take effect to cydia city is usually

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.290 
take effect to cydia city is usually
exactly<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> same<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.820> time<00:00:50.850> you're<00:00:51.210> not

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
thing that i did very first let's go

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.359 
thing that i did very first let's go
install<00:01:32.640> eclipse<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.659> now<00:01:34.290> eclipse<00:01:34.740> too<00:01:35.040> if

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
install eclipse to now eclipse too if

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.830 
install eclipse to now eclipse too if
you<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:35.700> know<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.240> does<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.600> basically

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you don't know what it does it basically

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
you don't know what it does it basically
themes<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.520> applications<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.000> makes<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
themes all applications and makes it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.170 
themes all applications and makes it
look<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.650> night<00:01:40.979> mode<00:01:41.220> basically<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.060> we

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
look like night mode basically so if we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.389 
look like night mode basically so if we
enable<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.380> quit<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.710> applications

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
enable this and we quit all applications

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.030 
enable this and we quit all applications
you'll<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.659> i<00:01:45.689> open<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.079> cydia<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.920> is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you'll see when i open up cydia that is

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.880 
you'll see when i open up cydia that is
going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> theme<00:01:47.610> inside<00:01:48.390> city<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.930> well<00:01:48.960> now

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
going to theme inside city as well now

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.350 
going to theme inside city as well now
it's<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.820> look<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.180> great

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's not going to look that great

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.450 
it's not going to look that great
because<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.200> hasn't<00:01:52.350> been<00:01:52.649> optimized<00:01:53.340> for

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
because it hasn't been optimized for

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.789 
because it hasn't been optimized for
cydia<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:54.090> yet<00:01:54.270> hopefully<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.320> developer

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
cydia just yet hopefully the developer

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.679 
cydia just yet hopefully the developer
will<00:01:56.100> update<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:57.000> Cydia<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:57.570> can

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
will update this for Cydia and we can

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.109 
will update this for Cydia and we can
get<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.320> awesome<00:01:58.860> looking<00:01:59.579> night<00:01:59.850> mode

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
get a really awesome looking night mode

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.240 
get a really awesome looking night mode
for<00:02:00.659> Cydia<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.560> can<00:02:01.710> see<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:01.920> here

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
for Cydia now you can see right here

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.280 
for Cydia now you can see right here
that<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:02.939> over<00:02:02.969> into<00:02:03.509> installed<00:02:04.079> you

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that if we go over into installed you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.840 
that if we go over into installed you
can<00:02:04.320> kind<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.280> could<00:02:05.520> look<00:02:05.790> like

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
can kind of see what it could look like

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.359 
can kind of see what it could look like
of<00:02:06.479> course<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.869> color<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> text<00:02:07.829> needs<00:02:08.250> to

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
of course the color of the text needs to

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
of course the color of the text needs to
be<00:02:08.489> changed<00:02:08.759> from<00:02:09.119> black<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:10.080> know

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
be changed from black to you know

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.440 
be changed from black to you know
something<00:02:10.649> else<00:02:10.800> obviously<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.209> see

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
something else obviously but you can see

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730 
something else obviously but you can see
that<00:02:12.690> cydia<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.470> come

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
to basically because we really haven't

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.840 
to basically because we really haven't
had<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.900> drastic<00:02:25.620> overhaul<00:02:25.740> of<00:02:26.340> what<00:02:26.520> cydia

had a drastic overhaul of what cydia

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.850 
had a drastic overhaul of what cydia
looks<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.300> since<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.960> don't<00:02:28.260> even<00:02:28.350> know<00:02:28.590> when

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
looks like since I don't even know when

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.580 
looks like since I don't even know when
we<00:02:29.760> did<00:02:29.940> get<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> small<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.750> change<00:02:31.200> back<00:02:31.530> i
