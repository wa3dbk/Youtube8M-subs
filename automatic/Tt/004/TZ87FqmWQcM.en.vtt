00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
picture we're going to have the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.360 
picture we're going to have the
turntables<00:00:33.290> keep<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.530> colored<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:37.129> we'll<00:00:38.129> try

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
turntables keep on colored and we'll try

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.520 
turntables keep on colored and we'll try
and<00:00:38.430> make<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> screen<00:00:39.059> color<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and make the screen color so we want to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:52.250 
and make the screen color so we want to
click<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> turntables<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.230> highlight<00:00:43.230> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.069 

to<00:00:52.800> minimize<00:00:53.190> objects<00:00:53.730> or<00:00:54.149> minimize<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
to minimize objects or minimize the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.700 
to minimize objects or minimize the
thing<00:00:55.850> holds<00:00:56.850> option<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> see<00:01:01.409> here

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
thing holds option so you can see here

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
thing holds option so you can see here
it's<00:01:02.070> minimizing<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:05.100> starts<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.670> form<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it's minimizing it starts to form to the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.420 
it's minimizing it starts to form to the
picture<00:01:08.780> if<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.960> doesn't<00:01:10.289> work<00:01:10.470> right<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.280> can

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
picture if it doesn't work right you can

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.660 
picture if it doesn't work right you can
always<00:01:11.580> lower<00:01:11.850> your<00:01:12.090> diameter<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:13.670> that's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
always lower your diameter and that's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:25.980 
always lower your diameter and that's
like<00:01:15.149> finding

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.010 

you<00:01:26.560> see<00:01:26.710> here<00:01:26.950> how<00:01:27.070> we<00:01:27.130> got<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.340> spot<00:01:28.020> just

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
you see here how we got that spot just

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.770 
you see here how we got that spot just
click<00:01:29.259> brush<00:01:29.530> over<00:01:30.070> your<00:01:30.220> diameter<00:01:30.880> hold

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
click brush over your diameter hold

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.070 
click brush over your diameter hold
option<00:01:32.020> and<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.140> go<00:01:36.570> over<00:01:37.570> here<00:01:37.930> I

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
option and there you go over here I

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.679 
option and there you go over here I
recommend<00:01:38.500> using<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:39.100> lower<00:01:39.399> diameter<00:01:40.030> because

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
recommend using a lower diameter because

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.870 
recommend using a lower diameter because
your<00:01:40.840> speaker<00:01:41.170> headphones<00:01:41.649> are<00:01:42.340> black<00:01:42.640> and

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
your speaker headphones are black and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.389 
your speaker headphones are black and
your<00:01:43.090> turntable<00:01:43.600> basis<00:01:43.960> block<00:01:44.170> so<00:01:45.100> let's<00:01:45.250> just

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
your turntable basis block so let's just

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.480 
your turntable basis block so let's just
use<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.670> lower<00:01:45.820> diameter<00:01:47.009> always<00:01:48.009> fine<00:01:48.220> tune

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
use the lower diameter always fine tune

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.880 
use the lower diameter always fine tune
hold<00:01:49.330> option<00:01:49.570> and<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.950> minimizes<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.740> can

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
hold option and it minimizes you can

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.520 
hold option and it minimizes you can
always<00:01:54.159> if<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.549> gives<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.850> trouble

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
always if that gives you trouble

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.050 
always if that gives you trouble
minimize<00:01:56.530> your<00:01:56.710> dime<00:01:56.920> you're<00:01:57.280> really<00:01:57.880> really

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
minimize your dime you're really really

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:06.420 
minimize your dime you're really really
low<00:01:59.399> like<00:02:00.399> there<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:01.000> see

use<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> pc<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:56.470> here<00:02:56.740> you<00:02:57.160> can<00:02:57.220> see<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.550> we're

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
use a pc so here you can see that we're

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.390 
use a pc so here you can see that we're
getting<00:02:58.090> really<00:02:58.330> really<00:02:58.660> into

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:19.530 

hold<00:03:06.000> option<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.480> minimize

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.449 

you<00:03:20.079> may<00:03:20.260> not<00:03:20.439> be<00:03:20.590> able<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.890> get<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.129> screen

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
you may not be able to get the screen

00:03:21.459 --> 00:04:03.050 
you may not be able to get the screen
but<00:03:22.299> it's<00:03:22.480> okay<00:03:24.450> we'll<00:03:25.450> try<00:03:25.599> one<00:03:25.780> more<00:03:25.959> time

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.690 

okay<00:04:03.720> there<00:04:04.020> we<00:04:04.050> go<00:04:04.140> so<00:04:05.099> hold<00:04:05.250> command<00:04:05.520> and

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
okay there we go so hold command and
