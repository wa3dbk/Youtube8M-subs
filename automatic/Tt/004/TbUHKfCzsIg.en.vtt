00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello this is my second tutorial topic 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.590
 where I want to show you what is the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.720
 configuration of the project or a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.970
 project the order of layers and groups 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.680
 of layers 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.870
 and one of the things you should know 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.870
 First of all, it's the layers 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.130
 what is here 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.130
 it's the layer panel 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.870
 all layers and groups of layers 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.870
 you will see here 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.600
 one of the things that you should have in 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.329
 account is that they are the layers 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.079
 the layers are being as if they were 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.089
 empty papers transparent papers 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.000
 every time you create a new layer it's 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.300
 as if it were a totally acetate 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.300
 empty 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.160
 as you will see I have an image of 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.160
 background 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.270
 and I just got a new layer to the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.580
 draw on it 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.650
 the rest transparent 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.650
 it stops being transparent where you paint 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.810
 something you should keep in mind is that 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:30.210
 each layer that you use and add to 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.850
 project will be completely empty 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.180
 as you will see are independent layers 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.180
 that I have added 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.690
 we will always pay for a new layer to be a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.510
 power 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.510
 I would like independent to all the others 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.509
 One thing that we should keep in mind is 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.069
 that always the level of depth of 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.420
 the layers will always interfere according to 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.540
 the height of how they are in the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.790
 layer panel the layers above but 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.130
 those that are in front the most will be seen 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.060
 those below are the ones that most 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.060
 at depth they will be 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.080
 Effects are applied up colors 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.490
 solid and they were down 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.080
 the art of the lines or the cne art should 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.420
 go totally up as it is the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.420
 reference from where we draw 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.590
 there are users who work when they work 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.170
 with a layer complexity level very 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.569
 different 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.170
 for example I use a layer level 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:57.240
 much higher 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.240
 since I divide by groups of layers 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:05.010
 how this folder that was is a group 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.010
 that you can put multiple layers in 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.730
 and for example I create different groups 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.180
 how is the body being in this case 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.180
 the stone 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.610
 I think group is the scene 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.550
 l would be these works 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:41.430
 since I have a color 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.430
 and would make a group more that are the effects 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.090
 in this case I do not have aggregators with 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.090
 effects so there is no layer 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.150
 sometimes tends to use groups 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.970
 of beds as needed 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.400
 for example in tender leaves I have a 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.010
 group that is totally in the background 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.790
 after all of them that is being 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.790
 the background 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.230
 in this fund he usually inserted a 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.230
 layer that is in black 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.610
 because I make this layer in black 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.939
 because any problem of a layer 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.569
 that I'm not sure if the colored well 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.819
 on its outside 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:37.360
 through this layer I can see if he has 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.360
 done well or not 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.870
 if it was more necessary to see it, it did not deactivate
