just<00:00:30.290> did<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:31.220> according<00:00:31.670> to<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:31.970> instruction

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
just did it according to the instruction

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.869 
just did it according to the instruction
manual<00:00:32.840> it<00:00:33.770> took<00:00:34.070> me<00:00:34.190> quite<00:00:34.220> a<00:00:34.430> while<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:34.820> build

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
manual it took me quite a while to build

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.450 
manual it took me quite a while to build
it<00:00:35.180> I<00:00:35.530> would<00:00:36.530> say<00:00:36.650> probably<00:00:36.830> about<00:00:37.040> twelve

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
it I would say probably about twelve

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.450 
it I would say probably about twelve
hours<00:00:37.640> in<00:00:37.970> total<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.739> spent<00:00:39.739> pretty<00:00:40.040> much<00:00:40.160> all

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
hours in total I spent pretty much all

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.460 
hours in total I spent pretty much all
day<00:00:40.640> one<00:00:40.910> day<00:00:41.059> doing<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:41.720> a<00:00:41.780> few<00:00:41.930> hours<00:00:41.989> the

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
day one day doing it and a few hours the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.960 
day one day doing it and a few hours the
next<00:00:42.620> day<00:00:42.770> um<00:00:43.780> it<00:00:44.780> wasn't<00:00:45.739> that<00:00:46.010> hard<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.580> do<00:00:46.820> it

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
next day um it wasn't that hard to do it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.610 
next day um it wasn't that hard to do it
was<00:00:47.090> just<00:00:47.120> time<00:00:47.510> consuming<00:00:47.540> took<00:00:48.320> a<00:00:48.350> while

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
was just time consuming took a while

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.979 
was just time consuming took a while
there's<00:00:49.489> lots<00:00:49.729> of<00:00:49.850> pieces<00:00:50.180> lots<00:00:50.659> of<00:00:50.750> little

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
there's lots of pieces lots of little

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.460 
there's lots of pieces lots of little
bolts<00:00:51.440> each<00:00:51.830> one<00:00:52.129> of<00:00:52.220> these<00:00:52.370> little<00:00:53.470> joints

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
bolts each one of these little joints

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.350 
bolts each one of these little joints
right<00:00:54.650> here<00:00:54.890> where<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.760> aluminum<00:00:56.150> comes

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
right here where the aluminum comes

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.200 
right here where the aluminum comes
together<00:00:56.629> has<00:00:57.500> a<00:00:57.530> nut<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.040> a<00:00:58.100> bolt<00:00:58.129> on<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.670> so

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
together has a nut and a bolt on it so

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.060 
together has a nut and a bolt on it so
just<00:00:59.960> looking<00:01:00.229> at<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.440> structure<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.949> can

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
just looking at the structure you can

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.430 
just looking at the structure you can
see<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.370> would<00:01:01.430> take<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.640> little<00:01:01.790> while<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.440> put

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
see it would take a little while to put

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.210 
see it would take a little while to put
all<00:01:03.559> that<00:01:03.680> in<00:01:03.860> there

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
all that in there

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.880 
all that in there
and<00:01:04.309> get<00:01:05.120> everything<00:01:05.269> tightened<00:01:05.690> up<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:06.110> use<00:01:06.740> an

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
and get everything tightened up I use an

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.500 
and get everything tightened up I use an
electric<00:01:06.979> drill<00:01:07.520> with<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.790> socket<00:01:08.060> on<00:01:08.240> it<00:01:08.390> when

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
electric drill with a socket on it when

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.780 
electric drill with a socket on it when
I<00:01:08.570> went<00:01:08.720> back<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.900> tighten<00:01:09.320> everything<00:01:09.680> I<00:01:09.890> just

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
I went back to tighten everything I just

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.730 
I went back to tighten everything I just
kind<00:01:10.940> of<00:01:10.970> loosely<00:01:11.330> assembled<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.260> frame<00:01:12.560> at

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
kind of loosely assembled the frame at

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.480 
kind of loosely assembled the frame at
first<00:01:13.010> then<00:01:13.930> put<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:14.990> polycarbonate<00:01:15.979> panels

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
first then put the polycarbonate panels

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.980 
first then put the polycarbonate panels
in<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.909> then<00:01:17.090> went<00:01:17.299> back<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:17.630> tightened<00:01:17.960> down

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
in and then went back and tightened down

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.350 
in and then went back and tightened down
all<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.409> nuts<00:01:18.799> and<00:01:18.950> bolts<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:20.030> way<00:01:20.150> it<00:01:20.240> gave

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
all the nuts and bolts that way it gave

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.690 
all the nuts and bolts that way it gave
me<00:01:20.479> a<00:01:20.510> little<00:01:20.690> bit<00:01:20.810> of<00:01:20.990> room<00:01:21.170> to<00:01:21.380> work<00:01:21.530> with

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
me a little bit of room to work with

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.770 
me a little bit of room to work with
probably<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.820> hardest<00:01:23.149> thing<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.329> figure<00:01:23.630> out

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
probably the hardest thing to figure out

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.620 
probably the hardest thing to figure out
was<00:01:23.990> how<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.320> put<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.619> door<00:01:24.890> on<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.399> I<00:01:26.299> didn't

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
was how to put the door on and I didn't

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.969 
was how to put the door on and I didn't
actually<00:01:26.780> do<00:01:27.259> it<00:01:27.409> according<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.920> the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
actually do it according to the

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.190 
actually do it according to the
instructions<00:01:28.579> because<00:01:29.570> it<00:01:29.750> was<00:01:29.869> supposed<00:01:30.109> to

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
instructions because it was supposed to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.899 
instructions because it was supposed to
slide<00:01:30.530> open<00:01:31.130> and<00:01:31.280> closed<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:34.340> door<00:01:34.609> in

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
slide open and closed and the door in

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.539 
slide open and closed and the door in
general<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.479> I<00:01:36.049> didn't<00:01:36.770> really<00:01:36.920> like<00:01:37.159> the

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
general just I didn't really like the

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.459 
general just I didn't really like the
design<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:38.689> what<00:01:38.810> I've<00:01:38.929> done<00:01:39.079> for<00:01:39.140> now

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
design of it so what I've done for now

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.260 
design of it so what I've done for now
is<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.829> just<00:01:39.859> bought<00:01:40.460> some<00:01:40.640> hinges<00:01:41.000> at<00:01:41.119> Home

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
is I just bought some hinges at Home

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.169 
is I just bought some hinges at Home
Depot<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:42.070> hinged<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.189> on<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.640> as<00:01:43.850> far<00:01:44.000> as<00:01:44.060> a

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
Depot and hinged it on and as far as a

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:45.669 
Depot and hinged it on and as far as a
latch<00:01:44.359> goes<00:01:44.630> I<00:01:44.780> tried<00:01:45.049> to<00:01:45.140> do<00:01:45.259> this<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:45.590> that

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
latch goes I tried to do this but that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.239 
latch goes I tried to do this but that
didn't<00:01:45.859> really<00:01:46.039> work<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:47.890> then<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:48.950> just<00:01:49.070> kind

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
didn't really work and then I just kind

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:50.649 
didn't really work and then I just kind
of<00:01:49.280> use<00:01:49.429> some<00:01:49.460> clothespins<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.149> do<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.479> and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
of use some clothespins to do it and

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.149 
of use some clothespins to do it and
I've<00:01:50.719> actually<00:01:50.899> narrowed<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> door<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:51.979> little

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
I've actually narrowed the door a little

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.889 
I've actually narrowed the door a little
bit<00:01:52.429> I<00:01:52.640> was<00:01:53.060> trying<00:01:53.359> to<00:01:53.390> get<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:53.659> to<00:01:53.719> fit

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
bit I was trying to get it to fit

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.859 
bit I was trying to get it to fit
between<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.320> doorway<00:01:54.829> but<00:01:55.700> these<00:01:56.030> side

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
between the doorway but these side

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.690 
between the doorway but these side
panels<00:01:57.409> here<00:01:58.090> actually<00:01:59.090> if<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.869> look<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:01.520> has

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
panels here actually if you look it has

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.940 
panels here actually if you look it has
a<00:02:01.729> larger<00:02:02.179> gap<00:02:02.359> at<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.569> top<00:02:02.630> comes<00:02:03.350> in<00:02:03.560> towards

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
a larger gap at the top comes in towards

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.160 
a larger gap at the top comes in towards
the<00:02:04.039> middle<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:05.420> has<00:02:05.569> a<00:02:05.600> larger<00:02:05.990> gap

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
the middle and it has a larger gap

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.559 
the middle and it has a larger gap
towards<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.679> bottom<00:02:06.859> and<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:08.090> does<00:02:08.270> that<00:02:08.420> on

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
towards the bottom and it does that on

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.350 
towards the bottom and it does that on
this<00:02:08.720> side<00:02:08.929> as<00:02:09.140> well<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.770> kind<00:02:09.979> of<00:02:10.039> bows<00:02:10.280> in<00:02:10.580> so

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
this side as well it kind of bows in so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.640 
this side as well it kind of bows in so
I<00:02:11.390> couldn't<00:02:11.630> really<00:02:11.780> get<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.080> door<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.380> fit

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
I couldn't really get the door to fit

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.090 
I couldn't really get the door to fit
between<00:02:13.069> those<00:02:13.520> panels<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.680> think<00:02:15.770> what<00:02:16.010> I'm

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
between those panels so I think what I'm

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.820 
between those panels so I think what I'm
going<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.370> later<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.830> actually

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
going to do later is just actually

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.980 
going to do later is just actually
rebuild<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.430> door<00:02:19.580> completely<00:02:19.990> replace

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
rebuild the door completely replace

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.050 
rebuild the door completely replace
these<00:02:21.230> side<00:02:21.500> pieces<00:02:22.660> with<00:02:23.950> actual<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:26.030> know

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
these side pieces with actual you know

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.820 
these side pieces with actual you know
maybe<00:02:26.269> some<00:02:26.510> angle<00:02:26.840> iron<00:02:26.959> or<00:02:27.290> some<00:02:27.440> wood<00:02:27.680> or

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
maybe some angle iron or some wood or

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.920 
maybe some angle iron or some wood or
something<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.250> it's<00:02:28.370> more<00:02:28.549> sturdy<00:02:28.849> and<00:02:29.120> then

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
something so it's more sturdy and then

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.970 
something so it's more sturdy and then
build<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.319> new<00:02:30.349> door<00:02:30.650> for

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
build a new door for

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.949 
build a new door for
it<00:02:31.099> with<00:02:31.370> some<00:02:31.519> hinges<00:02:31.879> and<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.390> proper<00:02:32.750> latch

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
it with some hinges and a proper latch

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.020 
it with some hinges and a proper latch
so<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.739> it<00:02:33.830> has<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> proper<00:02:34.400> door<00:02:34.610> on<00:02:34.760> it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
so that it has a proper door on it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.460 
so that it has a proper door on it
other<00:02:35.480> than<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.900> really<00:02:35.989> don't<00:02:36.200> have<00:02:36.319> any

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
other than that I really don't have any

didn't come crashing down or anything
like<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.549> but<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:07.790> did<00:03:08.060> do<00:03:08.180> something

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
like that but I did do something

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.660 
like that but I did do something
different<00:03:09.019> when<00:03:09.829> I<00:03:09.859> put<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.310> thing<00:03:10.340> up

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
different when I put the thing up

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.300 
different when I put the thing up
because<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.540> did<00:03:11.780> notice<00:03:12.019> that<00:03:12.170> what<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.280> was

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
because I did notice that what it was

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.180 
because I did notice that what it was
saying<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.940> do<00:03:14.120> didn't<00:03:15.109> really<00:03:15.319> make<00:03:15.500> sense<00:03:15.859> to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
saying to do didn't really make sense to

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.789 
saying to do didn't really make sense to
do<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:17.720> instructions<00:03:18.019> tell<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.560> just

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
do the instructions tell you to just

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.140 
do the instructions tell you to just
take<00:03:18.950> screws<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:20.019> put<00:03:21.019> it<00:03:21.109> through<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.410> metal

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
take screws and put it through the metal

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.750 
take screws and put it through the metal
metal<00:03:23.150> um<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:24.049> don't<00:03:25.040> know<00:03:25.160> if<00:03:25.280> these<00:03:25.400> bottom

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
metal um I don't know if these bottom

like<00:03:35.569> two<00:03:35.810> or<00:03:35.989> three<00:03:36.019> screws<00:03:37.239> per<00:03:38.239> each<00:03:38.480> side

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
like two or three screws per each side

like two or three screws per each side
and<00:03:39.290> I<00:03:39.319> was<00:03:39.440> thinking<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.769> myself<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:40.700> know<00:03:40.730> if

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
and I was thinking to myself you know if

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:42.909 
and I was thinking to myself you know if
we<00:03:40.970> did<00:03:41.120> get<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.299> really<00:03:41.599> bad<00:03:41.750> windstorm<00:03:42.410> that

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919 
we did get a really bad windstorm that

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.409 
we did get a really bad windstorm that
would<00:03:43.220> be<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.519> weak<00:03:43.700> point<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.150> structure

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
would be the weak point of the structure

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.319 
would be the weak point of the structure
because<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.530> force<00:03:45.829> of<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.579> wind<00:03:46.819> blowing<00:03:47.030> on

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
because the force of the wind blowing on

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:48.550 
because the force of the wind blowing on
the<00:03:47.419> side<00:03:47.630> of<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.840> wall<00:03:47.989> would<00:03:48.230> be<00:03:48.319> pretty

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
the side of the wall would be pretty

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.770 
the side of the wall would be pretty
good<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:49.099> know<00:03:49.280> over<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.489> 6070<00:03:50.120> mile<00:03:50.239> 80<00:03:50.510> mile

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
good you know over the 6070 mile 80 mile

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.830 
good you know over the 6070 mile 80 mile
an<00:03:50.900> hour<00:03:50.959> gust<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:52.299> that<00:03:53.299> would<00:03:53.450> pull<00:03:53.630> right

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
an hour gust and that would pull right

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.150 
an hour gust and that would pull right
through<00:03:53.900> that<00:03:54.169> aluminum<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:54.829> once<00:03:55.010> that

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
through that aluminum and once that

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.589 
through that aluminum and once that
happens<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.760> tire<00:03:55.970> structure<00:03:56.359> is<00:03:56.419> going<00:03:56.540> to

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
happens the tire structure is going to

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.839 
happens the tire structure is going to
come<00:03:56.750> down<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.139> that<00:03:57.859> is<00:03:58.099> definitely<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.579> weak

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
come down so that is definitely a weak

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.569 
come down so that is definitely a weak
point<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.560> what<00:04:00.709> I<00:04:00.739> did<00:04:01.010> was<00:04:01.220> I<00:04:01.310> went<00:04:01.519> around

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
point so what I did was I went around

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.170 
point so what I did was I went around
you<00:04:01.910> can<00:04:02.030> see<00:04:02.470> you<00:04:03.470> know<00:04:03.560> every<00:04:03.799> every<00:04:04.180> eight

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
you can see you know every every eight

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.759 
you can see you know every every eight
to<00:04:05.209> ten<00:04:05.480> inches<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.870> really<00:04:06.109> didn't<00:04:06.290> measure<00:04:06.500> I

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
to ten inches I really didn't measure I

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.800 
to ten inches I really didn't measure I
just<00:04:07.099> kind<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.280> did<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:07.489> went<00:04:08.450> all<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.630> way

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
just kind of did it went all the way

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.030 
just kind of did it went all the way
around<00:04:09.109> the<00:04:09.260> structure<00:04:10.299> putting<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:12.040> our

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
around the structure putting in our

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.180 
around the structure putting in our
these<00:04:13.160> screws<00:04:13.639> with<00:04:14.569> the<00:04:14.599> washers<00:04:15.230> also<00:04:15.680> that

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
these screws with the washers also that

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.830 
these screws with the washers also that
way<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.519> kind<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.760> spreads<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.269> load<00:04:17.450> out<00:04:17.570> over

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
way it kind of spreads the load out over

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.529 
way it kind of spreads the load out over
a<00:04:17.870> greater<00:04:18.139> distance<00:04:18.590> has<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:18.950> lot<00:04:19.539> better

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
a greater distance has a lot better

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.950 
a greater distance has a lot better
chance<00:04:20.599> of<00:04:21.019> holding<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.739> wind<00:04:22.250> gusts<00:04:22.669> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
chance of holding in and wind gusts and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.990 
chance of holding in and wind gusts and
as<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.380> can<00:04:24.470> see<00:04:24.710> like<00:04:24.919> I<00:04:25.039> said<00:04:25.220> we<00:04:25.340> had<00:04:25.490> really

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
as you can see like I said we had really

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.689 
as you can see like I said we had really
powerful<00:04:26.450> windstorm<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.900> other<00:04:27.050> day<00:04:27.229> and<00:04:27.699> the

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
powerful windstorm the other day and the

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.939 
powerful windstorm the other day and the
structure<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.120> still<00:04:29.180> standing<00:04:29.510> so<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:30.110> think

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
structure is still standing so I think

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.680 
structure is still standing so I think
that<00:04:31.099> is<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.400> reason<00:04:31.699> why<00:04:31.849> had<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.300> not<00:04:32.479> done

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
that is the reason why had I not done

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.960 
that is the reason why had I not done
that<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:32.900> think<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.169> would<00:04:33.229> have<00:04:33.349> come<00:04:33.500> down<00:04:33.970> one

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
that I think it would have come down one

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.240 
that I think it would have come down one
other<00:04:35.090> thing<00:04:35.300> I'd<00:04:35.419> like<00:04:35.599> to<00:04:35.720> note<00:04:35.900> is<00:04:36.080> I<00:04:36.250> did

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
other thing I'd like to note is I did

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.360 
other thing I'd like to note is I did
also<00:04:38.469> can<00:04:39.469> kind<00:04:39.590> of<00:04:39.680> see<00:04:39.860> it<00:04:39.950> right<00:04:40.099> there

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
also can kind of see it right there

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.839 
also can kind of see it right there
these<00:04:41.360> concrete<00:04:41.810> footers<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.200> did<00:04:42.680> attach<00:04:43.039> it

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:43.849 
these concrete footers I did attach it

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.459 
these concrete footers I did attach it
with<00:04:43.969> a<00:04:43.999> little<00:04:44.240> L<00:04:44.449> bracket<00:04:44.959> hurricane

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:45.469 
with a little L bracket hurricane

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:46.570 
with a little L bracket hurricane
bracket<00:04:45.860> whatever<00:04:46.129> you<00:04:46.219> call<00:04:46.399> those<00:04:46.550> things

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
bracket whatever you call those things

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.649 
bracket whatever you call those things
I'm<00:04:46.879> not<00:04:46.969> sure<00:04:47.589> that<00:04:48.589> way<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.699> wooden<00:04:50.089> part<00:04:50.389> is

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659 
I'm not sure that way the wooden part is

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.959 
I'm not sure that way the wooden part is
also<00:04:50.990> secured<00:04:51.619> down<00:04:51.800> as<00:04:51.979> well<00:04:52.219> well<00:04:52.819> that

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
also secured down as well well that

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.339 
also secured down as well well that
one's<00:04:53.179> pretty<00:04:53.330> heavy<00:04:53.599> so<00:04:53.809> I<00:04:53.869> don't<00:04:54.050> know<00:04:54.169> if<00:04:54.259> it

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
one's pretty heavy so I don't know if it

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.109 
one's pretty heavy so I don't know if it
would<00:04:54.499> have<00:04:54.589> lifted<00:04:54.770> in<00:04:55.129> the<00:04:55.369> windstorm<00:04:55.669> or

00:04:56.109 --> 00:04:56.119 
would have lifted in the windstorm or

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:59.739 
would have lifted in the windstorm or
not<00:04:56.389> off<00:04:57.289> of<00:04:57.349> those<00:04:57.889> concrete<00:04:58.759> footers<00:04:59.240> but<00:04:59.719> I

00:04:59.739 --> 00:04:59.749 
not off of those concrete footers but I

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:02.559 
not off of those concrete footers but I
didn't<00:05:00.050> want<00:05:00.169> to<00:05:00.199> take<00:05:00.379> any<00:05:00.529> chances<00:05:01.179> so<00:05:02.179> I

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
didn't want to take any chances so I

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.499 
didn't want to take any chances so I
went<00:05:03.499> ahead<00:05:03.589> and<00:05:03.800> did<00:05:03.889> that<00:05:04.209> not<00:05:05.209> on<00:05:05.330> the<00:05:05.389> mid

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
went ahead and did that not on the mid

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:06.850 
went ahead and did that not on the mid
side<00:05:05.719> actually<00:05:05.929> you<00:05:06.139> can<00:05:06.259> see<00:05:06.439> all<00:05:06.589> the<00:05:06.709> little

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
side actually you can see all the little

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.629 
side actually you can see all the little
nuts<00:05:07.369> and<00:05:07.550> bolts<00:05:07.849> at<00:05:08.839> every<00:05:09.529> joint<00:05:09.800> where

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
nuts and bolts at every joint where

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:13.899 
nuts and bolts at every joint where
they're<00:05:10.759> all<00:05:10.909> at<00:05:12.279> it's<00:05:13.279> quite<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.580> number<00:05:13.759> of

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
they're all at it's quite a number of

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.339 
they're all at it's quite a number of
them<00:05:14.199> so<00:05:15.369> but<00:05:16.369> other<00:05:16.490> than<00:05:16.639> I<00:05:16.789> mean<00:05:17.080> other<00:05:18.080> than

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
them so but other than I mean other than

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.869 
them so but other than I mean other than
than<00:05:18.469> the<00:05:18.559> door<00:05:18.769> I<00:05:19.069> would<00:05:19.369> say<00:05:19.490> it's<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.669> pretty

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
than the door I would say it's a pretty

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
think it's a good value kind of a pain

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.589 
think it's a good value kind of a pain
in<00:05:54.919> the<00:05:54.949> butt<00:05:55.159> to<00:05:55.249> put<00:05:55.399> together<00:05:55.459> I<00:05:55.939> couldn't

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
in the butt to put together I couldn't

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:57.730 
in the butt to put together I couldn't
even<00:05:56.749> figure<00:05:56.990> out<00:05:57.199> how<00:05:57.259> to<00:05:57.349> put<00:05:57.499> the<00:05:57.559> door<00:05:57.709> on

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.769 
even figure out how to put the door on
so<00:05:58.069> I<00:05:58.099> just<00:05:58.339> put<00:05:58.459> it<00:05:58.519> on<00:05:58.610> the<00:05:58.729> way<00:05:58.819> I<00:05:58.849> wanted<00:05:59.300> but

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
so I just put it on the way I wanted but

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:03.519 
so I just put it on the way I wanted but
it<00:06:00.110> survived<00:06:01.539> 70<00:06:02.539> 80<00:06:02.749> mile<00:06:02.990> an<00:06:03.110> hour<00:06:03.199> wind

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:03.529 
it survived 70 80 mile an hour wind

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.589 
it survived 70 80 mile an hour wind
gusts<00:06:03.919> so<00:06:04.699> I<00:06:04.729> think<00:06:04.879> we're<00:06:05.149> pretty<00:06:05.269> good<00:06:05.389> as

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:05.599 
gusts so I think we're pretty good as

gusts so I think we're pretty good as
long<00:06:05.719> as<00:06:05.809> we<00:06:05.899> don't<00:06:05.959> get<00:06:06.079> a<00:06:06.139> hurricane<00:06:06.319> we'll

00:06:07.239 --> 00:06:07.249
