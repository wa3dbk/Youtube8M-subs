00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:14.950 
hi everyone we're going to be making a

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.100 
hi everyone we're going to be making a
glass<00:00:15.190> feed<00:00:15.550> today<00:00:15.790> with<00:00:16.119> copper<00:00:16.570> 2<00:00:16.810> we're

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
glass feed today with copper 2 we're

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.609 
glass feed today with copper 2 we're
using<00:00:17.380> 620<00:00:18.340> enamel<00:00:18.850> and<00:00:19.170> what<00:00:20.170> I'm<00:00:20.380> holding

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
using 620 enamel and what I'm holding

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.940 
using 620 enamel and what I'm holding
now<00:00:20.950> is<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.340> tea<00:00:21.400> mesh<00:00:21.730> which<00:00:22.090> is<00:00:22.119> robin's<00:00:22.720> egg

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
now is a tea mesh which is robin's egg

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.109 
now is a tea mesh which is robin's egg
but<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.070> 620<00:00:24.700> is<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.849> larger<00:00:25.360> pea<00:00:25.570> size<00:00:25.840> gravel

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
but the 620 is a larger pea size gravel

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.189 
but the 620 is a larger pea size gravel
type<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.300> grain<00:00:28.630> so<00:00:29.529> I'm<00:00:29.680> starting<00:00:30.220> my<00:00:30.369> torch

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
type of grain so I'm starting my torch

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.710 
type of grain so I'm starting my torch
we're<00:00:32.199> going<00:00:32.320> to<00:00:32.379> be<00:00:32.500> using<00:00:33.300> skinny<00:00:34.300> copper

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
we're going to be using skinny copper

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.689 
we're going to be using skinny copper
tubing<00:00:35.080> that<00:00:35.290> you<00:00:35.410> can<00:00:35.559> buy<00:00:35.710> online<00:00:35.949> or<00:00:36.220> at<00:00:36.550> the

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699 
tubing that you can buy online or at the

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.630 
tubing that you can buy online or at the
hardware<00:00:37.120> store<00:00:37.180> all<00:00:38.140> I'm<00:00:38.410> doing<00:00:38.769> is<00:00:38.890> rotating

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
hardware store all I'm doing is rotating

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.140 
hardware store all I'm doing is rotating
it<00:00:39.820> on<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.180> mandrel<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.720> get<00:00:41.019> it<00:00:41.170> hot<00:00:41.410> and<00:00:42.150> when

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
it on the mandrel to get it hot and when

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.240 
it on the mandrel to get it hot and when
it<00:00:43.269> starts<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:43.659> glow<00:00:43.809> orange<00:00:44.559> I'm<00:00:44.890> going<00:00:45.129> to

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
it starts to glow orange I'm going to

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.310 
it starts to glow orange I'm going to
dredge<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:45.519> through<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:46.059> 620<00:00:46.690> white<00:00:46.900> enamel

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
dredge it through the 620 white enamel

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.969 
dredge it through the 620 white enamel
so<00:00:48.299> 620<00:00:49.299> refers<00:00:49.720> to<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:50.110> mesh<00:00:50.290> size<00:00:50.589> that

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:50.979 
so 620 refers to the mesh size that

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.850 
so 620 refers to the mesh size that
means<00:00:51.129> that<00:00:51.549> all<00:00:51.909> of<00:00:51.970> the<00:00:52.659> grains<00:00:53.350> will<00:00:53.620> fit

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
means that all of the grains will fit

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.920 
means that all of the grains will fit
through<00:00:54.010> mesh<00:00:54.309> with<00:00:54.580> six<00:00:54.850> holes<00:00:55.089> in<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.540> linear

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
through mesh with six holes in a linear

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.140 
through mesh with six holes in a linear
inch<00:00:56.260> but<00:00:56.979> none<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.339> it<00:00:57.460> will<00:00:57.610> go<00:00:57.820> through<00:00:58.120> a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
inch but none of it will go through a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.259 
inch but none of it will go through a
mesh<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.659> has<00:00:58.900> 20<00:00:59.350> holes<00:00:59.589> and<00:00:59.920> linear<00:01:00.909> inch

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
mesh that has 20 holes and linear inch

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.660 
mesh that has 20 holes and linear inch
so<00:01:02.140> we're<00:01:02.470> just<00:01:02.500> heating<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.190> up<00:01:03.369> right<00:01:03.610> now

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
so we're just heating this up right now

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
so we're just heating this up right now
and<00:01:04.890> waiting<00:01:05.890> for<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.159> to<00:01:06.280> smooth<00:01:06.610> out<00:01:06.790> and

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and waiting for it to smooth out and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.960 
and waiting for it to smooth out and
become<00:01:09.540> our<00:01:10.540> glass<00:01:10.900> bead<00:01:11.260> essentially<00:01:11.979> if<00:01:12.190> you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
become our glass bead essentially if you

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.430 
become our glass bead essentially if you
don't<00:01:13.180> wear<00:01:13.360> glasses<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.990> might<00:01:14.200> want<00:01:14.409> to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
don't wear glasses you might want to

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.319 
don't wear glasses you might want to
consider<00:01:14.830> wearing<00:01:15.100> safety<00:01:15.460> glasses<00:01:15.850> because

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
consider wearing safety glasses because

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:18.300 
consider wearing safety glasses because
some<00:01:16.659> of<00:01:16.689> those<00:01:16.899> little<00:01:17.229> particles<00:01:17.590> can<00:01:18.070> pop

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
some of those little particles can pop

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:26.580 
some of those little particles can pop
off<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.850> want<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.090> be<00:01:19.180> safe

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.240 

okay<00:01:27.490> I'm<00:01:27.670> back

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
okay I'm back

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.760 
okay I'm back

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
that was the seventh-inning stretch for

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.650 
that was the seventh-inning stretch for
the<00:01:30.860> cameraman<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:31.760> he's<00:01:31.940> all<00:01:32.090> ready<00:01:32.300> to<00:01:32.480> go

the cameraman so he's all ready to go
again<00:01:32.930> so<00:01:33.740> I'm<00:01:33.890> continuing<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:35.120> melt<00:01:35.690> the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
again so I'm continuing to melt the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.590 
again so I'm continuing to melt the
enamel<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.680> what<00:01:37.400> we're<00:01:37.550> looking<00:01:37.880> for<00:01:37.910> is<00:01:38.540> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
enamel and what we're looking for is a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.870 
enamel and what we're looking for is a
covered<00:01:39.260> copper<00:01:39.920> tubing<00:01:40.310> bead

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
covered copper tubing bead

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.730 
covered copper tubing bead
okay<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.630> copper<00:01:41.930> tubing<00:01:42.229> needs<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.590> get

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
okay the copper tubing needs to get

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.980 
okay the copper tubing needs to get
covered<00:01:43.070> by<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.280> enamel<00:01:43.820> I'm<00:01:44.180> using<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:44.810> work

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
covered by the enamel I'm using the work

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.890 
covered by the enamel I'm using the work
station<00:01:45.530> there<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.430> kind<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.820> smooth<00:01:47.240> the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
station there to kind of smooth the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.469 
station there to kind of smooth the
enamel<00:01:48.380> flat<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.310> can<00:01:49.550> see<00:01:49.790> where<00:01:50.030> where<00:01:50.450> I

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
enamel flat so I can see where where I

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.440 
enamel flat so I can see where where I
am<00:01:50.780> with<00:01:51.080> coverage<00:01:52.119> so<00:01:53.119> continuing<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:54.020> heat

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
am with coverage so continuing to heat

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.210 
am with coverage so continuing to heat
dredge<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.660> into<00:01:57.080> the<00:01:57.200> white<00:01:57.380> enamel<00:01:57.590> again

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
dredge it into the white enamel again

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.700 
dredge it into the white enamel again
the<00:01:58.820> 6:20<00:02:01.750> just<00:02:02.750> heat<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.050> some<00:02:03.350> more<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.560> I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
the 6:20 just heat it some more and I

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.290 
the 6:20 just heat it some more and I
promise<00:02:04.190> it's<00:02:04.399> gonna<00:02:04.550> get<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.850> lot<00:02:05.060> more

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
promise it's gonna get a lot more

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.350 
promise it's gonna get a lot more
exciting<00:02:06.220> we're<00:02:07.220> gonna<00:02:07.310> start<00:02:07.700> using<00:02:08.119> some

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
exciting we're gonna start using some

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.590 
exciting we're gonna start using some
color<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.080> bead<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.910> we're<00:02:11.270> just<00:02:11.300> really

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
color in this bead so we're just really

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.270 
color in this bead so we're just really
melting<00:02:12.260> this<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:14.709> sometimes<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.950> gets<00:02:16.130> to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
melting this in and sometimes it gets to

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.729 
melting this in and sometimes it gets to
be<00:02:16.400> so<00:02:16.430> pretty<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.540> but<00:02:18.230> they're<00:02:18.410> still

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
be so pretty and and but they're still

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.949 
be so pretty and and but they're still
raised<00:02:19.100> areas<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.970> could<00:02:20.150> stop<00:02:20.420> there<00:02:20.750> as

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
raised areas you could stop there as

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.340 
raised areas you could stop there as
long<00:02:21.230> as<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.830> particles<00:02:22.820> are<00:02:23.230> melted<00:02:24.230> and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
long as the particles are melted and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.650 
long as the particles are melted and
fused<00:02:24.650> enough<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.580> background<00:02:26.090> enamel

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
fused enough to the background enamel

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.690 
fused enough to the background enamel
you<00:02:26.840> could<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.320> little<00:02:27.620> bumpy<00:02:27.980> beads<00:02:28.250> I<00:02:28.520> mean

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
you could have little bumpy beads I mean

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.570 
you could have little bumpy beads I mean
that's<00:02:28.880> gonna<00:02:29.120> be<00:02:29.180> fine<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.650> we're<00:02:31.220> making

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
that's gonna be fine so we're making

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.150 
that's gonna be fine so we're making
progress

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.670 

all<00:02:37.160> right<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:37.730> now<00:02:38.150> we're<00:02:39.019> pushing<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.530> bead

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
all right so now we're pushing the bead

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.500 
all right so now we're pushing the bead
back<00:02:39.950> all<00:02:40.220> I'm<00:02:40.370> doing<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:40.760> kind<00:02:40.970> of<00:02:41.120> cleaning

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
back all I'm doing is kind of cleaning

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.690 
back all I'm doing is kind of cleaning
up<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.660> leading<00:02:42.290> edge<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:43.700> mandrel

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.600 

and<00:02:49.180> now<00:02:49.599> we're<00:02:49.959> going<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:50.470> be<00:02:50.709> rolling<00:02:51.220> it

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
and now we're going to be rolling it

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.729 
and now we're going to be rolling it
into<00:02:51.940> some<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.020> color<00:02:53.260> we're<00:02:53.500> going<00:02:53.620> to

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
into some of the color we're going to

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.339 
into some of the color we're going to
start<00:02:53.980> picking<00:02:54.370> up<00:02:54.489> some<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.569> kind<00:02:56.110> of

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
start picking up some of that kind of

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.979 
start picking up some of that kind of
that<00:02:56.590> confetti<00:02:57.130> color<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:57.970> 620<00:02:58.569> enamel

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
that confetti color of the 620 enamel

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.380 
that confetti color of the 620 enamel
and<00:02:59.140> really<00:02:59.860> all<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.670> just<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:01.060> mixture

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
and really all that is is just a mixture

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.160 
and really all that is is just a mixture
of<00:03:01.510> different<00:03:01.830> colors<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.720> we're<00:03:05.140> just

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
of different colors so we're just

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.840 
of different colors so we're just
melting<00:03:05.739> that<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.340> we're<00:03:06.430> going<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.610> start

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
melting that in and we're going to start

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:14.570 
melting that in and we're going to start
picking<00:03:07.060> up<00:03:07.330> some<00:03:07.569> more

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.280 

so<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.940> concoction<00:03:16.629> there<00:03:17.080> we've<00:03:17.260> got

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
so in that concoction there we've got

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.789 
so in that concoction there we've got
pumpkin<00:03:17.830> robin's<00:03:18.549> egg<00:03:19.200> looks<00:03:20.200> like<00:03:20.379> we've<00:03:20.560> got

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
pumpkin robin's egg looks like we've got

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.880 
pumpkin robin's egg looks like we've got
some<00:03:21.069> royal<00:03:21.549> blue<00:03:21.849> which<00:03:22.120> might<00:03:22.360> be<00:03:22.540> nitric<00:03:23.170> so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
some royal blue which might be nitric so

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.220 
some royal blue which might be nitric so
it's<00:03:24.220> got<00:03:24.459> a<00:03:24.489> nice<00:03:24.730> combination<00:03:25.209> of<00:03:25.629> colors

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.140 

we're<00:03:29.230> just<00:03:29.470> going<00:03:29.739> to<00:03:29.769> continue<00:03:30.099> to<00:03:30.700> melt

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
we're just going to continue to melt

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.750 
we're just going to continue to melt
that<00:03:31.390> in<00:03:31.599> and<00:03:31.780> we're<00:03:31.900> almost<00:03:32.049> finished<00:03:32.379> here

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
that in and we're almost finished here

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.100 
that in and we're almost finished here
I'm<00:03:33.760> going<00:03:33.940> to<00:03:34.000> see<00:03:34.150> one<00:03:34.420> last<00:03:34.599> thing<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:34.930> we

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
I'm going to see one last thing that we

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.930 
I'm going to see one last thing that we
can<00:03:35.349> do<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.739> bead<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.129> kind<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.430> spice<00:03:36.730> it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
can do to the bead to kind of spice it

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.150 
can do to the bead to kind of spice it
up<00:03:37.030> before<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.569> take<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.900> off<00:03:38.080> ok<00:03:38.920> I'm<00:03:39.129> changing

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
up before we take it off ok I'm changing

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.839 
up before we take it off ok I'm changing
hands<00:03:39.879> now<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.560> putting<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.860> mandrel<00:03:42.519> in<00:03:42.670> my

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
hands now and putting the mandrel in my

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.940 
hands now and putting the mandrel in my
non-dominant<00:03:43.450> hand<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.230> I'm<00:03:44.379> going<00:03:44.530> to<00:03:44.620> start

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
non-dominant hand and I'm going to start

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.039 
non-dominant hand and I'm going to start
with<00:03:45.489> my<00:03:45.700> right<00:03:46.000> hand<00:03:46.030> my<00:03:46.540> dominant<00:03:47.019> hand

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
with my right hand my dominant hand

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.309 
with my right hand my dominant hand
drawing<00:03:47.650> through<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.780> glass<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.810> that's

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
drawing through the glass and that's

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.050 
drawing through the glass and that's
gonna<00:03:50.530> create<00:03:50.799> a<00:03:50.980> marbled<00:03:51.430> effect<00:03:51.549> like

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
gonna create a marbled effect like

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.650 
gonna create a marbled effect like
marbled<00:03:52.930> paper<00:03:53.579> it's<00:03:54.579> a<00:03:54.700> pretty<00:03:55.090> simple<00:03:55.599> thing

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
marbled paper it's a pretty simple thing

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.020 
marbled paper it's a pretty simple thing
to<00:03:55.989> do<00:03:56.140> but<00:03:56.170> it<00:03:56.440> adds<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:56.829> lot<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.069> the<00:03:57.430> design<00:03:57.819> of

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
to do but it adds a lot to the design of

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.950 
to do but it adds a lot to the design of
the<00:03:58.120> bee

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.080

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
all righty so let's just melt in those

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:11.190 
all righty so let's just melt in those
little<00:04:03.720> grooves<00:04:03.990> that<00:04:04.200> were<00:04:04.260> created

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.020 

okay<00:04:12.010> here<00:04:12.459> we<00:04:12.550> go<00:04:12.580> let's<00:04:13.090> push<00:04:13.959> it<00:04:13.990> off<00:04:15.030> all

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
okay here we go let's push it off all

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.690

a pair of pliers so I can just drop the

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.430 
a pair of pliers so I can just drop the
bead<00:04:20.980> off<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.240> clean<00:04:22.540> end<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.050> mandrel

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
bead off of the clean end of the mandrel

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.120 
bead off of the clean end of the mandrel
into<00:04:23.830> heated<00:04:24.250> vermiculite<00:04:25.410> I'm<00:04:26.410> going<00:04:26.980> to
