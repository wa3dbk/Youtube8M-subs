00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.600
 we therefore remain vigilant of the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.860
 lot-et-garonne going back up to 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.550
 23 degrees on the side of Toulouse or 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.320
 of lyon but it is especially this after 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.810
