too crazy to each other and it is kind
of<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.070> cop-out<00:00:38.430> how<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> last<00:00:39.030> chapter

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
they ended with that cliffhanger and

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
they ended with that cliffhanger and
this<00:00:41.100> one<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.670> again<00:00:41.969> due<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.360> its<00:00:42.989> pretty

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
this one is just again due to its pretty

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.830

expected<00:00:43.920> from<00:00:44.070> sharingan<00:00:44.610> users<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.390> kind

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
expected from sharingan users but I kind

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.029 
expected from sharingan users but I kind
of<00:00:45.899> was<00:00:46.020> hoping<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.440> weren't<00:00:46.649> gonna<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
of was hoping they weren't gonna you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.410 
of was hoping they weren't gonna you
know<00:00:47.129> use<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.370> trope<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.059> out<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.300> this

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
know use that trope to get out of this

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
know use that trope to get out of this
but<00:00:49.079> that's<00:00:49.200> when<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> real<00:00:49.649> battle<00:00:49.680> begins

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
but that's when the real battle begins

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
but that's when the real battle begins
and<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.940> said<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.449> by<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> books

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and like I said it's very by the books

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.200 
and like I said it's very by the books
we<00:00:52.800> got<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.010> fire<00:00:53.280> technique<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.910> we've<00:00:54.059> seen

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
we got a fire technique that we've seen

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
we got a fire technique that we've seen
before<00:00:54.570> we<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.899> hand<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.350> hand<00:00:55.559> techniques<00:00:56.070> we

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
before we got hand to hand techniques we

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.060 
before we got hand to hand techniques we
even<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.969> kunai<00:00:57.480> slashes<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.350> very<00:00:58.649> simple

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
even got kunai slashes it's very simple

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
even got kunai slashes it's very simple
but<00:00:59.250> what<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> like<00:00:59.879> about<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.420> entire

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
but what I like about this entire

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.170 
but what I like about this entire
sequence<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.530> intercut<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.609> between<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
sequence is intercut in between it you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
sequence is intercut in between it you
get<00:01:03.329> these<00:01:03.449> other<00:01:03.629> back<00:01:03.930> scenes<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.439> both

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
get these other back scenes of both

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.550 
get these other back scenes of both
Kakashi<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.820> obito<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:06.360> kids<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.900> it's<00:01:07.350> sort

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
Kakashi and obito as kids and it's sort

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.380 
Kakashi and obito as kids and it's sort
of<00:01:07.619> paralleling<00:01:08.250> what's<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
of paralleling what's going on here and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.179 
of paralleling what's going on here and
what<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> love<00:01:09.930> here<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.740> I'm<00:01:10.830> surprised

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
what I love here is and I'm surprised

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.590 
what I love here is and I'm surprised
here<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.760> usually<00:01:11.939> get<00:01:12.150> sick<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.540> these

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
here because I usually get sick of these

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
here because I usually get sick of these
metaphors<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.350> Naruto<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.490> they<00:01:14.640> overuse

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
metaphors in Naruto because they overuse

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
metaphors in Naruto because they overuse
them<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.299> lot<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.340> it

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
them a lot but here I really like it

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
them a lot but here I really like it
because<00:01:17.700> Kakashi<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> essentially<00:01:19.140> saying<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
because Kakashi is essentially saying I

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.260 
because Kakashi is essentially saying I
don't<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> hurt<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.759> friend<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.210> don't

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
don't want to hurt my friend I don't

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.300 
don't want to hurt my friend I don't
want<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.570> kill<00:01:21.780> him<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.890> isn't<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
want to kill him but this isn't the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.280 
want to kill him but this isn't the
Obito<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> Oviedo<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
Obito I know this is in the Oviedo I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.230 
Obito I know this is in the Oviedo I
grew<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.189> want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.729> preserve<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
grew up with I want to preserve the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.060 
grew up with I want to preserve the
original<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.470> way<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:29.040> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
original one and the only way to do that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.609 
original one and the only way to do that
is<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> kill<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.150> current<00:01:30.390> Obito<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.470> that's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
is to kill the current Obito and that's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.810 
is to kill the current Obito and that's
where<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.189> great<00:01:32.430> big

this<00:03:25.889> week<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.459> really<00:03:26.760> hope<00:03:26.940> he's<00:03:27.120> able<00:03:27.239> to

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
this week and I really hope he's able to

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.670 
this week and I really hope he's able to
make<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.750> through<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:27.930> battle<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.470> think

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.819 
make it through this battle and I think
he<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:29.269> but<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.510> whole<00:03:30.690> deal<00:03:30.989> with<00:03:31.380> mod<00:03:31.650> are

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
he is but the whole deal with mod are

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.460 
he is but the whole deal with mod are
using<00:03:32.250> Obito<00:03:32.639> like<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.569> arena<00:03:33.930> no<00:03:34.109> jutsu

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
using Obito like as the arena no jutsu

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.309 
using Obito like as the arena no jutsu
to<00:03:34.500> bring<00:03:34.769> himself<00:03:34.920> back<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.430> life<00:03:35.609> is<00:03:35.849> just<00:03:36.319> so

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
to bring himself back to life is just so

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.039 
to bring himself back to life is just so
fucked<00:03:37.829> up<00:03:38.069> but<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.609> is<00:03:39.120> sort<00:03:39.359> of<00:03:39.480> fitting<00:03:39.780> for

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049
