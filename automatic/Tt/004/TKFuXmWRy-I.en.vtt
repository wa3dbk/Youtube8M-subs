00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
it up and down over a branch you can

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.080 
it up and down over a branch you can
draw<00:01:14.340> one's<00:01:14.610> attention<00:01:14.909> over<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:20.090> I'll

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
can see I'm over a lot of branches I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.609 
can see I'm over a lot of branches I
don't<00:01:30.270> worry<00:01:30.450> about<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.869> my<00:01:31.049> trolling<00:01:31.439> motor
