00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and hello to all dear friends with you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.150
 Tommy and today we continue again 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.309
 play minecraft there will be a small 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.769
 such a Christmas tree is worth it 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.630
 congratulate happy new year 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.289
 Merry Christmas 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.140
 so I'm a little sick by the voice of it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.029
 well, the series will be heard for you exactly 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 I would like him to show you what I 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 already done with your house 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.070
 which has already started building like this 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.590
 did yes now we go up I 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.710
 I 'll show you everything, so first we only 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.600
 meat to eat so it would be necessary to have holes 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.620
 shut it down something hurts and but thats already 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.160
 there appeared I did not close them forgot so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.010
 I do not think the Christmas tree will be this small 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.230
 warmed up here and leave now 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.290
 need to look well here and here 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.080
 a small fountain and such stand 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:01:00.950
 now we should probably go upstairs 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:03.330
 now and now it will be necessary to close 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.070
 I originally wanted to close the glass here 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.070
 so I'll start closing with heat 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.439
 home right very near live 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.929
 movies and subscribers coordinates i think 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.729
 you already understood 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.530
 saw where I ran and you yourself could 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.329
 to find 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.759
 so by the coordinates which is indicated and how 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.539
 once here in my piercing corner of the screen 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.299
 so here I fell by chance at all 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:02:02.119
 Now we need to raise things while there is time 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:04.159
 so here are my things and let's see what 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.649
 them here it is like a cherry tree or 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.459
 some kind of design is not cool 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.459
 I like this 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.739
 a cup 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.349
 what's so cool happened 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.640
 well i'm here so here is the fence 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:24.790
 I will put to be able to see each other and 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.840
 everything 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.840
 but so it will be cool 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.550
 so now i will need some 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.750
 finish your not big mansion 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.910
 who has already begun to build and you must first 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.870
 Well, make the rise to the second floor is 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.160
 first of all 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.660
 so put the dedication in it so 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.660
 Now I will first choose a Christmas tree 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:03:00.260
 new year it's endless so here i am 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.340
 I chose the Christmas tree now I will put it shorter here 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.340
 I have a ladder with a friend 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.190
 here a little so not very sad 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.560
 the stairs turned out I think it is quite 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.170
 it turned out cool so I 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.100
 leave on top and climb you can 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.080
 okay, I want to put myself 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.790
 then the lamp glowed glowing 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.410
 but for the time being they put the torch so 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.750
 it's here so put here here here and 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.200
 here we now think with lighting 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.020
 we are all right now we need 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.160
 decide where I will have a basement 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.460
 the entrance to the basement I experience from know where 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.460
 here 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.500
 then immediately Komi goes then gerd 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.500
 quite get away 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.300
 in fact put more or less 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.910
 the lighting was more 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.910
 so here I am Siberian gland found 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.800
 so here 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.480
 somewhere here so here will be 34 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.070
 maybe even 5 blocks 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:33.180
 heights 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.180
 I usually do that 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:54.619
 so okay normas to begin with i think 

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:56.059
 so so but on this I think everything to everyone 

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:57.949
