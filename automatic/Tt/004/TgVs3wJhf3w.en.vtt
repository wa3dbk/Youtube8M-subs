00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.030
 hi friends today we are going to do what we have 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.090
 roasted with marinade here as you see we have 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.969
 a piece of loin of a more or less medium 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.669
 kilo apart let's use about 6 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.259
 tablespoons of oil a tablespoon of 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:25.779
 sweet paprika a spoonful of oregano 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.480
 half a tablespoon of salt and three cloves of 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.880
 garlic these are all the ingredients that 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.779
 we need to make the tenderloin flavor 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.779
 with some 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.240
 first of all let's do the side 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.800
 here as you see in the oil we are going to 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.340
 add the finely chopped garlic 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.960
 the oregano 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 salt and paprika 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.460
 now we mix it well 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.780
 and now we have ready to stain the meat 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.390
 now we can only adopt the meat 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.390
 for that we throw the mixture over 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.939
 and a good fear we make sure it 's 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.250
 a tea that according to the mixture well by 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.250
 all the parts we turn around 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.180
 the one that bursts gives by all the parts 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.670
 and this now we put it in the fridge 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.979
 and we leave it a minimum of 89 hours what 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.380
 better do it at night to prepare 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.840
 the next day 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.840
 the irrigation a minimum plus eight euros 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 after nine hours the terna in adobo 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:02:01.130
 we are already going to the oven with a 200 oven 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.130
 degrees about 35 or 40 minutes 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.320
 and after 40 minutes in the oven already 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.880
 we have the tenderloin to carry the dough 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.250
 now we are going to put a table what 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.570
 let's cut it up we'll make some pictures 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.290
 leave at the end of a picture to 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.710

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.230
