00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.430
 welcome a new video tutorial les 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.430
 speaks your server and brother Daniel Oss 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.080
 of 6,666 this time I bring you a 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.540
 very short tutorial but in which 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.370
 we will be learning how to create a 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.590
 backup of our drivers 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.500
 how to create a correct copy of our 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.449
 drivers we are going to make a backup this 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.180
 tutorial I do them as I received 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.370
 several various comments in the 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.050
 various tutorials that I have in which 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.050
 He explained how to format systems 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.970
 operatives ask me a lot this topic 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.220
 and well here we are going to make the video 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.159
 tutorial as we always know that 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.290
 we install an operating system we have 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.350
 than create a backup of the 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.170
 drivers so you do not lose them because it's very 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.080
 difficult it is very difficult to look for those of the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.640
 drivers per page per page good 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.680
 let's start for this let's 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.229
 use a program called drivers and 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.150
 We are professional editing if you do not 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.950
 you have in the description of the video you 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.930
 I'll be leaving a link which will 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.770
 check the official page of 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.840
 drivers and us 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.700
 this program is compatible with all 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.300
 operating systems including 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.780
 windows 8 is simply the fact 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.280
 and automatically it will be downloading 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.700
 once you do it downloaded you 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.740
 will remain of the exe application executed 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.390
 as a program you install it as a 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.460
 program anyone is very easy to 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.190
 Installation simply das next next 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.130
 next install accept the terms of 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.740
 license and ribbon once the long 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.020
 it was installed that maximums were left 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.260
 directly on the desk we 're going to 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.260
 open 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.430
 as we see this is its interface 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.620
 well this window will be coming out 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.410
 that will ask us for an analysis we close it 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.390
 we close the window I'm just going 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.910
 to teach how to create a correct copy 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.850
 of security of the drivers we are going to 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.980
 the section that says backups 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.140
 there is as we can see is doing what 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.110
 that he is analyzing all the drivers 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.110
 that we have installed this will take 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.640
 It depends on the speed of the internet and 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.250
 it depends how many drivers you have 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.840
 installed on your computer so pause 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.850
 the video and when you have finished this 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.770
 process returned with you 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.570
 once you have finished scanning 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.030
 our computer will be pressure from us 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.120
 this window in which I get here 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.240
 two options will probably come out 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.170
 three the third would be controllers 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.170
 disconnected 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.440
 Well what we 're going to do is uncheck 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.720
 the one that says original drivers of 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.300
 windows is the only one that we are going to 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.210
 uncheck I repeat you let's leave 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.520
 marked the one that says used controllers 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.640
 currently since they are the controllers 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.580
 of the computer down from here is 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.860
 appears disconnected drivers that 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.780
 you leave it marked as they are the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.240
 usb memory controllers 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.270
 controls on disc controls 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.280
 external yes etc. ok and once 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.200
 we have unchecked the drivers 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.020
 original windows we are going to 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.680
 select next here in this 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.290
 window let's select the type of 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.780
 backup we are going to select 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.240
 automatic installation file and here 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.720
 let's select the destination in this 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.230
 I will save it in documents 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.140
 we select save 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.600
 and we select next 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.550
 and as we see here he will be creating what 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.810
 is our backup will be creating what 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.270
 is our backup of the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.700
 drivers this will take depends on the 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.950
 speed of your computer and depends on 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.750
 the drivers that you have installed like this 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.550
 that I return to pose the video of when 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.980
 was completed this process came back with 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.110
 your 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.000
 once the process of 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.340
 create the backup you will not be 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.709
 he in our window here tells us that 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.139
 the backup was created successfully 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.150
 and it tells us the location where 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.070
 He kept our backup 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.550
 this case the guard in my documents 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.050
 we just select finalize 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.000
 we closed what is our program we 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.510
 we go to where our 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.120
 backup 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.230
 He passed it to the desk once and good 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.180
 that we arrived formatted in our 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.690
 computer and that we already have it as 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.220
 again we are going to use this this this 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.170
 archive this backup 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.210
 it is not necessary that we have installed 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.340
 the Chinese driver to be able to execute it 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.650
 we can execute it but not what 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.930
 we have installed simply we are going 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.630
 to run as an administrator and if you're 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.880
 in windows 7 or windows 8 also in 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.940
 windows vista we execute as 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.110
 administrator we wait for him to load 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.110
 as we see is starting the program 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.630
 and here it will not be coming out what is the 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.740
 backup must be all the 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.870
 popcorn checked 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.960
 we just select start 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.770
 restoration 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.690
 we select yes 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.639
 good you will not be area in this window 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.639
 here it is very important that we select 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.220
 that we select to install this software 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.169
 of driver anyway this will 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.830
 it's going to come out so everything select this 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.569
 option and so will be installing all 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.729
 the controllers so let's go to 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.919
 wait for this action to end as 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.930
 we can see here we have the time that 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.520
 it's going to take so I'm going to pass the 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.190
 video to make us very long the 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.960
 video and return when you have finished 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.850
 this process 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.039
 and if we go out again this 

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.750
 window let's select again install 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.690
 this controller software of all 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.630
 forms will probably show you this 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:01.849
 window five or six times so let's go 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.849
 to select this the second option 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.480
 as we can see it's finished 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.080
 install all the drivers and install 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.180
 all the drivers that we had 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:16.280
 we select finish will ask us to 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.560
 restart our computer and you 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.140
 they select if I go or do not restart it 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.970
 since it would waste a lot of time and good 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.340
 This is has been the tutorial and 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.470
 we have installed the drivers remember 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.970
 restart your computer and when you return from 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.960
 restart network and have your computer 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.690
 completely updated with the 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.250
 original drivers of your windows and good 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.900
 this has been all I hope you have 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.870
 liked the video that has served you 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.450
 forget to lay your favorite video and 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.450
 comment subscribe and this has been all 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.130
 his brother daniel oss is dismissed from 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:52.960
 6,666 and see you in a few next 

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.960
 tutorials until next time
