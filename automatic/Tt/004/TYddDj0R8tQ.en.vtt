hello everyone this is kind of an update
video<00:00:15.889> and<00:00:15.950> bug<00:00:16.880> fix<00:00:17.300> for<00:00:17.720> my<00:00:18.310> busines<00:00:19.310> gate

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
video and bug fix for my busines gate

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.150 
video and bug fix for my busines gate
this<00:00:21.950> is<00:00:22.250> my<00:00:22.840> drawbridge<00:00:23.840> and<00:00:24.740> a<00:00:24.830> lot<00:00:25.009> of

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
this is my drawbridge and a lot of

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.519 
this is my drawbridge and a lot of
people<00:00:25.460> have<00:00:25.610> been<00:00:25.820> asking<00:00:26.330> for<00:00:26.750> me<00:00:26.900> to<00:00:26.930> do<00:00:27.199> a

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
people have been asking for me to do a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:36.369 
people have been asking for me to do a
tutorial<00:00:27.859> for<00:00:28.519> it<00:00:30.519> but<00:00:31.840> due<00:00:32.840> to<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.769> 1.3<00:00:34.489> patch

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
tutorial for it but due to the 1.3 patch

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.330 
tutorial for it but due to the 1.3 patch
my<00:00:37.039> clock<00:00:37.489> that<00:00:37.730> I<00:00:37.789> used<00:00:38.210> is<00:00:38.660> broken

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
my clock that I used is broken

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.700 
my clock that I used is broken
so<00:00:41.410> pretty<00:00:42.410> much<00:00:42.500> it's<00:00:44.110> this<00:00:45.110> is<00:00:45.380> what<00:00:45.590> the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
so pretty much it's this is what the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.580 
so pretty much it's this is what the
clock<00:00:45.950> was<00:00:46.190> like<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.180> this<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:48.080> supposed<00:00:48.470> to

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
clock was like and this is supposed to

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.050 
clock was like and this is supposed to
alternate<00:00:49.400> back<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.670> forth<00:00:50.290> but<00:00:51.290> I<00:00:51.650> had<00:00:52.040> to

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
alternate back and forth but I had to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:02.510 
alternate back and forth but I had to
add<00:00:55.340> repeaters<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.810> update<00:00:57.810> the<00:00:57.990> Pistons

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020 

to<00:01:03.520> get<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.790> to<00:01:03.940> start<00:01:04.210> working<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:06.010> it<00:01:06.400> seems

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
to get it to start working but it seems

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.609 
to get it to start working but it seems
that<00:01:07.450> not<00:01:08.260> only<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.540> clock<00:01:10.810> was<00:01:11.110> broken

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
that not only the clock was broken

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.580 
that not only the clock was broken
it<00:01:12.369> seems<00:01:12.760> this<00:01:13.060> piston<00:01:13.570> tape<00:01:13.840> is<00:01:14.080> having<00:01:14.470> the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
it seems this piston tape is having the

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.850 
it seems this piston tape is having the
same<00:01:15.150> bug<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:18.460> don't<00:01:19.420> think<00:01:19.720> it's<00:01:19.930> fixable

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
same bug and I don't think it's fixable

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.580 
same bug and I don't think it's fixable
so<00:01:21.820> I'm<00:01:22.270> probably<00:01:22.509> gonna<00:01:22.780> have<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:22.990> take<00:01:23.409> out

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
so I'm probably gonna have to take out

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.950 
so I'm probably gonna have to take out
all<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.520> piston<00:01:24.970> tape<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.509> clock<00:01:25.720> and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
all the piston tape and clock and

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.680 
all the piston tape and clock and
everything<00:01:26.350> and<00:01:26.470> replace<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.100> with<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.250> new<00:01:27.520> one

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.429 

but

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.830 

don't<00:01:33.070> be<00:01:33.280> expecting<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:34.450> tutorial<00:01:35.110> for<00:01:35.530> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
don't be expecting a tutorial for that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.200 
don't be expecting a tutorial for that
soon<00:01:37.840> because<00:01:38.590> I'm<00:01:39.189> having<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.759> really<00:01:40.060> hard

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
soon because I'm having a really hard

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.779 
soon because I'm having a really hard
time<00:01:41.490> redoing<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:43.680> also<00:01:44.680> I'm<00:01:45.310> going<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.670> be

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
time redoing that also I'm going to be

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.029 
time redoing that also I'm going to be
coming<00:01:46.090> out<00:01:46.179> with<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.420> video<00:01:46.689> for<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.590> new

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
coming out with a video for a new

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:53.819 
coming out with a video for a new
version<00:01:48.369> of<00:01:48.720> my<00:01:49.720> overkill<00:01:50.470> lock

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.639 

basically<00:01:54.670> my<00:01:55.060> overkill<00:01:55.570> lock<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:56.020> an<00:01:56.140> attempt

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
basically my overkill lock is an attempt

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.569 
basically my overkill lock is an attempt
at<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:57.299> combination<00:01:58.299> lock<00:01:59.219> where<00:02:00.219> you<00:02:00.399> can

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
at a combination lock where you can

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.100 
at a combination lock where you can
change<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.090> password<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.810> levers<00:02:04.110> there's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
change the password with levers there's

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.820 
change the password with levers there's
a<00:02:05.880> combination<00:02:06.880> lock<00:02:07.110> that's<00:02:08.110> really<00:02:08.530> small

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
a combination lock that's really small

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.729 
a combination lock that's really small
made<00:02:09.190> by<00:02:09.429> CP<00:02:10.149> minecraft<00:02:10.860> where<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.220> have<00:02:12.459> to

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
made by CP minecraft where you have to

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.600 
made by CP minecraft where you have to
replace<00:02:14.739> torches<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.730> blocks<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:18.099> change<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
replace torches and blocks to change the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.080 
replace torches and blocks to change the
password

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.910 

and<00:02:21.440> basically<00:02:22.440> my

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
and basically my

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.410 
and basically my
my<00:02:25.520> attempt<00:02:26.120> over<00:02:26.330> here<00:02:26.930> was<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:28.250> do<00:02:28.430> it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
my attempt over here was just to do it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.830 
my attempt over here was just to do it
whit's<00:02:31.080> lepers<00:02:31.770> so<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.550> was<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.090> wasn't<00:02:33.690> as

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
whit's lepers so it was it wasn't as

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.450 
whit's lepers so it was it wasn't as
manual<00:02:34.440> as<00:02:34.650> changing<00:02:35.370> those<00:02:35.670> ones<00:02:35.970> were

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.060 

and<00:02:38.550> basically<00:02:39.510> my<00:02:40.050> new<00:02:40.880> design<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.890> seen<00:02:43.890> be

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
and basically my new design is seen be

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.110 
and basically my new design is seen be
minecraft<00:02:44.750> expanded<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:46.220> so<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.910> change

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
minecraft expanded out so you can change

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.320 
minecraft expanded out so you can change
the<00:02:48.360> password<00:02:48.630> with<00:02:49.290> but

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.770 

and<00:02:55.140> people<00:02:56.140> have<00:02:56.350> been<00:02:56.530> saying<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.780> my

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
and people have been saying that my

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.750 
and people have been saying that my
piston<00:02:59.350> gate<00:02:59.590> doesn't<00:02:59.950> work<00:03:00.310> in<00:03:00.520> some

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
piston gate doesn't work in some

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:11.040 
piston gate doesn't work in some
orientations<00:03:02.850> even<00:03:03.850> though<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.570> does<00:03:10.050> there

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
orientations even though it does there

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.200 
orientations even though it does there
is<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:24.270 

F<00:03:16.510> one<00:03:16.570> orientation<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:22.830> f<00:03:23.830> 2

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
F one orientation here is f 2

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.940 
F one orientation here is f 2
orientation

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:38.430 

the<00:03:28.950> F<00:03:29.099> 0<00:03:29.489> orientation<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:33.769> then

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.710 

here

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.000 

is

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.630 

f<00:03:47.069> 3<00:03:48.019> orientation<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.939> one<00:03:50.939> orientation<00:03:52.640> and

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
f 3 orientation of one orientation and

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.630 
f 3 orientation of one orientation and
basically<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:55.140> not<00:03:55.409> an<00:03:55.620> orientation<00:03:56.129> bug

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
basically it's not an orientation bug

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.539 
basically it's not an orientation bug
but<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.689> is<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.939> bug<00:03:59.939> of<00:04:00.390> where<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.340> gate<00:04:02.340> is

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
but it is a bug of where the gate is

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.030 
but it is a bug of where the gate is
placed<00:04:02.939> in<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.299> world<00:04:03.540> if<00:04:04.230> it's<00:04:04.470> placed<00:04:04.829> in

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
placed in the world if it's placed in

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.199 
placed in the world if it's placed in
the<00:04:05.099> world<00:04:05.489> where<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:10.040> bugs<00:04:11.040> out<00:04:11.400> where<00:04:12.000> this

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
the world where this bugs out where this

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.270 
the world where this bugs out where this
one<00:04:12.540> tech<00:04:12.750> pulse<00:04:13.079> doesn't<00:04:13.560> make<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.829> up<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.159> the

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
one tech pulse doesn't make it up to the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.960 
one tech pulse doesn't make it up to the
top<00:04:14.489> of<00:04:14.700> these<00:04:14.819> torches<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.810> gate<00:04:16.019> won't<00:04:16.260> work

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
top of these torches the gate won't work

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.860 
top of these torches the gate won't work
and<00:04:18.320> basically<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.709> fix<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:20.580> take

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
and basically the fix that you just take

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.500 
and basically the fix that you just take
from<00:04:21.890> this<00:04:22.890> repeater<00:04:23.820> right<00:04:24.750> here<00:04:25.200> all<00:04:25.470> this

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
from this repeater right here all this

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.600 
from this repeater right here all this
move<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.720> over<00:04:28.080> to<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.410> right<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.920> add<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
move it over to the right and add a

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.210 
move it over to the right and add a
one-two<00:04:30.090> repeater<00:04:30.630> right<00:04:30.960> here

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
one-two repeater right here

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.829 
one-two repeater right here
right<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:33.000> between

00:04:35.829 --> 00:04:35.839 

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:40.650 

and<00:04:36.839> I<00:04:37.319> have<00:04:37.529> performed<00:04:38.099> this<00:04:38.430> fix

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
and I have performed this fix

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.490 
and I have performed this fix
this<00:04:41.290> one<00:04:41.590> at<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.100> one

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.840 

so<00:04:45.930> case

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:05:02.590 

just<00:04:50.850> what<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.180> original<00:04:51.810> was<00:04:52.110> like

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.780 

it's<00:05:03.080> broken<00:05:03.890> it<00:05:04.460> only<00:05:04.640> goes<00:05:04.970> up<00:05:05.180> one<00:05:05.480> blog<00:05:06.790> and

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
it's broken it only goes up one blog and

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.820 
it's broken it only goes up one blog and
it<00:05:08.570> won't<00:05:08.780> go<00:05:08.900> up<00:05:08.930> any<00:05:09.200> farther

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
it won't go up any farther

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.180 
it won't go up any farther
and<00:05:09.920> then<00:05:10.880> by<00:05:11.840> extending<00:05:12.410> this<00:05:12.560> out<00:05:12.800> and

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
and then by extending this out and

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.289 
and then by extending this out and
adding<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.640> repeater<00:05:14.090> ring<00:05:14.420> here

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:16.299 
adding the repeater ring here

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:25.569 
adding the repeater ring here
it<00:05:17.299> fixes<00:05:18.049> it<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:23.049> then<00:05:24.049> there's<00:05:24.469> a<00:05:24.559> bug<00:05:24.859> we're

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:25.579 
it fixes it and then there's a bug we're

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:31.199 
it fixes it and then there's a bug we're
in<00:05:26.199> multiplayer<00:05:27.939> if<00:05:28.939> the<00:05:29.209> server's<00:05:29.689> too<00:05:29.959> laggy

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:31.209 
in multiplayer if the server's too laggy

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:34.779 
in multiplayer if the server's too laggy
by<00:05:32.209> the<00:05:33.019> gate<00:05:33.229> won't<00:05:33.499> open<00:05:33.739> correctly<00:05:34.639> and

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
by the gate won't open correctly and

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.999 
by the gate won't open correctly and
basically<00:05:35.179> all<00:05:35.389> you<00:05:35.569> do<00:05:35.749> is<00:05:35.989> extend<00:05:36.379> this<00:05:36.679> part

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
basically all you do is extend this part

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.839 
basically all you do is extend this part
out<00:05:37.189> right<00:05:37.429> here<00:05:38.559> and<00:05:39.559> just<00:05:39.799> to<00:05:40.219> keep<00:05:40.369> adding

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
out right here and just to keep adding

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.509 
out right here and just to keep adding
the<00:05:40.999> repeater<00:05:41.419> right<00:05:41.779> here<00:05:42.249> extending<00:05:43.249> this

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:43.519 
the repeater right here extending this

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:48.159 
the repeater right here extending this
out<00:05:43.789> until<00:05:44.779> the<00:05:44.959> gate<00:05:45.109> starts<00:05:45.349> working<00:05:47.169> those

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
out until the gate starts working those

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:50.859 
out until the gate starts working those
are<00:05:48.559> pretty<00:05:48.769> much<00:05:48.860> the<00:05:49.039> two<00:05:49.669> bugs<00:05:50.360> that<00:05:50.689> I've

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:50.869 
are pretty much the two bugs that I've

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:53.330 
are pretty much the two bugs that I've
found<00:05:51.259> with

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
found with

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.159 
found with
