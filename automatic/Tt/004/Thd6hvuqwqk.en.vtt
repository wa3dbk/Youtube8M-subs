actually want to see at the last three
that's<00:00:21.600> usually<00:00:21.869> where<00:00:21.990> everyone<00:00:22.289> gets<00:00:22.439> stuck

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
that's usually where everyone gets stuck

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.420 
that's usually where everyone gets stuck
and<00:00:23.330> stuff<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.320> we'll<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:26.310> what

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
how hard they are but most likely I'll

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
how hard they are but most likely I'll
be<00:00:34.140> able<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.469> beat<00:00:34.620> him<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.100> mean<00:00:35.670> I'm<00:00:35.850> pretty

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
be able to beat him I mean I'm pretty

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.119 
be able to beat him I mean I'm pretty
high<00:00:36.930> level<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.530> while<00:00:37.680> he's<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
high level and while he's got the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.180 
high level and while he's got the
Washington<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.790> his<00:00:39.149> tag<00:00:39.649> but<00:00:40.649> he<00:00:40.739> dropped<00:00:40.890> ten

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
Washington as his tag but he dropped ten

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.060 
Washington as his tag but he dropped ten
bucks<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.700> him<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.600> maybe<00:00:42.780> 20<00:00:43.230> who<00:00:43.410> knows<00:00:43.620> when

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bucks on him or maybe 20 who knows when

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.970 
bucks on him or maybe 20 who knows when
he<00:00:44.160> actually<00:00:44.309> got<00:00:44.579> him<00:00:48.350> but<00:00:49.350> let's<00:00:49.530> keep<00:00:49.680> going

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
he actually got him but let's keep going

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.270 
he actually got him but let's keep going
and<00:00:50.160> we're<00:00:50.340> also<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.850> using<00:00:51.949> whatever<00:00:52.949> tag

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
and we're also just using whatever tag

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.029 
and we're also just using whatever tag
we<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.329> just<00:00:54.930> random<00:00:55.350> ian<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:58.039> we're

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
we have and just random ian so we're

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.689 
we have and just random ian so we're
sorted<00:00:59.520> by<00:00:59.640> health<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.140> take<00:01:01.289> damage

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
sorted by health so if they take damage

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.270 
sorted by health so if they take damage
probably<00:01:02.699> switch<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.359> out<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> next

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
probably switch them out for the next

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.750 
probably switch them out for the next
three<00:01:05.580> with<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> most<00:01:06.510> health<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.020> stuff<00:01:07.290> so

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
three with the most health and stuff so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.359 
three with the most health and stuff so
we'll<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:09.530> so<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.650> kind<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> means<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.189> can

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
we'll see so what kind of means we can

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.560 
we'll see so what kind of means we can
get<00:01:11.930> at<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> end<00:01:16.909> there's<00:01:17.909> no<00:01:18.060> no<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> could

the<00:02:20.860> hundred<00:02:21.160> doesn't<00:02:21.489> take<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.819> long<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
the hundred doesn't take that long and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.440 
the hundred doesn't take that long and
we<00:02:23.680> got<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:24.130> it<00:02:24.580> thinks<00:02:24.910> looks<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.180> few

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
we got like it thinks looks like a few

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.320 
we got like it thinks looks like a few
hours<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:26.110> we<00:02:26.170> have<00:02:26.319> like<00:02:26.500> seven<00:02:26.950> days<00:02:27.330> to

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
hours and we have like seven days to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.680 
hours and we have like seven days to
wait<00:02:29.110> for<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.350> next<00:02:29.709> one<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:31.299> that'd<00:02:31.420> be<00:02:31.540> cool

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
wait for the next one so that'd be cool

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.620 
wait for the next one so that'd be cool
if<00:02:31.780> they<00:02:31.900> increased<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.470> or<00:02:32.709> did<00:02:33.040> something

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
if they increased it or did something

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.340 
if they increased it or did something
with<00:02:34.630> events<00:02:36.450> or<00:02:37.450> gave<00:02:37.600> us<00:02:37.720> better<00:02:37.900> mutants

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
with events or gave us better mutants

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.210 
with events or gave us better mutants
also<00:02:39.540> instead<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.780> keep<00:02:41.470> giving<00:02:41.739> us<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:42.040> same

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
also instead of keep giving us the same

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.460 
also instead of keep giving us the same
ones<00:02:42.459> over<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:42.790> over<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.390> just<00:02:44.079> switching

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
ones over and over and just switching

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.080 
ones over and over and just switching
them<00:02:44.560> between<00:02:44.970> pvp<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.000> PVE

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.400 

you

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.620 

but<00:02:53.410> I'll<00:02:53.680> see<00:02:53.860> what<00:02:54.010> happens<00:02:57.450> because<00:02:58.450> I

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
but I'll see what happens because I

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.000 
but I'll see what happens because I
really<00:02:58.900> don't<00:02:59.050> need<00:02:59.170> any<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.680> mutants

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
really don't need any of the mutants

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.330 
really don't need any of the mutants
that<00:03:00.280> they<00:03:00.550> give<00:03:00.730> out<00:03:00.850> currently<00:03:01.830> got<00:03:02.830> most<00:03:03.130> of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
that they give out currently got most of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.770 
that they give out currently got most of
them<00:03:03.490> unless<00:03:04.000> they're<00:03:04.150> gonna<00:03:04.270> give<00:03:04.480> out<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.600> new

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
them unless they're gonna give out a new

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.280 
them unless they're gonna give out a new
one<00:03:04.960> that<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.110> don't<00:03:05.350> need<00:03:06.660> there<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.990> boar

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
one that I don't need there is the boar

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.080 
one that I don't need there is the boar
which<00:03:08.680> they<00:03:08.830> put<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.250> slots<00:03:09.610> which<00:03:09.940> I'm

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
which they put in the slots which I'm

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.720 
which they put in the slots which I'm
hoping<00:03:10.390> to<00:03:10.720> get<00:03:10.930> because<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.040> actually<00:03:12.160> need<00:03:12.700> it

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
hoping to get because I actually need it

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.360 
hoping to get because I actually need it
and<00:03:13.210> if<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.600> do<00:03:13.660> get<00:03:13.960> it<00:03:14.140> then<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.890> will<00:03:15.220> be<00:03:15.250> able

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
and if I do get it then I will be able

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.790 
and if I do get it then I will be able
to<00:03:15.670> get<00:03:17.670> some<00:03:18.670> gold<00:03:19.000> from<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.780> bingo<00:03:20.260> I'm<00:03:20.560> not

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
to get some gold from the bingo I'm not

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
to get some gold from the bingo I'm not
reach<00:03:21.010> our<00:03:21.130> goals<00:03:21.430> i'm<00:03:21.550> going<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.730> actually

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
reach our goals i'm going to actually

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.030 
reach our goals i'm going to actually
get<00:03:22.090> out<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.360> it<00:03:22.450> if<00:03:22.540> I<00:03:22.630> actually<00:03:22.780> get<00:03:23.080> them<00:03:23.290> but

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
get out of it if I actually get them but

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.190 
get out of it if I actually get them but
i<00:03:24.070> think<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.370> like<00:03:24.490> 800<00:03:24.970> or<00:03:25.060> 1200<00:03:25.570> gold<00:03:25.780> so

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
i think it's like 800 or 1200 gold so

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.110 
i think it's like 800 or 1200 gold so
would<00:03:26.620> be<00:03:26.770> really<00:03:26.950> nice<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.250> actually<00:03:27.459> get<00:03:27.850> it

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.820 
the strongest one although it does
attack<00:04:50.610> everybody<00:04:51.260> but<00:04:52.260> if<00:04:52.560> it<00:04:52.680> doesn't

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
attack everybody but if it doesn't

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.650 
attack everybody but if it doesn't
attack<00:04:53.220> everybody<00:04:53.490> in<00:04:53.760> attacks<00:04:54.030> one<00:04:54.240> person

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
attack everybody in attacks one person

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.010 
attack everybody in attacks one person
it's<00:04:54.840> gonna<00:04:55.020> take<00:04:55.320> somebody<00:04:55.770> down<00:04:55.800> for<00:04:56.250> sure

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
it's gonna take somebody down for sure

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.420 
it's gonna take somebody down for sure
even<00:04:58.020> though<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.560> enforcer<00:04:59.039> does<00:04:59.220> have<00:04:59.370> a

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
even though the enforcer does have a

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.980 
even though the enforcer does have a
Bronze<00:04:59.729> Star<00:05:00.030> it's<00:05:00.210> still<00:05:00.389> gonna<00:05:00.510> be<00:05:00.599> stronger

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
Bronze Star it's still gonna be stronger

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.110 
Bronze Star it's still gonna be stronger
than<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:02.160> I'd<00:05:02.250> recommend<00:05:02.430> taking<00:05:02.820> down

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
than it so I'd recommend taking down

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.790 
than it so I'd recommend taking down
that<00:05:03.270> one<00:05:03.419> person<00:05:03.870> I<00:05:03.960> didn't<00:05:04.289> right<00:05:04.500> there<00:05:04.710> as

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
that one person I didn't right there as

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.330 
that one person I didn't right there as
you<00:05:04.889> can<00:05:05.039> see<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:06.620> there<00:05:07.620> goes<00:05:07.770> my<00:05:07.889> man<00:05:08.070> here

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
you can see and there goes my man here

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.270 
you can see and there goes my man here
for<00:05:08.639> 5k<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:12.090> if<00:05:12.419> he<00:05:12.539> means<00:05:12.720> like<00:05:12.990> has<00:05:13.620> like<00:05:13.830> 6k

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
for 5k so if he means like has like 6k

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.120 
for 5k so if he means like has like 6k
health<00:05:14.639> it's<00:05:15.000> gonna<00:05:15.180> go<00:05:15.389> down<00:05:15.950> everyone<00:05:16.950> else

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
health it's gonna go down everyone else

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.010 
health it's gonna go down everyone else
get<00:05:17.370> to<00:05:17.460> attack<00:05:17.729> before<00:05:17.970> you<00:05:18.210> unless<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.720> have

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
get to attack before you unless you have

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.980 
get to attack before you unless you have
like<00:05:19.200> a<00:05:19.229> faster<00:05:19.770> meal

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.999 

but<00:05:24.990> even<00:05:25.229> then<00:05:25.349> it's<00:05:25.529> probably<00:05:25.679> gonna<00:05:25.860> get

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
but even then it's probably gonna get

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.309 
but even then it's probably gonna get
taken<00:05:26.309> down<00:05:29.509> all<00:05:30.509> right<00:05:30.629> it's<00:05:30.839> gone<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.199> the

00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 
taken down all right it's gone to the

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:36.889 
taken down all right it's gone to the
next<00:05:31.939> 199<00:05:32.939> I'm<00:05:35.089> gonna<00:05:36.089> want<00:05:36.300> to<00:05:36.389> check<00:05:36.539> out<00:05:36.659> the

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:36.899 
next 199 I'm gonna want to check out the

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.689 
next 199 I'm gonna want to check out the
start<00:05:37.679> super<00:05:38.399> I<00:05:38.429> guess<00:05:39.059> because<00:05:39.659> I<00:05:39.779> was<00:05:39.809> gonna

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
start super I guess because I was gonna

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.980 
start super I guess because I was gonna
do<00:05:41.699> the<00:05:41.849> most<00:05:42.029> damage<00:05:42.149> this<00:05:42.509> kind<00:05:42.719> of<00:05:42.749> attack

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
do the most damage this kind of attack

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.070 
do the most damage this kind of attack
more<00:05:43.289> than<00:05:43.319> everybody<00:05:43.679> else<00:05:44.009> as<00:05:44.189> you<00:05:44.279> can<00:05:44.429> see

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
more than everybody else as you can see

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.209 
more than everybody else as you can see
although<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.199> other<00:05:46.499> ones<00:05:46.679> are<00:05:46.740> going<00:05:46.889> to<00:05:47.009> hit

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
although the other ones are going to hit

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.980 
although the other ones are going to hit
a<00:05:47.279> lot<00:05:47.429> harder<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.909> guess<00:05:48.179> if<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.539> doesn't<00:05:48.869> do

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
a lot harder I guess if it doesn't do

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.719 
a lot harder I guess if it doesn't do
that<00:05:49.110> much<00:05:49.169> damage<00:05:49.319> like<00:05:50.009> it<00:05:50.159> doesn't<00:05:50.520> do<00:05:50.639> that

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
that much damage like it doesn't do that

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.600 
that much damage like it doesn't do that
much<00:05:50.789> damage<00:05:50.909> there<00:05:52.069> I'll<00:05:53.069> take<00:05:53.279> down<00:05:53.490> the

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
much damage there I'll take down the

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.719 
much damage there I'll take down the
middle<00:05:53.819> one<00:05:54.589> or<00:05:55.589> the<00:05:56.189> one<00:05:56.339> on<00:05:56.369> the<00:05:56.610> other<00:05:56.639> side

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
middle one or the one on the other side

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:05.719 
middle one or the one on the other side
but<00:05:59.729> um<00:06:00.439> it's<00:06:01.439> tough<00:06:01.649> to<00:06:01.800> you<00:06:04.430> like<00:06:05.430> that<00:06:05.459> when

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
but um it's tough to you like that when

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:07.369 
but um it's tough to you like that when
I<00:06:05.759> knew<00:06:05.939> I<00:06:05.969> could<00:06:06.180> put<00:06:06.509> in<00:06:06.629> some<00:06:06.869> decent<00:06:07.229> damage

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
I knew I could put in some decent damage

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.139 
I knew I could put in some decent damage
before<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.919> actually<00:06:08.069> got<00:06:08.399> to<00:06:08.639> it<00:06:08.759> and<00:06:08.909> take<00:06:09.119> it

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:09.149 
before I actually got to it and take it

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.850 
before I actually got to it and take it
down<00:06:09.389> so<00:06:11.959> but<00:06:12.959> I<00:06:13.019> take<00:06:13.169> down<00:06:13.349> the<00:06:13.499> middle<00:06:13.680> or

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
down so but I take down the middle or

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.109 
down so but I take down the middle or
the<00:06:13.889> other<00:06:14.129> one<00:06:14.309> in<00:06:14.430> this<00:06:14.550> lead<00:06:14.759> to<00:06:14.789> start

00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:15.119 
the other one in this lead to start

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:16.759 
the other one in this lead to start
trooper<00:06:15.419> for<00:06:15.659> last<00:06:15.990> because<00:06:16.199> it<00:06:16.439> doesn't<00:06:16.680> do

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:16.769 
trooper for last because it doesn't do

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:18.799 
trooper for last because it doesn't do
that<00:06:16.919> much<00:06:16.979> damage<00:06:17.129> but<00:06:17.879> depending<00:06:18.449> on<00:06:18.569> what

00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:18.809 
that much damage but depending on what

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.409 
that much damage but depending on what
level<00:06:18.839> you<00:06:19.259> are<00:06:19.759> probably<00:06:20.759> do<00:06:20.939> a<00:06:20.969> little<00:06:21.240> bit

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
level you are probably do a little bit

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.269
