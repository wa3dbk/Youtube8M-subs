00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.520
 video I hope you are very very well this 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 time with a very fast boxing 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.230
 new product of the brand found 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.630
 mans and well we go by steps first that 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.639
 nothing where the company is from and what is 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.100
 This product company wave 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.140
 comes from vigo those who know how I like 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.990
 post on these pages where 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.910
 support projects to found 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.980
 economically and this company is European 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.349
 and what do these products do 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.390
 good is wireless charging for our 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.759
 devices like you can see here I have 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 two different packages one is the pack 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.840
 which is the charger and the other is the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.250
 received let's go by parties I entered the 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 receiver for what is being the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.350
 iphone 5 that is an acting connector that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.809
 it also remains at 5 and 5 c and by 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.120
 another side the bread this is universal 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.430
 because it works both with respective of 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.860
 samsung 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.270
 other brands that also left a page 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 in the description so they know more 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.050
 of the product this is not a technology 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.600
 new since the google nexus is coming 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.830
 with her then she calls me a lot 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.960
 attention since I've never seen a 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.940
 wireless charger for advancements 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.200
 and good is a technology that I think 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.900
 now all the companies have to 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.210
 be exploding is very very interesting 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.250
 since today the problems of 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.500
 the cables is fatal let's know what 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.080
 first of all let's see a boxing 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.300
 to see the pad first that nothing like 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.190
 I tell them I like it a lot because the page 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.170
 is you can customize the colors 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.200
 brings out what has been a 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.940
 orange dot this and what saying the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.250
 black center on the page trick is to ask 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.220
 of the color you want so much the outline 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.960
 as the center as the nexus commented 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.479
 from google already comes with this technology 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.950
 the wireless charge that I find very 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.630
 very interesting 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.520
 This product has pros and cons 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.530
 Now let's see them but first 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.759
 let's meet them since I do not have much 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.189
 waiting time and has finally me 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.780
 arrived already 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:52.939
 very thin and very libya ready as 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.219
 can see here is where you should transmit 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.719
 what being the energy 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:00.770
 wirelessly and there's your connector 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.380
 micro-usb here comes your cable too and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.380
 comes some kind of crop where we are going 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.170
 to say how to work what comes 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.480
 being our receiver 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.520
 the adapter the and how can you see the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.860
 crystal device here you can see it 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.110
 how it works simply that place it 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.000
 up there is nothing to do simply 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.010
 we go through the hall but let's see 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.260
 the videos to see how it is installed and 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.540
 how is it first of all and well are we going to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.480
 know the receiver as I was saying 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.430
 now the charger if it is for others 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.950
 brands like what is being samsung 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.690
 and lg and devices therefor 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.390
 apple but the receiver is not 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.120
 receivers only pairs of countries like 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.560
 port lighting and that are iphones that 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.569
 it means iphone 5 5 6 and 5 is let's go to 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.799
 know it looks very thin so 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.890
 I see here it brings an about instructions 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.019
 here is a sticker where we are going to 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.180
 place in what is being like and 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.910
 mobile here and on the back of the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.380
 device so it does not move once 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.080
 that we connect and what has been 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.239
 so I see the mobile x simply 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.430
 you have to bend down three types of flex 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.530
 where are we going to make him stay in the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.590
 back of the iphone and now yes with 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.480
 one case that no longer move and now yes 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.750
 place our device in the part 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.240
 d 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.280
 the charger I have some kind of doubts 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.950
 that here I am finding one I do not know 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.270
 you have to remove anything to the flex 2 that 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.030
 it has to be a distance of 8 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.130
 millimeters is the maximum that can be 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.780
 of separated distance and that does not work 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.730
 with cage is metallic since I have a 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.500
 that made metallic I imagined that and 20 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.810
 I broke through what has been the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.420
 wireless charging not then good here 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.070
 jumps in these two doubts and good for me 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.870
 personally I think I'm 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.560
 should come by default in all 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.200
 brands both samsung apple and htc should already 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.500
 have your charger just come 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.180
 the pats those adapters that already 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.640
 they sell separately not then so 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.010
 have several because he has something 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.170
 bad right now I'm going to put this what 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.580
 says the mobile liquid was going to be what 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.010
 now it's being the lighting port 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.989
 so if right now I have a pad and 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.239
 I put it in my office and although I do 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.300
 I want to load I have to remove the keys 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.370
 sting that disconnect the flex and now yes 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.290
 put my conventional charge then that 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.870
 is not father right now I have to ask 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.310
 another lost charger to have two 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.870
 and not be doing this maneuver 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.940
 remove and put 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.680
 well I will see how it works if 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.900
 you're really interested in a number one I 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.400
 I would like you to tell me if you 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.680
 would like and if it would be easier 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.970
 this technology I personally was a 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.530
 project where you want to install one of 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.080
 these bases in what he did in the center 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.580
 of the car the console in the middle to 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.710
 that whenever I put in devices 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.949
 is loading there there has a 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.710
 usb port and connect and you just arrive 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:47.760
 and there load wirelessly 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.400
 devices I would like very much then 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.680
 I want to see how it works that they load 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.990
 the device what time it takes in 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.590
 load it and other data not that I know that 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.630
 you have more doubts than apparently 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.310
 then if you like it and already whom 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.139
 next video to see how this works 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.080
 good new technology at least to see 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.400
 leave a like also and good will motivate me 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.260
 to make the video still much more 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.910
 fast and I want to try it a 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.010
 week to see how it works does not 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.720
 I have a website in the part of 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.639
 down font is mans video 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.310
 they will also see themselves functioning in this 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:23.330
 moment is fine and thanks for the 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.330
 greetings
