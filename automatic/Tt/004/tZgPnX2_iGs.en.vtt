00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
kind of easing down a little bit now as

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
kind of easing down a little bit now as
we<00:00:48.719> get<00:00:48.870> closer<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> start<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.829> season

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and all the kind of hard running is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
and all the kind of hard running is
maybe<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.570> working<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.140> more

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
maybe out of the way working and more

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.099 
maybe out of the way working and more
working<00:00:55.610> on<00:00:56.610> getting<00:00:56.820> sharper<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.780> little

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
working on getting sharper on little

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
working on getting sharper on little
things<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.969> thought<00:01:00.480> we'd

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
things now and you know I thought we'd

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.849 
things now and you know I thought we'd
done<00:01:00.750> all<00:01:00.780> right<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.230> game<00:01:01.410> last<00:01:01.620> night

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
done all right in the game last night

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.579 
done all right in the game last night
the<00:01:01.890> times<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.489> past<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.969> was<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.300> better

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
the times are past and was a lot better

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:05.870 
the times are past and was a lot better
compared<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> first<00:01:04.920> couple<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.309> games<00:01:05.460> so

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
compared to the first couple of games so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.270 
compared to the first couple of games so
and<00:01:06.150> we'll<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.960> little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.590> sharper<00:01:08.040> I'm

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and we'll get little bit sharper I'm

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.649 
and we'll get little bit sharper I'm
sure<00:01:08.520> there'll<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.729> another<00:01:08.939> couple<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.510> tough

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
sure there'll be another couple of tough

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.109 
sure there'll be another couple of tough
sessions<00:01:10.110> along<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.619> but<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.880> getting

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
sessions along the way but it's getting

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.730 
sessions along the way but it's getting
very<00:01:12.420> close<00:01:12.630> now<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.200> we're<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.619> looking
