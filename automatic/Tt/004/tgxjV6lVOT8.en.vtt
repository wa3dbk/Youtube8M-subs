00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.760 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:01.709> export<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.340> PDF<00:00:02.520> from<00:00:03.000> Adobe<00:00:03.360> InDesign<00:00:03.740> so<00:00:04.740> I

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
to export a PDF from Adobe InDesign so I

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.800 
to export a PDF from Adobe InDesign so I
already<00:00:05.040> have<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> file<00:00:05.520> open<00:00:05.940> it's<00:00:06.120> an<00:00:06.390> excerpt

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
already have a file open it's an excerpt

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.350 
already have a file open it's an excerpt
from<00:00:06.990> my<00:00:07.080> iBooks<00:00:07.620> Author<00:00:07.799> guide<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.580> I'll<00:00:09.210> go

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
from my iBooks Author guide and I'll go

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.390 
from my iBooks Author guide and I'll go
up<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.510> file<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.200> choose<00:00:11.030> export<00:00:13.190> now<00:00:14.190> it's

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
up to file and choose export now it's

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.840 
up to file and choose export now it's
got<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> name<00:00:15.150> already<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.279> for<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> format

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
got a name already and for the format

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.609 
got a name already and for the format
I'm<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.359> choose<00:00:18.660> Adobe<00:00:19.230> PDF

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I'm going to choose Adobe PDF

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.220 
I'm going to choose Adobe PDF
interactive<00:00:20.400> rather<00:00:20.970> than<00:00:21.180> Adobe<00:00:21.539> PDF<00:00:21.900> print

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
interactive rather than Adobe PDF print

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.009 
interactive rather than Adobe PDF print
the<00:00:22.680> difference<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.550> print<00:00:24.269> PDFs<00:00:24.720> are

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the difference is that print PDFs are

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.650 
the difference is that print PDFs are
more<00:00:25.740> suited<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.160> pre-press<00:00:26.970> applications

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
more suited to pre-press applications

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
more suited to pre-press applications
for<00:00:28.199> example<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.619> you're<00:00:28.740> going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.920> send<00:00:29.099> your

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
for example if you're going to send your

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.820 
for example if you're going to send your
book<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> print<00:00:29.970> shop<00:00:30.029> or<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:31.410> print<00:00:31.740> on

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
book to a print shop or a print on

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
book to a print shop or a print on
demand<00:00:32.130> service<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.640> Lulu<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.020> print

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
demand service like Lulu that will print

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
demand service like Lulu that will print
a<00:00:34.380> paper<00:00:34.920> edition<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:35.670> book

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
a paper edition of your book

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.569 
a paper edition of your book
whereas<00:00:36.649> interactive<00:00:37.649> PDFs<00:00:38.070> preserve

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
whereas interactive PDFs preserve

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.310 
whereas interactive PDFs preserve
internal<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.270> external<00:00:39.360> hyperlinks<00:00:39.840> so

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
internal and external hyperlinks so

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.420 
internal and external hyperlinks so
they're<00:00:40.440> more<00:00:40.590> suited<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:40.980> reading<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
they're more suited to reading on a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.060 
they're more suited to reading on a
screen<00:00:41.850> especially<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.440> hyperlinks

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
screen especially if you have hyperlinks

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
screen especially if you have hyperlinks
and<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.149> readers<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.660> able<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
and you want your readers to be able to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.500 
and you want your readers to be able to
click<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.770> link<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.489> your<00:00:47.550> book<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.270> sent

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
click on a link in your book and be sent

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.029 
click on a link in your book and be sent
to<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> website<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.559> that's<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:49.829> we're<00:00:49.950> gonna

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
pick click Save and now we have some

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
pick click Save and now we have some
options<00:00:53.180> now<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> want<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> whole<00:00:55.020> thing

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.380 
so I'll do all pages I'm gonna choose
pages<00:00:58.649> rather<00:00:58.859> than<00:00:59.100> spreads<00:00:59.489> because<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.120> want

choose lossless compression because

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.020 
choose lossless compression because
lossless<00:01:35.040> compression<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.670> going<00:01:35.880> to

lossless compression is going to

lossless compression is going to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
are already going to be the highest

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.539 
are already going to be the highest
quality<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:49.170> resolution<00:01:49.680> I'll<00:01:49.770> choose<00:01:49.979> 96

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
quality for resolution I'll choose 96

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730

pixels<00:01:50.850> per<00:01:51.210> inch<00:01:51.240> which<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.350> little<00:01:52.619> bit

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
pixels per inch which is a little bit

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.980 
pixels per inch which is a little bit
denser<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> therefore<00:01:53.610> sharper<00:01:53.970> than<00:01:54.090> 72<00:01:54.659> but

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
denser and therefore sharper than 72 but

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.920 
denser and therefore sharper than 72 but
not<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.380> dense<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.890> images<00:01:56.310> will<00:01:56.520> appear

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
not so dense that images will appear

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.530 
not so dense that images will appear

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.480 
small or cramped on the screen and I
don't<00:02:00.810> apply<00:02:01.049> any<00:02:01.290> security<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> leave<00:02:02.280> all

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
don't apply any security so I leave all

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.760 
don't apply any security so I leave all

for<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> five<00:02:08.160> page<00:02:08.369> document<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.060> pretty

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
for a five page document this is pretty

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
for a five page document this is pretty
quick<00:02:09.509> but<00:02:09.750> for<00:02:09.929> larger<00:02:10.229> documents<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.739> might

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
quick but for larger documents it might

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.089 
quick but for larger documents it might
take<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> while<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.390> go<00:02:12.510> it's<00:02:12.720> done

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
take a while and here we go it's done

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.949 
take a while and here we go it's done
this<00:02:14.400> looks<00:02:14.640> just<00:02:14.879> like<00:02:15.060> how<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.330> appears<00:02:15.659> in

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
this looks just like how it appears in

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.449 
this looks just like how it appears in
Adobe<00:02:16.470> InDesign<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:17.640> looks<00:02:17.940> great<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.459> that's

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
Adobe InDesign it looks great and that's

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.390 
Adobe InDesign it looks great and that's
about<00:02:20.640> all<00:02:20.819> there<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> it
