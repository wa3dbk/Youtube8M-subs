00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
the box for the 2.0 TDI engines we

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.570 
the box for the 2.0 TDI engines we
generally<00:03:13.870> prefer<00:03:14.070> recommending<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.130> NGK

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
generally prefer recommending the NGK

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.030 
generally prefer recommending the NGK
plug<00:03:15.610> because<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.630> most<00:03:17.040> economical

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
plug because it is the most economical

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.220 
plug because it is the most economical
choice<00:03:18.510> but<00:03:19.510> if<00:03:19.600> you<00:03:19.690> have<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.870> preference

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
choice but if you have a preference

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.380 
choice but if you have a preference
there<00:03:20.590> isn't<00:03:21.010> really<00:03:21.310> going<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.760> be<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> major

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
there isn't really going to be a major

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.960 
there isn't really going to be a major
performance<00:03:22.690> difference<00:03:23.320> between<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:24.550> NGK

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
performance difference between the NGK

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.670 
performance difference between the NGK
version<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.480> volkswagen<00:03:26.019> version<00:03:26.380> and<00:03:26.590> then

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
version the volkswagen version and then

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.900 
version the volkswagen version and then
the<00:03:26.800> boxed<00:03:27.130> version<00:03:27.190> they're<00:03:27.519> all<00:03:27.670> going<00:03:27.850> to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
the boxed version they're all going to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.600 
the boxed version they're all going to
be<00:03:27.970> very<00:03:28.930> similar<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.739> really<00:03:29.980> boils<00:03:30.430> down<00:03:30.489> to

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
be very similar it really boils down to

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.640 
be very similar it really boils down to
preference<00:03:33.540> okay<00:03:34.540> so<00:03:35.200> when<00:03:35.350> we're<00:03:35.470> going<00:03:35.590> to

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
preference okay so when we're going to

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.320 
preference okay so when we're going to
be<00:03:35.739> installing<00:03:36.190> these<00:03:36.459> spark<00:03:36.790> plugs<00:03:36.850> on<00:03:37.180> its

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
be installing these spark plugs on its

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.300 
be installing these spark plugs on its
engine<00:03:37.660> they<00:03:38.019> already<00:03:38.200> are<00:03:38.350> pre<00:03:38.680> gapped<00:03:38.950> as<00:03:39.160> we

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
engine they already are pre gapped as we

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.430 
engine they already are pre gapped as we
talked<00:03:39.519> about<00:03:39.760> before<00:03:39.880> you<00:03:40.540> install<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.380> in

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
talked about before you install it in

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.160 
talked about before you install it in
your<00:03:41.590> spark<00:03:41.830> plug<00:03:42.040> socket<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:43.510> pop<00:03:43.930> it<00:03:44.080> in

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
your spark plug socket and pop it in

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.930 
your spark plug socket and pop it in
place<00:03:44.320> when<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.160> have<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.340> spark<00:03:45.670> plug<00:03:45.730> socket

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
place when you have a spark plug socket

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.910 
place when you have a spark plug socket
they<00:03:46.330> have<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.600> rubber<00:03:46.959> piece<00:03:47.170> inside<00:03:47.560> that<00:03:47.769> has

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
they have a rubber piece inside that has

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.710 
they have a rubber piece inside that has
retained<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.760> spark<00:03:49.030> plug<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.480> can<00:03:49.600> turn

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
retained the spark plug so you can turn

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.100 
retained the spark plug so you can turn
it<00:03:49.870> upside<00:03:49.989> down<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.709> it<00:03:51.340> doesn't<00:03:51.549> fall<00:03:51.850> out

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
it upside down and it doesn't fall out

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.660 
it upside down and it doesn't fall out
all<00:03:53.110> right<00:03:53.230> when<00:03:53.530> installing<00:03:54.040> these<00:03:54.190> in<00:03:54.459> your

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
all right when installing these in your

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.400 
all right when installing these in your
engine<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:55.420> set<00:03:55.630> them<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:55.840> place<00:03:56.049> and<00:03:56.079> you

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
engine you set them in place and you

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.949 
engine you set them in place and you
kind<00:03:56.709> of<00:03:56.799> throw<00:03:57.790> them<00:03:57.850> in<00:03:58.060> by<00:03:58.239> hand

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
kind of throw them in by hand

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:17.390 
kind of throw them in by hand
and<00:03:59.079> wait<00:03:59.590> for<00:03:59.769> them<00:03:59.859> to<00:03:59.980> bottom<00:04:00.310> out

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.170 

okay<00:04:18.400> now<00:04:18.550> we're<00:04:18.670> going<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.820> go<00:04:18.910> ahead<00:04:19.000> and

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
okay now we're going to go ahead and

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.390 
okay now we're going to go ahead and
tighten<00:04:19.360> down<00:04:19.510> all<00:04:19.810> of<00:04:19.840> our<00:04:19.989> spark<00:04:20.320> plugs<00:04:20.590> as

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
tighten down all of our spark plugs as

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.600 
tighten down all of our spark plugs as
mentioned<00:04:21.970> on<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.120> NGK<00:04:22.540> box<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:24.280> tighten

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
mentioned on the NGK box you tighten

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.910 
mentioned on the NGK box you tighten
them<00:04:24.670> down<00:04:24.910> by<00:04:25.120> hand<00:04:25.150> then<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.230> go<00:04:26.380> a<00:04:26.410> half<00:04:26.680> to

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
them down by hand then you go a half to

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.560 
them down by hand then you go a half to
two-thirds<00:04:27.340> of<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.550> time<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.940> intention<00:04:28.480> of

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
two-thirds of the time the intention of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.870 
two-thirds of the time the intention of
this<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.020> just<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.500> crush<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:30.310> crush<00:04:30.670> washer

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
this is just to crush the crush washer

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.810 
this is just to crush the crush washer
at<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.330> end<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.570> the<00:04:31.660> spark<00:04:31.900> plugs<00:04:32.170> so<00:04:32.890> yeah

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
at the end of the spark plugs so yeah

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.200 
at the end of the spark plugs so yeah
Rasch<00:04:34.630> it<00:04:34.810> on<00:04:34.930> there<00:04:35.550> or<00:04:36.550> we<00:04:36.670> just<00:04:36.790> get<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.060> in

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
Rasch it on there or we just get it in

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:48.120 
Rasch it on there or we just get it in
there<00:04:37.860> all<00:04:38.860> right<00:04:42.690> all<00:04:43.690> right<00:04:46.830> just<00:04:47.830> keep<00:04:47.980> in

mind we don't want to go crazy

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.610 
mind we don't want to go crazy
tightening<00:04:49.660> these<00:04:49.780> because<00:04:50.140> we<00:04:50.260> really<00:04:50.500> don't

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
tightening these because we really don't

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.140 
tightening these because we really don't
want<00:04:50.830> to<00:04:50.890> do<00:04:50.950> any<00:04:51.130> damage<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.670> engine<00:04:51.820> just

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
want to do any damage the engine just

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.090 
want to do any damage the engine just
enough<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.680> where<00:04:55.530> you're<00:04:56.530> getting<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.860> spark

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
enough to where you're getting the spark

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.820 
enough to where you're getting the spark
plug<00:04:57.310> all<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.580> way<00:04:57.640> in<00:04:57.730> there<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:57.880> tight<00:05:01.830> okay

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
plug all the way in there and tight okay

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.590 
plug all the way in there and tight okay
once<00:05:03.040> we've<00:05:03.220> done<00:05:03.490> tightening<00:05:04.240> down<00:05:04.270> all<00:05:04.570> of

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
once we've done tightening down all of

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.330 
once we've done tightening down all of
our<00:05:04.720> spark<00:05:04.990> plugs<00:05:05.200> we<00:05:05.350> can<00:05:05.470> now<00:05:05.530> reinstall<00:05:05.860> all

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
our spark plugs we can now reinstall all

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:15.750 
our spark plugs we can now reinstall all
