00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Anthurium is a plant of origin 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.629
 tropical who loves moisture but 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.780
 especially not to have your feet in 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.700
 water nature yom is a very plant 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.379
 decorative for its flowers its flowers 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.070
 white and pink flowers and for 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.020
 most common 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.970
 the red flowers but the anthurium is 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.730
 also very decorative for its foliage 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 its brilliant foliage the anthurium is 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.750
 a houseplant par excellence 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.050
 since the ideal temperature is located 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.600
 between 18 and 25 degrees mostly distant 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.630
 your anthuriums a radiator or a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.610
 chimney the drying air may burn 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.520
 the foliage and for that we increase its 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.260
 humidity then it's pretty simple 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 just have a saucer 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.289
 you have clay balls at 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.510
 bottom pour 1 cm of water so that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.629
 that the pos is not in direct contact 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 with moisture and with evaporation 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.260
 it will increase the hygrometry around 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.289
 the plant 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 of course you water once a 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.100
 week your anthuriums during the winter 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.780
 and during the summer during the period 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.479
 one in full vegetation you the rose 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 is 2 to 3 times other techniques for 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.590
 well maintain his anthuriums at the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.820
 house one wins in a pot 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 big but for that we will not put any 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630
 the land can be peat 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.369
 blonde clay balls if you 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.890
 want or why not fiber 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.229
 like here then the pot is two or 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.930
 three centimeters in diameter by volume 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.890
 and so it's bigger at the bottom there 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:36.409
 put fiber to enhance our 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.070
 skin you position your anthuriums 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:43.229
 on the pot and we will fill all around 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 with this fiber then it could be 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.790
 fiber it could peat 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.189
 foam safway too why not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.140
 in order to keep the moisture around 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.149
 pot but without winning it 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.790
 because if you put a tax too 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.469
 great to your anthuriums it will not bloom 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.210
 the more he will do facts and no 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.790
 will not bloom and then there is a rule 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.590
 general when repoting adventure yom 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.960
 or even in this case when we put it 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.879
 fibers always need that the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.350
 college be in the light and when we 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.590
 talk about anger actually it's the part 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.800
 top of the pot this place this is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.410
 here so the flowers if he finds himself at 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.240
 shade or buried it will not bloom anymore 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.770
 now our anthuriums are going 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.470
 maintain it like any flowering plant 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.800
 gradually as the flowers are removed 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.170
 faded 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.880
 Then landmark nothing to know 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.690
 if the flower should be removed or not 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.700
 it's the color of the stem the stem 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.470
 when it starts to dry out 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.150
 when they start to turn yellow 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.430
 it's a flower that needs to be removed 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.470
 wanted to withdraw as and when 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.120
 principle your anthuriums should 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.710
 to bloom to van damme years then it blooms 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.840
 more summer compared to winter 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.610
 since anthuriums we already have 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.820
 evoked loves humility it must also 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.160
 sprayed water on the foliage but 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:00.550
 as much as possible of the non-calcareous water and 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.750
 of rain wolves then the ideal is to 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.400
 spray the underside of the leaves without 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.690
 wet the flowers since you 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.000
 understand that if you wanted the flowers 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.560
 we risk that the flowers are stung by 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.300
 following when he will start to 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.710
 resume vegetation especially at 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.510
 spring wanted to bring a little bit 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.370
 fertilizer every two weeks three 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.810
 weeks a special plant fertilizer 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.240
 flowers so you can keep 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.660
 very long ago your anthuriums in 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.660
 your apartment
