doctor mostly we just wanted to get rid
of<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.700> fact<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.060> he<00:03:23.209> had<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.630> ton<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:23.959> dust<00:03:24.350> on

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
of the fact that he had a ton of dust on

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.319 
of the fact that he had a ton of dust on
his<00:03:24.920> head<00:03:25.160> because<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.579> helmets<00:03:25.970> kind<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.239> a

his head because it's helmets kind of a

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.750 
his head because it's helmets kind of a
weird<00:03:26.510> plastic<00:03:27.049> so<00:03:27.889> it's<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.489> matter<00:03:28.670> of

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
weird plastic so it's just a matter of

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.990 
weird plastic so it's just a matter of
how<00:03:29.660> can<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.989> not<00:03:30.200> put<00:03:30.620> more<00:03:30.829> dust<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.459> like<00:03:31.760> and

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
how can I not put more dust and like and

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.660 
how can I not put more dust and like and
dead<00:03:32.540> skin<00:03:32.840> cells<00:03:33.109> yes<00:03:33.590> that's<00:03:33.859> who<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.400> this

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
dead skin cells yes that's who so this

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.370 
dead skin cells yes that's who so this
was<00:03:34.850> an<00:03:35.180> attempt<00:03:35.569> to<00:03:35.600> get<00:03:35.810> rid<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.139> it

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
was an attempt to get rid of that it

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.620 
was an attempt to get rid of that it
worked<00:03:36.590> pretty<00:03:36.709> well<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.340> works<00:03:37.519> very<00:03:37.760> well<00:03:37.850> it

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
worked pretty well it works very well it

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.410 
worked pretty well it works very well it
only<00:03:38.720> took<00:03:39.019> three<00:03:39.910> it's<00:03:40.910> three<00:03:41.120> times<00:03:41.299> yeah

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
only took three it's three times yeah

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.870 
only took three it's three times yeah
even<00:03:44.230> wearing<00:03:44.560> latex<00:03:44.920> gloves<00:03:45.069> didn't<00:03:45.610> really

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
even wearing latex gloves didn't really

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.760 
even wearing latex gloves didn't really
work<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.330> what<00:03:46.660> we<00:03:46.750> ended<00:03:46.990> up<00:03:47.080> doing<00:03:47.470> was

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
work and what we ended up doing was

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.100 
work and what we ended up doing was
using<00:03:48.100> Photoshop<00:03:48.670> to<00:03:49.120> manually<00:03:49.630> remove<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
using Photoshop to manually remove the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.570 
using Photoshop to manually remove the
dust<00:03:50.350> one<00:03:50.709> frame<00:03:51.069> at<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.310> time

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
dust one frame at a time

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.780 
dust one frame at a time
an<00:03:52.050> unfortunate<00:03:53.050> task<00:03:53.440> we<00:03:53.800> went<00:03:54.010> with<00:03:54.160> only<00:03:54.459> as

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
an unfortunate task we went with only as

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.210 
an unfortunate task we went with only as
a<00:03:54.819> last<00:03:55.060> resort

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.980 

the<00:03:59.220> final<00:03:59.610> major<00:03:59.760> component<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.630> Star

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
the final major component of the Star

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.050 
the final major component of the Star
Wars<00:04:01.020> Episode<00:04:01.350> was<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.340> explosion<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
Wars Episode was the explosion of the

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.110 
Wars Episode was the explosion of the
Death<00:04:03.270> Star<00:04:03.950> we<00:04:04.950> started<00:04:05.400> with<00:04:05.700> just<00:04:05.730> the

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
Death Star we started with just the

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.600 
Death Star we started with just the
Death<00:04:06.300> Star<00:04:06.570> model<00:04:06.900> against<00:04:07.320> black<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.860> then

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
Death Star model against black and then

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.570 
Death Star model against black and then
after<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.360> few<00:04:09.420> frames<00:04:09.900> we<00:04:10.500> replaced<00:04:10.920> it<00:04:11.100> with

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
after a few frames we replaced it with

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.370 
after a few frames we replaced it with
the<00:04:11.730> brick-built<00:04:12.150> white<00:04:12.480> circle<00:04:12.960> that<00:04:13.260> was

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
the brick-built white circle that was

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:19.039 
the brick-built white circle that was
equal<00:04:13.740> in<00:04:13.830> diameter<00:04:17.660> yeah<00:04:18.660> that's<00:04:18.870> pretty

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
equal in diameter yeah that's pretty

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.470 
equal in diameter yeah that's pretty
good

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.450 

I<00:04:22.190> think<00:04:23.190> that<00:04:23.310> works

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
I think that works

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.670 
I think that works
all<00:04:26.000> right<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.449> let's<00:04:26.660> so<00:04:27.380> we're<00:04:27.500> going<00:04:27.620> to

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
all right so let's so we're going to

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.140 
all right so let's so we're going to
take<00:04:27.800> three<00:04:28.069> frames<00:04:28.400> of<00:04:28.580> this<00:04:28.729> and<00:04:28.940> then<00:04:29.030> we're

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
take three frames of this and then we're

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.499 
take three frames of this and then we're
gonna<00:04:29.270> split<00:04:29.569> it<00:04:29.720> right<00:04:29.930> here<00:04:30.580> for<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.970> rain

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
gonna split it right here for the rain

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:38.050 
gonna split it right here for the rain
coming<00:04:32.870> out<00:04:34.330> through<00:04:35.330> your<00:04:35.539> stations<00:04:36.849> once<00:04:37.849> we

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
coming out through your stations once we

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.300 
coming out through your stations once we
had<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.300> white<00:04:38.479> circle<00:04:38.870> in<00:04:38.990> place<00:04:39.229> we<00:04:39.979> started

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
had the white circle in place we started

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.100 
had the white circle in place we started
to<00:04:40.460> physically<00:04:40.910> explode<00:04:41.389> it<00:04:41.509> from<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.810> center

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
to physically explode it from the center

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.740 
to physically explode it from the center
one<00:04:42.620> frame<00:04:42.889> at<00:04:43.009> a<00:04:43.069> time<00:04:43.210> leaving<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.419> ring<00:04:44.630> of

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
one frame at a time leaving a ring of

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.570 
one frame at a time leaving a ring of
bricks<00:04:45.050> in<00:04:45.229> the<00:04:45.319> middle<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:46.009> simulate<00:04:46.250> the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
bricks in the middle to simulate the

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.659 
bricks in the middle to simulate the
Praxis<00:04:47.000> effect<00:04:47.330> as<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.919> bricks<00:04:49.160> exploded

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
Praxis effect as the bricks exploded

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.879 
Praxis effect as the bricks exploded
outward<00:04:50.000> we<00:04:50.509> literally<00:04:50.840> just<00:04:51.020> held<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.710> ring

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
outward we literally just held the ring

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.460 
outward we literally just held the ring
in<00:04:51.979> place<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.490> lifted<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.240> each<00:04:53.449> frame<00:04:53.810> until

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
in place and lifted it each frame until

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.610 
in place and lifted it each frame until
it<00:04:54.560> passed<00:04:54.800> beneath<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.340> camera<00:04:59.289> later<00:05:00.289> in

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
it passed beneath the camera later in

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.689 
it passed beneath the camera later in
after-effects

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
after-effects

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.939 
after-effects
we<00:05:02.270> added<00:05:02.449> some<00:05:02.630> glow<00:05:03.110> to<00:05:03.380> better<00:05:03.590> approximate

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
we added some glow to better approximate
