00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
time we're going to do a pushing and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.380 
time we're going to do a pushing and
pulling<00:00:40.710> exercise<00:00:41.370> last<00:00:41.850> time<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.210> did<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
pulling exercise last time we did a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.000 
pulling exercise last time we did a
push-pull<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.410> time<00:00:43.620> we're<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:43.950> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
push-pull this way so we're going to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.020 
push-pull this way so we're going to
bring<00:00:45.989> some<00:00:46.230> balance<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.590> our<00:00:46.710> body<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.280> again

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
bring some balance to our body and again

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.270 
bring some balance to our body and again
we're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> focus<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.780> speed<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:50.039> get<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
we're going to focus on speed to get the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
we're going to focus on speed to get the
conditioning<00:00:50.820> effect<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> promote<00:00:51.539> fat<00:00:51.750> loss

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
conditioning effect to promote fat loss

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.479 
conditioning effect to promote fat loss
remember<00:00:52.350> fat<00:00:52.559> losses<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.280> function

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
remember fat losses and just a function

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.950 
remember fat losses and just a function
of<00:00:53.730> strength<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.329> much<00:00:54.449> weight<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:54.840> can

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
of strength and how much weight you can

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.910 
of strength and how much weight you can
lift<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.260> also<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.530> function<00:00:55.680> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
lift it's also a function of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
lift it's also a function of
conditioning<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.760> speed<00:00:57.300> those<00:00:57.719> are<00:00:57.899> other

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
conditioning and speed those are other

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.389 
conditioning and speed those are other
elements<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.559> can't<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.309> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
elements you can't you don't want to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.760 
elements you can't you don't want to
miss<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.750> we're<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.050> focus<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.530> higher

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
miss and we're going to focus on higher

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.399 
miss and we're going to focus on higher
reps<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:02.879> promote<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.750> oxygen<00:01:04.229> debt

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
reps to really promote that oxygen debt

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.020 
reps to really promote that oxygen debt
so<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.769> training<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.280> fatigued<00:01:05.610> state

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so your training in a fatigued state

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
so your training in a fatigued state
that's<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> help<00:01:06.810> promote<00:01:07.110> promote

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that's going to help promote promote

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
that's going to help promote promote

promote growth hormone which is the most

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.530 
promote growth hormone which is the most
