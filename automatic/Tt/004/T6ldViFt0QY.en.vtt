itself

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
itself

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.440 
itself
it<00:01:00.720> was<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.960> good<00:01:01.230> action<00:01:01.530> fight<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.300> was

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
it was a good action fight now it was

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.420 
it was a good action fight now it was
quite<00:01:03.660> obvious<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.170> Aamir<00:01:04.650> Khan<00:01:04.920> was<00:01:05.190> way

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
quite obvious that Aamir Khan was way

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.380 
quite obvious that Aamir Khan was way
way<00:01:05.910> faster<00:01:06.740> then<00:01:07.740> Garcia<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.700> at<00:01:08.910> first<00:01:09.120> I

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
way faster then Garcia and at first I

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.940 
way faster then Garcia and at first I
thought<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.200> fight<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
thought that this fight was kind of a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.500 
thought that this fight was kind of a
mismatch<00:01:11.190> looking<00:01:11.730> at<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.940> first<00:01:12.150> round

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
mismatch looking at the first round

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.080 
mismatch looking at the first round
because<00:01:12.990> meera<00:01:13.320> khan<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.770> landed<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.430> lot<00:01:14.970> of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because meera khan was landed a lot of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.950 
because meera khan was landed a lot of
shots<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.840> i<00:01:16.800> wasn't<00:01:17.010> really<00:01:17.220> sure<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.960> Garcia

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
shots and i wasn't really sure if Garcia

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.270 
shots and i wasn't really sure if Garcia
was<00:01:19.200> going<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.410> be<00:01:19.530> able<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.130> those

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
was going to be able to take all those

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.900 
was going to be able to take all those
shots<00:01:20.930> but<00:01:21.930> Garcia<00:01:22.830> showed<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.160> good<00:01:23.400> chin<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
shots but Garcia showed a good chin and

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.880 
shots but Garcia showed a good chin and
he<00:01:24.000> never<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.480> showed<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.200> he<00:01:25.530> was<00:01:25.710> hurt

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
he never really showed that he was hurt

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.430 
he never really showed that he was hurt
by<00:01:26.760> any<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.120> those<00:01:27.210> punches<00:01:27.540> even<00:01:28.320> though<00:01:28.410> he

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
by any of those punches even though he

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.180 
by any of those punches even though he
did<00:01:28.740> get<00:01:28.890> cut<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.650> was<00:01:31.800> noticing

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
did get cut but one thing I was noticing

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.580 
did get cut but one thing I was noticing
is<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.670> even<00:01:33.180> though<00:01:33.479> Aamir<00:01:34.140> Khan<00:01:34.380> was

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
is that even though Aamir Khan was

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.940 
is that even though Aamir Khan was
landing<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.400> shots<00:01:36.170> danny<00:01:37.170> garcia<00:01:37.440> was

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
landing way more shots danny garcia was

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.400 
landing way more shots danny garcia was
landing<00:01:38.369> good<00:01:38.490> counters<00:01:39.200> during<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
landing good counters during the

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.130 
landing good counters during the
exchanges<00:01:40.979> even<00:01:41.310> though<00:01:41.690> Aamir<00:01:42.690> Khan<00:01:42.960> was

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
exchanges even though Aamir Khan was

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
exchanges even though Aamir Khan was
probably<00:01:43.560> landing<00:01:43.950> two<00:01:44.610> or<00:01:44.760> three<00:01:44.940> punches<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
probably landing two or three punches to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.060 
probably landing two or three punches to
Garcia's<00:01:46.500> one

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
Garcia's one

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.700 
Garcia's one
but<00:01:48.700> in<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.090> back<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.300> my<00:01:49.480> mind<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:50.080> was<00:01:50.320> like

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
but in the back of my mind I was like

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.890 
but in the back of my mind I was like
okay<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.310> know<00:01:51.430> Amir<00:01:51.790> Khan<00:01:52.030> does<00:01:52.300> have<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.570> shaky

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
okay I know Amir Khan does have a shaky

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.219 
okay I know Amir Khan does have a shaky
chin<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:54.430> that<00:01:54.760> would<00:01:54.880> be<00:01:54.909> Danny<00:01:55.360> Garcia's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
chin so that would be Danny Garcia's

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.680 
chin so that would be Danny Garcia's
best<00:01:56.530> shot<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.220> just<00:01:57.910> keep<00:01:58.120> landing<00:01:58.360> shots

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
best shot is to just keep landing shots

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.120 
best shot is to just keep landing shots
on<00:01:58.960> that<00:01:59.110> chin<00:02:00.810> but<00:02:01.810> actually<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.590> first

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
on that chin but actually the first

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.609 
on that chin but actually the first
knockdown<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:04.000> wasn't<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.630> shot<00:02:05.050> to<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.260> chin

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
knockdown it wasn't a shot to the chin

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.910 
knockdown it wasn't a shot to the chin
it<00:02:05.830> was<00:02:05.950> actually<00:02:06.340> more<00:02:06.580> in<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.930> neck<00:02:08.259> like
