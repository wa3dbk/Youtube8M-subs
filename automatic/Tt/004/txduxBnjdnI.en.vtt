liquor as you're probably aware now this
is<00:00:21.800> a<00:00:21.829> pre<00:00:22.249> activated<00:00:23.060> version<00:00:23.569> it's<00:00:23.900> not<00:00:24.109> the

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:24.259 
is a pre activated version it's not the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.220 
is a pre activated version it's not the
live<00:00:24.529> version<00:00:24.949> is<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.519> pre<00:00:25.909> activated<00:00:26.630> which

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
live version is a pre activated which

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.229 
live version is a pre activated which
basically<00:00:27.880> means<00:00:28.880> it's<00:00:29.390> been<00:00:29.689> part<00:00:30.589> fermented

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
basically means it's been part fermented

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.010 
basically means it's been part fermented
ok<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.200> natural<00:00:34.010> sugars<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:35.120> proteins

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
ok so the natural sugars and proteins

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.320 
ok so the natural sugars and proteins
and<00:00:36.500> amino<00:00:37.010> are<00:00:37.760> all<00:00:39.520> broken<00:00:40.520> down<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.030> point

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
and amino are all broken down to a point

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.540 
and amino are all broken down to a point
where<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:41.630> cart<00:00:41.870> can<00:00:42.080> digest<00:00:42.320> them<00:00:42.890> very<00:00:43.310> very

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
where the cart can digest them very very

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.200 
where the cart can digest them very very
easily

is your answer it's basically all of the

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.010 
is your answer it's basically all of the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.970 

absolutely<00:02:14.580> stuffed<00:02:15.450> full<00:02:15.930> of<00:02:16.230> all<00:02:16.590> of<00:02:16.620> the

absolutely stuffed full of all of the
best<00:02:18.200> boilies<00:02:19.200> chopped<00:02:19.800> up<00:02:20.040> there<00:02:20.819> is<00:02:20.940> nothing

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
best boilies chopped up there is nothing

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.600 
best boilies chopped up there is nothing
in<00:02:21.599> there<00:02:21.810> that's<00:02:22.349> going<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.650> spook<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.069> carp<00:02:23.370> in

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
in there that's going to spook a carp in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.770 
in there that's going to spook a carp in
terms<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.420> roundness<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:29.239> you're<00:02:30.239> already<00:02:30.390> a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
terms of roundness so you're already a

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.559 
terms of roundness so you're already a
step<00:02:31.110> ahead<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.650> other<00:02:31.800> anglers<00:02:32.569> the

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
step ahead of the other anglers the

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.000 
step ahead of the other anglers the
other<00:02:33.720> advantage<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:35.520> very<00:02:35.730> cheap<00:02:36.060> I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
other advantage is it's very cheap I

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.420 
other advantage is it's very cheap I
believe<00:02:39.170> recommended<00:02:40.170> retail<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.980> seven

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
believe recommended retail is seven

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.300 
believe recommended retail is seven
pounds<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.330> two<00:02:42.510> kilos<00:02:42.959> so<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:44.220> a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
pounds for two kilos so it's a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.130 
pounds for two kilos so it's a
pre-baiting<00:02:47.569> state<00:02:48.569> you're<00:02:48.810> not<00:02:48.840> going<00:02:49.050> to

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
pre-baiting state you're not going to

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.400 
pre-baiting state you're not going to
get<00:02:49.230> much<00:02:49.440> cheaper<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:53.100> top<00:02:53.940> quality<00:02:54.480> top

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
get much cheaper the top quality top

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.030 
get much cheaper the top quality top
boilie

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.500 
boilie
as<00:02:56.580> you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.940> see<00:02:57.120> there's<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.480> different

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
as you can see there's all different

opened you've got bits of yellow bits of

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.150 
opened you've got bits of yellow bits of
red<00:03:03.330> there's<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.720> lot<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:04.140> red<00:03:04.380> ammo<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.980> new

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
red there's a lot of red ammo the new

red there's a lot of red ammo the new
boilie<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.790> there<00:03:06.319> you<00:03:07.319> get<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.620> odds<00:03:07.850> larger

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
boilie in there you get the odds larger

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.059 
boilie in there you get the odds larger
pieces<00:03:09.170> but<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:10.350> a<00:03:10.760> superb<00:03:11.760> mix<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.950> other

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
pieces but it's a superb mix the other

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.900 
pieces but it's a superb mix the other
thing<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.430> it's<00:03:14.580> actually<00:03:14.880> quite<00:03:15.120> dry<00:03:15.769> now

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
thing is it's actually quite dry now

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.490 
thing is it's actually quite dry now
I've<00:03:17.910> found<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:19.280> literally<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.930> bag<00:03:21.930> of

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
I've found that this literally a bag of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.620 
I've found that this literally a bag of
this<00:03:22.739> will<00:03:23.190> absorb<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.640> liter<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.970> water

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
this will absorb a liter of water

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.560 
this will absorb a liter of water
so<00:03:26.260> rather<00:03:26.470> than<00:03:26.770> water<00:03:27.300> I'm<00:03:28.300> going<00:03:28.480> to

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
so rather than water I'm going to

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.930 
so rather than water I'm going to
improve<00:03:28.870> things<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.320> little<00:03:29.440> bit<00:03:29.680> more<00:03:29.940> by

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
improve things a little bit more by

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.270 
improve things a little bit more by
chucking<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.450> liter<00:03:31.660> of<00:03:31.930> this<00:03:31.960> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.230 

now

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
now

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.830 
now
one<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.310> improves<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.540> digestibility<00:03:40.540> of

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
one this improves the digestibility of

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.260 
one this improves the digestibility of
the<00:03:41.710> whole<00:03:41.890> setup<00:03:43.620> two<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:45.430> has<00:03:45.670> an<00:03:45.880> enormous

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
the whole setup two it has an enormous

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.370 
the whole setup two it has an enormous
amount<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:48.330> cloud<00:03:49.330> attractant<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.620> area

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
amount of cloud attractant to the area

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.540 
amount of cloud attractant to the area
now<00:03:53.380> as<00:03:53.740> you<00:03:53.980> can<00:03:54.130> see<00:03:54.190> it's<00:03:54.910> a<00:03:55.120> very<00:03:55.470> sticky

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
now as you can see it's a very sticky

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.900 
now as you can see it's a very sticky
thick<00:03:57.550> liquid<00:03:59.010> absolutely<00:04:00.010> stuff<00:04:00.580> full<00:04:00.760> of

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
thick liquid absolutely stuff full of

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.050 
thick liquid absolutely stuff full of
goodness<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.440> what<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.620> do<00:04:02.770> is<00:04:03.310> I'll<00:04:03.670> add<00:04:03.850> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
goodness and what I do is I'll add the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.770 
goodness and what I do is I'll add the
liter<00:04:04.270> of<00:04:04.690> corn<00:04:04.990> steep<00:04:05.290> liquor<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.770> this<00:04:06.780> and

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
liter of corn steep liquor to this and

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.230 
liter of corn steep liquor to this and
then<00:04:08.050> I'll<00:04:08.170> leave<00:04:08.380> it<00:04:08.620> soak<00:04:08.980> for<00:04:09.220> an<00:04:09.340> hour<00:04:09.520> and

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
then I'll leave it soak for an hour and

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.500 
then I'll leave it soak for an hour and
almost<00:04:10.750> all<00:04:10.960> of<00:04:11.170> that<00:04:11.350> will<00:04:11.560> be<00:04:11.710> absorbed<00:04:12.510> so

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
almost all of that will be absorbed so

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.930 
almost all of that will be absorbed so
when<00:04:13.660> you<00:04:13.780> start<00:04:14.080> throwing<00:04:14.320> it<00:04:14.650> in<00:04:14.940> it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
when you start throwing it in it

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.450 
when you start throwing it in it
gradually<00:04:16.660> releases<00:04:17.230> over<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> period<00:04:17.920> of<00:04:18.220> time

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
gradually releases over a period of time

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.240 
gradually releases over a period of time
if<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:19.030> bait<00:04:19.540> stays<00:04:19.840> there<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.290> long<00:04:20.500> which

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
if the bait stays there that long which

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.330 
if the bait stays there that long which
are<00:04:22.240> baiting<00:04:23.050> for<00:04:23.350> key<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:23.950> every<00:04:24.310> other

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340

to the spot to find some bits of bait as
well

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
well

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.460

now<00:05:20.760> hemp<00:05:21.030> is<00:05:21.120> very<00:05:21.360> good<00:05:21.600> for<00:05:21.750> that<00:05:21.810> it

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
now hemp is very good for that it

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.890 
now hemp is very good for that it
doesn't<00:05:22.860> seem<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.490> matter<00:05:23.850> how<00:05:24.270> well<00:05:24.570> fed<00:05:24.870> a

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
doesn't seem to matter how well fed a

doesn't seem to matter how well fed a
spot<00:05:25.350> is<00:05:25.620> there<00:05:26.220> always<00:05:26.370> seems<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:26.910> be<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.180> small

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
spot is there always seems to be a small

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.510 
spot is there always seems to be a small
amount<00:05:27.720> that<00:05:27.870> left<00:05:28.440> on<00:05:28.650> the<00:05:28.770> bottom<00:05:29.130> for<00:05:29.280> carp

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
amount that left on the bottom for carp

basically<00:06:08.629> what<00:06:08.810> we'll<00:06:09.020> be<00:06:09.169> doing<00:06:09.349> is

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
basically what we'll be doing is

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.050 
basically what we'll be doing is
enhancing<00:06:10.699> some<00:06:11.629> Tigers<00:06:12.310> by<00:06:13.310> soaking<00:06:13.639> those

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
enhancing some Tigers by soaking those

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.529 
enhancing some Tigers by soaking those
in<00:06:14.629> corn<00:06:15.080> steep<00:06:15.470> liquor<00:06:15.800> and<00:06:16.159> using<00:06:17.000> those<00:06:17.180> as

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
in corn steep liquor and using those as

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:20.320 
in corn steep liquor and using those as
our<00:06:17.689> hook<00:06:17.960> bait<00:06:18.259> so<00:06:19.159> if<00:06:19.460> we<00:06:19.849> get<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.060> head<00:06:20.300> of

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
our hook bait so if we get a head of

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.589 
our hook bait so if we get a head of
tension<00:06:21.199> bream<00:06:21.500> come<00:06:21.770> in<00:06:22.270> theoretically<00:06:23.270> they

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
tension bream come in theoretically they

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.170 
tension bream come in theoretically they
should<00:06:23.780> leave<00:06:23.990> that<00:06:24.229> alone

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
should leave that alone

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.029 
should leave that alone
once<00:06:26.180> a<00:06:26.330> cart<00:06:26.569> coming<00:06:26.870> after<00:06:27.379> them<00:06:27.530> to<00:06:27.740> polish
