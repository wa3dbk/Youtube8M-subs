00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.260
 the document that you will discover was made by a cabinet 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.150
 specialized in sometimes narrow studies that unites 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.380
 the technique with you that allows me to record the position and the 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.509
 eye movements on a document 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.259
 we are going to present you the recorded sequences of the look of 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.770
 two people trial ante to the correction of a text having the same 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.009
 faults on the software or order 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.460
 the blue circle indicates the position of the gaze 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.269
 its mentor diameter of the eye fixations 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.299
 the blue segment indicates the multiple jerky place between two bindings 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.260
 this first video reproduces christine's correction sequence 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.430
 specialist in written communication 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.910
 but not professional correction 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.310
 you can see that the movements of the blue circle are numerous they are 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.950
 succeed very quickly 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.210
 the look of christine baal and the text as would any ordinary reader 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.090
 having for instructions therefore correct the faults 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.500
 - one word out of two gold has been fastened 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.620
 christine in record no fault during this first reading 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.370
 here we are in the second reading here again many words are not 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.280
 fixed 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.470
 it is important to know against fixing the eye is blind it can not 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 so detect fake 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.350
 although specialist in written communication 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.330
 and despite three reading this text 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.820
 christine will not have been able to correct all the faults 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.990
 the great knowledge of christine for the rules of our language is 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.050
 insufficient to ensure perfect correction in text 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.540
 here is a record of the corrective clarisse correction sequence 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.420
 professional i am correct words 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.140
 note first of all the precision of the movements of the gaze 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 and this at four are regular totally controlled by a 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.920
 concentration immediately mobilized 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.430
 clary bindings are very long almost twice as much as 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.390
 christine 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.630
 she reveals careful attention every word with every sign 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.369
 clarisse will correct all the mistakes of the text from the first pass 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.229
 a second and final reading will serve as a check 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.860
 in addition to a perfect mastery of the spelling rules of grammar 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.490
 and the typographic code of our language 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.659
 professional correction calls for an effort of concentration and 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.530
 of rigor demanding to be mobilized on sometimes very long texts 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:11.369
 to conclude 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.049
 here is the visual path tracing all of christine's bindings 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.869
 at first reading 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.749
 and point of fixation are sparse it is appear the many evils 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.109
 having escaped his vigilance 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:27.409
 in comparison the visual path of clarisse and dance completes them 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.479
 no word no sign has been neglected 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.219
 Professional and professional correction that requires an eye to exercise 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:36.419
 rigorous and methodical
