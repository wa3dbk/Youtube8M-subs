00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
 one of the frequent problems too 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.849
 when working with a large rabbit is 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.630
 sweat dermatin infectious where dermatitis 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 then this disease manifests itself 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.699
 the following symptoms on the hind legs in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.340
 mostly on hind legs 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.640
 bleeding occurs sometimes pus 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:31.859
 painful such ulcers they form from 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:35.040
 the fact that the rabbit is on the grid and under 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.300
 with his weight he presses the part 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.230
 soft tissue they die off and it starts 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.030
 tissue infection and then 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.100
 the next I am for 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.719
 means such ulcers are treated 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.440
 antibiotic 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:59.809
 any antibiotics such as what and spray 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:04.140
 mean to process you need 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:09.430
 Of course, another assistant is needed 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:15.070
 friend you live 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.810
 mean twice a day process these 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.680
 wounds 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.830
 they dry up very quickly and disappear but 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.540
 for prevention for prevention 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.960
 further it is necessary to use here 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.380
 such or something like mats ie this 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.640
 mat 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:37.540
 lays down in a strong notch grid by he 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.150
 has a wider surface and kings 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.970
 uterus or crawl rest on it and not 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.720
 makes itself such ulcers means in what 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.840
 plus such a mesh that manure he is 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.930
 equally goes through the hole in this in 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.610
 This rug means these are inexpensive peels and 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.840
 very effective they can be washed with boiling water 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.149
 scald any disinfectants and so on 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.740
 very comfortable here is a rabbit latch 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.930
 it can not not remove nothing 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.930
 take a look and then everything
