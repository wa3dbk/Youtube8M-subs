I<00:01:08.530> think<00:01:08.860> 118<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.820> be<00:01:09.939> precise<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:10.689> lots<00:01:11.380> of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
I think 118 to be precise and lots of

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.560 
I think 118 to be precise and lots of
wood<00:01:11.740> pilings<00:01:12.310> which<00:01:12.670> serve<00:01:12.939> as<00:01:12.970> basically

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
wood pilings which serve as basically

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.440 
wood pilings which serve as basically
the<00:01:13.659> city's<00:01:14.020> foundation<00:01:14.620> exactly<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:16.210> it's<00:01:16.390> a

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
the city's foundation exactly so it's a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.290 
the city's foundation exactly so it's a
city<00:01:16.690> of<00:01:16.780> canals<00:01:17.250> bridges<00:01:18.250> Woody<00:01:18.760> Allen<00:01:19.180> and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
city of canals bridges Woody Allen and

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.370 
city of canals bridges Woody Allen and
boats<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:22.530> mean<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.890> can't<00:01:24.720> okay<00:01:25.720> so<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:26.049> watery

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
boats I mean I can't okay so this watery

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.410 
boats I mean I can't okay so this watery
setup<00:01:26.710> makes<00:01:26.890> Venice<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.310> unique<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.880> romantic

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
setup makes Venice a unique and romantic

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.270 
setup makes Venice a unique and romantic
place<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.049> that's<00:01:29.560> probably<00:01:29.799> why<00:01:29.979> more<00:01:30.159> than

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
place and that's probably why more than

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.130 
place and that's probably why more than
20<00:01:30.640> million<00:01:30.880> tourists<00:01:31.479> flocked<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.930> city

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
should add this trivia because I don't

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.359
