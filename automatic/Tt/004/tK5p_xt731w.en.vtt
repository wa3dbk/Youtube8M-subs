went<00:06:03.430> up<00:06:03.550> high<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:03.879> all<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.030> del<00:06:04.449> can<00:06:04.659> do<00:06:04.810> is

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
went up high and all the del can do is

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.839 
went up high and all the del can do is
start<00:06:05.229> the<00:06:05.349> ball<00:06:05.530> over<00:06:05.680> in<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.889> 4/7<00:06:06.520> area<00:06:06.729> and

start the ball over in the 4/7 area and

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.550 
start the ball over in the 4/7 area and

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.100 
hopefully he can bounce the 4-pin out
off<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:08.949> kick<00:06:09.310> back<00:06:09.490> and<00:06:09.759> in<00:06:10.060> to<00:06:10.479> the<00:06:10.599> 6-pin

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.469 
off the kick back and in to the 6-pin
best<00:06:11.949> to<00:06:12.039> just<00:06:12.159> go<00:06:12.370> for<00:06:12.580> two<00:06:12.729> pins
