of the scar too much like I focus more

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.300 
of the scar too much like I focus more
on<00:00:24.009> my<00:00:24.279> nitro<00:00:24.869> but<00:00:25.869> I'm<00:00:25.990> really<00:00:26.200> into<00:00:26.619> RC<00:00:27.070> drift

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
on my nitro but I'm really into RC drift

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.439 
on my nitro but I'm really into RC drift
in<00:00:27.550> so<00:00:29.130> recently<00:00:30.130> I<00:00:30.460> got<00:00:30.760> my<00:00:31.060> one-way

in so recently I got my one-way

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.390 
in so recently I got my one-way
differential<00:00:32.400> and<00:00:34.080> I<00:00:35.080> really<00:00:36.010> want<00:00:36.160> to<00:00:36.220> test

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
differential and I really want to test

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.740 
differential and I really want to test
it<00:00:36.580> out<00:00:36.640> here<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.030> show<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:37.300> guys<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.750> let's

body's<00:00:57.369> looking<00:00:57.670> cool<00:00:59.610> so<00:01:00.610> let's<00:01:00.640> take<00:01:01.119> this

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.299 
body's looking cool so let's take this

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.450 
body's looking cool so let's take this
off<00:01:03.210> um<00:01:04.379> plug<00:01:05.379> in<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.710> battery

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
off um plug in the battery

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.060 
off um plug in the battery
I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:07.840> videos<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.200> little<00:01:08.320> dark<00:01:08.710> isn't

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
I think this videos a little dark isn't

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:23.090 
I think this videos a little dark isn't
it<00:01:09.390> no<00:01:10.390> it's<00:01:10.570> cool<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.930> yeah

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.860 

I'll<00:01:23.640> give<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:24.510> here<00:01:26.720> turn<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
I'll give this back right here turn the

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:36.140 
I'll give this back right here turn the
radio<00:01:28.050> on

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.410 

so<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.140> problem<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.620> the<00:01:37.800> the<00:01:38.640> d3<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
so the problem of the the d3 is the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:59.270 
so the problem of the the d3 is the
shattering<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.610> course

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.810 

now<00:02:00.280> it's<00:02:00.729> just<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.329> -<00:02:01.390> like<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:06.130> think<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.640> would

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
now it's just so - like I think it would

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.020 
now it's just so - like I think it would
be<00:02:06.939> a<00:02:06.969> good<00:02:07.210> car<00:02:07.509> for<00:02:07.539> drifting<00:02:08.110> because<00:02:09.039> you

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
be a good car for drifting because you

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.150 
be a good car for drifting because you
know<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.420> chattering<00:02:10.929> of<00:02:11.110> course<00:02:11.379> is<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:11.650> big

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
know the chattering of course is a big

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.030 
know the chattering of course is a big
problem<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:13.599> could<00:02:13.780> damage<00:02:13.989> your<00:02:14.290> front<00:02:14.709> belt

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
problem you could damage your front belt

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.369 
problem you could damage your front belt
because<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:15.879> checking<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.450> belt<00:02:16.959> forces

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
because it's checking the belt forces

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:27.240 
because it's checking the belt forces
loose<00:02:20.370> yeah<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:26.140> way<00:02:26.319> is<00:02:26.440> working<00:02:26.860> everything

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
loose yeah one way is working everything

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.319 
loose yeah one way is working everything
is<00:02:27.489> working<00:02:29.099> let<00:02:30.099> me<00:02:30.190> zoom<00:02:30.430> here<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.819> little<00:02:31.150> bit

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
is working let me zoom here a little bit

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:49.450 
is working let me zoom here a little bit
for<00:02:32.019> you

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.360 

and<00:02:50.460> there<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.670> go<00:02:50.790> that's<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.270> one<00:02:51.450> way<00:02:52.370> for

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and there you go that's in one way for

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.070 
and there you go that's in one way for
the<00:02:53.670> security<00:02:54.150> three<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.540> know<00:02:54.630> there's<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:54.960> lot

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
the security three I know there's a lot

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.920 
the security three I know there's a lot
of<00:02:55.110> videos<00:02:55.410> about<00:02:55.440> there<00:02:55.920> about<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.970> on

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
of videos about there about that on

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.680 
of videos about there about that on
YouTube<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:59.060> really<00:03:00.060> wanted<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.300> make<00:03:00.510> this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
YouTube but I really wanted to make this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.620 
YouTube but I really wanted to make this
one<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.140> don't<00:03:01.740> know<00:03:01.890> why<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:08.480> I'm<00:03:09.480> probably

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
one I don't know why so I'm probably

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.860 
one I don't know why so I'm probably
going<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.200> be<00:03:10.500> making<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.070> video<00:03:11.480> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.630> car

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
going to be making a video of the car

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.160 
going to be making a video of the car
Ronnie<00:03:16.730> don't<00:03:17.730> SPECT<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.930> I'm

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
Ronnie don't SPECT much because I'm

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.600 
Ronnie don't SPECT much because I'm
really<00:03:19.410> not<00:03:19.650> time<00:03:20.490> doing<00:03:20.880> RC<00:03:21.420> videos<00:03:22.460> you<00:03:23.460> got

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
really not time doing RC videos you got

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.960 
really not time doing RC videos you got
a<00:03:23.640> lot<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:23.880> homework<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.450> do<00:03:25.370> but<00:03:26.370> that's<00:03:26.640> about

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
a lot of homework to do but that's about

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.030 
a lot of homework to do but that's about
it
