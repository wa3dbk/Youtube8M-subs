is<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> replacement<00:00:20.430> valve<00:00:20.850> okay<00:00:21.420> what<00:00:21.840> we're

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
is a replacement valve okay what we're

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.259 
is a replacement valve okay what we're
going<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.350> I've<00:00:23.340> already<00:00:23.640> done<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> brown<00:00:24.090> I

demonstrate it for you here this is a
special<00:00:27.210> tool<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.449> cutting<00:00:27.779> these<00:00:27.900> piping

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
special tool for cutting these piping

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.970 
special tool for cutting these piping
and<00:00:28.529> pulled<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> part<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.160> such<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:30.830> bit<00:00:31.830> too

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
and pulled it part of such a bit too

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.370 
and pulled it part of such a bit too
much

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380

close the knife on the tube and this is
a<00:00:40.469> plastic<00:00:40.739> tube<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.760> edges<00:00:42.120> begins<00:00:42.450> to

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
a plastic tube and the edges begins to

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.060 
a plastic tube and the edges begins to
cut<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.079> want<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.320> rotate<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
cut you want to rotate it so that you

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.910 
cut you want to rotate it so that you
get<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.190> nice<00:00:44.430> clean<00:00:44.910> cut<00:00:48.260> that's<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> simple

with two pieces and I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.040> cut<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.150> show<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.030 

this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.159> plastic<00:01:20.340> piece<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:22.040> you

this is a little plastic piece here you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.910 
this is a little plastic piece here you
can<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.400> its<00:01:23.549> got<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.970> head<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.920> that's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
can see its got like a head on it that's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.130 
can see its got like a head on it that's
going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:26.369> right<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:27.180> water<00:01:27.780> pipe

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
going to go right in your water pipe

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.280 
going to go right in your water pipe
it's<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> set<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.180> just<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.630> okay

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it's going to set in just like that okay

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
it's going to set in just like that okay
just<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> simple<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.619> valve<00:01:34.890> has<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
just that simple then your valve has a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.069 
just that simple then your valve has a
special<00:01:36.360> fitting<00:01:36.689> back<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:39.020> develop<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
special fitting back here develop a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.719 
special fitting back here develop a
special<00:01:40.409> thing<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:41.009> simply<00:01:41.369> slides

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
special thing and just simply slides

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.010 
special thing and just simply slides
over<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> pipe<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.899> want

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
over the pipe so all you do and you want

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.300 
over the pipe so all you do and you want
to<00:01:46.170> make<00:01:46.290> sure<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.770> pretty<00:01:46.950> straight

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
to make sure that you're pretty straight

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.819 
to make sure that you're pretty straight
going<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:49.049> outside<00:01:49.170> edges<00:01:49.619> are

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
going on and if your outside edges are

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.490 
going on and if your outside edges are
clean<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.970> simply<00:01:51.450> slide<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.290> back

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
clean and you just simply slide it back

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
clean and you just simply slide it back
on<00:01:52.880> with<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:54.149> push<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> you're<00:01:54.960> done

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
on with a good push and you're done

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
on with a good push and you're done
then<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> want<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> turn<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> valve<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
then you want to turn the valve to the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.990 
then you want to turn the valve to the
off<00:01:57.149> position<00:01:58.250> crosswise<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.610> pipe<00:01:59.820> is

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
off position crosswise to the pipe is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.389 
off position crosswise to the pipe is
always<00:02:00.329> off<00:02:00.540> okay<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.399> that's<00:02:02.579> one<00:02:02.790> side<00:02:03.030> done

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
always off okay so that's one side done

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.560 
always off okay so that's one side done
