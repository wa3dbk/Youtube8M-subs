tears of the moon I think I liked it
better<00:02:53.330> than<00:02:53.660> Medusa<00:02:54.200> although<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.220> doesn't

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
better than Medusa although it doesn't

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.550 
better than Medusa although it doesn't
have<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> same<00:02:55.910> cheesing<00:02:56.690> possibilities<00:02:57.380> as

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
have the same cheesing possibilities as

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.770 
have the same cheesing possibilities as
Medusa<00:02:58.070> lane'<00:02:58.220> I've<00:02:58.730> done<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> lot<00:02:59.420> of<00:02:59.480> cheese

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
Medusa lane' I've done a lot of cheese

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.949 
Medusa lane' I've done a lot of cheese

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
on Medusa is just hilarious here comes

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.160 
on Medusa is just hilarious here comes
you<00:03:03.080> simulator<00:03:03.530> standard<00:03:04.130> a<00:03:04.459> pvt<00:03:04.880> from<00:03:05.780> tester

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
you simulator standard a pvt from tester

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.740 
you simulator standard a pvt from tester
so<00:03:06.320> far<00:03:06.790> Midas<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.880> known<00:03:08.090> for<00:03:08.330> going<00:03:08.450> for

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
so far Midas is known for going for

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.320 
so far Midas is known for going for
standard<00:03:09.170> play<00:03:09.380> too<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:09.980> this<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:10.940> probably<00:03:11.180> a

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
standard play too so this is probably a

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.880 
standard play too so this is probably a
safe<00:03:11.570> build<00:03:11.870> from<00:03:12.050> tester<00:03:12.470> he<00:03:12.590> probably

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
safe build from tester he probably

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.550 
safe build from tester he probably
doesn't<00:03:13.220> need<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.459> scout<00:03:13.700> anytime<00:03:14.150> soon<00:03:14.560> mitis

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
doesn't need to scout anytime soon mitis

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.530 
doesn't need to scout anytime soon mitis
always<00:03:15.920> sticks<00:03:16.280> in<00:03:16.459> his<00:03:16.580> base<00:03:16.790> for<00:03:17.150> as<00:03:17.299> long<00:03:17.480> as

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
always sticks in his base for as long as

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.810 
always sticks in his base for as long as
he<00:03:17.780> can<00:03:17.989> he's<00:03:18.350> very<00:03:18.560> usually<00:03:19.250> very<00:03:19.430> late<00:03:19.670> to

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
he can he's very usually very late to

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.620 
he can he's very usually very late to
scout<00:03:22.930> but<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.200> means<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:25.090> tester<00:03:26.090> can

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
scout but that means that tester can

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.810 
scout but that means that tester can
probably<00:03:27.049> get<00:03:27.200> out<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.350> zealot<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:28.010> ward<00:03:28.610> off<00:03:28.760> a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
probably get out a zealot to ward off a

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.670 
probably get out a zealot to ward off a
scout<00:03:29.269> here<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.750> keep<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.410> scanning

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
scout here and keep that scanning

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.410 
scout here and keep that scanning

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540

the moon but i think you know they could
have<00:04:02.630> done<00:04:02.750> this<00:04:02.780> map<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:03.380> like<00:04:04.040> desert<00:04:04.489> or

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
have done this map in like desert or

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.210 
have done this map in like desert or
something<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.540> Badlands<00:04:05.989> towel<00:04:06.590> set<00:04:06.890> or

something the Badlands towel set or

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.620 
something the Badlands towel set or
anything<00:04:07.519> else<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.970> I<00:04:08.060> think<00:04:08.269> it<00:04:08.329> still<00:04:08.540> would

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
anything else and I think it still would

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.870 
anything else and I think it still would
have<00:04:08.660> been<00:04:08.780> as<00:04:08.930> good

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.520 

Deepu<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.330> I<00:04:14.570> assume<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.900> was<00:04:15.050> a<00:04:15.140> factory

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
Deepu and I assume that was a factory

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.979 
Deepu and I assume that was a factory
didn't<00:04:15.830> catch<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.010> I'm<00:04:16.400> sure<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:16.880> is<00:04:16.970> though<00:04:17.209> it

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
didn't catch it I'm sure it is though it

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.660 
didn't catch it I'm sure it is though it
looks<00:04:18.440> like<00:04:18.590> both<00:04:18.769> are<00:04:18.950> going<00:04:19.130> for<00:04:19.310> standard

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
looks like both are going for standard

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.800 
looks like both are going for standard

to see a bunch of Jew goons out I'm
wondering<00:04:26.510> if<00:04:26.630> tester<00:04:26.960> even<00:04:27.200> made<00:04:27.350> one<00:04:27.680> zealot

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
wondering if tester even made one zealot

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.880 
wondering if tester even made one zealot
I<00:04:28.430> haven't<00:04:28.910> seen<00:04:29.180> him<00:04:29.510> well<00:04:30.380> I'm<00:04:30.500> sure<00:04:30.650> he<00:04:30.740> has

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
I haven't seen him well I'm sure he has

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.680 
I haven't seen him well I'm sure he has
a<00:04:30.920> sellout<00:04:31.190> out<00:04:31.430> blocking<00:04:31.880> his<00:04:32.000> show<00:04:32.300> because

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
a sellout out blocking his show because

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.790 
a sellout out blocking his show because
he's<00:04:32.870> going<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.110> need<00:04:33.230> something<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.650> block

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
he's going to need something to block

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.710 
he's going to need something to block
his<00:04:33.950> choke<00:04:34.190> if<00:04:34.340> he<00:04:34.460> wants<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.760> stop<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.240> scalp

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.990
