 and canoes christrose know a few 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.750

 right click on this link 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.630
 hard to pull in brackets 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.760
 I've tried now 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.390
 ddr television does not make advertising or 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.020
 got more trouble and was able to recover 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.140
 farther on I have him on top 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:47.219
 has sprung in entertaining in it though 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 never stop to watch out here a 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.399
 small chunks and then see yes there 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.850

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.680
 up here the infusion of the arm chips here 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 happened again on the top actor 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 said I was lazy but falls 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 I had gave me the easy 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.549
 to forget 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 and that was a week up there 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.580
 a lid on it and wanted yesterday 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.520
 I then keep the topic but pig 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 say at the same time 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.390
 zo sin caras seems to have checked 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 will probably be there just one 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.090
 Mediterranean plants is moment I am 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.119
 Let's get him off me again 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.150
 a Mediterranean plant and me 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.049
 probably just need heat 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.979
 probably these warm jump 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.979
 only from a certain temperature 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.310
 I do not know what it's like when you look at yourself 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.110
 into the water this canada has had the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.159
 the water is always bubbling over it 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.290
 if just blanch the tee 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.590
 do not let drain 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.790
 otherwise we'll get this buried 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.119
 district travel in this on it is 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.430
 unbelievable not understandable or at least 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.729
 he also lives plant because you know the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.190
 For example, only after the forest fire came trees 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.650
 this one seems to be like that, yes me 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.000
 I hope I can help you with that 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.500
 I will always keep you up to date 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.080
 who then later show how 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.980
 the plants look but first as 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.230
 tip on how to walk in canoes 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.470
 It's easy when you look 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.120
 far as looking so as if in child 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.120
