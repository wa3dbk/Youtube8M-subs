00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:11.549 

so<00:00:09.050> in<00:00:09.349> this<00:00:09.679> video<00:00:10.040> you<00:00:10.400> will<00:00:10.430> see<00:00:10.580> how

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
so in this video you will see how

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.420 
so in this video you will see how
projector<00:00:12.559> headlights<00:00:13.990> create<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.289> line<00:00:16.129> a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
projector headlights create a line a

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.110 
projector headlights create a line a
razor-sharp<00:00:16.849> line<00:00:17.540> like<00:00:18.080> you<00:00:18.230> see<00:00:18.439> here

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.200 

so<00:00:25.120> this<00:00:25.570> is<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.780> high<00:00:26.110> beam<00:00:27.000> projector<00:00:28.000> from

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
so this is a high beam projector from

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.060 
so this is a high beam projector from
2001<00:00:29.310> Mercury<00:00:30.310> Cougar<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:32.050> this<00:00:32.470> one<00:00:32.710> creates

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
2001 Mercury Cougar so this one creates

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.120 
2001 Mercury Cougar so this one creates
a<00:00:33.550> spotlight<00:00:34.450> it<00:00:34.930> does<00:00:35.170> not<00:00:35.410> create<00:00:35.770> a<00:00:35.830> line

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
a spotlight it does not create a line

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.420 
a spotlight it does not create a line
and<00:00:37.050> as<00:00:38.050> you<00:00:38.260> can<00:00:38.410> see<00:00:38.740> it's<00:00:39.660> essentially<00:00:40.660> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and as you can see it's essentially a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.310 
and as you can see it's essentially a
reflective<00:00:42.430> surface<00:00:42.670> like<00:00:43.420> a<00:00:43.450> flashlight<00:00:43.809> and

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
reflective surface like a flashlight and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.500 
reflective surface like a flashlight and
lens<00:00:45.220> in<00:00:45.640> front<00:00:45.700> of<00:00:46.239> it<00:00:46.650> here<00:00:47.650> I<00:00:47.680> have<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.239> holy<00:00:49.239> D

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
lens in front of it here I have a holy D

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.380 
lens in front of it here I have a holy D
flashlight<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.410> I'm<00:00:51.129> taking<00:00:51.610> off<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:52.180> top

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
flashlight and I'm taking off the top

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.280 
flashlight and I'm taking off the top
part<00:00:52.629> so<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:53.140> can<00:00:53.379> use<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:54.370> LED<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:56.140> the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
part so I can use the LED with the

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:04.960 
part so I can use the LED with the
projector

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.330 

you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.569 

so<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.509> is<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> high<00:01:13.079> beam<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:13.950> see<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
so this is the high beam so you see that

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:18.950 
so this is the high beam so you see that
I'm<00:01:14.939> just<00:01:15.270> adjusting<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:17.360> LED<00:01:18.360> inside<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I'm just adjusting the LED inside the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
I'm just adjusting the LED inside the
projector<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:20.820> makes<00:01:21.229> different<00:01:22.229> size<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
projector and it makes different size so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.380 
projector and it makes different size so
cars<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.299> set<00:01:25.079> up<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> right<00:01:26.090> dimension<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
cars are set up to a right dimension of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.770 
cars are set up to a right dimension of
the<00:01:27.750> spotlight<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.039> now<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.399> have<00:01:29.909> low<00:01:30.509> beam

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the spotlight so now I have low beam

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.830 
the spotlight so now I have low beam
from<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.409> same<00:01:31.679> car<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.270> creates<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
from the same car and this one creates a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.889 
from the same car and this one creates a
line<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.579> inside<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.450> metal

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
line and you can see inside the metal

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.950 
line and you can see inside the metal
plate<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.610> responsible<00:01:39.360> for<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.780> line

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
plate that is responsible for the line

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.130 
plate that is responsible for the line
and<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:41.189> there's<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.549> ridge<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> lens<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and also there's a ridge on the lens to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.580 
and also there's a ridge on the lens to
amplify<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.770> line<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.600> by<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.659> way<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> put

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
amplify the line and by the way I put

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.639 
amplify the line and by the way I put
the<00:01:46.890> metal<00:01:47.490> sheets<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.209> the<00:01:48.569> red<00:01:48.810> silicone<00:01:49.170> on

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the metal sheets and the red silicone on

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.730 
the metal sheets and the red silicone on
it<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.789> can<00:01:50.939> see<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.689> low<00:01:52.140> beam<00:01:52.409> has

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
it so as you can see the low beam has

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.309 
it so as you can see the low beam has
two<00:01:53.250> flat<00:01:53.520> faces<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.630> high<00:01:54.840> beam<00:01:55.049> has

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
two flat faces and the high beam has

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.130 
two flat faces and the high beam has
only<00:01:55.860> one<00:01:56.220> and<00:01:56.429> it's<00:01:57.299> hard<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.080> camera

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
only one and it's hard to see on camera

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.039 
only one and it's hard to see on camera
but<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> low<00:01:59.130> beam<00:01:59.399> projector<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.420> wider<00:02:00.869> than

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
but the low beam projector is wider than

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.130 
but the low beam projector is wider than
the<00:02:01.349> high<00:02:01.619> beam<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.429> creates<00:02:02.819> a<00:02:03.060> wider<00:02:03.390> area

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the high beam so it creates a wider area

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.309 
the high beam so it creates a wider area
of<00:02:04.289> light<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.909> here<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.599> see<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.080> line

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
of light so here you can see the line

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.940 
of light so here you can see the line
that<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.310> low<00:02:08.580> beam<00:02:08.849> creates<00:02:09.299> and<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:10.619> metal

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
that the low beam creates and the metal

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.390 
that the low beam creates and the metal
plate<00:02:11.280> blocks<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.569> light<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:13.110> one<00:02:13.500> side<00:02:13.830> but

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
plate blocks the light on one side but

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.539 
plate blocks the light on one side but
in<00:02:14.519> fact<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.209> reversed<00:02:15.959> the<00:02:16.680> metal<00:02:17.010> plate<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
in fact it's reversed the metal plate is

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.660 
in fact it's reversed the metal plate is
on<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> bottom<00:02:18.299> but<00:02:18.840> since<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.320> lens<00:02:19.670> reverse

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
on the bottom but since the lens reverse

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.710 
on the bottom but since the lens reverse
the<00:02:20.880> light<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.480> blocks<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.049> light<00:02:22.079> on<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.769> top

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the light it blocks the light on the top

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.440 
the light it blocks the light on the top
now<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.140> take<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.770> high<00:02:25.980> beam<00:02:26.280> projector<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.210> I

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
now I take the high beam projector and I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.220 
now I take the high beam projector and I
just<00:02:27.690> put<00:02:27.930> cardboard<00:02:28.620> straight<00:02:29.610> shape<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.630> as

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
just put cardboard straight shape and as

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.190 
just put cardboard straight shape and as
you<00:02:31.410> can<00:02:31.530> see<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.880> does<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.450> same

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you can see is that it does the same

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:42.330 
you can see is that it does the same
effect

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.680 

you

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.460 

here<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.470> put<00:02:47.800> triangle<00:02:48.790> shape<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:50.320> can

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
here I put triangle shape and you can

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.180 
here I put triangle shape and you can
see<00:02:50.800> that<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.490> shape<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.300> reversed<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.800> the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
see that the shape is reversed so the

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.870 
see that the shape is reversed so the
manufacturers<00:02:54.940> try<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.930> get<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.740> best<00:02:57.460> shape

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
manufacturers try to get the best shape

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.320 
manufacturers try to get the best shape
and<00:02:58.380> angles<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.980> distance<00:03:00.610> from<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.150> light

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
and angles and distance from the light

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.680 
and angles and distance from the light
and<00:03:01.600> it's<00:03:02.200> mostly<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:03.160> plate<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.390> makes

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
and it's mostly this plate that makes

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.960 
and it's mostly this plate that makes
