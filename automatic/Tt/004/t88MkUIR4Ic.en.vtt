00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.190
 yes people welcome today 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.360
 I want to show you how you like the engine 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.300
 from your rtk even in cold weather 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.639
 I could also get mine 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.420
 the problem that just as correct 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.250
 cold when it has started 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.949
 and here I have tried and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.039
 the first method so there are two 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.109
 methods that we now present so 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.240
 At the moment we have so much degrees out there 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.120
 nothing klinsmann has top left neckar 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.219
 on 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.700
 and then i hope that through this 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.570
 small video helps and then a lot of fun 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.809
 with the methods so at first 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:52.170
 Method you need the air filter 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:57.180
 lose weight and then you take your expensive ones 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:01.910
 sprit and feel very carefully what is there 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:08.000
 purely when that is a bit full 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.250
 then he pulls me to it that rises 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.220
 and then he should actually 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.439
 jump on and if not come then 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.259
 We also go to the second method and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.380
 I'll show you a lot of fun like this 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.409
 and for the second and last method 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:30.030
 you just need a feeling and 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.560
 So keep the max motor off 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.829
 I make it a little bit true on all sides 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.829
 just 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.710
 So I did a little bit now 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.770
 always it 's natural to do it 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.290
 So it was really hot then put 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.340
 take the simple glow plugs your 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.280
 plug does not make him anything at the moment 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.500
 helps yes then something is broken 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.760
 say happy because when his name is 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.480
 actually jumps right 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.340
 easy on but actually would have the 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.750
 already bring the first method because 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.170
 at least with me and then a lot 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.660
 fun 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.380
 hopefully it will work for you now 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.920
 worked in any case and then until the 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.920
 next video
