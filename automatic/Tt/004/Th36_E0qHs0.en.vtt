00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
family is full of nerds I think me and

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.480 
family is full of nerds I think me and
my<00:04:45.140> brother<00:04:45.320> Harlan<00:04:45.830> might<00:04:46.010> be<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.250> least

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
my brother Harlan might be the least

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.490 
my brother Harlan might be the least
nerdy<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.270> think<00:04:47.660> Harlan<00:04:47.990> is<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.200> least<00:04:48.380> a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
nerdy I think Harlan is the least a

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.960 
nerdy I think Harlan is the least a
nerdy<00:04:48.680> at<00:04:48.830> this<00:04:48.950> point<00:04:49.190> because<00:04:49.640> he's<00:04:49.850> an

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
nerdy at this point because he's an

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.930 
nerdy at this point because he's an
electrician<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:51.130> not<00:04:52.130> nerdy<00:04:52.490> at<00:04:52.580> all

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
electrician and not nerdy at all

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.060 
electrician and not nerdy at all
compared<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:54.260> rest<00:04:54.289> of<00:04:54.530> us<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.710> guess<00:04:54.919> the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
compared to the rest of us I guess the

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.440 
compared to the rest of us I guess the
electrician<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:55.669> kind<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:55.910> nerdy<00:04:56.150> and<00:04:56.240> he<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.419> a

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
electrician is kind of nerdy and he is a

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.290 
electrician is kind of nerdy and he is a
Linux<00:04:56.810> kid<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:58.190> guess<00:04:58.910> that's<00:04:59.030> kind<00:04:59.120> of

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
Linux kid so I guess that's kind of

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.380 
Linux kid so I guess that's kind of
nerdy<00:05:00.370> but<00:05:01.370> yeah<00:05:01.520> this<00:05:01.640> is<00:05:01.700> my<00:05:01.820> good<00:05:02.060> night<00:05:02.240> I

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.150 
I am starting to figure out how to film
when<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.190> Drive<00:05:24.460> because<00:05:25.470> I<00:05:26.470> think<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.980> mount

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
when I Drive because I think the mount

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.440 
when I Drive because I think the mount
that<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.060> put<00:05:28.360> up<00:05:28.630> here<00:05:28.690> is<00:05:29.530> really<00:05:29.860> loud<00:05:30.450> which

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
that I put up here is really loud which

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.200 
that I put up here is really loud which
stinks<00:05:32.020> because<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:33.340> in<00:05:33.520> a<00:05:33.580> good<00:05:33.730> spot<00:05:34.000> I

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
stinks because it's in a good spot I

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.570 
stinks because it's in a good spot I
mean<00:05:34.240> look<00:05:34.540> at<00:05:34.600> that<00:05:34.750> angle<00:05:35.160> look<00:05:36.160> at<00:05:36.310> how<00:05:36.400> much

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
mean look at that angle look at how much

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.140 
mean look at that angle look at how much
you<00:05:36.760> can<00:05:36.880> see<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:37.420> can<00:05:37.720> adjust<00:05:38.020> it<00:05:38.140> with<00:05:38.560> my

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
you can see you can adjust it with my

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.290 
you can see you can adjust it with my
Matt<00:05:40.150> but<00:05:40.900> I<00:05:41.080> put<00:05:41.320> one<00:05:41.470> over<00:05:41.650> here<00:05:41.830> too<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:43.150> I

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
Matt but I put one over here too and I

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.330 
Matt but I put one over here too and I
think<00:05:43.570> this<00:05:44.410> is<00:05:44.590> gonna<00:05:44.740> be<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:45.040> one<00:05:45.130> that<00:05:45.250> I'm

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
think this is gonna be the one that I'm

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.890 
think this is gonna be the one that I'm
gonna<00:05:45.430> have<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.700> use<00:05:45.730> I<00:05:46.060> think<00:05:46.090> I<00:05:46.360> might<00:05:46.540> end<00:05:46.750> up

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
gonna have to use I think I might end up

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.220 
gonna have to use I think I might end up
buying<00:05:47.080> one<00:05:47.350> that<00:05:47.830> lets<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.490> swivel<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:50.050> that

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
buying one that lets you swivel so that

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.010 
buying one that lets you swivel so that
I<00:05:50.260> can<00:05:50.530> like<00:05:50.770> lean<00:05:51.550> on<00:05:52.419> the<00:05:52.540> steering<00:05:52.840> wheel<00:05:52.990> a

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
I can like lean on the steering wheel a

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.250 
I can like lean on the steering wheel a
little<00:05:53.140> bit<00:05:53.380> and<00:05:53.470> swivel<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:54.430> I<00:05:54.780> think<00:05:55.780> that's

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
little bit and swivel it I think that's

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.439 
little bit and swivel it I think that's
what's<00:05:56.500> gonna<00:05:56.590> have<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:56.830> happen
