 although the frozen meals of the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.790
 Gaming kitchen are not exactly homemade 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.130
 they are made from scratch as well as their 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.710
 manufacturing chain every time 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.809
 begins a series of some of his 150 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.090
 Frozen meals from pizzas to 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 cakes this santa rosa factory 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.859
 california restructures its chain of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.019
 manufacture according to the menu plate 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.019
 today burritos in quantity 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.699
 in eight hours they will produce 60,000 burritos 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.329
 and talking about fast food 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.329
 It's time to start cooking the beans 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:52.519
 well to clean them place 550 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.530
 kilograms of beans on a ribbon a 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:01:01.250
 vibrator table to discard dirt and 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:04.299
 stones are then submerged in water to 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.299
 speed up your cooking 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.180
 next a full giant colander 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.040
 of these beans is immersed in a 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.310
 huge pressure cooker that quickly 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.170
 takes heat the lid is sealed and by 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.530
 it the water reaches a temperature 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.160
 higher than boiling almost 120 degrees 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.160
 centigrade 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.500
 the beans take only 40 minutes in 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.420
 cook instead of two and a half hours 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.650
 they are quickly passed through ice water 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.650
 to stop cooking 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.110
 and prevent them from falling apart 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.250
 at the same time large quantities are cooked 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.500
 of rice but not completely 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.540
 it is removed from the heat before finishing 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.860
 cooking for the burrito to cook 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.860
 in the microwave of homes 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.360
 while in the cheese sector rayan 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.540
 150 kilograms of cheddar and monterrey 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.540
 jac 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.820
 that's a million calories 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.269
 and that is a burrito without sauce the recipe 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:24.080
 de amy takes a lot of oil 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:26.530
 pepper and onion spices and sauce 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.530
 tomato 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.980
 When the sauce is ready, it goes to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.769
 a giant mixer 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.340
 and it will be the base of four thousand kilograms 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.340
 filling 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.690
 a very useful tool in the kitchen is 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.590
 the elevator that adds to the sauce some 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.590
 450 kilograms of rice 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:00.170
 then the grated cheese 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.170
 and 550 kilograms of cooked beans 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.650
 and the stuffing is ready for the chain 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.220
 of elaboration but first they must 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.480
 make the tortillas for it use 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.650
 a giant mixer 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.700
 with salt and oil flour for 250 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.700
 kilograms of dough 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.989
 This machine produces hundreds of balls 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.470
 mass with the right size for a 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.470
 tortilla 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.530
 ah 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.920
 and then add a little more flour 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.840
 to remove the stickiness from the dough and 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.260
 you can better go through the machine 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.260
 kneading 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.680
 This machine stretches the dough twice 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.400
 and the staff stretches it once again to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.400
 give it the home touch 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.150
 the tortillas are cooked in the oven 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.150
 for less than a minute 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.389
 and it was time to make the burritos 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.050
 each tortilla carries a portion of 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.050
 filling 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.850
 I assure you that you know better than you 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.850
 go 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.560
 machines do a lot but do not bend 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.389
 a burrito to perfection so that 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.639
 the staff takes care of it and every 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.710
 one doubles 10 burritos per minute during 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.900
 4 hours 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.940
 are two prepare enough to 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.570
 feed a whole hungry stadium 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.570
 from the super bowl 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.550
 after hours at the factory these 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.070
 burritos are ready to leave 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:18.440
 but not without spending about 45 minutes before 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.440
 at 40 degrees centigrade below zero 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.820
 they are finally ready to be 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.770
 wrapped packaged and delivered to 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.290
 when I started working here six years ago 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.200
 years and a half the burritos are 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.600
 they packaged by hand over time 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.090
 we realized that some processes are 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.310
 more safe and effective if you perform them 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.350
 a machine 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.680
 know he was not able before he had to 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.840
 take it place it wrap it and do it 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.890
 with thousands of rites for 8 hours 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:54.920
 a day the method we use in the 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.220
 Today is much more effective and safe 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:03.100
 for all and the result of the work 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.100
 it's still a well-armed burrito 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:08.400
 today are the burritos tomorrow according to the 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.670
 demand could be pizzas tarts or 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.920
 vegetarian burgers whatever be 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.960
 the food the manufacturing chain of 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.580
 Amy is ready to transform and 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.580
 feed our microwave
