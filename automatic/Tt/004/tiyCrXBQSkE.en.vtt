00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
green black and set and I use this one

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.199 
green black and set and I use this one
probably<00:02:52.049> good<00:02:53.049> 75%<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.190> time<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.430> here

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
probably good 75% of the time and here

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.060 
probably good 75% of the time and here

is the black on black I use that one
probably<00:03:03.400> 25%<00:03:03.820> of<00:03:04.239> time<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.570> as<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> result

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
probably 25% of time and as a result

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.240 
probably 25% of time and as a result
it's<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.290> little<00:03:05.530> better<00:03:05.680> condition<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:08.070> like<00:03:09.070> it

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250

knife razor-sharp I've touched them up a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.600 
knife razor-sharp I've touched them up a
couple<00:03:42.190> times<00:03:42.520> because<00:03:43.030> I<00:03:43.120> use<00:03:43.300> them<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:43.690> often

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
couple times because I use them so often

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.500 
couple times because I use them so often
probably<00:03:45.610> once<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.600> month<00:03:46.810> I'll<00:03:47.020> touch<00:03:47.200> them<00:03:47.350> up

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
they do hold an edge fairly well I use

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.930 
they do hold an edge fairly well I use
them<00:03:51.730> probably<00:03:52.270> harder<00:03:52.660> than<00:03:52.840> their<00:03:52.990> intended

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940

got them from not just knives or your

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.990 
got them from not just knives or your
corner<00:05:15.820> store<00:05:16.030> calm<00:05:17.460> but<00:05:18.460> they<00:05:18.610> were<00:05:18.669> in<00:05:18.880> the

about<00:05:22.090> 50<00:05:22.660> so<00:05:22.960> that<00:05:23.590> was<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.710> pretty<00:05:23.890> good<00:05:24.100> deal
