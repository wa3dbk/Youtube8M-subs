00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.180
 Silver your choice to not 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.910

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.980
 Christmas if our tableware is 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.310
 white or another whole color not with 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.050

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.990
 All we have brought is LEDs 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.420
 for energy saving and to avoid 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.760
 avoid setbacks not because this does not 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.100
 they get very hot if they are the jalan 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.730
 a lot of light a lot of light and they are very good 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.350
 the basics this christmas is the tree 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 We here have the girls 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.830
 specialists assembling trees for this 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.800
 we use the lights first before 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.780
 decorate the tree what we do is 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.660
 decorate it first with the lights and 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.850
 we choose what colors of lights we are going to 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.440
 use according to the trend we're going 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.420
 to decorate our tree not if our 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.270
 trend is a traditional trend 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.400
 we can use the multicolor we can use

 the blue also the fuchsia 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.980
 the tip is that we put the lights 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.739
 set so that no space is us 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.629
