00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
free one so let's check out its moveset

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
free one so let's check out its moveset
okay<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:37.890> diamond<00:01:38.310> store<00:01:38.490> moonblast

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
okay this diamond store moonblast

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.330 
okay this diamond store moonblast
dazzling<00:01:39.840> gleam<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.350> protect<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.979> comes<00:01:41.159> with

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
dazzling gleam and protect it comes with

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.950 
dazzling gleam and protect it comes with
diamond<00:01:41.670> storm<00:01:41.880> which<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> signature<00:01:42.630> move

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
diamond storm which is a signature move

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.109 
diamond storm which is a signature move
and<00:01:43.250> diamonds<00:01:44.250> formats<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.579> fifty<00:01:44.880> percent

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and diamonds formats a fifty percent

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.730 
and diamonds formats a fifty percent
chance<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.540> raising<00:01:45.780> your<00:01:46.049> defense<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.560> hit

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
chance of raising your defense if it hit

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.130 
chance of raising your defense if it hit
so<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.130> very<00:01:47.159> nice<00:01:47.700> move<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.270> comes<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
so it's a very nice move it comes the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.630 
so it's a very nice move it comes the
classic<00:01:49.619> ripple<00:01:49.890> which<00:01:50.009> prevents<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> from

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
classic ripple which prevents it from

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.240 
classic ripple which prevents it from
being<00:01:50.820> traded<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.329> GTS<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.250> random

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
being traded on the GTS and random

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.179 
being traded on the GTS and random
nature<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.880> three<00:01:54.600> perfect<00:01:55.049> ivs<00:01:55.500> at<00:01:55.890> least

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
nature and three perfect ivs at least

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.649 
nature and three perfect ivs at least
three<00:01:56.399> perfect<00:01:56.790> ivs<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
three perfect ivs so if you want to

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.209 
three perfect ivs so if you want to
solve<00:01:57.810> for<00:01:58.020> set<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> good<00:01:58.560> diancie<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
solve for set for a good diancie it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.920 
solve for set for a good diancie it
should<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.790> pretty<00:01:59.969> easy<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.360> do<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.750> because

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
should be pretty easy to do so because

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
should be pretty easy to do so because
you're<00:02:01.229> guaranteed<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.920> three<00:02:02.310> perfect

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you're guaranteed to get three perfect

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.240 
you're guaranteed to get three perfect
ivs<00:02:02.969> every<00:02:03.450> single<00:02:03.750> time<00:02:03.899> if<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.950> is<00:02:05.130> your

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
