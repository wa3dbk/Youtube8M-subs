00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.250 
doesn't really bet out too much and he
has<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> moderate<00:03:38.820> aggression<00:03:39.360> factor<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:40.049> I

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
has a moderate aggression factor so I

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.650 
has a moderate aggression factor so I
only<00:03:40.769> have<00:03:41.010> second<00:03:41.430> pair<00:03:41.610> here<00:03:41.940> with<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> decent

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
only have second pair here with a decent

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.020 
only have second pair here with a decent
kicker<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:43.440> think<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.489> fold<00:03:44.790> because

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
kicker I think this is a fold because

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.360 
kicker I think this is a fold because
the<00:03:45.329> pot<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.780> small<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.350> don't<00:03:47.010> have<00:03:47.190> much

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
the pot is small I don't have much

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.400 
the pot is small I don't have much
invested<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.120> there<00:03:48.510> are<00:03:48.630> other<00:03:48.720> players<00:03:49.110> to

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
invested and there are other players to

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.590 
invested and there are other players to
act<00:03:49.560> behind<00:03:49.950> me<00:03:50.130> that's<00:03:50.579> also<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:51.060> pretty<00:03:51.269> solid

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
act behind me that's also a pretty solid

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.110 
act behind me that's also a pretty solid
bet<00:03:52.079> to<00:03:52.290> make<00:03:52.470> against<00:03:52.980> multiple<00:03:53.430> players<00:03:53.730> so

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
bet to make against multiple players so

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.350 
bet to make against multiple players so
easy<00:03:54.870> fold<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.470> think<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:56.010> made<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.760> call<00:03:57.030> here<00:03:57.269> in

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
easy fold I think I made a call here in

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.759 
easy fold I think I made a call here in
late<00:03:57.510> position<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.110> was<00:03:58.200> hoping<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.739> a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
late position and was hoping to see a

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.670 
late position and was hoping to see a
flop<00:03:59.160> for<00:03:59.459> cheap<00:03:59.730> but<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.180> got<00:04:00.540> re-raise<00:04:01.019> all<00:04:01.320> in

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
flop for cheap but I got re-raise all in

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
flop for cheap but I got re-raise all in
from<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.130> blinds

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
from the blinds

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.000 
from the blinds
you<00:04:03.360> know<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.780> player<00:04:04.110> might<00:04:04.380> be<00:04:04.530> kind<00:04:04.920> of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
you know this player might be kind of

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.580 
you know this player might be kind of
aggressive<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.910> at<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> 15<00:04:06.690> that's<00:04:07.079> not<00:04:07.320> high

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
aggressive but at a 15 that's not high

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.650 
aggressive but at a 15 that's not high
enough<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.950> think<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.340> my<00:04:08.579> ace<00:04:08.760> jack<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.359> best

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
enough to think that my ace jack is best

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.900 
enough to think that my ace jack is best
here<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.200> that's<00:04:10.650> just<00:04:10.709> way<00:04:11.190> too<00:04:11.250> big<00:04:11.700> of<00:04:11.820> a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
here and that's just way too big of a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.240 
here and that's just way too big of a
bet<00:04:12.150> phrase<00:04:12.510> jack<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.079> I'm<00:04:13.440> rather<00:04:13.920> much

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
bet phrase jack so I'm rather much

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.940 
bet phrase jack so I'm rather much
always<00:04:14.519> behind<00:04:15.239> here<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:15.720> based<00:04:16.289> on<00:04:16.440> poor<00:04:16.680> win

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
always behind here and based on poor win

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.640 
always behind here and based on poor win
odds<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.489> weak<00:04:18.090> pot<00:04:18.419> odds<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.989> think<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.500> is

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
odds and weak pot odds I think this is

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.310 
odds and weak pot odds I think this is
an<00:04:19.739> easy<00:04:19.829> fold<00:04:20.250> as<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:21.330> can<00:04:21.479> see<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.930> would<00:04:22.289> have

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
an easy fold as you can see I would have

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.160 
an easy fold as you can see I would have
been<00:04:22.530> running<00:04:22.800> behind<00:04:23.130> two<00:04:23.400> hands<00:04:23.880> here

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
been running behind two hands here

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.010 
been running behind two hands here
