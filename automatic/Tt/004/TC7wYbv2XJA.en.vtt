 talk about gtx it comes with gpu buccina that 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.970
 it increases the clock according to 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.550
 game demand adaptive vertical sync 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.800
 which is a new method of synchronization 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.140
 vertical nor well adaptive lookout, so he 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.709
 is adapting and as it did nvidia 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.170

 in the olympic had connectors directx 11 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.470
 with directx I trust 5.0 physical support 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.920
 nvidia cuda technology pci express 2.0 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.090

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.690
 power that is the 6-pin 26 only one 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.080

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.310
 cd I will not use it 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:54.340
 since caramba felipe nor used a 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:05:02.200
 practically zero and here comes a 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:06.419
 tape stuck enthusiasm of the night 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.419
 This is the user manual. 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.430
 Caracas is a poster of our lady. 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.600
 the size of the gigantic post here 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.370
 When you have in the room, he goes to 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.500
 wall 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.310
 Let's sign that I think they're there. 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.300
 in a hurry a file the 8 connector 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.510
 pins 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.180
 this is neither an extender nor opened 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.340
 also eight pins and I put two more 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.030
 and six pins here to connect the source 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:49.570
 she already has then come here also the 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:53.210
 rgb tv adapter and one connector 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.560
 molex adapter for six boys 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.910
 children, then this problem in the 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:00.020
 video card and these two you 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:03.200
 connect a brat from your source 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.620
 I'm going to a gang here like 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.620
 open it there 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:17.810
 the crazy thing our lady looks at here 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.690
 People bomb law good looks the 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.960
 connectors is where six pins 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.910
 and one of 8 pins she will spend more 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.100
 power with the silver video card is 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.870
 easy to overclock as 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.740
 I do not overclock this board 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.810
 video of am 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.610
 I think so unnecessary to me in 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.350
 It will serve so spare'll do 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.090
 overclock i will not try 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.710
 so the question the connectors to make 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.120
 This is it, if you will use four 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.730
 academics and will use these two 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.800
 connectors for alencar and the two plates 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.840
 I 'll only use one video 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.200
 well we have here a rubber of 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:57.830
 protection being a white one a black to 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:01.580
 set eutv and e dvd and here we 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.650
 we have the display port and the hdm are four 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:08.710
 connectors making it impossible to use 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:12.980
 four monitors for the board is beautiful is 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:15.310
 and we're going to use two 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:19.040
 Video cards now on this machine 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.050
 mine that I'm using neither has 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.540
 dust I do not even think she used it 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.669
 A lot and that's it guys I hope 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.290
 You liked it and I'm very happy. 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:28.920
 Can you expect a review of her that will 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.020
 I'm going out and try to do it 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:35.040
