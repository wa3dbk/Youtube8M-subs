which is CD 760 I'm not sure but it may

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.360 
which is CD 760 I'm not sure but it may
be<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> hexa<00:00:33.540> core<00:00:33.750> GPU<00:00:34.070> just<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
be a hexa core GPU just like the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
be a hexa core GPU just like the
previous<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.079> see<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> a

the graphics are on the default which

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.360 
the graphics are on the default which
are<00:01:37.610> high<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:40.490> let's<00:01:41.490> see<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:43.370> extremely

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
octa-core variant is no force because

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.950 
octa-core variant is no force because
I'm<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:08.100> to<00:02:08.190> get<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.490> Nexus<00:02:08.760> 6<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.690> nexus

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.760 
the octa-core nor for I'm not sure about
these<00:03:28.660> neighboring<00:03:29.020> 805<00:03:30.150> but<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.510> can<00:03:32.440> assume

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
these neighboring 805 but I can assume

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.020 
these neighboring 805 but I can assume
that<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:35.260> octopod<00:03:35.740> will<00:03:35.920> run<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.370> just

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
that that the octopod will run it just

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.430 
that that the octopod will run it just
fine

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
fine

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.350 
fine
snap<00:03:38.890> again<00:03:39.010> fine<00:03:39.280> we'll<00:03:39.580> run<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.940> just<00:03:39.970> fine

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
snap again fine we'll run it just fine

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.820 
snap again fine we'll run it just fine
but<00:03:41.170> this<00:03:41.440> one<00:03:41.650> here<00:03:42.040> is<00:03:42.280> extremely<00:03:42.910> good

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
but this one here is extremely good

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.420 
but this one here is extremely good
full-fledged<00:03:44.830> optimized<00:03:45.990> GT<00:03:46.990> Center<00:03:47.380> yes<00:03:50.430> I'm

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
full-fledged optimized GT Center yes I'm

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.940 
full-fledged optimized GT Center yes I'm
thinking<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.780> know<00:03:52.900> make<00:03:53.200> note<00:03:53.440> for<00:03:53.739> my

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
thinking to you know make note for my

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:16.180 
thinking to you know make note for my
main<00:03:54.130> phone<00:03:54.430> because<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.060> extremely<00:03:55.890> good

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.360 

you<00:04:16.790> can<00:04:16.940> see<00:04:17.180> if<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:17.690> gain<00:04:17.959> some<00:04:18.230> speeds<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
you can see if I gain some speeds the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.740 
you can see if I gain some speeds the
frame<00:04:19.610> rate<00:04:19.790> still<00:04:20.090> remains<00:04:21.280> normal<00:04:22.480> so<00:04:23.480> the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
frame rate still remains normal so the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.840 
frame rate still remains normal so the
note<00:04:23.930> 4<00:04:24.140> is<00:04:24.260> not<00:04:24.410> rooted<00:04:24.770> so<00:04:25.130> I<00:04:25.160> can't<00:04:25.520> show<00:04:25.640> you

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
note 4 is not rooted so I can't show you

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.850 
note 4 is not rooted so I can't show you
the<00:04:26.030> FPS<00:04:26.660> but<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.550> can<00:04:28.550> say<00:04:28.970> that<00:04:29.270> it<00:04:29.390> is

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
the FPS but I can say that it is

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.660 
the FPS but I can say that it is
constant<00:04:30.860> at<00:04:30.950> 45<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.760> above<00:04:31.820> 45<00:04:32.420> to<00:04:32.900> 60<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:34.040> 55

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
constant at 45 and above 45 to 60 to 55

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.980 
constant at 45 and above 45 to 60 to 55
and<00:04:38.530> so<00:04:39.530> very<00:04:39.800> smooth<00:04:40.130> performance<00:04:40.750> here<00:04:41.750> on

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
and so very smooth performance here on

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.740 
and so very smooth performance here on
the<00:04:42.230> note<00:04:42.380> for<00:04:42.790> the<00:04:43.790> octa-core<00:04:44.150> nor<00:04:44.450> for

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
the note for the octa-core nor for

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.840 
the note for the octa-core nor for
tedious<00:04:45.350> areas<00:04:45.740> for<00:04:46.010> so<00:04:46.130> gain<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:46.520> if<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:46.700> want

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
tedious areas for so gain so if you want

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.540 
tedious areas for so gain so if you want
to<00:04:46.970> have<00:04:47.660> some<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.500> know<00:04:48.530> game<00:04:48.950> of<00:04:49.100> quest<00:04:49.400> you

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
to have some you know game of quest you

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.520 
to have some you know game of quest you
