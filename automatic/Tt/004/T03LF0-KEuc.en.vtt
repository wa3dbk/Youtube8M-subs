00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.620
 Many people confuse the terms cement and concrete 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.450
 the cement is a gray powder 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.319
 which is used to make concrete 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.509
 It is also an ingredient of the mortar used to place bricks 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.080
 It is also used to pave roads build dams or coat 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.419
 reservoirs 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.419
 let's see this work material 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.560
 the process starts in the limestone quarry 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.140
 limestone that is near the surface has a high content of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.360
 silica and roc and aluminum oxide 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.710
 deeper 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.090
 the limestone is more pure contain less of those minerals and more carbonate 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.130
 of calcium 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.170
 In this factory both types of rock are used varying the proportions for 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.590
 make different types of cement 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.309
 the operators drill the rock wall and place explosives in the holes 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.550
 for security reasons 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.329
 Operators must stand behind the area they are flying keeping 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.050
 a distance of at least 50 meters 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.050
 two 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.840
 after the explosion the blades come into action 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.200
 load the rocks in dumps with a capacity of 50 tons 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.520
 then they carry their cargo to the nearby cement plant 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.460
 in the plant the dump trucks empty the rocks in what is called shredder 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.290
 primary 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.100
 The primary crusher reduces it to the approximate size of tennis balls 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.850
 a constant stream of water prevents dust from accumulating and depositing on 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.850
 hoppers 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.790
 two 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.960
 from there a conveyor belt carries the rocks to a 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.220
 secondary crusher that the reduction size of goal balls 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:17.169
 the rocks rich in calcium carbonate and the low carbon act are crushed 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 separately 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.499
 now is the time to mix both the proportion varies according to the type of 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:28.329
 cement that is made 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.579
 this machine called triple makes lots of the required proportions 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.449
 this is called pure mixture 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.059
 then a recuperator loads the mixture in a machine called 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:44.059
 roller crusher 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.829
 depending on the minerals present naturally in the crushed rock the 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.119
 Factory adds minerals is like silica 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:53.819
 and a rÃºa 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.819
 Certain types of cement also require aluminum oxide 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.609
 the roller mixes and shreds the ingredients evenly producing 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.859
 a dry rock powder that they call raw food 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.369
 that powder passes a preheater 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:12.569
 the temperature of the powder is 80 degrees before entering 40 seconds these 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.979
 ten times hotter 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:19.229
 thus begins the process of joining the minerals that will later harden 

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:21.059
 when they hydrate with water 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:24.459
 the preheater a is equipped with a fast calcination 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.379
 in about five seconds it removes 95% of the carbon dioxide from the powder 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.339
 through a chemical reaction 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:32.680
 this to isla lime 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.170
 which is the most important element of cement 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.640
 the dust passes a rotary kiln a huge cylindrical furnace that moves it from 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.629
 up and down 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.060
 the oven rotates about two revolutions per minute to ensure that the material 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.779
 travel at the right speed 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:52.139
 the gas flame of the burner that is in the background burns at a thousand 700 degrees 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.509
 centigrade 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.379
 when the dust that approaches the reaches the thousand 500 degrees merge 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.379
 pieces like marbles that are called critical 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:07.359
 When the clinker leaves the oven, large fans cool it down 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.659
 a temperature of 60 degrees it is important to cool the cinca quickly 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.150
 to obtain quality cement from there, the clinker passes to the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
 storage 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.940
 The final step in the manufacture of cement is the final crushing 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:33.839
 gypsum is added to the client the precise amount varies according to the type of cement 

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.069
 that is manufactured 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.860
 plaster delays the time it takes cement to set so you can 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.669
 work up to two hours before it hardens 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.030
 cement roller mills are called ball mills 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.950
 because they contain metal balls about 150 tons in the largest mills 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.010
 As the roller rotates the balls crush and crush the clinker and 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.189
 plaster to create a fine powder 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:58.750
 So cement is not a hard job
