00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.850
 hello friends in touch Anatoly 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:17.640
 Gopnik and today I want to offer you 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:22.660
 install a deck at home in the garden 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.450
 why now I will explain if you remember 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.070
 antiquity then the measure was just dickie 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.050
 he did not flow at all his density 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.619
 much higher than usual this honey is very 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.779
 is useful 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.180
 is it real than demet with time 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.489
 our great-grandfathers decided to turn everything for 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.160
 this made a deck by analogy nest 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.030
 bee so as not to disturb the natural 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.640
 natural process 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.220
 mid of the deck has a particularly unique 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.050
 that is not a subtle aroma and taste of such a world 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:52.090
 rich in fructose and glucose 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.070
 has a lot of power 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.960
 trace elements and vitamins hormones 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.690
 minerals enzymes pollen 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.720
 which contains 20 kinds of different 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.700
 amino acids amino acids in the deck all 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.590
 the process of collecting honey bees adjusted 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.180
 as well as in the nest and man there 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.789
 not to interfere in what does not need all 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.109
 works itself this way in the apiary 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.389
 only bees are working beekeeper resting 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.270
 although on the contrary the person is actively 

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:24.969
 It affects the bee me this framework for empty 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.609
 produce pumping honey although he often 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.850
 not yet called after each visit 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.039
 hives bees experience hatch daytime stress 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.109
 only on the fourth day are they again 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.899
 start rebuilding their 100 fill 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.240
 their nectar and in August beekeepers in general 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.590
 pump out the main reserves of honey on 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.899
 loan sale winter stock of bees 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.860
 of course bees come 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.740
 sting 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.490
 and often after being taken from them 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.520
 this honey they die from the deck presses 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.140
 is not taken in August only on 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.480
 next year in May when it settles 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.250
 warm weather will appear honey plant then and 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.650
 the bees don't sting they give themselves 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.600
 voluntarily and I'm sorry, and here it is 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.330
 real honey medical to put it mildly 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.340
 knitting needles as experts say honey from 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.650
 hives for food and honey from the deck for 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.740
 treatment as the process of collecting 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.630
 honey first bees bring honey 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.959
 its nectar courtyard lays it in 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.060
 100 at this time young bees are gaining and 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.110
 Sotnik Taraz bicky shift others 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.630
 honeycomb at night bees from nectar evaporate 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.270
 the water is so concentrated 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.100
 nectar for whom his bees again 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.100
 shift another cell and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.000
 sealed but that's not honey 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.520
 it is necessary that he call and and pass 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.030
 nectar conversion honey minimal 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.550
 excerpt 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.160
 in these sealed acres there should be no 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.170
 less than two months and even better after 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.200
 strong frosts in January 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.360
 real honey our case honeycomb 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.360
 withdrawn in spring fully sealed 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.170
 sustained and hence the high quality of honey 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.230
 honey stocks 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
 easily accessible and day withdrawals possible 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.130
 pussies of the sea and protective nets 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.130
 how to make a deck 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.170
 a deck is made of deciduous 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.390
 wood can can a craftswoman from boards 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.690
 bad hardwoods or doing 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.950
 hardwood double wall 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.380
 deciduous tree must be kept clean 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.250
 diameter not less than 40 centimeters long 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:41.880
 120 meters for this fit beech a 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:44.110
 heavily birch and others inside the deck 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.910
 you need to round the corners for this 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.460
 set the river of triangular section 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.010
 inside corner along the entire length because it 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.620
 real round nest and so 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.270
 You received 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.430
 strong reliable housing for bees 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.010
 wall thickness should be if for 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.420
 latitude nets about 4 centimeters for 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.420
 Moscow 6 and for Siberia at least 10 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.460
 the best deck to attach higher 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.160
 for the bees make their nests higher there and 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.230
 air listens and winter is easier 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.600
 above the deck must be 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.640
 canopy from the sun and rain to our deck 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.510
 need to be insulated can be straw 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.120
 lay in the winter and especially in the summer should 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.770
 be good ventilation remember inside 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.040
 the deck must be dry 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.690
 bees do not like dampness attached deck 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.790
 on supports at an angle of 30 degrees 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.470
 horizon height from the ground not less than 20 30 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.310
 centimeters it is necessary for good 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.350
 ventilation mode for the whole and lower 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.390
 base to install the covers 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.430
 the top cover is generally needed 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.070
 only once when else will you be when 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.930
 the deck will be populated and the bottom cover 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.490
 I advise you to make you well articulated so 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.620
 how it will open at you not one 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.750
 times through the bottom cover you will 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.000
 pick up your honey 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.030
 Of course everything should be hermetically sealed yes 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.950
 bottom cover preferably inside 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.520
 set matter otherwise bees 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:13.740
 sealed her honeycomb deck installed 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.990
 it is desirable that at noon I was in the shade 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.880
 and during the day I received as much as possible 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:23.900
 more light and better under the tree and 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.900
 icy necessarily south 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:32.150
 so here inside the deck as we see from 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:37.099
 figure where is the perga where 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.830
 is honey and everything else 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:43.309
 eat next spring you can you 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:47.319
 calmly take your healing honey 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:50.180
 without any problems and its taste will be 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:52.339
 unique because he will be many 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:56.529
 component as well as 100 mm price 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:56.529
 which is three times more than usual
