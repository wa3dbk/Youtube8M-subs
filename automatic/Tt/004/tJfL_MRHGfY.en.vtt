whatever your frame rate is you should

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
whatever your frame rate is you should
double<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.090> shutter<00:01:24.360> speed<00:01:24.450> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
double it to get your shutter speed so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.630 
double it to get your shutter speed so

you<00:01:46.770> could<00:01:46.979> change<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.490> own<00:01:47.640> X<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.090> don't

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
you could change is own X but I don't

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.249 
you could change is own X but I don't
want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.720> want<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.990> change<00:01:49.140> my

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
want to do that I want to change my

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.800 
want to do that I want to change my
aperture<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:51.090> idea<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
aperture now because I have an idea of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.440 
aperture now because I have an idea of
how<00:01:52.290> much<00:01:52.500> should<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:52.950> focus<00:01:53.189> behind<00:01:53.909> me<00:01:54.210> in

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
how much should be in focus behind me in

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.899 
how much should be in focus behind me in
this<00:01:55.200> video<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.340> case<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.759> really

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
this video and in this case it really

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.639 
this video and in this case it really
doesn't<00:01:57.299> need<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.869> focus<00:01:58.140> i'm<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.590> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
doesn't need to be in focus i'm going to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.389 
doesn't need to be in focus i'm going to
open<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.979> up<00:01:59.100> as<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:01.020> know<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.350> fairly<00:02:01.979> wide

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
open it up as you know to a fairly wide

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.249 
open it up as you know to a fairly wide
aperture<00:02:03.149> let's<00:02:03.509> pretend<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.899> i<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
aperture let's pretend that i have the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.999 
aperture let's pretend that i have the
kit<00:02:04.469> lens<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> t4i<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.060> i<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.770> 50<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
kit lens on the t4i and if i was at 50 I

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.119 
kit lens on the t4i and if i was at 50 I
could<00:02:08.610> go<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:09.179> 50<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.979> see

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
could go to about 50 and you can see

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.920 
could go to about 50 and you can see
that<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.400> got<00:02:11.489> a<00:02:11.640> little<00:02:11.940> bit<00:02:12.150> brighter<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
that it got a little bit brighter just a

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.480 
that it got a little bit brighter just a
little<00:02:13.200> bit

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
little bit

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.370 
little bit
now<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:15.060> last<00:02:15.270> setting<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.750> have<00:02:15.870> available<00:02:16.110> to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
now the last setting I have available to

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.290 
now the last setting I have available to
me<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.620> change<00:02:16.710> his<00:02:17.100> is<00:02:17.400> oh<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.820> I'm<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.240> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
me to change his is oh so I'm going to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.910 
me to change his is oh so I'm going to
change<00:02:18.480> my<00:02:18.540> iso<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.230> I'm<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.590> up<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
change my iso and I'm going to go up to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.720 
change my iso and I'm going to go up to
let's<00:02:20.610> jump<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.210> iso<00:02:21.870> 1600<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.550> can

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
let's jump up to iso 1600 and you can

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.010 
let's jump up to iso 1600 and you can
see<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:23.970> that's<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.270> little<00:02:24.480> too<00:02:24.660> bright<00:02:24.810> so

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
see that that's a little too bright so

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.520 
see that that's a little too bright so
I'm<00:02:25.080> going<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> come<00:02:25.470> down<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.710> ISO<00:02:26.580> 800<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
I'm going to come down to ISO 800 and

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.950 
I'm going to come down to ISO 800 and
that<00:02:28.530> looks<00:02:28.710> pretty<00:02:28.860> nice<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.850> first<00:02:30.810> I

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
that looks pretty nice so first I

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.960 
that looks pretty nice so first I
followed<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.440> rule<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:31.710> thumb<00:02:32.070> my<00:02:32.670> shutter

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
followed the rule of thumb my shutter

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.790 
followed the rule of thumb my shutter
speed<00:02:33.030> needed<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.600> be<00:02:33.690> set<00:02:33.960> at<00:02:34.140> twice<00:02:34.590> my

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
speed needed to be set at twice my

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.010 
speed needed to be set at twice my
framerate<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.670> gave<00:02:35.940> me<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:36.330> 50th<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
framerate that gave me one 50th of a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.540 
framerate that gave me one 50th of a
second<00:02:37.410> there's<00:02:37.560> no<00:02:37.740> one<00:02:37.920> there<00:02:38.130> was<00:02:38.250> really

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
second there's no one there was really

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.720 
second there's no one there was really
no<00:02:38.790> thinking<00:02:39.210> they're<00:02:39.390> just<00:02:40.050> did<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.550> next<00:02:41.550> was

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
no thinking they're just did it next was

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.220 
no thinking they're just did it next was
aperture<00:02:42.270> there<00:02:42.510> was<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.690> little<00:02:42.990> bit<00:02:43.110> more

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
aperture there was a little bit more

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.780 
aperture there was a little bit more
thinking<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:43.740> did<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> want<00:02:44.310> stuff<00:02:44.580> in<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
thinking there did I want stuff in the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.640 
thinking there did I want stuff in the
background<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.390> being<00:02:45.630> focused<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.200> didn't

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
background to being focused and I didn't

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.590 
background to being focused and I didn't
really<00:02:46.740> care<00:02:46.860> what<00:02:47.730> focal<00:02:48.090> length<00:02:48.270> was<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
really care what focal length was I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.450 
really care what focal length was I
shooting<00:02:48.960> at<00:02:49.080> how<00:02:49.290> low<00:02:49.680> an<00:02:49.860> aperture<00:02:50.220> could<00:02:50.430> I

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
shooting at how low an aperture could I

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.940 
shooting at how low an aperture could I
go<00:02:50.730> in<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.030> case<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.450> was<00:02:51.510> f5<00:02:51.960> so<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> went<00:02:52.830> as

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
go in this case it was f5 so I went as

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.860 
go in this case it was f5 so I went as
low<00:02:53.190> as<00:02:53.370> i<00:02:53.490> could<00:02:53.550> go<00:02:53.910> cuz<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.210> didn't<00:02:54.600> care<00:02:54.780> if

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
low as i could go cuz I didn't care if

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.240 
low as i could go cuz I didn't care if
things<00:02:55.080> were<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.410> back<00:02:55.560> were<00:02:55.740> in<00:02:55.860> focus

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
things were in the back were in focus

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.830 
things were in the back were in focus
and<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.610> wanted<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> let<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.270> as<00:02:57.390> much<00:02:57.540> light<00:02:57.810> as

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and I wanted to let in as much light as

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.500 
and I wanted to let in as much light as
possible<00:02:57.990> and<00:02:58.620> then<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:59.670> just<00:03:00.150> started<00:03:00.420> to

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
possible and then I just started to

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.320 
possible and then I just started to
increase<00:03:00.780> my<00:03:01.110> iso<00:03:01.650> until<00:03:02.490> I<00:03:02.520> got<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:02.850> something

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
increase my iso until I got to something

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.850 
increase my iso until I got to something
that<00:03:03.450> looked<00:03:03.630> good<00:03:03.780> actually<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.260> jumped<00:03:04.710> up

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
that looked good actually I jumped up

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.230 
that looked good actually I jumped up
decided<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.460> was<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.670> too<00:03:05.790> bright<00:03:06.030> and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
decided that was a little too bright and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.650 
decided that was a little too bright and
came<00:03:06.660> back<00:03:06.690> down<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.320> ISO<00:03:07.710> 800<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.450> how

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
came back down to ISO 800 so that's how

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.770 
came back down to ISO 800 so that's how
I<00:03:09.690> set<00:03:10.080> my<00:03:10.260> exposure<00:03:10.770> for<00:03:11.700> videos<00:03:12.060> every

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
I set my exposure for videos every

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.870 
I set my exposure for videos every
single<00:03:12.960> time<00:03:13.320> I<00:03:13.500> film<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.800> video<00:03:13.890> always<00:03:14.670> start

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
single time I film a video always start

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.970 
single time I film a video always start
at<00:03:14.970> one<00:03:15.090> 50th<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.780> second<00:03:16.170> then<00:03:16.530> adjust<00:03:16.860> my

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
at one 50th of a second then adjust my

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.770 
at one 50th of a second then adjust my
aperture<00:03:17.340> and<00:03:17.580> then<00:03:18.000> adjust<00:03:18.510> my<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:19.350> 0<00:03:19.700> now

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
aperture and then adjust my is 0 now

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.540 
aperture and then adjust my is 0 now
that<00:03:21.780> we<00:03:21.900> covered<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:23.070> talked<00:03:23.340> about

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
that we covered that and I talked about

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.120 
that we covered that and I talked about
that<00:03:23.730> rule<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.150> thumb<00:03:24.420> i<00:03:24.810> will<00:03:25.680> tell<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:25.980> that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
that rule of thumb i will tell you that

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.560 
that rule of thumb i will tell you that
i<00:03:26.160> do<00:03:26.280> know<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.640> some<00:03:27.000> professional

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
i do know of some professional

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.240 
i do know of some professional
videographers<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.380> are<00:03:28.470> moving<00:03:28.860> away<00:03:29.010> from

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
videographers that are moving away from

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.850 
videographers that are moving away from
that<00:03:29.670> careful<00:03:30.209> two<00:03:30.480> times<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:31.140> frame<00:03:31.410> rate<00:03:31.650> I

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
that careful two times the frame rate I

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.940 
that careful two times the frame rate I
too<00:03:32.520> have<00:03:33.330> occasionally<00:03:34.050> allowed<00:03:34.290> my<00:03:34.530> shutter

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
too have occasionally allowed my shutter

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.770 
too have occasionally allowed my shutter
speed<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.250> go<00:03:35.430> above<00:03:35.820> or<00:03:36.060> below<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:36.660> I<00:03:36.690> know

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
speed to go above or below but I know

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.350 
speed to go above or below but I know
some<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.320> vary<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:37.800> widely<00:03:38.100> and<00:03:38.459> we<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.090> it

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
some that vary it widely and we and it

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.380 
some that vary it widely and we and it
is<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.840> don't<00:03:40.830> really<00:03:40.980> notice<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.400> difference<00:03:41.550> so

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
is I don't really notice a difference so

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.690 
is I don't really notice a difference so
you<00:03:42.480> can<00:03:42.930> adjust<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.739> but<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.160> you<00:03:44.340> want<00:03:44.550> to<00:03:44.610> be

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
you can adjust it but if you want to be

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.250 
you can adjust it but if you want to be
a<00:03:44.730> stickler<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.690> want<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:45.930> go<00:03:46.020> by<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
a stickler and you want to go by the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.830 
a stickler and you want to go by the
rule<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.530> thumb<00:03:46.830> that<00:03:47.330> should<00:03:48.330> give<00:03:48.600> you<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
rule of thumb that should give you the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.600 
rule of thumb that should give you the
most<00:03:49.050> cinematic<00:03:49.290> look<00:03:49.709> then<00:03:50.250> your<00:03:50.400> shutter

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
most cinematic look then your shutter

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.030 
most cinematic look then your shutter
speed<00:03:50.700> should<00:03:51.090> be<00:03:51.150> twice<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.870> frame<00:03:52.530> rate<00:03:52.800> and

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
speed should be twice the frame rate and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.940 
speed should be twice the frame rate and
so<00:03:53.700> if<00:03:53.850> you<00:03:53.910> were<00:03:54.030> shooting<00:03:54.510> at<00:03:54.660> 60<00:03:55.650> frames<00:03:55.680> per

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
so if you were shooting at 60 frames per

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.520 
so if you were shooting at 60 frames per
second<00:03:56.400> your<00:03:56.730> shutter<00:03:57.000> speed<00:03:57.060> should<00:03:57.510> be<00:03:57.570> one

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
second your shutter speed should be one

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
second your shutter speed should be one
120th<00:03:59.520> of<00:03:59.760> a<00:04:00.060> second<00:04:00.709> alright<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.280> hope<00:04:02.400> this

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
120th of a second alright so I hope this

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.960 
120th of a second alright so I hope this
was<00:04:02.820> helpful<00:04:03.020> setting<00:04:04.020> your<00:04:04.650> video<00:04:05.220> exposure

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
was helpful setting your video exposure

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.510 
was helpful setting your video exposure
