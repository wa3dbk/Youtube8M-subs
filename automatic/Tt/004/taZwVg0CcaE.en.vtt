00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.359
 Moscow region town of Bronnitsy 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.610
 increased armor strength whose name 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.530
 it is not by chance since 1453 inhabited in 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.890
 village gunsmiths master 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.619
 I make armor and woven chain mail 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.039
 they were called armor nikami 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.470
 and in 1782 in bronze 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.500
 begin to make jewelry 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.449
 decoration and of course spread 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.540
 got chain fishing 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.230
 because the chain is essentially parsed 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.140
 chain mail 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.690
 chains were created for different purposes 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.309
 wearing lapel watches 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.590
 pendants and Christie 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.840
 have an aging villar and from generation to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.640
 a generation passed on the secrets of the ancient 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.770
 craftsmanship 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.020
 let's find out how they work today 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.289
 masters jewelers of the city 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:01.289
 Bronnitsy production begins of course 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.149
 swept away yes not simple but noble 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.909
 silver and gold 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.490
 in front of us is a gold bar weighing in 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.100
 twelve kilograms and 2 ingots i 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.290
 silver 30 kilograms each 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.750
 confess the last time you 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.869
 have seen so much precious metal 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.360
 most of us for the first time a bronnitsky 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.540
 masters treat him like a simple 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.299
 raw materials requiring light to create 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.780
 their exquisite gold bar day 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.470
 placed in a planer and begin 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.470
 chip off 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.840
 gently with a soft brush gold chips 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.690
 sweep into a container now on the scales 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.990
 gold is carefully weighed at all 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.060
 stages of the chain of weight control 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.440
 this is the basis of any jewelry 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.920
 production 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.990
 after weighing the creation begins 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.330
 charge for multicolored gold this 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.640
 made by mixing with silver and 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.780
 other alloying components 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.330
 gold in the plant is made red and yellow 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.850
 white and even green for every taste 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.320
 but despite the color she is strictly 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.140
 complies with the mandatory 585 test 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.050
 now the metal is melted in the granulator 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.470
 and passing through the water takes the form 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.630
 droplets of granules wet granules are placed 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.660
 for 4 hours in a drying cabinet 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.660
 there they dry at 120 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.780
 degrees dried granules fall asleep in 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.299
 continuous casting furnace after 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.330
 passing through the form appears on 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.880
 light gold wire and sent to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.459
 dragging machine passing through 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.010
 machine wire is getting thinner in 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.560
 the diameter in the apparatus is similar to household 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.600
 wire washer wasted 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.660
 in water with the addition of a special 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.360
 solution and carry on u jack for this 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.180
 process applying in furnace protective 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.790
 gas medium annealing target lead 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.430
 fusion to equilibrium 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.280
 swept away the tension and he 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.730
 becomes softer and more pliable 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.519
 after annealing, the wire is drawn again 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.360
 through the wire drawing machine again annealing and 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.459
 so several times before getting the wire 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.040
 required diameter and here it is finally 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.900
 ready to go to the jewelers in the shop 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.180
 build follow up 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.450
 jeweler in the workshop of manual assembly begins 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.640
 creating a chain of holy ki un remains 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.750
 the wire is twisted in a spring 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.120
 foundry 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.420
 with this spring and work happens 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.560
 masters of twigs chickens cut at the links a 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.319
 then from the links 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.590
 the chain is being assembled at the factory 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.799
 weave a variety of roses and ribbons 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 Springer left the rope tying 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.670
 Byzantine and many others 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.329
 they differ not only in technique 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.819
 weaving 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.190
 but also the size and diameter 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.220
 wire if the product which 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.060
 different in color chains 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.129
 from several colors gold is 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.349
 Classic Bronnitsky option on 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:18.430
 collected sorry with fine 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.500
 squirrel brushes put gold solder 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.370
 solder straighten check quality 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.889
 and chains are ready to be sent to the next 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.099
 shop but we still leave them in the process 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.039
 assembly and go to the site of mating where 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:37.280
 chains weave cars this section 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.490
 plant accommodates more stats api knitting 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.199
 machine tools each one strictly 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.110
 specialized he weaves a chain only 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:48.169
 one type and size so it turns out 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.840
 more than 100 models of employee chains 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.360
 factory give some machines the names they 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.389
 descend from chaining which 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.030
 creates a machine for example this one is called 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.840
 grandma from italian mating 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.030
 title but what translates as 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.240
 grandmother and where are the chains that we are 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:10.849
 left in the assembly shop they are already on 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.970
 plot with pads and facets 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:16.520
 first they knock them through 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.220
 the machine there under the action of the press chain 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.889
 take a trial and a certain form 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.560
 become oval or square 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.440
 round or flat time to grant 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.950
 the chain is wound on the machine shaft and when 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.650
 temperature of -20 degrees freeze 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.169
 now she won't move under 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.870
 chisel master and will be perfect for 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.960
 cut on such a machine can be processed 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.510
 immediately up to 3 kilograms of chains but he 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.370
 produces only two-sided cut 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.950
 for a more difficult cut 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.080
 there are machines without freezing 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.470
 drum they are not meant to 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:59.850
 large volume but can create 6 8 and 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:03.210
 even 12 third-party faceting and this machine 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:06.600
 granite circumference such a cut is necessary 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.360
 for example byzantine chain from here 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:12.120
 our openwork products will be sent to 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.810
 final stage mount 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.600
 on this section of the chain we cut to size 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.410
 insert locks owl boxes white way 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.229
 Bronnitsy 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:25.320
 the only jewelry production where 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:28.139
 gold is used even in the lock spring 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:31.080
 on all others put steel 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.390
 spring chain assembled and on it 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.810
 suggestive gloss she sparkles shimmers 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:39.870
 and delight the eye 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.380
 real decoration that will always be 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.380
 in fashion
