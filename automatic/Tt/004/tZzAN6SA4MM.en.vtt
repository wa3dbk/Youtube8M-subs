00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.730

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.180
 long time but no matter now it's 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.919

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.870

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.639

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.070

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.199

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.779
 Lipstick variants therefore remains 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 to make it fit to tarnish a lot of fun ok me 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.710
 I want to finish my face first 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.990
 So I say mine 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.279
 priming on my own 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.019
 concealer and my eyebrows 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 I would like to move in now 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.630
 I use a little bit of browser 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.360
 even in winter actually that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.390
 All year long I have exactly that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.829
 I also have bulbas bouncing primer 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.930
 Back on my blog if you are 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.219
 that would like to see or read and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 I'll just show you how I do that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.770
 order is best so it is such a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.050
 creamy music product and I take 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.809
 such an untypical brush actually 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 this is a real peninsula 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.550
 this is the celebration of 2 years of luxe face 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.420
 with the optimal for it go so pure and 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.939
 I wear because so and crayons or 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.080
 also in pots movements here so on 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.960
 and then I just pull the rest 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.030
 a wheel set free so if i have 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.890
 that so far I'll take a flush 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.590
 I take this from Manhattan 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.270
 The color apricot and I take for it 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.930
 then quite gladly from will technics 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:35.659
 this blaschke bit purely club off 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.659
 and solved it hits here 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.300
 goal is a bit backwards and 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.190
 At that time I was a brother for the face 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.060
 times, and indeed me this loose here 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.350
 powder from chanel you will all 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.240
 products again in the top of the infobox 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.880
 if I find that now 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.410
 here too fast or not said so 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.990
 and that would just mean mine 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.510
 foundation around but also here my 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.040
 concealer so the face is ready 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.100
 now it can go on with the eyes 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 that he is in danger of such a base i have 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.490
 already applied I do one now 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.870
 second base or not just bay 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.970
 but I also use that as color 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.310
 this is here from patrice majors day long 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.680
 lasting in the color kopper 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.530
 gebana view I have everything in one sentence 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.940
 said if I could not 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.050
 in the name brands but I take 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.990
 just the product with mine 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:26.530
 ring finger on and then distribute it on 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.180
 then my whole moving song carries 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.290
 usually a layer on it 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.400
 because I really have a nice intense 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.950
 I would like to have color 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.050
 beloved nas or purple eyeshadow her 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.340
 now see the color if you do not 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.420
 So it's such a reddish brown 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.640
 reddish brown actually son bronx 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.680
 brown and I am also looking 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.570
 So after a job, I'll tell you 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.860
 in any case, and then take it 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.510
 I was such a fluffy brush 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.530
 a little smaller is also one of too 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.350
 jever des petit right here in 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.959
 the crease pure 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.500
 Here I want the eyeshadow bit 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.090
 yes so cats shaped apply that is 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.480
 I quote the corner a bit 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.870
 high then I give the eyeshadow too 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.690
 now under the eye namely one 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.980
 more brushes are still being used 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.720
 a little bit more greasy it happens 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.720
 Little dirty so it was not all that 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.519
 bad and then I paint the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.560
 trim out a bit so I'm here 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.459
 such a soft transition now 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.800
 I want everything a little bit more 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.830
 darker and it was indeed 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.910
 then a dark eyeshadow for us 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.769
 was it is very that there is such a 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.090
 dark brown also from nas I write 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.510
 you the color the infobox I know 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.640
 not by heart now, and I give it 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.100
 then only here so in the back and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.640
 then I give her a little bit more 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.640
 down there 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.620
 so and now again one last time 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.010
 dazzle you can go over it quietly 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.829
 the colors to each other to blind the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.410
 is the color chestnut of lancome and 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.500
 I mean the waterline out of that 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.480
 makes everything even more courageous and so on 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.120
 just like this how should I say 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.870
 the mary kate olsen look that very much 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.760
 like a bit grungy and me like 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.880
 Now take this channel, too 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.670
 so that bit the eyelash wreath above 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.110
 shower along eyelashes and already that 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.550
 finished I still hope this 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.980
 combination that I extend with one 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.350
 mascara take from / extensions of 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.400
 l'oreal and still pays that 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.170
 bun by john whitesell shopping 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.020
 facts never go away so it looks 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.460
 make-up then with fluffy eyelashes 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.350
 makes a lot of course now 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.550
 I take a lipstick and that 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.050
 I think I'm dark 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.880
 decided simply suitable for the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.110
 fall as I think I have too 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.750
 taken I do not you, nor 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.420
 that's from mainhattan 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.900
 extreme lets decide the number 54 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:58.710
 v and it's just such a beautiful deep 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.710
 dark reddish brown 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.740
 That's how it looks with the lipstick 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.110
 Of course you can also use newton ton 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.940
 I find such an insurer so 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.650
 a bright, bright sound also very good 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.840
 I had my video there 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.370
 applied but I find with days with 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.900
 dark lip has nunmal so special 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.460
 especially cordial or I wanted you 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.720
 still the variant I show in the 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.370
 have worn video with a 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.750
 pink lipstick, I think that's 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.250
 actually fits quite well then 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.130
 come the even more eye for retribution 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:35.410
 that's wild of the color just 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:36.639
 peachey really great and that is now 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.460
 current gap I still have here 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.139
 a hair band from zara 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.690
 if you ask yourself but so and yes me 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.520
 I really like that, that's my heart 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.930
 beat for you i hope you have it 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.110
 maybe you are inspired by the look 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.699
 also after lipstick variant wants 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.199
 and I wish you much fun then 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.009
 look and imitate 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.009
 so it is then
