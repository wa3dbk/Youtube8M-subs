00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
hey everybody Bionic dance here so I

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.209 
hey everybody Bionic dance here so I
have<00:00:11.519> kind<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.389> nerdy<00:00:12.900> question<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.950> want<00:00:14.160> to

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
have kind of a nerdy question I want to

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.799 
have kind of a nerdy question I want to
ask<00:00:14.429> I'm<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> middle<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.630> watching

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
ask I'm in the middle of watching

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.689 
ask I'm in the middle of watching
Revenge<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.560> Sith<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.490> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
Revenge of the Sith and I got to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.330 
Revenge of the Sith and I got to
thinking<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:18.390> how<00:00:18.660> lightsabers<00:00:19.619> interact

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
thinking about how lightsabers interact

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.480 
thinking about how lightsabers interact
with<00:00:20.670> blaster<00:00:21.330> bolts<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.289> see<00:00:22.560> cuz<00:00:22.980> what

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
with blaster bolts you see cuz what

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390 
with blaster bolts you see cuz what
happens<00:00:23.939> hey<00:00:24.210> blaster<00:00:25.170> bolt<00:00:25.560> bounces<00:00:26.189> right

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
happens hey blaster bolt bounces right

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.550 
happens hey blaster bolt bounces right
off<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.789> blade<00:00:27.000> right<00:00:27.359> makes<00:00:27.960> perfect<00:00:28.380> sense

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
off the blade right makes perfect sense

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.130 
off the blade right makes perfect sense
so<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:30.000> would<00:00:30.119> happen<00:00:30.179> if<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:32.009> lightsaber

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
so what would happen if a lightsaber

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.330 
so what would happen if a lightsaber
interacted<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.620> bullet<00:00:35.480> okay<00:00:36.480> cuz

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
interacted with a bullet okay cuz

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
interacted with a bullet okay cuz
lightsabers<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.579> frequently<00:00:39.270> cut<00:00:39.719> right

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
lightsabers they frequently cut right

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.860 
lightsabers they frequently cut right
through<00:00:40.079> metal<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.879> remember<00:00:42.570> reading

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
through metal and I remember reading

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.709 
through metal and I remember reading
somewhere<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.550> know<00:00:44.969> where<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.270> wish<00:00:45.539> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
somewhere I don't know where I wish I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
somewhere I don't know where I wish I
could<00:00:45.870> remember<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.559> bugging<00:00:47.190> me

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
could remember where this is bugging me

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.639 
could remember where this is bugging me
but<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.180> remember<00:00:48.690> reading<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.379> blade<00:00:49.620> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
but I remember reading that the blade of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.279 
but I remember reading that the blade of
a<00:00:49.829> lightsaber<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.430> actually<00:00:51.030> microscopic<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
a lightsaber is actually microscopic and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.439 
a lightsaber is actually microscopic and
that<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> reason<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> looks<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> does

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that the reason it looks the way it does

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.540 
that the reason it looks the way it does
is<00:00:54.840> because<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:55.920> really<00:00:56.129> glows

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is because it really really really glows

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.150 
is because it really really really glows
a<00:00:56.579> lot<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.469> don't<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:58.890> that's

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
a lot right now I don't know if that's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
a lot right now I don't know if that's
true<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.879> say<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> can't<00:01:00.390> find

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
true because like I say I can't find

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.029 
true because like I say I can't find
this<00:01:00.899> source<00:01:01.199> anymore<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.800> I've<00:01:01.859> been

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
this source anymore and I've been

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
this source anymore and I've been
through<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.329> Star<00:01:03.600> Wars

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
through like the the Star Wars

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.010 
through like the the Star Wars
encyclopedia<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.240> Wikipedia<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.570> few<00:01:06.869> of

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
encyclopedia and Wikipedia and a few of

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780 
encyclopedia and Wikipedia and a few of
the<00:01:07.110> visual<00:01:07.439> guides<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> stuff<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.310> cannot

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the visual guides and stuff and I cannot

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
the visual guides and stuff and I cannot
find<00:01:09.240> where<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.200> said<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> lightsaber

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
find where it said that the lightsaber

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.890 
find where it said that the lightsaber
blade<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.490> technically<00:01:11.909> microscopic<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
blade is technically microscopic and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.760 
blade is technically microscopic and
that's<00:01:13.020> bugging<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> crap<00:01:13.890> enemy<00:01:14.720> but<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that's bugging the crap enemy but if it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.999 
that's bugging the crap enemy but if it
is<00:01:16.850> microscopic<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.810> Jedi<00:01:19.049> tried<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.680> block

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
is microscopic and a Jedi tried to block

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.440 
is microscopic and a Jedi tried to block
a<00:01:20.960> bullet<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.770> lightsaber<00:01:23.090> well<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> seems

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
a bullet with a lightsaber well it seems

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.390 
a bullet with a lightsaber well it seems
to<00:01:24.570> me<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> bullet<00:01:25.259> would<00:01:25.290> split<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.100> two

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to me that the bullet would split in two

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.999 
to me that the bullet would split in two
and<00:01:26.430> continue<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> target<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.860> know

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and continue on into the target you know

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.210 
and continue on into the target you know
I<00:01:29.340> mean<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.810> wanted<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> kill<00:01:31.320> Jedi<00:01:31.650> screw

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
I mean if you wanted to kill Jedi screw

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.260 
I mean if you wanted to kill Jedi screw
blasters<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> machine<00:01:33.840> gun<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:35.159> even<00:01:35.970> if

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
blasters get a machine gun now even if

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.980 
blasters get a machine gun now even if
it<00:01:36.540> turns<00:01:36.780> out<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.840> lightsaber<00:01:39.840> blade

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it turns out that a a lightsaber blade

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.160 
it turns out that a a lightsaber blade
is<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.470> microscopic<00:01:41.430> well<00:01:42.119> you'd<00:01:42.810> still<00:01:43.140> have

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
is not microscopic well you'd still have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.130 
is not microscopic well you'd still have
to<00:01:43.350> count<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.310> catching<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.850> entirety<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
to count on catching the entirety of a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
to count on catching the entirety of a
bullet<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.829> cannot<00:01:47.310> see<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.270> there's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
bullet which you cannot see and there's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
bullet which you cannot see and there's
traveling<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.960> hell<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.350> lot<00:01:49.530> faster<00:01:49.560> than<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
traveling a hell of a lot faster than a

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.670 
traveling a hell of a lot faster than a
blaster<00:01:50.729> bolt<00:01:50.939> you'd<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.079> count<00:01:52.439> on

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
blaster bolt you'd have to count on

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.230 
blaster bolt you'd have to count on
being<00:01:52.829> able<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.130> catch<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.460> whole<00:01:53.729> thing<00:01:54.090> with

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
being able to catch the whole thing with

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.700 
being able to catch the whole thing with
the<00:01:54.360> blade<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.810> only<00:01:54.930> caught<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.409> half

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the blade if you only caught like half

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
the blade if you only caught like half
of<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.280> still<00:01:56.520> pinwheel<00:01:57.119> into<00:01:57.600> you

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
of it it would still pinwheel into you

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.160 
of it it would still pinwheel into you
on<00:01:57.899> its<00:01:58.110> way<00:01:58.259> through<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.829> momentum<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.210> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
on its way through with momentum so you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
on its way through with momentum so you
know<00:02:01.320> why<00:02:01.619> why<00:02:02.130> did<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.520> use<00:02:02.850> blasters

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
know why why did they use blasters

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.359 
know why why did they use blasters
against<00:02:03.930> Jedi's<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.530> I'm<00:02:04.680> wondering<00:02:05.159> why

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
against Jedi's what I'm wondering why

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.029 
against Jedi's what I'm wondering why
didn't<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.240> use<00:02:06.270> like<00:02:06.960> actual<00:02:07.320> projectiles

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
didn't they use like actual projectiles

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.889 
didn't they use like actual projectiles
it<00:02:08.700> seems<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.149> would<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.420> been<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.599> much

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
it seems like it would have been a much

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.400 
it seems like it would have been a much
better<00:02:10.770> way<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.099> kill<00:02:12.060> off<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.300> Jedi<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:13.170> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
better way to kill off the Jedi if you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.680 
better way to kill off the Jedi if you
were<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.620> war<00:02:13.830> with<00:02:14.100> them<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.390> saying
