yeah this is the front of my Sebring and
cleaned<00:00:03.840> off<00:00:03.990> these<00:00:04.230> lights<00:00:04.500> now<00:00:05.250> what<00:00:05.490> I'm

see<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.360> there<00:00:15.389> maybe<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:15.870> can't<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
see you up there maybe you can't but and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.730 
see you up there maybe you can't but and
it's<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:18.060> there<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:21.230> it<00:00:22.230> right<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.500> there

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
it's up there you see it right up there

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.330 
it's up there you see it right up there
the<00:00:23.330> radar<00:00:24.330> detector<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:24.990> there<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the radar detector up there and the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.220 
the radar detector up there and the
thing<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.730> by<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.000> time<00:00:27.240> laser<00:00:27.570> goes<00:00:27.900> off

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
thing is by the time laser goes off

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.279 
thing is by the time laser goes off
you're<00:00:28.920> screwed<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.240> put<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.689> bra<00:00:31.019> on

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you're screwed now I put this bra on

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.830 
you're screwed now I put this bra on
here<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> while<00:00:31.800> ago<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:33.420> radar

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
here a while ago because it's radar

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.889 
here a while ago because it's radar
deflecting<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:36.450> know<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.870> a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
deflecting and you know if you have a

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.840 
deflecting and you know if you have a
license<00:00:37.440> plate<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> front<00:00:38.309> that's<00:00:38.610> one

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
license plate in the front that's one

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.220 
license plate in the front that's one
thing<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.090> gets<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.660> want<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.079> it

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
thing that gets you you want to have it

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.190 
thing that gets you you want to have it
behind<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.680> screen<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.940> I'll<00:00:42.629> have<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.809> license

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
behind a screen and I'll have a license

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.660 
behind a screen and I'll have a license
plate<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.590> front<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> might<00:00:44.219> coat<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
plate in front but it might coat the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.049 
plate in front but it might coat the
back<00:00:44.879> too<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.989> these<00:00:46.260> guys<00:00:46.789> it<00:00:47.789> really

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
back too now these guys it really

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.690 
back too now these guys it really
wrapped<00:00:48.329> his<00:00:48.539> stuff<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.079> good<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:50.399> came<00:00:50.670> with

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
wrapped his stuff up good this came with

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.510 
wrapped his stuff up good this came with
a<00:00:51.620> few<00:00:52.620> brushes<00:00:53.989> right<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.050> cheap<00:00:56.010> ones<00:00:56.250> but

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
a few brushes right here cheap ones but

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.560 
a few brushes right here cheap ones but
they<00:00:56.670> work<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.120> guess<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:59.120> this<00:01:00.120> was<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.539> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
they work I guess and this was in a

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.789 
they work I guess and this was in a
plastic<00:01:01.440> bag<00:01:02.180> wrapped<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.960> don't<00:01:04.739> know

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
plastic bag wrapped up in I don't know

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.250 
plastic bag wrapped up in I don't know
it's<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.450> paper<00:01:06.450> thing<00:01:06.840> or<00:01:07.020> something

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it's like a paper thing or something

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.399 
it's like a paper thing or something
that's<00:01:07.500> Cushing<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.420> was<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:09.990> his<00:01:10.110> jar

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that's Cushing and was really in his jar

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
that's Cushing and was really in his jar
really<00:01:10.799> tight<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:12.030> like<00:01:12.299> I'd<00:01:12.390> open<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> up

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
really tight and like I'd open it up

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.010 
really tight and like I'd open it up
again<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> I'm<00:01:15.000> gonna<00:01:15.119> paint<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.630> here

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
again so I'm gonna paint it on here

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
I tell you got to do now this thing was

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
I tell you got to do now this thing was
like<00:01:18.990> really<00:01:19.229> bomb<00:01:19.619> proof<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.280> they<00:01:20.460> had

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
like really bomb proof the way they had

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.359 
like really bomb proof the way they had
this<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.030> was<00:01:21.210> surprised<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.990> uh<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.530> got<00:01:23.189> some

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
this I was surprised but uh I got some

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.460 
this I was surprised but uh I got some
pretty<00:01:23.549> thin<00:01:23.820> headlights<00:01:24.330> here<00:01:24.570> itself<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
pretty thin headlights here itself and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.429 
pretty thin headlights here itself and
by<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.680> way<00:01:25.950> he's<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> put<00:01:27.360> them<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.570> one

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
by the way he's got to put them on one

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.999 
by the way he's got to put them on one
even<00:01:28.890> stroke<00:01:30.320> now<00:01:32.030> this<00:01:33.030> stuff<00:01:34.009> actually

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
even stroke now this stuff actually

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
even stroke now this stuff actually
makes<00:01:35.369> your<00:01:35.729> lights<00:01:36.000> slightly<00:01:36.840> tinted<00:01:37.170> but

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
makes your lights slightly tinted but

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.080 
makes your lights slightly tinted but
these<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.009> lights<00:01:38.250> are<00:01:38.430> slightly<00:01:38.759> tinted

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
these are lights are slightly tinted

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.630 
these are lights are slightly tinted
already<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.350> wears<00:01:40.500> off<00:01:40.860> about<00:01:41.250> six

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
already and it wears off about six

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.160 
already and it wears off about six
months<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:44.090> got<00:01:45.090> pretty<00:01:45.240> small<00:01:45.689> headlights

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
months so I got pretty small headlights

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.950 
months so I got pretty small headlights
so<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.829> could<00:01:47.670> put<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:47.970> stuff<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> couple

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
so I could put this stuff on a couple

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.319 
so I could put this stuff on a couple
times<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.399> quick<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.640> easy<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.600> uh<00:01:53.329> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
times but it's quick and easy and uh the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.660 
times but it's quick and easy and uh the
other<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.630> here

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
other one here

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.480 
other one here
semi<00:01:57.670> dark<00:01:57.970> but<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.840> could<00:01:59.020> see<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> reflection

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
semi dark but I could see the reflection

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.030 
semi dark but I could see the reflection
perfectly<00:02:00.490> see<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.880> drips<00:02:01.150> yeah

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
perfectly see the drips yeah

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.560 
perfectly see the drips yeah
takes<00:02:03.970> two<00:02:04.210> seconds<00:02:04.690> to<00:02:04.750> do<00:02:05.760> but<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:07.420> don't

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
takes two seconds to do but you don't

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.750 
takes two seconds to do but you don't
even<00:02:07.660> have<00:02:07.990> two<00:02:08.229> seconds<00:02:08.800> with<00:02:08.920> later<00:02:09.160> right

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
even have two seconds with later right

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.900 
even have two seconds with later right
I'll<00:02:10.000> litter<00:02:10.860> leave<00:02:11.860> litter<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.460> not<00:02:12.640> laser

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
I'll litter leave litter or not laser

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.610 
I'll litter leave litter or not laser
actually<00:02:13.330> but<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.920> type<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.190> radar

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
actually but that type of radar

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.990 
actually but that type of radar
basically<00:02:17.620> your<00:02:17.770> radar<00:02:18.070> detector<00:02:18.190> goes<00:02:18.730> off

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
basically your radar detector goes off

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.560 
basically your radar detector goes off
and<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.300> tells<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.750> got<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:19.990> ticket<00:02:20.430> so

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
but I'm not sure if that's gonna do a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.580 
but I'm not sure if that's gonna do a
whole<00:02:37.210> hell<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.660> lot<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.870> good<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.320> tell<00:02:38.500> you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
I use there I could probably coat this
