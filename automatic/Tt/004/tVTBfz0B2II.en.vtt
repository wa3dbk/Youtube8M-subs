one<00:00:39.030> black<00:00:39.570> ops<00:00:39.750> first<00:00:39.960> came<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.469> was

one of the most liked most use guns and
still<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.190> guess<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.059> don't<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.690> used

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
still is I guess but I don't see it used

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
still is I guess but I don't see it used
as<00:00:46.350> much<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.100> before<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.149> I

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
as much as it was before you know I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.910 
as much as it was before you know I
think<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.780> lot<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.200> people<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.500> testing<00:00:49.860> out

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
think a lot of people are testing out

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
think a lot of people are testing out
new<00:00:49.950> guns<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.610> stuff<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.480> know<00:00:51.510> like

new guns and stuff and you know like
Tamura<00:00:52.079> gun<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.520> cool

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
Tamura gun so that's that's pretty cool

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
Tamura gun so that's that's pretty cool
I<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.079> about<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.379> guys<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> guys

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
I don't know about you guys you guys

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
I don't know about you guys you guys
probably<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.160> oh<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.120> every<00:00:57.360> game

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
probably think oh I see them every game

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
probably think oh I see them every game
and<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.469> know<00:00:58.590> ghosts<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.489> stuff

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and you know ghosts and all this stuff

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.000 
and you know ghosts and all this stuff
but<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.289> be<00:01:01.379> honest<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.859> notice

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
but for me to be honest I don't notice

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.670 
but for me to be honest I don't notice
them<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.370> much<00:01:02.520> anymore<00:01:02.760> uh<00:01:03.290> not<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.559> as

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
them that much anymore uh not as much as

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.260 
them that much anymore uh not as much as
maybe<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.010> FAMAS<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.580> think<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> FAMAS<00:01:06.119> is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
maybe the FAMAS I think the FAMAS is

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.580 
maybe the FAMAS I think the FAMAS is
more<00:01:06.510> reason<00:01:06.960> now<00:01:07.220> since<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> game<00:01:08.580> came<00:01:09.119> out

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
more reason now since the game came out

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.020 
more reason now since the game came out
but<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.680> think<00:01:10.920> that's<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.460> they<00:01:11.610> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
but I think that's just because they I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
but I think that's just because they I
mean<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.450> unlockable<00:01:13.020> f-14<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.950> it's<00:01:14.189> not

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
mean it's unlockable f-14 so it's not

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
mean it's unlockable f-14 so it's not
like<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.700> know<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.360> another<00:01:15.659> gun

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
like you know you can get another gun

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.590 
like you know you can get another gun
later<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:17.159> maybe<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:17.939> think<00:01:18.119> that's<00:01:18.420> why

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
later on it's maybe I think that's why

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.090 
later on it's maybe I think that's why
you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.900> once<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> gun<00:01:19.979> you're

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
you know once you get a gun you're

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.440 
you know once you get a gun you're
comfortable<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.000> kind<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
comfortable with you kind of kind of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749 
comfortable with you kind of kind of
chill<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.340> should<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.520> put<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
chill with it so you should have put the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
chill with it so you should have put the
FAMAS<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.420> higher<00:01:24.600> anyways<00:01:25.259> what

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
FAMAS a little bit higher anyways what

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
FAMAS a little bit higher anyways what
do<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:25.950> guys<00:01:26.040> think<00:01:26.280> about<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.549> ak-74<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.630> I

have a real big problem with because
they<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.930> overpowered<00:01:37.409> me

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
they think it's overpowered me

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.230 
they think it's overpowered me
personally<00:01:38.400> I'm<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> people<00:01:39.030> who

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
personally I'm one of the people who

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.429 
personally I'm one of the people who
think<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.750> overpowered

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
think it's not overpowered

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
think it's not overpowered
I<00:01:40.640> just<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.270> rest<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
I just think the the rest of the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
I just think the the rest of the
submachine<00:01:43.049> class<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> underpowered<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.040> think

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
submachine class is underpowered I think

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.859 
submachine class is underpowered I think
it<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> doesn't<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:44.970> enough<00:01:46.670> enough<00:01:47.869> leg

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it just doesn't have enough enough leg

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.450 
it just doesn't have enough enough leg
attachment<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.530> stuff<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.829> again<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
attachment these stuff that again to the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.800 
attachment these stuff that again to the
guns<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.909> there's<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.420> something<00:01:51.689> missing

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
guns are there's just something missing

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.830 
guns are there's just something missing
from<00:01:52.049> each<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.439> guns<00:01:53.360> which<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.600> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
from each of the guns which is this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.149 
from each of the guns which is this
isn't<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.229> good<00:01:55.350> example<00:01:55.470> because<00:01:55.890> I'm

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
isn't a good example because I'm

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.380 
isn't a good example because I'm
actually<00:01:56.340> show<00:01:56.700> enough<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.119> I'm<00:01:57.210> actually
