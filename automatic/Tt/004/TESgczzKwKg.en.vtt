in<00:01:56.549> anywhere<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> stop<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> goal<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.469> sums

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
in anywhere to stop a goal and that sums

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.139 
in anywhere to stop a goal and that sums
them<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.979> he<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.460> limit<00:01:59.759> fills<00:01:59.939> through

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
them up he is like limit fills through

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.120

about
I<00:03:32.260> think<00:03:32.770> his<00:03:32.860> reading<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.250> game<00:03:33.459> was

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
I think his reading of the game was

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.949 
I think his reading of the game was
absolutely<00:03:33.760> fantastic<00:03:34.180> you<00:03:34.720> know<00:03:34.750> because

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
absolutely fantastic you know because

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.330 
absolutely fantastic you know because
he's<00:03:35.050> not<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.320> biggest<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.970> height<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:39.190> know

he's not the biggest in height you know

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.190 
he's not the biggest in height you know
I'm<00:03:39.700> probably<00:03:40.030> fair<00:03:40.390> to<00:03:40.510> say<00:03:40.660> he<00:03:40.780> wasn't<00:03:40.959> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
I'm probably fair to say he wasn't the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.030 
I'm probably fair to say he wasn't the
quickest<00:03:42.010> but<00:03:42.250> what<00:03:43.239> he<00:03:43.330> did<00:03:43.510> was<00:03:43.720> he<00:03:43.900> was<00:03:44.050> you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
quickest but what he did was he was you

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.380 
quickest but what he did was he was you
know<00:03:45.100> he<00:03:45.280> was<00:03:45.370> five<00:03:45.700> yards<00:03:46.000> quicker<00:03:46.209> than

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
know he was five yards quicker than

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.030 
know he was five yards quicker than
everyone<00:03:46.660> else's<00:03:46.959> had<00:03:47.230> he<00:03:47.410> had<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.650> never<00:03:47.770> say

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
everyone else's had he had I never say

die attitude you know the times that

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.010 
die attitude you know the times that
we've<00:03:50.739> seen<00:03:51.070> balls<00:03:51.400> go<00:03:51.640> into<00:03:51.880> the<00:03:52.000> box<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.510> it

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
we've seen balls go into the box and it

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.930 
we've seen balls go into the box and it
gets<00:03:53.260> his<00:03:53.410> head<00:03:53.620> too<00:03:53.830> he<00:03:53.980> gets<00:03:54.160> his<00:03:54.310> foot<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.730> it

gets his head too he gets his foot to it
gets<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.239> block<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.770> really

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
gets a block on it and that really

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.979 
gets a block on it and that really
epitomizes<00:03:57.280> just<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.150> way<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:58.510> he<00:03:58.630> wants<00:03:58.930> to

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
epitomizes just the way that he wants to

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.440 
epitomizes just the way that he wants to
win<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.010> he's<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.220> winner<00:04:00.520> and<00:04:01.239> that's

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
win is that he's a winner and that's

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.420 
win is that he's a winner and that's
what<00:04:01.690> Liverpool<00:04:02.140> won<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.860> see<00:04:03.070> how<00:04:03.130> much<00:04:03.280> it

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
what Liverpool won you see how much it

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.100 
what Liverpool won you see how much it
means<00:04:03.580> for<00:04:03.760> me<00:04:04.000> he's<00:04:04.480> read<00:04:04.690> through<00:04:04.930> and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
means for me he's read through and

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.570 
means for me he's read through and
through<00:04:05.260> you<00:04:05.440> know<00:04:05.560> you<00:04:05.620> cut<00:04:05.950> him<00:04:06.100> in<00:04:06.190> and

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
through you know you cut him in and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.190 
through you know you cut him in and
after<00:04:06.970> now<00:04:07.150> he's<00:04:07.300> a<00:04:07.330> bottle<00:04:07.720> rockets<00:04:08.020> got<00:04:08.170> a

after now he's a bottle rockets got a

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.949 
after now he's a bottle rockets got a
Liverpool<00:04:08.500> FC<00:04:08.890> right<00:04:09.700> inside<00:04:10.150> him<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.510> think

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
Liverpool FC right inside him I think

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.010 
Liverpool FC right inside him I think
