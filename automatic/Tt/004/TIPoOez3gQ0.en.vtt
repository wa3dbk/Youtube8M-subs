00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
very ordinary the table stores away

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.080 
very ordinary the table stores away
neatly<00:01:20.680> in<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.979> wardrobe<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:21.640> that's<00:01:21.790> a<00:01:21.909> good

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
neatly in the wardrobe so that's a good

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.270 
neatly in the wardrobe so that's a good
safety<00:01:22.420> feature<00:01:22.810> but<00:01:23.440> there's<00:01:24.009> more<00:01:24.220> than

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
safety feature but there's more than

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.130 
safety feature but there's more than
that<00:01:24.520> barely<00:01:24.789> have<00:01:24.970> done<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.119> lot<00:01:25.539> of<00:01:25.570> crash

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
that barely have done a lot of crash

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.889 
that barely have done a lot of crash
testing<00:01:26.649> on<00:01:26.799> these<00:01:26.950> seat<00:01:27.729> systems<00:01:28.240> seat<00:01:28.509> belts

to<00:01:29.439> prove<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.130> really<00:01:30.460> are<00:01:30.610> safer<00:01:31.509> in

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
to prove that you really are safer in

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.649 
to prove that you really are safer in
this<00:01:31.810> motorhome<00:01:32.350> than<00:01:32.619> than<00:01:33.189> some<00:01:33.490> others<00:01:33.880> one

this motorhome than than some others one

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.820 
this motorhome than than some others one
of<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:34.840> things<00:01:35.020> they've<00:01:35.200> done<00:01:35.229> is<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.649> put

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
of the things they've done is to put

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.469 
of the things they've done is to put
strengthening<00:01:36.460> underneath<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.240> seats

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
strengthening underneath the seats

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.330 
strengthening underneath the seats
themselves<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:38.409> don't<00:01:38.619> submarine

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
themselves so that you don't submarine

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.029 
themselves so that you don't submarine
now<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:39.759> means<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.899> seat<00:01:41.229> bases<00:01:41.590> don't

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
now that means that the seat bases don't

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.399 
now that means that the seat bases don't
collapse<00:01:42.520> giving<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.539> danger<00:01:44.080> of<00:01:44.229> being

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
collapse giving you the danger of being

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.770 
collapse giving you the danger of being
actually<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.179> strangled<00:01:46.179> possibly<00:01:46.630> by<00:01:46.750> the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
actually and strangled possibly by the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.469 
actually and strangled possibly by the
seatbelts<00:01:47.440> themselves<00:01:48.039> but<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:49.060> said<00:01:49.390> them

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
seatbelts themselves but I said them

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.210 
seatbelts themselves but I said them
something<00:01:49.690> unique<00:01:49.960> about<00:01:50.440> this<00:01:50.619> vehicle<00:01:50.860> and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
something unique about this vehicle and

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.539 
something unique about this vehicle and
there<00:01:51.610> is<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:53.080> course<00:01:53.170> Pullman<00:01:53.979> dinette<00:01:54.340> makes

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
there is of course Pullman dinette makes

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.910 
there is of course Pullman dinette makes
our<00:01:54.729> bed<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:57.159> there's<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.399> second<00:01:57.909> double<00:01:58.090> bed

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
our bed but there's a second double bed

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.730 
our bed but there's a second double bed
comes<00:01:59.920> down<00:02:00.220> from<00:02:00.490> above

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.890 

so<00:02:04.740> effectively<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.760> you've<00:02:05.910> got<00:02:05.940> two<00:02:06.630> bunk

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
so effectively there you've got two bunk

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.210 
so effectively there you've got two bunk
beds<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:08.039> both<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.880> double<00:02:09.660> size<00:02:10.070> but<00:02:11.070> then

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
beds and both of double size but then

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.070 
beds and both of double size but then
there's<00:02:11.400> more<00:02:11.670> sleeping<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.450> more<00:02:12.630> lounging

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
there's more sleeping and more lounging

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.490 
there's more sleeping and more lounging
space<00:02:13.200> at<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.620> back<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.170> six

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
space at the back so this is a six

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
space at the back so this is a six
berths<00:02:16.740> Motorhome<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:17.820> makes<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.270> big<00:02:18.510> double

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
berths Motorhome this makes a big double

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.010 
berths Motorhome this makes a big double
bed<00:02:18.960> at<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.320> back<00:02:19.500> here<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.460> room<00:02:21.020> when

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
bed at the back here and this room when

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.750 
bed at the back here and this room when
it's<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.350> such<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> good<00:02:22.770> weather<00:02:23.010> outside<00:02:23.520> for

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
it's not such a good weather outside for

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.800 
it's not such a good weather outside for
six<00:02:24.060> maybe<00:02:24.660> even<00:02:24.810> more<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:26.060> relax<00:02:27.060> here<00:02:27.420> you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
six maybe even more to relax here you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
six maybe even more to relax here you
can<00:02:27.960> use<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> freestanding<00:02:28.680> table<00:02:29.340> which

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
can use a freestanding table which

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.990 
can use a freestanding table which
stores<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:29.940> under<00:02:30.270> this<00:02:30.420> setting<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:32.000> play
