00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:05.589
 Hello everyone, welcome the latest video tutorial on how to solve the cube 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:06.320
 rubik 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.450
 this time we'll talk dubito or creed 2 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.249
 for each one 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.919
 here is the first thing to do 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.289
 choose a face a color I always look for yellow 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.370
 let's grind this face 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.710
 this face will be the one that when the kuasar has solved it will be yellow 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.710
 so let's look for a corner 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.550
 well done this 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 the third yellow side therefore done well 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.269
 green and purple yellow you have to go looking 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.030
 a corner 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.710
 purple yellow is another color oo 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.330
 yellow green 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.770
 it's another color 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.320
 let's go find it here 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.320
 this red yellow green bass 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.750
 so water will have to be put in because at least for yellow yellow for you green bear 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.540
 we promise 4 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.920
 this move here must go here so you should do this 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.040
 movement 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.870
 many doing this movement is ruined 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.610
 the work already done then we move what we have already done 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.870
 we bring on teleritmo poste 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.380
 yellow yellow 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.560
 green green 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.549
 yellow green bjork we go to look for a corner that is yellow Chiola and another 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.040
 por 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.150
 prof 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.780
 this corner must be put out of the same thing as before we move brixiamoto.it put 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.210
 instead of before 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.030
 waxing just a year to fix that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.910
 so same thing 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.350
 move 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.140
 excellent posture 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 it's not that he has guided football, so it's hard to show you 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.550
 yahoo trophy 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:19.009
 your the cube we have to put up here. is here below queen and before 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:21.659
 what we have to do is to bring it 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.919
 under the place where it must be 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.999
 and then do these linux 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.999
 mashed potato 

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:33.439
 and the cover in its place 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.029
 this is part 20 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.929
 more intuitive with a little training I will be very easy 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.600
 autocompletepro quartet 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.979
 the cube is rotated 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:46.229
 beginning with his part and sofa 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:50.309
 liquid time price only the real 3 then you know how to solve the rubik's cube 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:51.889
 2x2 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.559
 marguerit a series of bones 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.679
 then 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
 has the first thing we need to do country chic and a corner 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.579
 black green red 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.909
 and we take it to the place where it will be like sarritzu cube water jugs 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.149
 I do this to Catholic 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:11.309
 via trento 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:12.929
 course 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:16.219
 no . . in its place we put it to the right 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.189
 and we perform that we make ares are 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.989
 these other beatiloro triangles until we reach them never seen 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.059
 cube configuration 

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:26.219
 to do it you need to 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.219
 learn these monster nights 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.609
 I'll show you the time again 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.709
 this started from here 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.099
 returned custom salt that other returns to his place 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:44.790
 alight 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.790
 returned shanghai place 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.620
 we will do this until all the corners have gone to the place 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:54.129
 just check 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.900
 Violet 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.969
 purple green green black 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.429
 route 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.409
 blue purple violet blue 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.109
 black 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.929
 blue blue or red red 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.119
 of the piero greets 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.839
 so now we only need orientals to orient you 

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.349
 let's take a corner well placed successes 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:14.540
 and we put it inside 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.370
 guide - cocaine 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.370
 and let's do this exhibition 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.229
 we do it 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.249
 until 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:27.849
 I didn't see that 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:28.999
 the corner 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.210
 maresca 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.039
 when he came back 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:34.710
 that stock 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.930
 and working on the bike can also be entered so it still turns 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.449
 and we work on PC always on monster series 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.120
 put the upper part in place 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.779
 until the hill does not match 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.779
 and as a result 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:03.129
 I hope I was clear 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.540
 and this is the simplest method of solving coverage 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.009
 concerts and meltin pot 90 chat.it lorca mondo 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.270
 I use the same I keep an average of 10 seconds booking contacts at the club 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.849

 volterra 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.830
 here is solved 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.710
 to the next 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.020
