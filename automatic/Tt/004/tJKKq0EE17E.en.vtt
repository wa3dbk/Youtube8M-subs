00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.920
 hello welcome to cycle today 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:24.470
 I will not teach crafts not 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:29.119
 this time I'm going to teach you how to drive a 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.849
 auto and automatic auto good for 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.910
 start we have to get in the car or 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.780
 put ourselves in the place of the driver here 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.780
 there are the keys 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.830
 Well now I'm going to show you 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.830
 to the car come 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.309
 once we get on top of the car we're going to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.309
 locate the following parts 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.780
 this is the handbrake you should always 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.310
 be up right now I'm going to lower it 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.840
 so they see like this they will be without the brake 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.710
 now we are going to pick it up and go to 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.790
 listen as you catch 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.530
 where I stop there they leave it this is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.920
 important because many times the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.110
 automatic what they already saw it and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.070
 plane that I have not vacuumed my charge nor what 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.830
 I have taken him to aspire 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.830
 without entering the key in the switch 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.920
 and there it is 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.340
 well before continuing I'm going to 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.910
 teach a few things these pedals 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.160
 who see there 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.690
 this is the brake and this is the accelerator 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.120
 obviously that as this car is 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.400
 automatic nothing else has those two 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.400
 pedals here and the clutch 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 if it was not automatic well now yes 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.620
 let's see the gearbox here 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.540
 how can you see 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:10.710
 it has some letters and numbers apart here 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:16.210
 they have more or less is because this car 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:19.360
 apart from being automatic tiptronic that 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.670
 it's another type of transmission but that 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.420
 now I will not explain it to you in another 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.420
 tutorial yes 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.879
 ok the p means park for whom 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.680
 mean that the car is not going to 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.499
 move in any way 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.319
 although they squeeze the accelerator the car does not 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:41.370
 is going to move even if it's on or 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.560
 so it will hear the engine but ua 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.989
 it is not going to move 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.819
 unless you are on a slope I think 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.130
 that if you get to move a little bit some 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:58.470
 models the one that means reverse serves 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.860
 to put the car in the wevers to the n 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.709
 means neutral this good I occupy it 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.300
 when I am to give some time for 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.030
 example in those traffic lights that have 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.099
 laps and things like that that exists 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.340
 He has not paid a little more than 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.380
 time there is when I put neutral and 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.319
 more than anything is if you plan because it already 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.739
 you do not have to have your foot on the brake 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:28.150
 yes because neutral as it rests the 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.330
 machine is like a way to drown 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.800
 a little gasoline according to what I have been told 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.560
 the d means drive white is so that 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.300
 conduct yourself as you know or be 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.940
 drive in the sense that you are going to 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.290
 move forward but in plan or if everything is 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.030
 plan and all ghraib is perfect not 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.890
 they need more or that is more and puts it in 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.300
 the drive alone the car is going to advance 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.960
 even without him squeezing in the 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.960
 throttle 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:02.910
 but not all places are so 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.599
 planes then that's why you have this 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.670
 4 3 and 2 this does not mean that 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.239
 the machine is going to stay in the fourth 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:15.090
 speed or in the third speed or in 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.760
 the second speed depending where 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 placed on the lever comes out 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.120
 to make the changes in my good car 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:29.389
 is a 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.780
 it's a truck let's say auto here 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.630
 there is this button that serves to change 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:40.800
 the speed if they are in parking have 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:43.920
 that press the button like this 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.790
 and they are going backwards 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.969
 you saw and steingruber I'm going to 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:56.110
 press and I pass it to neutral 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:58.749
 then pressed it happened in some 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.729
 cars like mine can happen 

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:02.919
 some speeds just pushing the 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.330
 but that already depends on the 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.430
 model 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.250
 but for example the means to pass the 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.409
 fourth of the d does not happen I just have to 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.159
 press the button and pull it to the fourth 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:18.020
 for the third if it happens alone and already but 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.229
 the second one again are they squeeze the 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:26.590
 button and strip to exit second then 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:28.460
 nothing else pushed him like this third fourth of 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.349
 Jan 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.539
 and even there for webber came up I have to 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:38.050
 press the button and put it in webex 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.050
 there I have 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.300
 but I think that depends on each model 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.760
 because once I got into another car and did not 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.150
 changed speed like this to forces to 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.840
 we all have to press this button 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.350
 good 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:59.010
 so the fourth third and second I'm going 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:02.490
 to say where I have occupied them is the 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:06.870
 occupy a tiny rise or not 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:11.070
 it was very strong the rise is the occupy 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.780
 in one that makes these two longer 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.210
 are the ones that I occupy the most because 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.090
 second one is already like for a rise 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.370
 seriously so super steep and wearing 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:24.180
 in the truck or in the car like this 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:28.550
 already put in second because then this is 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:32.660
 very short is like the most basic 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:36.050
 then I do not know how busy in these 2 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:39.500
 you are only once and to descend 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.380
 is it has never held anything more 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.300
 occupied the fourth and third for that 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.370
 Well, as I say, it's like he has 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.770
 the engine has very marked or is not left 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.550
 flow and well I really like to drive 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.060
 fast then do not busy it but 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.280
 because everything is a matter of each person and 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:02.840
 that they hold on to your car or 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.390
 they understand it and then like everything 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.960
 they have to practice 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.750
 because that's all for the moment 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.660
 I hope in another tutorial next 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:18.080
 week I do not know what I'm going to teach you 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:21.080
 next week really but well 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.390
 I hope you like my videos I know 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.390
 that a lot of people say that we should not 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.030
 to say that they subscribe and they like 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:31.030
 favorites but then if it served them as 

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.020
 somehow the video entertained them 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.740
 subscribe follow in loyal like i 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.110
 favorites 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.250
 and by the way thank you for watching my videos
