00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and chain left the gears it's 37 so but

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.460 
and chain left the gears it's 37 so but
every<00:01:51.270> one<00:01:51.450> small<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> take<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> down<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
every one small I take it down to the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.209 
every one small I take it down to the
nostalgia<00:01:53.130> drugs<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.880> I've<00:01:54.689> ran<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> 12<00:01:55.409> 99<00:01:55.799> in

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
nostalgia drugs and I've ran a 12 99 in

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.660 
nostalgia drugs and I've ran a 12 99 in
it<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.820> sitting<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> way<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.479> sits<00:01:57.689> 1299

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
it just sitting the way it sits 1299

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.300 
it just sitting the way it sits 1299
equated<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.820> how<00:02:00.180> many<00:02:00.240> miles<00:02:00.630> per<00:02:00.810> hundred

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
equated to how many miles per hundred

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.330 
equated to how many miles per hundred
909<00:02:02.420> that's<00:02:03.420> certainly<00:02:03.750> respectable<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.829> when

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
909 that's certainly respectable so when

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130 
909 that's certainly respectable so when
it<00:02:05.640> comes<00:02:05.790> time<00:02:05.939> for<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.509> sell<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:06.960> you

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
it comes time for you to sell this you

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.809 
it comes time for you to sell this you
could<00:02:07.290> probably<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> money<00:02:08.160> by<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> small

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
could probably use the money by a small

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.059 
could probably use the money by a small
