00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and Ubuntu touch it was designed that

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.500 
and Ubuntu touch it was designed that
way<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.310> graphics<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> interface<00:00:18.300> are

the notification shade for instance is a

notification shade on Android it has

notification shade on Android it has
some<00:00:35.700> differences<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.420> adds<00:00:36.660> some<00:00:37.020> things<00:00:37.230> on

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
some differences it adds some things on

some differences it adds some things on
top<00:00:37.559> of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> experience<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.879> would<00:00:39.000> get

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
top of the experience that you would get

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
top of the experience that you would get
from<00:00:39.270> Android<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.960> it's<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.410> same<00:00:40.680> promise

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
from Android but it's the same promise

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.010 
from Android but it's the same promise
you<00:00:41.399> pull<00:00:41.579> down<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> notification<00:00:41.940> shade<00:00:42.750> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you pull down the notification shade to

calls emails and other information and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.010 
calls emails and other information and
some<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.700> compared<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> interface<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.870> what

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
some have compared the interface to what

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.750 
some have compared the interface to what
you<00:00:49.170> find<00:00:49.350> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.680> Kindle<00:00:49.950> Fire<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.550> very

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you find on the Kindle Fire it's very

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
you find on the Kindle Fire it's very
similar<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.149> how<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> Kindle<00:00:51.780> Fire<00:00:51.809> os<00:00:52.350> looks

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
similar to how the Kindle Fire os looks

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.470 
similar to how the Kindle Fire os looks
and<00:00:52.890> works<00:00:53.219> but<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.000> differences<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and works but there are differences in

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.330 
and works but there are differences in
how<00:00:54.690> things<00:00:54.930> are<00:00:55.050> laid<00:00:55.199> out<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> interacted

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
how things are laid out and interacted

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.459 
how things are laid out and interacted
with<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.360> may<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.539> asking<00:00:57.780> yourself<00:00:58.260> why

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
with so you may be asking yourself why

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.229 
with so you may be asking yourself why
should<00:00:58.710> care<00:00:58.890> about<00:00:58.920> Ubuntu<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.730> phones<00:00:59.910> or

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
should care about Ubuntu for phones or

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.060 
should care about Ubuntu for phones or
Ubuntu<00:01:00.390> for<00:01:00.840> tablets<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.469> answer<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Ubuntu for tablets the answer to that is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.619 
Ubuntu for tablets the answer to that is
convergence<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.570> change

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
convergence and how this will change

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
convergence and how this will change
your<00:01:04.019> workflow<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> future<00:01:05.280> canonical

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
your workflow in the future canonical

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
your workflow in the future canonical
has<00:01:06.030> designed<00:01:06.420> Ubuntu<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.470> work<00:01:07.680> in<00:01:07.920> different

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
has designed Ubuntu to work in different

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.830 
has designed Ubuntu to work in different
environments<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> plug<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.540> phone

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
environments when you plug up your phone

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
environments when you plug up your phone
to<00:01:10.049> peripherals<00:01:10.710> such<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.040> monitor<00:01:11.490> or

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
to peripherals such as a monitor or

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
to peripherals such as a monitor or
keyboard<00:01:12.000> or<00:01:12.119> mouse<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.689> interface<00:01:13.110> changes

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
keyboard or mouse the interface changes

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.310 
keyboard or mouse the interface changes
to<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> full<00:01:14.310> desktop<00:01:14.610> version<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> Ubuntu<00:01:15.689> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
to a full desktop version of Ubuntu so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.050 
to a full desktop version of Ubuntu so
basically<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> full<00:01:17.670> computer

basically you have a full computer
running<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.750> pocket<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.350> long<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
running in your pocket so long as you

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.230 
running in your pocket so long as you
have<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> peripherals<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> power<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
have the peripherals to power it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.300 
have the peripherals to power it
canonical<00:01:21.869> calls<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> super<00:01:22.890> phone<00:01:23.070> that
