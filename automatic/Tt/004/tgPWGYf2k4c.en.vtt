was<00:02:12.319> always<00:02:12.800> a<00:02:13.040> part<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.700> this<00:02:14.030> all-star<00:02:14.360> game

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
was always a part of this all-star game

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.170

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and that is kind of strange but I guess

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.990 
and that is kind of strange but I guess
it<00:02:17.630> is<00:02:17.840> what<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.380> people<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:19.250> certainly<00:02:19.610> is

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
it is what it is people it certainly is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.699
