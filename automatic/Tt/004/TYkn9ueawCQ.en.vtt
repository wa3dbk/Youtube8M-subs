protrusion<00:00:13.380> tabs<00:00:13.559> they're<00:00:13.799> kind<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:13.980> known<00:00:14.190> to

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
protrusion tabs they're kind of known to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.460 
protrusion tabs they're kind of known to
shear<00:00:14.880> off<00:00:14.929> mine's<00:00:15.929> still<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.289> good<00:00:16.410> condition

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
shear off mine's still in good condition

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
shear off mine's still in good condition
and<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:19.199> other<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.500> is<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> ends<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.430> this

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
and the other this is the ends like this

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.279 
and the other this is the ends like this
is<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.939> intake<00:00:21.150> oh<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.779> exhaust<00:00:22.020> hub

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
is the intake oh this is the exhaust hub

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.849 
is the intake oh this is the exhaust hub
and<00:00:22.740> this<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.519> actually<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.880> original<00:00:24.859> oil

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
and this is actually the original oil

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.460 
and this is actually the original oil
pump<00:00:26.130> disc<00:00:26.460> that's<00:00:26.699> inside<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:28.109> veinous

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
pump disc that's inside the veinous

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
pump disc that's inside the veinous
assembly<00:00:29.480> pull<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.630> into<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> frame<00:00:31.050> here

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
assembly pull that into the frame here

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.639 
assembly pull that into the frame here
so<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.279> actually<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.910> resides<00:00:33.270> inside<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
so this is actually it resides inside of

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.440 
so this is actually it resides inside of
here<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:36.649> what<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.610> systems<00:00:39.059> has<00:00:39.210> done

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
here now what these on systems has done

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.530 
here now what these on systems has done
is<00:00:39.860> identify<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.370> these<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:41.879> holes<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.510> a

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
is identify that these two holes have a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.639 
is identify that these two holes have a
large<00:00:42.870> amount<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.200> play

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
large amount of play

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.380 
large amount of play
they've<00:00:44.129> got<00:00:45.559> seat<00:00:46.559> here<00:00:47.090> point<00:00:48.090> six

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
they've got seat here point six

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
they've got seat here point six
millimeters<00:00:48.600> play<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.800> concerns<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
millimeters play as it concerns the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.470 
millimeters play as it concerns the
insertion<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.449> tabs<00:00:52.879> from<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> hub<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
insertion of tabs from the hub so you

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.450 
insertion of tabs from the hub so you
can<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.160> quite<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.370> of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
can see it's actually quite a bit of

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.549 
can see it's actually quite a bit of
play<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.660> makes<00:00:57.809> quite<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.079> rattle<00:00:58.500> as

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
play here it makes quite a rattle as

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.510 
play here it makes quite a rattle as
it's<00:00:58.710> pointing<00:00:58.980> around<00:00:59.190> that's<00:00:59.340> what's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
it's pointing around that's what's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.740 
it's pointing around that's what's
happening<00:00:59.820> every<00:01:00.030> time<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.329> pants<00:01:00.629> is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
happening every time your pants is

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.319 
happening every time your pants is
adjusting<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.859> inside<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.850> hitting<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
adjusting on the inside it's hitting it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
adjusting on the inside it's hitting it
hard<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.199> side<00:01:04.500> every<00:01:04.920> single<00:01:05.159> time

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
hard on one side every single time

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460 
hard on one side every single time
that's<00:01:06.210> why<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> disassembled<00:01:06.990> once<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.380> can

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that's why I disassembled once if we can

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.289 
that's why I disassembled once if we can
see<00:01:07.560> us<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.740> camera<00:01:08.040> here<00:01:08.250> you'll<00:01:08.909> see<00:01:09.060> one

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
see us on camera here you'll see one

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.460 
see us on camera here you'll see one
side<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.790> focus<00:01:12.170> one<00:01:13.170> side

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
side if I get this in focus one side

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.210 
side if I get this in focus one side
will<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.040> shiny<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.049> side<00:01:16.259> won't<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:17.040> each

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
will be shiny and one side won't on each

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.899 
will be shiny and one side won't on each
side<00:01:18.650> now<00:01:19.650> what<00:01:20.130> he's<00:01:20.250> doing<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.460> providing<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
side now what he's doing is providing a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.810 
side now what he's doing is providing a
second<00:01:21.240> hub<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.720> one's<00:01:21.900> from<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.140> S<00:01:22.229> 50<00:01:22.820> where

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
second hub this one's from an S 50 where

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.980 
second hub this one's from an S 50 where
the<00:01:23.909> original<00:01:24.180> has<00:01:24.270> 50<00:01:24.450> holes<00:01:24.600> only<00:01:24.780> have

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the original has 50 holes only have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.539 
the original has 50 holes only have
point<00:01:25.350> four<00:01:25.590> millimeter<00:01:25.950> play<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:28.549> there's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
point four millimeter play and there's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.090 
point four millimeter play and there's
significantly<00:01:30.119> less<00:01:30.329> play<00:01:30.860> involved<00:01:31.860> now

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
significantly less play involved now

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.410 
significantly less play involved now
always<00:01:32.220> also<00:01:32.579> done<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:32.880> drilled<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.270> the

always also done is drilled out the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.350 
always also done is drilled out the
counter<00:01:33.780> holes<00:01:34.740> two<00:01:35.250> down<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.579> 0.15

counter holes two down to 0.15
millimeter<00:01:36.869> play<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.729> these<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.900> very

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
millimeter play and these are a very

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.490 
millimeter play and these are a very
tight<00:01:40.619> fit<00:01:41.600> still<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> little<00:01:43.020> play<00:01:43.170> will

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
tight fit still a little play will

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
tight fit still a little play will
assembly<00:01:43.829> play<00:01:43.979> there<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.820> there's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
assembly play there but there's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.289 
assembly play there but there's
significantly<00:01:45.689> less<00:01:46.700> stress<00:01:47.700> placed<00:01:48.000> on<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
significantly less stress placed on it

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.609 
significantly less stress placed on it
when<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.479> mouse<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:48.840> hitting<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.560> think

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
when the mouse is hitting it and I think

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.620 
when the mouse is hitting it and I think
anybody<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.250> has<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.060> ability<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.360> kind<00:01:51.509> of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
anybody that has the ability to kind of

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.870 
anybody that has the ability to kind of
handhold<00:01:52.619> these<00:01:52.799> things<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.310> put<00:01:53.790> them

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
handhold these things and put them

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.670 
handhold these things and put them
together<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.409> be<00:01:55.500> able<00:01:55.560> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
together is really going to be able to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.340 
together is really going to be able to
feel<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> difference<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> big

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
feel a difference I was it was a big

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.030 
feel a difference I was it was a big
deal<00:01:58.469> when<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.680> first<00:01:58.979> felt<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.399> and<00:02:01.040> everybody

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
deal when I first felt it and everybody

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.389 
deal when I first felt it and everybody
has<00:02:02.159> seen<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.460> kind<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> agrees<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.770> big<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
has seen this kind of agrees the big is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.800 
has seen this kind of agrees the big is
a<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.790> big<00:02:05.969> difference<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.540> way<00:02:06.630> these

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
a very big difference in the way these

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.449 
a very big difference in the way these
parts<00:02:07.110> fit<00:02:07.290> together<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.190> we're<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.399> to

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
parts fit together so we're going to

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.249 
parts fit together so we're going to
replace<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> newly<00:02:09.629> provided<00:02:10.050> hub

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
replace it with the newly provided hub

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.130 
replace it with the newly provided hub
and<00:02:10.970> what<00:02:11.970> we're<00:02:12.090> gonna<00:02:12.209> hope<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.840> this

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
and what we're gonna hope is that this

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.910 
and what we're gonna hope is that this
solves<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.560> problem

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
solves the problem

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.300 
solves the problem
of<00:02:15.110> excessive<00:02:16.110> interference<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.860> tab

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
of excessive interference and tab

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.479 
of excessive interference and tab
shearing<00:02:17.700> off<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.120> also<00:02:18.810> throw<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.590> we<00:02:20.040> are

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
shearing off I also throw it on we are

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.949 
shearing off I also throw it on we are
going<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.940> disassemble<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.860> spline<00:02:22.860> how

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
going to disassemble this spline how

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.150 
going to disassemble this spline how
splines<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.500> them<00:02:26.780> anti-rattle

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
splines and have them anti-rattle

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.650 
splines and have them anti-rattle
basically<00:02:29.160> get<00:02:29.370> installed<00:02:29.849> in<00:02:30.090> them<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.510> make

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
basically get installed in them and make

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.140 
basically get installed in them and make
sure<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.900> everything<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.620> going<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:32.150> very

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
sure that everything is going to be very

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.530 
sure that everything is going to be very
tip-top<00:02:33.660> shape<00:02:33.720> from<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.350> on
