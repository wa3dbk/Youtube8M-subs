00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.730
 The objective of this game is governed 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.879
 by two obstacles the first consists 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.879
 in memorizing color and figures 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.879
 shown 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.330
 because he wondered about his color and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.330
 your order 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.170
 color 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.170
 so color 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.120
 i 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.650
 The second obstacle is to form 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.530
 a figure with some pieces given with the 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.900
 same as the first one and the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.320
 shows that state figure that is us 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.970
 presents 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.970
 then simÃ³n something 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.270
 the first rule is that you can not 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.270
 damage the parts 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.780
 the second rule is that you can not 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.290
 change then with the partner to do 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.290
 the piece 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.720
 but is that the opponent can not 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.720
 sabotage 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.849
 relationship 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.850
 12 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.560
 the figure 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.010
 a pair 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.610
 more than one timer as 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.610
