00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 and speak my tranquil ones in style 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.970
 The Italian is well spoken here. 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.970
 Welcome to another video on the web 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.990
 in today's video to be teaching you 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.970
 to install the mod mode in churchyard 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.240
 Now you must be wondering what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.189
 which is a today side mode side is a mold 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.039
 revolutionary movement that puts pressure 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.009
 mode of installing modifications is a 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.809
 beta version still has bugs limitations 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.020
 but it already impresses a lot 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.320
 summing up the love template makes response 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.110
 everything and install all modifications 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.399
 without having the game installation for example 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.850
 Remember that vehicle you need 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.980
 install it by aussie in gm title 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.610
 another similar program that strongly 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.860
 bfre point 3d point files so that 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 could be replaced because well with the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.550
 side mold you will not need 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.859
 replace the original game file 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 just put a track in the side mode and 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 ready maybe many of you do not know 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.090
 but when we installed some vehicles in the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.540
 game you need to replace the files 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.220
 old CarmÃ³polis in light vehicles is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 will have to turn the vehicle around 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.270
 perfectly with the necessary changes 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.860
 made by the author of the vehicle 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.210
 already with the mold in the churchyard you 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 need to waste more time 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.950
 replacing line by line of each 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.950
 because the face itself is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.869
 identifies error reacting much 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 many people do not do anything about it 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.750
 consequently to install 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.850
 correct 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.560
 so there is no need to have 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.810
 in this work of passing through this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 installation process so that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.530
 where many examples that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.659
 could give about the functionality of this 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.270
 incredible way that everyone 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.250
 That's right everyone should have in your gt 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.110
 if an explanation has not been 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.869
 need enough for your 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.299
 understanding please read the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.149
 mod archive or visit the blog 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.189
 of the mix molds in the post in the modification of the 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.590
 mold in the churchyard to understand and 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.149
 understand this change without 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.090
 more relationships now some installation 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.400
 this modification, which by the way is very 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.860
 It is installed and to be honest 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.319
 I do not think I'd even have to have video 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:23.310
 ai canopy had are over at sexy carol 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:25.860
 not only do I feel in your voice because at last 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.319
 personnel or an installation now 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.480
 modifying beauty as you effect 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.260
 two abstention from the video and have 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.709
 extracted or open copy paste continued 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.080
 and the file modulated point to s damage 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.120
 against you to copy after you have done 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.310
 this right click on 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.230
 so gta san andreas and I came here 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.329
 prove the file after doing so 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.380
 a control to jump within range 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.170
 of your gpa 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.599
 so we can in here bee goes through 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.860
 read on and make the installation of 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.590
 modifications 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.000
 here I have already separated a pass and that 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.500
 I put some some ways 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.480
 modifications that are now going to install 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.269
 good you may want to install will be the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.069
 sindieletro the maniac that is passing 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.000
 a board on the screen for you to see the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.220
 which is the hq every pec is a pack of cars 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.150
 made by rui sa tourism but also 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.400
 Danny and the improv of the post that is a 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.319
 another modification that you are also 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.049
 seeing your screen that is a light 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.109
 differentiated in the posts of san andreas 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.170
 the memory and 1024 here my fixed memory 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.079
 that improves the texture leaves the game and the 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.000
 real time sic in which practically better 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.950
 the graphic a bit and the main game 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.660
 You 're also seeing your screen. 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.549
 now that you know the modifications 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.410
 that we are going to install, just give a 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.959
 control to select all the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.870
 files and gives you comfort if you want to copy 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.090
 done that has a control inside the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.139
 pasta mode no adro you are not yours 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.889
 of 10 floors 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.889
 thus 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.920
 done that we can observe that all the 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.130
 modifications have been installed in a 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.350
 easy and quick thanks to the 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.250
 a modification of some 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.740
 problem 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.410
 you simply delete the 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.670
 your continued folder or simply 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.980
 remove the 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.540
 like so looking for work thing 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.720
 would not be possible if the installation 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.510
 was done otherwise in the case here of the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.100
 that I have here car pack of vehicles 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.040
 he would have to tell him 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.390
 1.5 objectives that program the 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.300
 problem is that I liked to give a 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.660
 Look there we'll have to back it up 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.370
 of all GT3 files en-mg thing 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.830
 that there is no need to be part of the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.330
 because it is simply dragging 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.670
