without even consciously giving myself a

without even consciously giving myself a
guideline<00:02:41.430> I've<00:02:41.820> now<00:02:42.120> got<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.570> very<00:02:43.140> sharp<00:02:43.620> edge

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
guideline I've now got a very sharp edge

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550 
guideline I've now got a very sharp edge
there<00:02:44.340> and<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.120> given<00:02:45.450> me<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.630> guideline<00:02:46.110> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
there and it's given me a guideline to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.860 
there and it's given me a guideline to
follow<00:02:46.700> for<00:02:47.700> my<00:02:47.820> sideburn

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.040 

and<00:02:51.379> stop<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:53.180> all<00:02:53.330> we<00:02:53.450> got<00:02:53.629> to<00:02:53.720> do<00:02:53.840> now<00:02:54.019> is

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
and stop and all we got to do now is

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.280 
and stop and all we got to do now is
join<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:54.650> side<00:02:54.890> burn<00:02:55.160> up<00:02:55.400> with<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.810> jaw<00:02:57.050> line

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
join the side burn up with the jaw line

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.900 
join the side burn up with the jaw line
which<00:02:57.800> is<00:02:58.519> pretty<00:02:59.000> simple<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.569> see<00:03:00.700> so<00:03:01.700> from

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
which is pretty simple to see so from

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.809 
which is pretty simple to see so from
the<00:03:02.000> top

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
the top

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.100 
the top
all<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.540> way<00:03:04.659> down

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.670 

what<00:03:08.110> you<00:03:08.260> can<00:03:08.470> now<00:03:08.650> see<00:03:09.930> from<00:03:10.930> sideburn<00:03:11.530> it

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
what you can now see from sideburn it

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.229 
what you can now see from sideburn it
goes<00:03:11.830> down<00:03:12.040> to<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.280> bottom<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.819> jaw<00:03:13.030> line

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
goes down to the bottom of the jaw line

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.059 
goes down to the bottom of the jaw line
then<00:03:13.840> across<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.530> chin<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:15.370> jaw<00:03:15.640> line<00:03:15.879> is

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
then across to the chin but jaw line is

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.899 
then across to the chin but jaw line is
the<00:03:18.069> most<00:03:18.280> important<00:03:18.909> line<00:03:19.659> of<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.319> beard<00:03:20.909> so

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
the most important line of the beard so

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.960 
the most important line of the beard so
always<00:03:22.269> work<00:03:22.510> from<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.900> top<00:03:22.930> down<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.580> if<00:03:24.849> we

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
always work from the top down so if we

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.460 
always work from the top down so if we
want<00:03:25.120> to<00:03:25.150> take<00:03:25.360> this<00:03:25.510> skinnier<00:03:26.019> on<00:03:26.230> this

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
want to take this skinnier on this

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.640 
want to take this skinnier on this
particular<00:03:26.799> bit<00:03:27.220> we<00:03:28.030> work<00:03:28.239> from<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.540> top

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
particular bit we work from the top

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.990 
particular bit we work from the top
don't<00:03:29.650> work<00:03:29.920> from<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.190> bottom<00:03:30.340> because<00:03:30.879> if

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
don't work from the bottom because if

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.150 
don't work from the bottom because if
you<00:03:31.090> take<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.870> take<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.260> jaw<00:03:32.470> line<00:03:32.680> higher

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
you take if you take the jaw line higher

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.400 
you take if you take the jaw line higher
than<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.519> jaw<00:03:33.730> line<00:03:33.970> it<00:03:34.660> was<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:34.930> ridiculous

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
than the jaw line it was just ridiculous

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.130 
than the jaw line it was just ridiculous
now<00:03:36.310> he<00:03:36.370> needs<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.700> inside<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.690> beard<00:03:37.930> area

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
now he needs to inside the beard area

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.309 
now he needs to inside the beard area
now<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> where<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.480> clipper<00:03:40.810> comes<00:03:41.140> in

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
now this is the where a clipper comes in

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.380 
now this is the where a clipper comes in
handy<00:03:41.530> because<00:03:41.829> if<00:03:42.640> you've<00:03:42.879> got<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.120> blade<00:03:45.390> you

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
handy because if you've got a blade you

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.910 
handy because if you've got a blade you
know<00:03:46.540> you're<00:03:46.750> going<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.959> be<00:03:47.079> trying<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.739> move

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
know you're going to be trying to move

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.160 
know you're going to be trying to move
the<00:03:48.160> blade<00:03:48.370> against<00:03:49.000> different<00:03:49.629> angles<00:03:50.079> of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
the blade against different angles of

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.930 
the blade against different angles of
the<00:03:50.230> skin<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.250> might<00:03:51.549> Nick<00:03:51.790> yourself

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
the skin and you might Nick yourself

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.759 
the skin and you might Nick yourself
it's<00:03:52.690> where<00:03:52.840> a<00:03:52.870> clipper<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.560> another

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
it's where a clipper this is another

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.229 
it's where a clipper this is another
reason<00:03:54.099> why<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.250> use<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.459> clipper<00:03:54.879> so<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.090> can

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
reason why you use a clipper so I can

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.030 
reason why you use a clipper so I can
get<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.390> really<00:03:55.780> sharp<00:03:56.049> line<00:03:56.349> with<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> clipper

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
get a really sharp line with a clipper

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.490 
get a really sharp line with a clipper
and<00:03:57.250> then<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.060> can<00:03:58.209> just<00:03:58.450> move<00:03:59.109> your<00:03:59.290> face

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
and then you can just move your face

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.280 
and then you can just move your face
around<00:04:00.180> there's<00:04:01.180> two<00:04:01.420> ways<00:04:01.599> of<00:04:01.750> doing<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.230> you

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
around there's two ways of doing it you

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.530 
around there's two ways of doing it you
can<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.739> use<00:04:02.950> your<00:04:02.980> clipper<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.730> without

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
can just use your clipper and without

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.009 
can just use your clipper and without
turning<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.019> on<00:04:05.049> match<00:04:05.769> the<00:04:06.400> angle<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.150> then

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
turning you on match the angle and then

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.349 
turning you on match the angle and then
match<00:04:08.890> it's<00:04:09.129> your<00:04:09.340> bottom<00:04:09.609> lip<00:04:09.819> and<00:04:10.030> then<00:04:10.090> just

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
match it's your bottom lip and then just

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.640 
match it's your bottom lip and then just
lightly<00:04:10.989> press<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.980> in

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
lightly press it in

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.920 
lightly press it in
you<00:04:14.650> want<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:14.980> line<00:04:15.190> thinner<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:16.420> outside

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
you want the line thinner the outside

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.510 
you want the line thinner the outside
line<00:04:17.260> so<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.400> jaw<00:04:18.610> line<00:04:18.850> is<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.660> outside<00:04:20.110> line

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
line so the jaw line is the outside line

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.250 
line so the jaw line is the outside line
from<00:04:21.520> here<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.940> here<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.450> outside<00:04:22.990> line

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
from here to here is the outside line
