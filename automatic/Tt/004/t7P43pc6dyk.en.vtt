so<00:00:57.100> in<00:00:57.190> these<00:00:57.309> banshees<00:00:57.820> finally<00:00:58.300> come<00:00:58.649> what

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
so in these banshees finally come what

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.200 
so in these banshees finally come what
you<00:00:59.710> do<00:00:59.859> is<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.250> just<00:01:00.489> hit<00:01:00.940> them<00:01:01.059> with<00:01:01.179> your

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
you do is you just hit them with your

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.899 
you do is you just hit them with your
machine<00:01:01.629> guns<00:01:01.839> to<00:01:02.019> take<00:01:02.229> them<00:01:02.350> out<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.760> don't

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:03.909 
machine guns to take them out you don't

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.760 
machine guns to take them out you don't
have<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.149> use<00:01:04.269> your<00:01:04.390> missiles<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.049> you<00:01:05.590> wait

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
have to use your missiles and you wait

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.789 
have to use your missiles and you wait
until<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.549> little<00:01:06.759> cursor<00:01:07.360> thing<00:01:07.770> shows<00:01:08.770> up

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
until this little cursor thing shows up

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.820 
until this little cursor thing shows up
red<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.580> then<00:01:10.119> you<00:01:10.420> can<00:01:10.600> hit<00:01:10.750> them<00:01:10.869> if<00:01:11.560> it's

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
red and then you can hit them if it's

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.929 
red and then you can hit them if it's
blue<00:01:12.130> then<00:01:12.549> you<00:01:12.850> they're<00:01:13.509> too<00:01:13.780> far<00:01:14.020> away

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:55.920 

pretty<00:01:18.939> straightforward

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:05.569 

they<00:01:56.930> all<00:01:57.110> want<00:01:57.380> again

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.119 

so<00:02:06.210> when<00:02:06.420> these<00:02:06.509> serifs<00:02:06.930> come<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.890> do<00:02:08.009> is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
so when these serifs come what you do is

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.460 
so when these serifs come what you do is
you<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.429> your<00:02:08.459> machine<00:02:08.759> gun<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:10.110> take<00:02:10.319> out

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you use your machine gun to take out

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.400 
you use your machine gun to take out
their<00:02:10.830> shields<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.510> then<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.930> switch<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
their shields and then you switch to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
their shields and then you switch to
your<00:02:13.470> missiles<00:02:13.890> after<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.310> shields<00:02:14.640> are<00:02:14.760> off

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
your missiles after the shields are off

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.440 
your missiles after the shields are off
wait<00:02:15.599> for<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.930> lock<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.650> hit<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.069> and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
wait for it to lock on and hit them and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.640 
wait for it to lock on and hit them and
if<00:02:18.450> these<00:02:18.629> tariffs<00:02:19.080> can<00:02:19.290> take<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.590> out

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
if these tariffs can take you out

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.460 
if these tariffs can take you out
extremely<00:02:20.640> easily<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:22.019> what<00:02:22.170> you're<00:02:22.319> going<00:02:22.410> to

curlies<00:03:17.700> phantoms<00:03:18.120> wait<00:03:18.329> til<00:03:18.569> they<00:03:18.690> ping<00:03:18.930> up

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
curlies phantoms wait til they ping up

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.990 
curlies phantoms wait til they ping up
and<00:03:19.380> then<00:03:19.859> you're<00:03:20.130> gonna<00:03:20.250> want<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.579> go<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:20.760> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
and then you're gonna want to go to the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.520 
and then you're gonna want to go to the
one<00:03:21.150> that's<00:03:21.209> closest<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:21.959> you<00:03:22.079> first<00:03:22.290> you

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
one that's closest to you first you

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.690 
one that's closest to you first you
don't<00:03:22.650> want<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.859> go<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.069> one<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> middle

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
don't want to go to one in the middle

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.550 
don't want to go to one in the middle
because<00:03:24.329> then<00:03:24.540> they<00:03:24.660> can<00:03:24.810> all<00:03:24.930> attack<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
because then they can all attack you and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.559 
because then they can all attack you and
basically<00:03:26.459> just<00:03:26.760> shoot<00:03:26.970> them<00:03:27.060> with<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:27.389> many

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
basically just shoot them with as many

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.650 
basically just shoot them with as many
bullets<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.440> missiles<00:03:29.000> as<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.359> they

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
bullets and missiles as you can they

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.610 
bullets and missiles as you can they
take<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:31.079> bit<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.829> take<00:03:32.010> out<00:03:33.139> on<00:03:34.139> this<00:03:34.319> one<00:03:34.530> you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
take a bit to take out on this one you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.199 
take a bit to take out on this one you
see<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.160> go<00:03:35.310> back<00:03:35.459> another<00:03:35.790> time<00:03:36.060> to

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
see I have to go back another time to

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.800 
see I have to go back another time to
take<00:03:36.359> it<00:03:36.480> out<00:03:37.760> but<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.880> want<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.120> make<00:03:39.299> sure<00:03:39.329> if

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
take it out but you want to make sure if

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.210 
take it out but you want to make sure if
they're<00:03:40.019> shooting<00:03:40.290> at<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.829> keep<00:03:41.010> doing

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
they're shooting at you to keep doing

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.309 
they're shooting at you to keep doing
dodging<00:03:41.940> maneuvers<00:03:42.540> because<00:03:42.780> these<00:03:42.959> can<00:03:43.170> also

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
dodging maneuvers because these can also

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.069 
dodging maneuvers because these can also
show<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.250> extremely<00:03:44.970> quickly<00:03:45.180> so<00:03:45.930> you<00:03:45.989> have

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
show you extremely quickly so you have

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.720 
show you extremely quickly so you have
to<00:03:46.170> kill<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.440> first<00:03:46.680> one<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:47.370> go<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.519> the

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
to kill the first one you go to the

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.069 
to kill the first one you go to the
second<00:03:48.060> one<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.299> take<00:03:48.480> that<00:03:48.630> one<00:03:48.780> out<00:03:51.079> going

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
second one and take that one out going

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.680 
second one and take that one out going
from<00:03:52.260> closest<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:53.040> farthest<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.639> you<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.060> if

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
from closest to farthest to you and if

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.599 
from closest to farthest to you and if

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
take out these phantoms they'll just

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:08.750 
take out these phantoms they'll just
disappear<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:03.239> leaf
