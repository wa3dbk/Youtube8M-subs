really harps on us about making sure

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.080

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
that every single day we're getting

that every single day we're getting
better<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:19.799> that's<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.430> most

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
better and I think that's the most

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.039 
better and I think that's the most
important<00:02:21.090> thing<00:02:21.269> that<00:02:21.299> I've<00:02:21.569> learned<00:02:21.599> from

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
him obvious I've learned a ton of things

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.259 
him obvious I've learned a ton of things
but<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.390> one<00:02:25.140> aspect<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:26.310> making<00:02:26.819> sure<00:02:27.239> that

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
but that one aspect of making sure that

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.149 
but that one aspect of making sure that
every<00:02:27.540> single<00:02:28.019> day<00:02:28.200> I'm<00:02:28.470> working<00:02:28.709> on<00:02:28.920> things
