looks like it's probably going to be

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.480 
looks like it's probably going to be
another<00:01:38.670> incomplete<00:01:39.480> pass

set I've currently am set for one and a
half<00:02:17.550> seconds<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.210> makes<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.570> easy<00:02:18.750> to

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
half seconds just makes it easy to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.920 
half seconds just makes it easy to
quickly<00:02:19.140> move<00:02:19.440> through<00:02:19.710> plays<00:02:20.720> move<00:02:21.720> things

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
quickly move through plays move things

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.950 
quickly move through plays move things
backwards<00:02:22.440> okay<00:02:22.590> so<00:02:22.800> here<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.460> see<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:24.720> we<00:02:24.840> were

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
backwards okay so here we see if we were

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.560 
backwards okay so here we see if we were
to<00:02:25.020> let<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.260> play<00:02:25.530> out<00:02:26.240> we're<00:02:27.240> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> see

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the throws an interception and maybe I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.350

down conversions it looks like we didn't

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.570 
down conversions it looks like we didn't
have<00:05:02.720> any<00:05:02.930> all<00:05:03.410> right<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.860> it<00:05:03.980> just<00:05:04.160> says<00:05:04.340> play

selected<00:05:09.440> correctly<00:05:12.910> okay<00:05:13.910> third<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.570> five

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:18.939 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.450 

we<00:05:19.939> convert<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.479> now<00:05:20.689> okay<00:05:21.169> you<00:05:22.069> know<00:05:22.219> a<00:05:22.310> lot<00:05:22.430> of

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
we convert it now okay you know a lot of

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.439 
we convert it now okay you know a lot of
third<00:05:23.270> down<00:05:23.449> conversions<00:05:24.050> here<00:05:24.199> on<00:05:25.000> runs<00:05:26.000> I'm

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
third down conversions here on runs I'm

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:28.990 
third down conversions here on runs I'm
guessing<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:26.960> most<00:05:27.620> of<00:05:27.860> our<00:05:28.039> third<00:05:28.789> down

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
guessing that most of our third down

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.640 
guessing that most of our third down
conversions<00:05:29.569> in<00:05:29.719> this<00:05:29.900> game<00:05:30.080> must<00:05:30.319> have<00:05:30.500> been

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
conversions in this game must have been

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.209 
conversions in this game must have been
passed<00:05:31.129> place<00:05:35.530> yeah<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.560> love<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.009> although

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:38.770 
passed place yeah I love it although
it's<00:05:37.490> okay<00:05:37.729> so<00:05:37.789> you<00:05:37.969> can<00:05:38.060> see<00:05:38.210> our<00:05:38.300> tendency

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
it's okay so you can see our tendency

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.570 
it's okay so you can see our tendency
here<00:05:38.990> is<00:05:39.139> definitely<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:41.620> pass<00:05:42.620> on<00:05:42.919> third<00:05:43.159> down

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.100
