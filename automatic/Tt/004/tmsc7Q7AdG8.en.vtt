up slipping blending into the ground and

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.330 
up slipping blending into the ground and
again<00:03:58.140> this<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> really<00:03:58.860> long<00:03:58.890> wearing

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340

eyeliner crayon that's not going to smug

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.280 
eyeliner crayon that's not going to smug
but<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.460> movable<00:04:03.030> we're<00:04:03.960> going<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.140> go

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
but it's movable we're going to go

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.950 
but it's movable we're going to go
underneath<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:04.920> eye<00:04:04.950> with<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.310> same<00:04:05.550> pencil

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
underneath the eye with the same pencil

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.620 
underneath the eye with the same pencil
and<00:04:06.960> we're<00:04:07.080> going<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.260> do<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.620> waterline<00:04:08.190> and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
and we're going to do the waterline and

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.210 
and we're going to do the waterline and
it<00:04:09.630> glides<00:04:09.840> on<00:04:10.110> really<00:04:10.350> easily<00:04:10.380> because<00:04:11.010> it's

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
it glides on really easily because it's

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.860 
it glides on really easily because it's
grounded<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:12.300> soft<00:04:13.400> it's<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:14.700> stay<00:04:15.000> and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
grounded and soft it's going to stay and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.310 
grounded and soft it's going to stay and
go<00:04:16.050> down<00:04:16.290> under<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.770> lash<00:04:16.980> line<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:18.320> actual

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
go down under the lash line the actual

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.040 
go down under the lash line the actual
eyelashes<00:04:20.190> themselves<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:20.940> we<00:04:21.060> have<00:04:21.239> relying

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 
eyelashes themselves so we have relying

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.110 
eyelashes themselves so we have relying
at<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.410> same<00:04:22.650> time<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.160> inner<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:23.640> outer<00:04:23.880> of

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120

at the same time the inner and outer of
it<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.860> I'm<00:04:25.980> going<00:04:26.100> to<00:04:26.130> take<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.490> same<00:04:26.730> small

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
it and I'm going to take that same small

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.620 
it and I'm going to take that same small
brush<00:04:27.360> or<00:04:27.540> you<00:04:27.660> pick<00:04:28.430> and<00:04:29.430> pick<00:04:30.000> up<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.360> little

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.230 
brush or you pick and pick up a little
bit<00:04:30.750> of<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.080> dark<00:04:32.010> eyeshadow<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.670> set<00:04:35.240> that

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
bit of the dark eyeshadow to set that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.280 
bit of the dark eyeshadow to set that
eyeliner<00:04:36.540> pretty<00:04:36.930> much<00:04:37.110> blends<00:04:37.500> itself<00:04:39.290> so

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
eyeliner pretty much blends itself so

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.350 
eyeliner pretty much blends itself so

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.850 

okay<00:05:23.630> we're<00:05:23.840> just<00:05:23.870> going<00:05:24.169> to<00:05:24.230> sweep<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.740> along

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
okay we're just going to sweep it along

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.850 
okay we're just going to sweep it along
the<00:05:25.040> bottom<00:05:25.280> lashes<00:05:25.639> look<00:05:25.970> at<00:05:26.150> them<00:05:26.650> and<00:05:27.650> this

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
the bottom lashes look at them and this

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.530 
the bottom lashes look at them and this
is<00:05:27.980> going<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.250> thicken<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.850> lengthen<00:05:29.240> without

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
is going to thicken and lengthen without

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.150 
is going to thicken and lengthen without
clumping<00:05:29.900> so<00:05:30.350> it<00:05:30.410> gives<00:05:30.500> you<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.680> really<00:05:30.860> much

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
clumping so it gives you a really much

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.960 
clumping so it gives you a really much
look<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.470> eyelashes<00:05:33.640> so<00:05:34.640> we're<00:05:34.790> putting

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.180 
rashes on we're going to measure them
first<00:05:36.710> I<00:05:37.660> might<00:05:38.660> take<00:05:38.840> one<00:05:39.110> off<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:39.680> end<00:05:39.710> just

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
first I might take one off the end just

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:45.990 
first I might take one off the end just
to<00:05:40.310> be<00:05:40.580> safe<00:05:41.360> make<00:05:41.960> sure<00:05:41.990> they're<00:05:42.320> comfortable

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.270

pick up the glue with the little bit of
glue<00:05:49.400> on<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.610> end<00:05:49.640> of<00:05:49.820> a<00:05:49.910> toothpick<00:05:50.330> and<00:05:50.540> you

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
glue on the end of a toothpick and you

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.980 
glue on the end of a toothpick and you
just<00:05:50.930> glided<00:05:51.140> on<00:05:51.410> the<00:05:51.590> edge<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:51.919> the<00:05:52.040> lashes

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
just glided on the edge of the lashes

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.659 
just glided on the edge of the lashes
focusing<00:05:53.990> on<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.590> edges<00:05:55.040> put<00:05:55.280> a<00:05:55.310> little<00:05:55.490> bit

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
focusing on the edges put a little bit

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.719 
focusing on the edges put a little bit
more<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.860> you're<00:05:57.979> going<00:05:58.100> to<00:05:58.160> let<00:05:58.280> it<00:05:58.430> sit<00:05:58.700> for

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
more and you're going to let it sit for

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.000 
more and you're going to let it sit for
about<00:05:59.000> 10-15<00:05:59.510> seconds<00:06:00.169> to<00:06:00.380> thicken<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.800> little

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
about 10-15 seconds to thicken a little

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.010 
about 10-15 seconds to thicken a little
bit<00:06:01.130> so<00:06:01.430> it<00:06:01.580> adheres<00:06:01.970> easier<00:06:02.419> when<00:06:02.660> you<00:06:02.720> put<00:06:02.900> it

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
bit so it adheres easier when you put it

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:09.610 
bit so it adheres easier when you put it
on<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:03.260> eyes<00:06:07.240> so<00:06:08.240> now<00:06:08.390> the<00:06:08.660> lashes<00:06:09.229> are<00:06:09.410> dry

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.120 
of a brown tone and then I chose a pink
tone<00:06:26.270> so<00:06:26.479> that<00:06:26.600> we<00:06:26.720> get<00:06:26.900> trying<00:06:27.530> to<00:06:27.590> match<00:06:27.770> her

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
tone so that we get trying to match her

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
vitamins and liposomes in them so it's

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.080
