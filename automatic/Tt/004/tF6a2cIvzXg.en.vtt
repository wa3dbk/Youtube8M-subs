00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello so today we have before 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.019
 we truly become popular 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.340
 car in Ukraine daew lanos or sens 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.760
 what basically to the topic of today 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:24.960
 conversation has absolutely no respect 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 then it will be about that out of ten 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.460
 owners of this car somewhere around 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.840
 eight then all 10 don't even know what 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.350
 This car has a cabin filter 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.110
 I think that we should not talk about it on 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 its benefits 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 about what keeps the dust 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.489
 if it is a carbon filter put it 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.329
 maybe Harry will delay the other 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.390
 harmful impurities in the air means it is 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.840
 than 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 plant these cars go without a filter 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 cabin only 1600 16 valve engine 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 full minced with air conditioning possible 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.560
 there will be this cabin filter 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.720
 and all the other sens and lanos and 1500 even 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.220
 with air conditioning there is no this filter 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:28.460
 so today we installed a filter 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.460
 cabin in this car is that 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.400
 that is, I think it should be 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.640
 be sure to put 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:44.390
 it's about your health and so let's get started 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.630
 to install this filter 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.780
 I need this screwdriver 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.780
 regular cross and basically myself 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.380
 immediately tell mean filter 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.060
 here is this plastic cover 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.580
 it will interfere with unwind three screws 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.519
 rather self-tapping screws or how to call it 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.120
 mattress 1 2 and 3 right over here 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.360
 janitor 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.459
 and 4 sorry here are 4 more 4 screws and not 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.900
 I will delay your time I am his 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:44.110
 I will disconnect without camera as I will unscrew further 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:52.030
 tell and so the screws are unscrewed 4 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:57.130
 now we need to remove this cover 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.130
 here, first get out of here 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:07.630
 that's the way it was removed to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:16.850
 understandably 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:22.430
 there is a bridge here I took a view to 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:27.430
 it was visible because it means there is a filter 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.430
 comes is behind this iron 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:38.380
 panel insert it the first time 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:44.030
 quite difficult but I will tell you that 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:53.510
 the first filter is inserted here 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:04:02.330
 This is how it is pushed here. 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:07.420
 so on are being pushed through to 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.420
 until it stops almost then we start it 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.680
 for this panel 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:35.620
 now we put it just inserted 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:38.340
 here as if and so means how to get 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.750
 show hard on video because there 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.060
 the camera you climb you can't see anything 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.450
 let's say this is all done by touch 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.880
 if you are 10 minutes and the statute of the second 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.100
 once you understand how the first and second 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.780
 once and put it there for three or four 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:59.620
 minutes this is worth it this is small 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.850
 problem with installing how would a filter 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:07.540
 need for the car and as we see 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.610
 the filter is set in place it took 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.220
 about 10 minutes is pretty 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.080
 uncomfortable posture 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.850
 better to change because how would you 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.870
 almost personally have the engine 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.770
 to get it well get it okay 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.450
 set for the first time pretty 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.660
 problematic but in principle it's all 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.930
 done here after we have it 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.990
 set accordingly we collect everything in 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.680
 reverse order 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.680
 here is this bra 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.069
 especially for all the water 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.710
 merged 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.319
 past the filter so that it does not hit 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.470
 moisture 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:57.440
 then I install this cover 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.440
 like that under the wing 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.460
 chris body 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:34.550
 put in place now installed it 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:38.070
 work this panel all things but put 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:47.510
 combine the hole insert in place 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:55.040
 clips tighten the screws respectively 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:58.070
 We dress further Mona Lease on place all 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.730
 filter installed 

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.730
 Thanks for attention
