00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.080
 car fine now so 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.780
 high that buying a radar detector case 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.509
 very necessary and this acquisition will pay 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 yourself quickly enough important right 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.379
 choose him 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.090
 about this today and tell you to choose 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.920
 high - quality radar detector need 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.439
 pay attention to the definition 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.019
 ranges and modes of radar DPS 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.720
 a good device supports x range and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.840
 kei range and also takes a short 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
 impulse signals mode pi-pi good 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.690
 the device must be protected from false 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.760
 positives 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.770
 by the way if your radar detector 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.170
 constantly beeping it does not mean that 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.390
 all around stumbled on camera or somewhere 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.430
 lurked a traffic cop with radar the thing is 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.629
 what some devices can give 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.059
 false positives 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.719
 on the line of high voltage gears or even 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.719
 on mobile phones 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.130
 and also on automatic doors and cameras 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.990
 on 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.420
 This is usually a problem of inexpensive 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.519
 radar detectors cost up to 3000 rubles 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.229
 besides, cheap models usually have 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.229
 low range 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.700
 bank show detectors with average cost 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.420
 5 6 thousand rubles already on the door is not 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.430
 work 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.620
 On and radar determine in advance 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.660
 however, the model is different 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.480
 here are two devices of the same price category 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.200
 they perform the same way through the streets 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.170
 Krasnodar 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.450
 but if the device on the right is already signaling 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.480
 to its owner about the approaching chamber 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.910
 2 silent speaks much later 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.250
 so when choosing a radar detector other than 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.740
 Of all other things, it is important to read reviews and 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.250
 see tests on specialized 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.800
 forums 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.320
 and now I will pass on the word to the leader 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.420
 programs to Viktor Gusev, thanks Mikhail 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.820
 for such a detailed story about so 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.550
 important things like a radar detector but 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.190
 I think you missed one important thing. 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.310
 at first glance it may seem 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.670
 insignificant 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.680
 but this is not the one my familiar kitchen and 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 set to break dexter would be very 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.420
 happy a week later stopped him 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.959
 take off what's the matter and 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.099
 annoying sound so we radar detector 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.500
 choose ears 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.020
 In this device area every day is not 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.510
 it is impossible that he forced you to discomfort 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.520
 but let's see then 4 overhears 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.350
 regular choose under which fit 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.350
 i'm here 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.060
 but not black enough like a frog 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.060
 let's compare a little 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.170
 but I do not know for me is poured from the street 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.170
 volume a little annoyingly no 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.140
 my third signal option 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.580
 I do not know how to compare it with wildlife 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.770
 but this is to my liking 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.770
 I think I'll take it checked personally 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.410
 bgggg
