rights<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.009> think<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> ranking<00:01:50.700> system<00:01:51.000> should

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
rights I think the ranking system should

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510

be<00:01:51.299> an<00:01:51.390> average<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.320> scores<00:01:52.619> per<00:01:53.040> game<00:01:53.340> i

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
be an average of your scores per game i

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.130 
be an average of your scores per game i
would<00:01:53.909> say<00:01:54.090> win-loss<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
would say win-loss but if you have a

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959

intro at be as 972 I think that it

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.259 
intro at be as 972 I think that it
should<00:03:20.889> be<00:03:20.949> combination<00:03:21.489> of<00:03:21.579> KD<00:03:21.790> and<00:03:22.090> when

should be combination of KD and when

loss for example your KD in a playlist
like<00:03:24.040> action<00:03:24.400> sack<00:03:24.579> shouldn't<00:03:25.000> count<00:03:25.150> because

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
like action sack shouldn't count because

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.030 
like action sack shouldn't count because
that<00:03:25.720> should<00:03:25.959> be<00:03:26.049> separated<00:03:26.560> into<00:03:26.620> casual

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040

we<00:03:44.709> go<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:45.250> it<00:03:45.400> would<00:03:45.579> be<00:03:45.609> cool<00:03:45.909> if<00:03:45.939> they

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
we go but it would be cool if they

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.819 
we go but it would be cool if they

incorporated individual stats to your

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.979 
incorporated individual stats to your
rank<00:03:48.040> because<00:03:48.189> you<00:03:48.459> can<00:03:48.639> go<00:03:48.819> 15<00:03:49.419> and<00:03:49.569> 0<00:03:49.629> get<00:03:49.959> a

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
rank because you can go 15 and 0 get a

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.569 
rank because you can go 15 and 0 get a
perfect<00:03:50.229> but<00:03:50.500> still<00:03:50.680> lose<00:03:50.919> and<00:03:51.159> make<00:03:51.280> it<00:03:51.400> seem

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
perfect but still lose and make it seem

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.189

like<00:03:51.699> it<00:03:51.849> was<00:03:51.879> nothing<00:03:52.120> however<00:03:52.419> win-loss<00:03:52.959> is

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.199 
like it was nothing however win-loss is

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.839 
like it was nothing however win-loss is
definitely<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.889> way<00:03:53.979> to<00:03:54.009> go<00:03:54.129> for<00:03:54.250> ranks

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
definitely the way to go for ranks

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.909 
definitely the way to go for ranks
