00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.189
 I already made two items here today. 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.790

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.189
 green f5 chopper for you to view 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.829

 your vision if a guy from afar like 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.659

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 you already know that the sword is stone're 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.070
 right guys not to be confused with the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.849
 iron and ney kuasne logical diamond goes 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.590
 confuse but reap with the stone gives 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.239
 for you give a depth is right 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.840
