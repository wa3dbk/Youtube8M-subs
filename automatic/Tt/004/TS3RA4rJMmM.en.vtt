 a little guide about the templar 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.389
 How to do the damage from the templar 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.950
 can push 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 we'll go quickly the items 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.289
 through which I have now after the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.609
 all over for effect so to speak me 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.619
 show you the damage only from 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 Templar, therefore, do not be surprised 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 why I have it in myself and not 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.019
 jeopardizes if one or 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.609
 others asked how are you the money 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.130
 I have done so it the threat 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.660
 Damage to templates and indeed need 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.430
 we enchanting art your companion 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.469
 i can die we should go with it 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.860
 pay attention to the companion himself 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.000
 templer can not exceed 150 percent 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.980
 critical hits hurt 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.680
 I was lucky to have rolled up 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.539
 here I still have 38 so twelve is missing 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.960
 But still we have just this part 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.910
 we should pay attention to strength 150 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.699
 critical hits hurt otherwise 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.190
 everything in strength and war chance 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.300
 pure packing or elite harm 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.280
 and physical harm 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.230
 I'll introduce you to the script and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.940
 after all, I'll show you that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.430
 how it gets then how much works out 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.060
 I will hurt you then 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.790
 say so with patch 2.2 now 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.590
 works better because of the templates too 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.060
 benefits from elite harm and 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.110
 physical harm so there you can do that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.939
 script already change 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 Unfortunately I will not have it yet 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.710
 I will show you later , and we will 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 have enchanting art we have here 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 a blessed sword of the dollar 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.780
 winemaker but this is not to say 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.579
 that does not have to be like that now 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 if you can not do anything with the equipment 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.780
 you also like to use this way you will 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.490
 See how much damage that makes dollars 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.400
 or or in son we can use 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.049
 then probably cartons wedding ring he says 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.000
 the life went out around you and 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.200
 the thing really does hurt a lot 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.149
 ticket millions 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.009
 then we have a unity when we have it 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.990
 need if we play a class 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.700
 who do not rely on a unit 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.460
 is because it just goes fast or you 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.439
 just speed powers or what goes well 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.259
 We always use it here in stone 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.840
 jordan with physical harm then 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.219
 strength with the elite hurt below 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.509
 socket in the best case you see there 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.850
 everywhere I have the socks with the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.280
 red stone inside because a strength 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.970
 at the templar 25 strengths are yes that will 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.340
 Multiplied 25 times 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.530
 and that's why we use it 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.410
 strength and is pretty important then 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.910
 we have Johanns essence the chance 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.220
 against a goal to a goal 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.540
 So that he can hold correctly 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.090
 beautiful the opponents of eleven years 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.190
 keep away or as shown 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.480
 he from akk three tied the reward 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.920
 use the amulet 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.460
 and there's the legendary one 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.630
 ability to work that wonderfully 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.670
 only one must consider that the legionÃ¤re 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.130
 ability of these amulet not 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.820
 term guardians works otherwise 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.590
 works really nice and yes then 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.420
 we defenders of the West mark a 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.920
 blocking an attack gives you a chance 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.959
 an onrushing wolf over to 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.880
 then lead against which he touches 360 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.250
 weapons we have harm again 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.320
 more critical hit chance below 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.880
 socket with more emphasis on it and 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.900
 yes I just want to see you now 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.500
 show how much harm the Sun makes it 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:13.709
 stop very interesting for the classes 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:16.330
 single starts single day damage 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.790
 had a small turntable look at this 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.070
 is very interesting for people for 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.800
 class now for example in rabat the 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:28.120
 not necessarily a lot of single with 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.220
 target has single target so you see 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.420
 that's why it makes millions if 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.360
 you imagine and play one 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.850
 class which ten minutes with it 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.680
 spend on the guardian guardian 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.239
 one can work out that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.760
 calculate so that makes a few 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.750
 billions in all harm overall 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:50.320
 you see it already ticking with this 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.290
 two million 800,000 euros hurt 3 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.610
 millions even go really jagged 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.610
 let's think come 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.100
 it comes to an end with come to the end 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.380
 and otherwise stay tuned I'll show you 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.860
 now the other items which yes 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.660
 with patch 2.2 that has changed and the 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.730
 companion of physical damage but 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.570
 also benefits from elite recommends 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.930
 a loveless wall wants loveless 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.540
 wall rivers sun hats young dom 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.330
 you have to try because this can 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.160
 also rift gardens fir and you can see it 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.840
 down to the legendary skill of the 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.210
 grip gall is then I confessed duration 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.160
 Mine still has its exports 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.500
 back and forth but the grip gallien 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.180
 then no harm can be done to oneself 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.030
 he can not move anymore 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.910
 if he lives below that percentage 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.360
 so to speak, what else is left to say 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.150
 people everywhere ruby rows 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.370
 The best starts you can have are 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.530
 maximum of 150 critical strike chances 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.360
 together critical hit hurt 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.660
 excuse otherwise critical 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:03.620
 chance to hit a pedestal in the middle of ruby 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.680
 rows and physical damage and elite 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.570
 harm so you post that tremendously 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.960
 hurt and what we saw before 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.090
 would have 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.400
 in the video is not in comparison 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.440
 definitely something if you just go with it 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.760
 sunbathe loveless wall and then 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.750
 maybe another stone from Jordan 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.640
 if you are not on the unit 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.730
 instructed is much more harm 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.050
 I firmly hope the video has you 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.640
 please if you liked it 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.200
 together upstairs if you still have criticism 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.650
 had or suggestions what you forget 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.080
