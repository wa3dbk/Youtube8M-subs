this and see which part on this that's

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.870 
this and see which part on this that's
sort<00:03:04.450> of<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> ground<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.560> if<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.370> remove<00:03:06.700> this

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
sort of the ground and if I remove this

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.040 
sort of the ground and if I remove this
resistor<00:03:07.600> here<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:08.470> still<00:03:09.750> too<00:03:10.750> short

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
resistor here and it's still too short

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.820 
resistor here and it's still too short
go<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.440> way<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.950> kind<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:12.970> makes<00:03:13.180> me<00:03:13.360> curious

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
go the way I kind of makes me curious

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:34.520 
go the way I kind of makes me curious
what<00:03:14.830> damage<00:03:15.250> this<00:03:16.080> cut<00:03:17.080> caused

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:43.350 

there<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.650> go<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:41.820> pressing<00:03:42.820> down<00:03:43.030> on<00:03:43.060> this

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
there you go a pressing down on this

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.920 
there you go a pressing down on this
resistor<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:48.150> because<00:03:49.150> of<00:03:49.390> that<00:03:49.570> right

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
resistor it's because of that right

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:00.750 
resistor it's because of that right
there<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:59.080> I<00:03:59.320> can<00:03:59.500> actually<00:03:59.590> see<00:04:00.100> like<00:04:00.310> an<00:04:00.430> arc

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
there and I can actually see like an arc

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.110 
there and I can actually see like an arc
there<00:04:01.150> I'm<00:04:01.420> gonna<00:04:01.570> get<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:01.840> bettors<00:04:03.120> scope

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
there I'm gonna get the bettors scope

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.510 
there I'm gonna get the bettors scope
out<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.630> I'll<00:04:04.720> show<00:04:04.990> you<00:04:05.200> I'll<00:04:05.830> hook<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.160> up<00:04:06.280> to

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
out and I'll show you I'll hook it up to

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.210 
out and I'll show you I'll hook it up to
the<00:04:06.640> phone<00:04:07.210> see<00:04:08.080> right<00:04:08.350> there<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.980> where<00:04:09.190> it

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
the phone see right there is where it

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:16.729 
the phone see right there is where it
was<00:04:09.400> connected<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:14.530> that<00:04:14.740> right<00:04:14.950> there<00:04:14.980> so

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
was connected and that right there so

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.200 
was connected and that right there so
whatever<00:04:17.739> reason<00:04:18.250> they<00:04:18.400> had<00:04:18.640> this<00:04:18.850> pressed

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
whatever reason they had this pressed

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:24.570 
whatever reason they had this pressed
over<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.290> was<00:04:23.410> touching<00:04:23.920> this<00:04:24.100> ground

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
over and it was touching this ground

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.930 
over and it was touching this ground
connection<00:04:25.450> here<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.220> customers<00:04:30.700> that

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
connection here and the customers that

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:40.110 
connection here and the customers that
you<00:04:31.000> heard<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.390> noise<00:04:35.130> so<00:04:38.460> I'm<00:04:39.460> not<00:04:39.580> sure<00:04:39.880> with

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
you heard a noise so I'm not sure with

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.310 
you heard a noise so I'm not sure with
that<00:04:40.150> but<00:04:40.450> this<00:04:40.570> directly<00:04:41.230> goes<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:43.200> what<00:04:44.200> it

real<00:04:56.410> close<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:57.130> something<00:04:57.970> I<00:04:59.880> thought<00:05:00.880> that

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
real close to something I thought that

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.670 
real close to something I thought that
wouldn't<00:05:01.300> need<00:05:01.450> to<00:05:01.480> have<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.140> videos<00:05:02.410> like

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
wouldn't need to have and videos like

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.040 
wouldn't need to have and videos like
this<00:05:03.390> so<00:05:04.390> now<00:05:04.750> my<00:05:04.930> shorts<00:05:05.320> going<00:05:05.590> away<00:05:07.050> I'm

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
this so now my shorts going away I'm

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.840 
this so now my shorts going away I'm
going<00:05:08.290> to<00:05:08.350> plug<00:05:08.530> in<00:05:08.680> withing<00:05:08.950> backup<00:05:09.430> together

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
going to plug in withing backup together

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.310 
going to plug in withing backup together
and<00:05:10.410> see<00:05:11.410> if<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.650> actually<00:05:11.770> fixed<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.430> TV<00:05:13.320> put

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
and see if it actually fixed the TV put

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.880 
and see if it actually fixed the TV put
it<00:05:14.440> in<00:05:14.620> and<00:05:14.830> now<00:05:14.950> I<00:05:14.980> have<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> red<00:05:15.580> light<00:05:16.890> nicely

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
it in and now I have a red light nicely

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
it in and now I have a red light nicely
heard<00:05:18.040> the<00:05:18.190> relay<00:05:18.520> click<00:05:20.430> let's<00:05:21.430> see<00:05:21.670> if<00:05:21.760> it

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
heard the relay click let's see if it

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:28.239 
heard the relay click let's see if it
actually<00:05:21.940> turns<00:05:22.540> on

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.249 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.939 

I<00:05:28.279> sure<00:05:29.179> wish<00:05:29.389> its<00:05:29.569> power<00:05:29.839> but<00:05:30.199> it's<00:05:30.770> on<00:05:30.919> the

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
I sure wish its power but it's on the

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:48.310 
I sure wish its power but it's on the
bottom

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:57.220 

I<00:05:48.350> got<00:05:49.040> screened<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.760> know<00:05:49.910> it's<00:05:50.090> lit<00:05:50.360> up<00:05:56.020> so<00:05:57.020> I'm

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
I got screened I know it's lit up so I'm

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.380 
I got screened I know it's lit up so I'm
going<00:05:57.380> to<00:05:57.440> put<00:05:57.560> it<00:05:57.650> back<00:05:57.800> together<00:05:57.980> and<00:05:58.490> we're

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
going to put it back together and we're

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:09.370 
going to put it back together and we're
going<00:05:59.570> to<00:05:59.630> test<00:05:59.900> it<00:06:00.080> to<00:06:00.110> the<00:06:00.320> cable
