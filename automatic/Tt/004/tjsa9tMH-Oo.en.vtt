00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.260
 good data very given to the new video 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.240
 pretty pretty important video is 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.639
 how good it seems to be that doing nothing is a 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.469
 and domain over x 720 to playstation 4 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.019
 I want to be 120 will be a little more 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.669
 powerful than ps 4 and it seems to be that good 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.740
 that another rumor comes from another page 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:19.080
 well you know this helps me to 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.939
 tell you that each page has its world 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.769
 so it seems that each page has 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 your contacts and such and each page goes to 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.859
 put different things with which 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.080
 it seems that we will never know the truth 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.089
 so we'll know what lurks 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.500
 treat the new generation and such is 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.840
 time is a 24/7 axis a pretty magazine 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.100
 important a pretty digital magazine 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.110
 important with the planned visit a 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.400
 web page so that we understand everything 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.320
 the best in a next rides people 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.820
 quite important that really when 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 many people get Spanish pick up 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.530
 news and many times already because of it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.020
 because basically they usually have enough 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.270
 reason they usually have quite how to say it 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.630
 enough criteria quite restrict 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.670
 so to say certain things we go with 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.160
 what basically says that loans are 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.880
 four will be more powerful than with 720 and 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:12.860
 this basically says sources 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.290
 internal of 420 sources from within and such 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.479
 the development and all this organ that I 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.220
 sincerely I have my doubts having 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.229
 many rumors and I do not have or have 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.540
 a lot of height that he took this did not 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.400
 I think a fuck about that somehow 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.410
 but really all the common here 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.500
 He affirmed so that you go knowing about 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.050
 what was that saying four 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.290
 1.84 teraflops coordinate and while 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.330
 we wanted in 120 to 1.23 teraflops of the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.310
 fox I think it's a measurement of 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.670
 Speed processing 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.890
 processing and such speed in this 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.590
 is basically the power of we would say 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.240
 no correction quotes me if I 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.950
 I'm basically wrong 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.450
 and well basically we're going through that 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.540
 would be based that precision 4 will be more 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.149
 powerful that we did 720 although in the 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.590
 theme game ram memory seems to be that 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.479
 win and here we are growing 20 with 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.180
 nacho end of ram and not sad for the 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.310
 operating system and playstation 4 with 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.670
 four gigas of ram and one for the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.630
 operating system so good 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.550
 would win in this case the 20 in the subject 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.830
 of the rmi tal but the other that is the most 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.050
 important because it has not been good we are going to 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 see what it says are to present before 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.590
 of 2013 e3 I stop doubting what I've 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.050
 said many times surely it 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.940
 present in e3 of 2013 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.670
 the grones are presented before the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.800
 I would really have a hard time assimilating it 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.360
 true but good everything had a possible 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.360
 know so good nothing more
