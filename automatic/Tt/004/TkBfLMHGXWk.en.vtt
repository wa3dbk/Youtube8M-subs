00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.350
 the main and most important thing about this 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.019
 Sandwich sandwich is the green mojo 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.669
 Cuban where we're going to marinate the meat 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.559
 recipe that we are going to use is the chef's 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.650
 roig today that enough has been done 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.480
 popular from the chef movie 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.550
 in a bowl we toss the olive oil 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.669
 extra virgin orange juice 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.230
 the lime juice stir and add the 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:29.260
 orange zest 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.250
 fresh mint leaves chopped the 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.980
 fresh coriander leaves also chopped 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.220
 and finally add the minced garlic the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.900
 dry oregano and ground cumin 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.060
 mix well and season to taste 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 in this mixture we are going to submerge the piece 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.260
 of meat I have used the back of 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.540
 Iberian pig 'calculate about 200 grams 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.520
 per person to me leave me two mouths 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.430
 you're so my piece of loin was from 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.430
 400 grams we pringamos well 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.770
 we put it in a bag with zip and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.930
 we let him do the fridge for 12 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.790
 minimum hours 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.420
 we are stirring it inside the bag 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.420
 several times 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.490
 mine has been all night and now 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.159
 direct from the bag to a source of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.409
 oven with all the mash 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.009
 remember to put the part of the fat 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.009
 upwards 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.280
 we give it with a cooking rope 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.780
 whenever I do this type of barbecue 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.760
 the oven I like to tie or shine the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350
 meat in this way we will get a 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.810
 roasted more homogeneous and that the piece 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.670
 keep its shape 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.979
 we introduce the tray in the oven 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.390
 preheated to 180 degrees centigrade 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.390
 for 45 minutes 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.620
 if you have the possibility to control the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.120
 internal temperature of the meat 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.490
 that it will reach its optimum 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.300
 when the center of the piece indicates 55 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.300
 degrees Celsius 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.320
 we cut the strings 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.399
 and steak masters to cut the meat well 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.399
 it's better to be cold 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.760
 we put on a hot iron both the 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.030
 meat like cooked ham simply 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.380
 back and forth and of course the bread in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.410
 this time I prepared my bread 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.940
 favorite for sandwiches some muffins in 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.950
 the description of the video I leave the link 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.570
 of the muffin bread video is super easy 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.080
 and ideal for making hamburgers and 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.080
 sandwiches 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.040
 we painted the bottom with mustard 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.230
 of which we use for puppies 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.860
 hot, nothing old mustard or 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.350
 edition 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.970
 now we place 6 thin slices of loin 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:00.770
 dipped three slices of cooked ham 2-3 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.260
 slices of Swiss gruyere cheese depends 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.860
 of size and pickles all over the 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.860
 surface 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.390
 we cover our sandwich and paint 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.990
 the whole surface of the bread with 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.990
 melted butter 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.020
 place on a hot iron by 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.340
 the butter part and we paint the 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.310
 another part of bread with butter 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.319
 melted too 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.870
 I eat I do not have a double iron 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.849
 I crush the sandwich with a lid 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.870
 once golden I turn it around and 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.870
 we keep squeezing 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.650
 and now we only have to taste this 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.940
 Exquisite sandwich I hope you like it 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.940
 It has enchanted me
