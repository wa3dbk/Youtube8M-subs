00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:06.120
 today we are going to prepare a Russian salad 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.120
 purebred style 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.300
 The first thing we are going to do is put 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.660
 cook the potatoes we washed and the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.480
 we put in a saucepan with hot water the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.790
 We will leave until when you click on them 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.980
 they are totally tender they will be like 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 15 minutes approximately a little 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.850
 depending also on the size of the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.070
 potatoes when they are cold we are going to 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.960
 chop we're going to cut into dice 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 little ones too small because if 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.129
 not after removing our salad 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.070
 we end up breaking completely 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.690
 the potato but good a little a size 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 intermediate that you consider 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.539
 timely and we add the tuna the tin 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.430
 of tuna I have used tuna to natural 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.759
 it is neither pickled nor in oil it is 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.530
 tuna to the natural the egg we have cooked 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.320
 I already showed you how to do it in a video 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.110
 previous you can click on the label 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.520
 that appears to you if you want to see how it 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.190
 makes for us to fit perfectly 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.229
 orange in the middle and we're going to chop it 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.600
 just like potatoes we have to 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.229
 wait until they are completely cold 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.470
 we cut it is done very easily and 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:33.110
 we add together with the tuna and the potatoes 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.270
 then we will incorporate the 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.210
 variants the variant is nothing more than a 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.400
 preserved pickle and carrot in 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.980
 vinegar if you do not have you can use 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.890
 cooked carrot without problem and 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.800
 we ended up adding the mayonnaise 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.900
 You can make it a homemade mayonnaise 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.640
 I also leave my mayonnaise recipe 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.740
 but good if you can not also use 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.110
 the boat that is of quality once 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 that we have everything right and the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.070
 removed perfectly integrated what 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.610
 we are going to cover and we are going to leave it in the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.990
 refrigerator so that it is very cold and 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.300
 this is the result I have used 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.580
 as a garnish for these fillets 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.580
 I hope you liked it until another 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.909

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.909
