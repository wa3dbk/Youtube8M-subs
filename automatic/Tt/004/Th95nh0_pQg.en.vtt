00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.419
 Hi, color of worker rights, we are back from the mountains this year 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.090
 new pagan my poor Matthias Faber to my right is Thomas Marquardt 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.570
 the developer marketer img our first theme value ivox 29 inches in carbon 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.640
 his squad Thoma is constantly on but just before 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.869
 Waldmann briskly tapes developer Berger is admonished between way 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.660
 led us all 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.040
 Percentage high quality bikes image material development and also product management 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.930
 equally responsible for both the program geometry and the front wheels 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.130
 as on 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.850
 for the composition of the components 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.690
 we have the Eee box in the Gasthof Alissa ride except 29 today 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.750
 she lives here 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.910
 Domains but very briefly what the evening, there were some changes 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.750
 Contrary to last year 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.550
 two boys also very briefly what are the absolute highlights of the new name 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.030
 So yes to a name the frame completely redone this year in Kaprun 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.460
 then we refined our 29 inch geometry a bit 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.620
 stayed here 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.860
 429 millimeters extremely short of 29 inches advice 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.030
 you might think the bike will be very nervous but have compensated by 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.430
 we hear the bottom brackets have adapted the steering angle to the old one 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.690
 flatter steering angle than they usually 29 inches wide 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.070
 This makes running culture the short winter break agile 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.230
 compared to last year, the seating position is a bit further forward 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.490
 slipped and you have more pressure 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.750
 Get front wheel 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.260
 and can therefore significantly better climbs 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.270
 then he climbs up 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.620
 We thought about what else should be turbo-man out of his 29th 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.910
 and next to it 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.700
 Stability and directional stability and agility it is also from the 4th 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.540
 and there we did some more stuff 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.350
 for one thing we have 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.100
 this aspiration flattened 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.230
 they are acting like a platitude but now 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.250
 Car or a farm machinery builds you imagine leaf springs 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.170
 a flattened strut gives just better than one percent 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.989
 and second, we have the percentage where diameter is 27 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.619
 Puma 2 mm 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:20.259
 this reduces the seat post better springs and 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:24.349
 we've gotten percent of the company's got a seat post 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.419
 the percent is marked with the word free flex that means this Kaprun 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:29.479
 seatpost 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.850
 not a very good run 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.849
 give in 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.089
 and absorb percent shocks 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.569
 he counts them in the crowd pond as well as those who have yes or exit already 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.959
 Of course we drove extensively in the forest 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.659
 Juice and summertime quite good what wants to furnish two three highlights what 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.549
 especially at this roebuck semyon is 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.010
 in short one at our MGM we have the scores Islam 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.499
 XX group 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.779
 Percent then percent built the brand new 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.779
 Herbert Schons himself 29 inches 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.209
 which has Annika Bruhn crown Meta Tappert 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.639
 thus creates one and a half below 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.499
 to be one night 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.139
 and as a very special highlight of this bath is the well on Rotter of 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.669
 to emphasize this 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.319
 Gerald's rotating masses reduces the work much better 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.759
 and it just had a lot more agile with the barrel b now we have of course 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:22.099
 also internally Bali of course everything in phases a big one it is so much better 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.270
 the settlement we have 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.190
 The craftsmen benefit from the agreement with the bicycle in the area of 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.710
 History of Art just what the translation of Campbell Avastin 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.920
 what did he bring with us so tame in our book 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.549
 yes we have talked intensively with Andy Aydin as could also different 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.219
 Variants were kind 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.119
 and percent 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.309
 his preferred variant is actually worrying about the whole thing 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:45.799
 Translation 39 26 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.929
 so twice in front 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:52.519
 at twice then the smaller gradation because in conjunction with 29 inches 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.979
 Wheels is sufficient 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:58.339
 for pressing all the ride but also enough reserves if it offers 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:59.879
 especially steep is profit 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.900
 okay there is this tip before marriage at Bergamont 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.669
 for dolly over 5000 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.269
 but we also have cheaper bikes for beginners bikes 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.019
 is Lampart models are you know that you see the WHO 2 point 2 brought and 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.479
 Although the cheapest option also whether series 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.939
 "Of course it is clear that we used all the mines and what if 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:23.069
 all poor from the frame and after Spider on a trim level very big 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.650
 Overview Schwesig 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.569
 good, too 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:30.129
 Our hypothesis human was actually only extended to the top 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.240
 with the carbon wheels but we have pulled down even further 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.040
 under now hold the entry-level package at 599 euros 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.379
 clearly 

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.789
 for 599 you do not get the same what you think for 1200 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.710
 or 1600 euros gets 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.440
 Jan but still attached importance that we have a high quality 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.300
 Make room at the old percent good aluminum frame 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 Geometry slightly revised 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.669
 on the back of Bonn very small made a little bit longer 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.819
 but are of opinion for this target group 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.129
 he is the most athletic 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.830
 because here super agile me so necessary 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.969
 but the Wolfener even more smoothness even more safety when driving 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.680
 that's why they have just made a little longer rear triangle 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.910
 the whole geometry on it so you sit a little more comfortable 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.229
 the wheel that works is something running 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.819
 thus more safety 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.360
 that he already many tell me now I took to the whole people ways they 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.279
 Thanks to Thomas for giving her an answer 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.919
 and I say goodbye to Euro here now as a formation like 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.789
 always go to www bergamont point 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.650
 Anyone who has the time and inclination can visit us here at the booth otherwise easy 

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:44.869
 Hello and bye and hello in the political
