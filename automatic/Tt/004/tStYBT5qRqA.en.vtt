the<00:01:05.549> weirdest<00:01:06.090> thing<00:01:06.530> I've<00:01:07.970> probably

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.230 
the weirdest thing I've probably
experienced<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.049> while<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.850> didn't<00:01:11.850> really

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
experienced in a while I didn't really

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840 
experienced in a while I didn't really
know<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> think<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.619> could<00:01:14.580> barely

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
know what to think of it I could barely

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.230 
know what to think of it I could barely
eat<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.080> soup<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.680> only<00:01:16.890> finished<00:01:17.460> half<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240

and<00:01:18.570> then<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.320> finished<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.250> other<00:01:20.340> half<00:01:20.700> just

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
and then I finished the other half just

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.520 
and then I finished the other half just
a<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.540> while<00:01:21.720> ago<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.850> was<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.020> full

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
a little while ago and I was so so full

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.810 
a little while ago and I was so so full
from<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.530> littlest<00:01:28.950> amount<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.549> soup

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
from just the littlest amount of soup

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.080 
from just the littlest amount of soup
and<00:01:30.650> you<00:01:31.650> know<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> knew<00:01:32.100> I'd<00:01:32.280> get<00:01:32.460> full<00:01:32.759> quick

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.539 
and you know I knew I'd get full quick
but<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> didn't<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.320> would<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
but I didn't think it would be that

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.640 
but I didn't think it would be that
intense<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.420> big

intense so that was this really big

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.770 
intense so that was this really big
surprise<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:43.460> was<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.729> expecting<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.540> at

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
surprise and I was not expecting that at

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.920 
surprise and I was not expecting that at
all<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:48.890> things<00:01:49.890> happen<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.939> I'm
