00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
over to our clamp on the throttle body

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.990 
over to our clamp on the throttle body
we'll<00:00:25.680> go<00:00:25.800> ahead<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.010> loosen<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.640> clamp

and there's a small chamber off to the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.910 
and there's a small chamber off to the
left-hand<00:00:30.390> side<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.990> can<00:00:31.140> pop<00:00:31.380> off<00:00:31.619> from

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
left-hand side that you can pop off from

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.040 
left-hand side that you can pop off from
its<00:00:32.040> rubber<00:00:32.279> fitting<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.840> go<00:00:33.960> ahead

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.620 
its rubber fitting then we can go ahead
and<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> unit<00:00:34.800> off<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.489> piece<00:00:35.760> now

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
and take the unit off as one piece now

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.630 
and take the unit off as one piece now
there<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.020> still<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> cable<00:00:37.890> connected<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
there is still a cable connected to it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.400 
there is still a cable connected to it
so<00:00:39.059> we'll<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.510> ahead<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.899> rotate<00:00:40.230> the
