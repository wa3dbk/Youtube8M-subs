00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.489
 people run more if I'm experience 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.680

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.660
 yes it is very boring I do not conceive the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 listen to my heartbeat that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.950

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.780

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.520
 church that the heart sweat also 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.190
 you doubt and you hurt muscles after and you 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.100
 you need to end up being able to hurt me 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.020
 here that hurts and the knee suffers 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.250
 very much and then finish running 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.010
 try a crazy desire to see a 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.400
 beer 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.530
 man who eat like a goose as if 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.480
 the world runs out is that I 'm not 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
 good and makes me a lot of clothes for and handsome 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.100
 every day the eye that run is that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.530
 I want to run that is not a sport 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.780
 very cheap cheap let's go let's go 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.120

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.550
 Take the sweat and gps the shirt 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.620
 Special comprehensive technique for 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.870
 days of cold tape for the twins who 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.150
 Do not be charged and the effort is less 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.920
 the sleeves the sleeves a gloves 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.870

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.729

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.040
 she can not do it you can not can not you can 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.430
 a lot of money has a lot of bad things 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.620
 but 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.800
 they have more good things you think 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.050
 imagine god when he created the running 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:09.680
 There is San Pedro San Jose 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.680
 judas that by the way there is a look 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.960
 I want to create running 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.910
 I think Jesus thought I had 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.400
 many good things of course 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.930
 Of course, together with friends, great 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.810
 that's very good as a group creates that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.780
 friendship of ties does not feel like a 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.230
 shower without running that having that help 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.230
 current 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.350
 take advantage of the housework the love 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.350
 I'm going to run 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:49.830
 the running generating who as how 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.590
 make love said no do not argue 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.480
 you know how to run and nobody discusses me the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.700
 sport gives you happiness and running 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.590
 also of nothing that if it costs work 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.690
 get to her but but you get there 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.060
 you arrive and you show up forces you to go 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.050
 more to the physiotherapist than that pretty 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.490
 I touch you to 7 is a little body 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.170
 you also go up the ego you look at the 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.260
 mirror and you look at it in another way says 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.580
 that 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.360
 is one of the challenges that he has proposed 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.970
 that gives you a happiness that neither 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.050
 chocolate cake full of things 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.000
 good 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.620
 if you are when you run in the first 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.840
 10-kilometer race is already 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.460
 losing the beginning of the film forget it 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.580
 because if you have not run 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.440
 do not run do not run anymore because this already 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.020
 not separate can not stop and the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.430
 marathon and do not run a whore again 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.800
 marathon in life and you arrive at the hotel 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.230
 limping it hurts everything and you're in the 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.450
 shower and suddenly and cingulate I think that 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.030
 for next year I could do the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.610
 I work another marathon and we fall again 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.370
 for a bowl that goes badly hurts everything 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.320
 and you fall back into it once you 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.770
 you enter you do not know is dead is lost 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.770
 run 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.860
 I had not thought about it, I recommend you 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.450
 that if you have not run never run them 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.900
 and the case that is making me want 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.160
 you're made to run, you think so, but 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.200
 they are very old I'm still in time 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.239
 is age does not matter otherwise good 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.540
 it does not matter to run 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.540
 I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm leaving 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.759
 that has to run its twins like that 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.729
 put there in sins in the peroneum 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:34.620
 that's not peron is in the eyelet no no no 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.400
 it's fine until we have it here 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.400
 we have life 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.599
 but on the foot 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.110
 do not
