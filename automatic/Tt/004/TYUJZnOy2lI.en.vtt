00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
the bottom now when it's charging you

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.759 
the bottom now when it's charging you
get<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> nice<00:03:09.640> little<00:03:09.940> red<00:03:10.420> light<00:03:10.780> when<00:03:11.590> it's

millimeter<00:03:17.890> input<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:18.910> just<00:03:19.209> input<00:03:20.549> but

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
millimeter input so you just input but

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.750 
millimeter input so you just input but
there's<00:03:22.329> also<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:23.519> can<00:03:24.519> input<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:26.760> then

there's also you can input this and then
on<00:03:27.880> this<00:03:28.060> side<00:03:28.120> we<00:03:28.480> have<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.630> volume<00:03:28.959> up<00:03:29.320> volume

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
on this side we have a volume up volume

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.610 
on this side we have a volume up volume
down<00:03:29.970> as<00:03:30.970> they<00:03:31.120> say<00:03:31.269> its<00:03:31.420> volume<00:03:31.870> up<00:03:32.109> volume

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
down as they say its volume up volume

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.229 
down as they say its volume up volume
down<00:03:33.549> right<00:03:34.209> there<00:03:34.420> sorry<00:03:35.320> about<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.739> focus

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
down right there sorry about the focus

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.569 
down right there sorry about the focus
but<00:03:37.239> right<00:03:37.630> and<00:03:37.989> then<00:03:38.620> on<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.980> bottom<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:39.549> we

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
but right and then on the bottom here we

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.900 
but right and then on the bottom here we
have<00:03:39.760> a<00:03:39.910> little<00:03:40.150> circular<00:03:41.109> pin<00:03:42.040> thing<00:03:42.489> so<00:03:42.820> you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
have a little circular pin thing so you

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.360 
have a little circular pin thing so you
can<00:03:43.120> just<00:03:43.390> push<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.470> in<00:03:44.680> it's<00:03:44.859> very<00:03:44.920> small

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
can just push this in it's very small

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.690 
can just push this in it's very small
cord<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.180> I<00:03:46.239> guess<00:03:46.450> if<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.440> need<00:03:47.769> far<00:03:48.130> distance

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
cord so I guess if you need far distance

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.199 
cord so I guess if you need far distance
then<00:03:48.940> get<00:03:49.480> a<00:03:49.510> little<00:03:49.810> extender<00:03:51.209> little

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
then get a little extender little

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.560 
then get a little extender little
information<00:03:52.630> stuff<00:03:53.560> like<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.920> little<00:03:54.570> LED

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
information stuff like that little LED

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.620 
information stuff like that little LED
indicator<00:03:56.079> and<00:03:56.609> that's<00:03:57.609> all<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.299> back

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
indicator and that's all for the back

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.289 
indicator and that's all for the back
and<00:03:58.989> there's<00:03:59.319> a<00:03:59.380> little<00:03:59.650> hinge<00:04:00.130> here<00:04:00.549> or<00:04:00.940> hope

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
and there's a little hinge here or hope

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.020 
and there's a little hinge here or hope
I'm<00:04:01.810> never<00:04:02.290> sure<00:04:02.709> what<00:04:03.130> I<00:04:03.340> guess<00:04:03.579> you<00:04:03.730> can<00:04:03.880> hang

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
I'm never sure what I guess you can hang

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.670 
I'm never sure what I guess you can hang
on<00:04:04.180> your<00:04:04.209> keychain<00:04:04.600> which<00:04:05.049> would<00:04:05.290> be<00:04:05.410> really

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
on your keychain which would be really

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.720 
on your keychain which would be really
cool<00:04:05.829> and<00:04:06.600> yes<00:04:07.600> I'd<00:04:07.780> use<00:04:08.079> that<00:04:08.350> so<00:04:09.190> let's<00:04:09.519> just

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
cool and yes I'd use that so let's just

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.199 
cool and yes I'd use that so let's just
put<00:04:09.940> this<00:04:10.120> inside<00:04:10.630> here<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:11.940> here<00:04:12.940> we<00:04:13.090> have

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
put this inside here and here we have

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.030 
put this inside here and here we have
the<00:04:13.329> cable<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.870> unique<00:04:14.260> thing<00:04:14.590> about<00:04:14.620> this

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
the cable a unique thing about this

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.960 
the cable a unique thing about this
cable<00:04:15.459> is<00:04:15.970> it's<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.329> try<00:04:16.660> way<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.669> let's<00:04:18.669> say<00:04:18.910> you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
cable is it's a try way so let's say you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.960 
cable is it's a try way so let's say you
plug<00:04:19.600> this<00:04:19.870> into<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.320> computer<00:04:20.799> plug<00:04:21.220> this<00:04:21.669> in

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
plug this into the computer plug this in

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.740 
plug this into the computer plug this in
to<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.020> X<00:04:23.260> Mini<00:04:23.620> then<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:24.669> can<00:04:24.909> also<00:04:25.150> listen

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
to the X Mini then you can also listen

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.240 
to the X Mini then you can also listen
to<00:04:25.930> the
