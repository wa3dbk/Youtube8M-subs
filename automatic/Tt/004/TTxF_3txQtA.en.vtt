00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 Hi, everyone, how are you, I'm Jonathan 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.139
 better known as studio 54 and you 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.549
 I will teach how to restore your system how 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.809
 restore my pc with windows xp system 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.150
 we continually move things around 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.850
 our pc some we enter virus 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.010
 Trojans we eliminate registry keys 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.830
 that we should not eliminate programs from 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.660
 important systems etcetera however 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 not everything is lost windows we 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.289
 provides a tool for 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.719
 go back in time our pc and 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.270
 amend some mistakes made these 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.739
 restorations in windows xp 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.719
 first of all I'll make a brief 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.750
 explanation so they know what it is that 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.789
 are doing windows xp create points of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.129
 restoration in our pc that are 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.379
 states where the pc experiences changes 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.530
 important and elements of the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.969
 system records entries permits 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 which can alter the operation 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.190
 of our computer for good or for 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.260
 wrong the restoration points are marked 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 the time and save the configuration 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.880
 a PC so you can return it to the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.930
 point for example if we put a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.940
 virus makes a 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.220
 and our pc starts to fail is 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.710
 convenient to back our pc up 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 before a week that is to say we are looking for a 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.940
 restoration point before the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.860
 date of failure and ready now I'm going to 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.750
 clear some doubts that are made to me 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.550
 constantly one of them is 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.190
 concerning the elimination of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.020
 files and documents the points of 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.720
 restoration does not delete your files 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.240
 what they eliminate are programs 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.490
 and changes in the registry ie if 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.619
 you install a program yesterday and it restores 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.410
 to a point two days ago the program 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.210
 installed will disappear you can go back to 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.850
 install it with the setup or exc of 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.320
 installation another doubt that I pose is 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 concerning the errors of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 restoration if for some reason your pc 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.979
 when restored to a previous state 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.320
 it gets worse or they just start to 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.840
 fail some things you can undo the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.060
 recent restoration and ready another 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.040
 curiosity is that some antivirus is 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.020
 update them because you eliminate the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.940
 records of the last days and can 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.890
 that are disabled or not working 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.259
 correctly in that case it is not 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.120
 It is necessary for you to do the restoration 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.560
 simply reinstall shell exe without 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.900
 uninstall the program and 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.849
 the option to repair most good 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.160
 antivirus have it after this 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.500
 we will go to the practical side before you should 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
 Check if your pc can be restored 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.790
 that is, if you do not have the 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.530
 restoration option for this you must 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.080
 go to your desktop and right click 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.150
 about my pc then you choose the option 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.519
 properties then you will open a 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.319
 window in the general tab select 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.870
 then the restore system tab 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.790
 check that the check indicates disable 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.980
 restore system in all units 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.799
 is unchecked otherwise 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.959
 We can restore your system if it is 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.640
 marked I recommend unchecking it for 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.980
 future restorations click on 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.980
 configuration and the available space what 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.170
 set at the maximum 12% but in this case 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.630
 it could not be done if, on the contrary, 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.120
 and for good they have the box unmarked 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.299
 let's continue then I leave the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:11.090
 steps to follow and let's start 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:14.220
 start to all accessory programs 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.050
 system tools restore 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.850
 system and we double click 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.370
 a window will open where 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.680
 we will have three options 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.820
 we leave the one that says restore my computer 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.820
 to a previous state 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.269
 and we give it to next 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.040
 in this example we have chosen the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.620
 restoration to day 8 of the month of April 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.240
 of 2009 we click on next then 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.730
 to select our point of 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.830
 restoration we are opened one last 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.060
 window with a message the one that shows is 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.060
 a smaller edited 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.080
 and we give it to the next one I do not give 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.330
 because I'm going to restart my pc and the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.460
 video will be cut I hope this is 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.310
 very helpful, you know, I'm jonathan
