00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
moving on to the variable throttle we're

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.110 
moving on to the variable throttle we're
gonna<00:03:02.390> start<00:03:02.750> with<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:03.100> 90s<00:03:04.100> GM<00:03:04.519> a<00:03:04.550> throttle

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
gonna start with a 90s GM a throttle

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.050 
gonna start with a 90s GM a throttle
position<00:03:05.269> sensor<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.610> mate<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.820> with<00:03:08.030> a

we'll<00:03:39.049> see<00:03:39.230> how<00:03:39.290> this<00:03:39.470> works<00:03:39.650> out<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:40.670> this

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
we'll see how this works out in this

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:59.120 
we'll see how this works out in this
video<00:03:41.209> here

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.740 

now<00:04:00.130> we're<00:04:00.310> looking<00:04:00.610> at<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.820> two<00:04:01.030> twelve-volt

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
now we're looking at the two twelve-volt

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.430 
now we're looking at the two twelve-volt
SLA<00:04:02.290> AGM<00:04:02.830> batteries<00:04:03.310> for<00:04:03.670> total<00:04:03.940> 24<00:04:04.360> volts<00:04:04.660> and

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
SLA AGM batteries for total 24 volts and

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.930 
SLA AGM batteries for total 24 volts and
we<00:04:05.680> attach<00:04:05.920> those<00:04:06.160> through<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.430> frame<00:04:06.730> by

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
we attach those through the frame by

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.920 
we attach those through the frame by
welding<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.660> couple<00:04:08.040> angle<00:04:09.040> iron<00:04:09.340> tabs<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.900> the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
bands with the body attached to the

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.750 
bands with the body attached to the
frame<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.540> batteries<00:04:19.989> nest<00:04:20.350> quite<00:04:21.190> well<00:04:21.430> and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
frame the batteries nest quite well and

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.020 
frame the batteries nest quite well and
are<00:04:22.180> very<00:04:22.480> secure

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.970 

and<00:04:28.120> finally<00:04:28.750> our<00:04:28.900> heatsink<00:04:29.350> mods<00:04:29.590> here<00:04:29.860> I'm
