00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 an event in bordeaux in the very 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.279
 prized quarter of the Golden Triangle at 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.930
 middle of the luxury signs the shocks

 the couturier opens its doors 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.110
 dedicated to custom fashion this brand 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.690
 Bordeaux created by professionals 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.799
 from the textile industry has for 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.639
 ambition to perpetuate the tradition 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.870
 French 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.300
 but with a technology 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.109
 revolutionary scps technology 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.730
 admitted it's a 3d scanner of people 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.080
 which is embedded in a chain 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.359
 technical and computer we have 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.039
 developed called camille the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.520
 customer enters the machine 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.210
 it is digitized and measures are processed 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.950
 after digitization these measurements we the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 then integrate into our software 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.809
 patronage based on the options that the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.160
 client has chosen to generate 4 swims 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.350
 specific which is invaded in 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.690
 production there are several scanners 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.760
 of people on the other hand what is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.469
 unique is the integration of this scanner 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.059
 in a technical chain that allows for 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.300
 generate automatic and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.949
 it's unique in France 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.989
 once your codes determined in 3d by 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.579
 the software jean-françois finch and his 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.680
 team set up clothes on 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.510
 measure to the millimeter and with a 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.470
 quality concern equal to the biggest 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.470
 french fashion houses 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.979
 the chic of the casual masculine 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.360
 pants with blazers going through the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.360
 shirt and even shoes 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.820
 your foot all the data is 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.340
 inputs into the machine and then we 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.009
 with the customer we will choose the product 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.500
 thanks to another computer file 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.450
 so it's very simple you see a 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.000
 model that interest you it is 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.250
 select eventually we can do 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.780
 a change in the color and 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.000
 then it's send directly to 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.119
 factory and for production you can 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.649
 choose different types of leathers 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.469
 then also bath rather the 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.060
 city ​​shoe or basketball is 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.770
 also the little personal touch you 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.189
 can you register your name initial 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.590
 on the shoe little personal side 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.630
 very interesting that's your key a 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.700
 revolutionary concept only a few 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.769
 machines of this type exist in France 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.720
 clothes at the right price shocks the 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.849
 fashion designer sticks to his time at his time 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.519
 at a time when consumers are 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.260
 waiting for customization a 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.489
 concept that is extremely innovative I 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.650
 think it's the future of the garment 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.239
 because we are really moving towards 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.790
 more personalized clothes things 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.920
 who looks like us and above all they 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.560
 are 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.380
 who marries our body is what 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.870
 after recognizing the modes where all the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.270
 world are alike with the fast 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.390
 fashion like h &amp; m or zara now on 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:43.660
 want things maybe more unique 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.420
 ten years ago I think it's 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.489
 the future especially with the machine we have 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.989
 who scans who takes the measurements in 3d 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.700
 it's something that has been at length 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.069
 matured through an experience in 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.980
 the textile industry since I'm from 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.239
 of this sector as well as all 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.860
 employees and associates of the 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.970
 company to all of us we cumulate several 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.780
 dozens of years of experience in 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.610
 textile industry 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.290
 this experience allowed you to 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.970
 find that the clothes that were 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.410
 manufactured at some of our customers or 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.150
 in some workshops that we could 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.450
 to know had difficulty being 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.680
 elapsed this for several reasons the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.299
 does that again the consumer 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.769
 is looking for customization and that 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.080
 So the offer available to him only 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.030
 it did not suit the difficulties the 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.040
 ever greater competition for 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.230
 make products of very high quality 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.019
 variable that make that the consumer does not 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.340
 do not get used to it and all that exhausts the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.620
 economic model of ready-to-wear 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.180
 hence the idea of ​​bringing clothes on 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.109
 measure that allow one to respond to 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.630
 consumer expectations 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.670
 and secondly to bring a new 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.470
 puff of oxygen to the distribution network 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.900
 who when they adopt the garment on 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.970
 measure have no stocks can have 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.670
 optimized sales areas, therefore 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.079
 very optimized distribution costs 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.120
 inferior to those who know in 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.560
 done brought what allows them to do 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.549
 not only margins but of 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.590
 also meet the expectations of 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.880
 consumers both by having 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.359
 performing structures this point 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.130
 economic 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.780
 illustration of this trend from 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.209
 consumers who are anxious to obtain 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.670
 classic responses original quirky brief 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.700
 in summary in their image 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.560
 me it was complicated so normally 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.290
 I order 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.620
 either every time i'm in england 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.970
 we find more easily but there I 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.940
 know now that it's tailor-made 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.010
 so I do not see the one at 10 inches and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.960
 some clothes 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.350
 you tried the machine this case half 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.850
 what do you think 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.320
 it's a little weird I feel 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.810
 of emptiness in europe or to cultivate it is 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.330
 well that's 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.860
 it's beautiful and a lot of 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.240
 technologies but every woman at her 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.100
 own morphology and I think that's 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.710
 good to have precisely a garment that 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.970
 who suits us who fits me perfectly and 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.770
 who do they know how to put in 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.080
 value the top is custom-made on 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.110
 can have a perfectly adapted cut 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.290
 to its morphology and that in addition one can 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.419
 have product customize at will so 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.889
 it's unique and just cut for 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.560
 accelerate its development society 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.060
 opens up its capital to investors and 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.040
 plans to open sales outlets 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.940
 clean and free in France as at 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.200
 overseas 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.200
 records are currently in progress
