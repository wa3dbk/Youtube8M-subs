00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
and cover him back up with spagna moss

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.479 
and cover him back up with spagna moss
to<00:02:36.310> keep<00:02:36.519> them<00:02:36.670> nice<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:36.910> damp<00:02:37.950> hers<00:02:38.950> seem<00:02:39.340> to

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
to keep them nice and damp hers seem to

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.080 
to keep them nice and damp hers seem to
be<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.640> little<00:02:39.820> bit<00:02:39.970> dimpled<00:02:40.570> let<00:02:41.140> me<00:02:41.290> dry<00:02:42.090> okay

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
be a little bit dimpled let me dry okay

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.550 
be a little bit dimpled let me dry okay
and<00:02:43.269> these<00:02:43.390> are<00:02:43.630> gumballs<00:02:44.049> eggs<00:02:46.170> I've<00:02:47.170> counted

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
and these are gumballs eggs I've counted

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.890 
and these are gumballs eggs I've counted
like<00:02:47.980> three<00:02:48.340> times<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.180> i<00:02:49.269> keep<00:02:49.480> getting<00:02:49.660> a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
like three times and i keep getting a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.449 
like three times and i keep getting a
different<00:02:50.260> number<00:02:50.560> it's<00:02:50.739> hard<00:02:51.040> to<00:02:51.220> count

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
different number it's hard to count

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.300 
different number it's hard to count
because<00:02:51.760> they're<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.090> such<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.420> big<00:02:52.600> ball<00:02:53.310> but

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
because they're in such a big ball but

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.009 
because they're in such a big ball but
we<00:02:54.489> have<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.310> one<00:02:57.640> two<00:02:57.910> three<00:02:57.989> four<00:02:58.989> five

we have we have one two three four five
six<00:02:59.530> seven<00:03:00.220> eight<00:03:01.109> we<00:03:02.109> have<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.410> here<00:03:02.440> that's

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
six seven eight we have one here that's

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.690 
six seven eight we have one here that's
not<00:03:03.040> connected<00:03:03.579> in<00:03:03.940> any<00:03:04.060> way<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:06.489> over

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
not connected in any way and then over

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.550 
not connected in any way and then over
here<00:03:09.480> there's<00:03:10.480> roughly<00:03:12.000> 20<00:03:13.000> eggs<00:03:13.349> 22<00:03:14.349> eggs

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
here there's roughly 20 eggs 22 eggs

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.660 
here there's roughly 20 eggs 22 eggs
here<00:03:15.160> I'm<00:03:15.550> not<00:03:15.790> exactly<00:03:16.209> sure<00:03:16.420> because<00:03:16.989> it's

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
here I'm not exactly sure because it's

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.739 
here I'm not exactly sure because it's
difficult<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.849> count<00:03:19.560> underneath<00:03:20.560> let's<00:03:21.040> see

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:21.749 
difficult to count underneath let's see

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:31.979 
difficult to count underneath let's see
1<00:03:22.749> 2<00:03:23.109> 3<00:03:23.799> 4<00:03:24.099> 5<00:03:25.260> 6<00:03:26.260> 7<00:03:26.680> 8<00:03:26.920> 9<00:03:27.159> 10<00:03:28.060> 11<00:03:28.989> 12<00:03:29.650> 13<00:03:30.090> 14<00:03:31.090> 15<00:03:31.599> 16

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:42.030 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
17<00:03:32.260> 18<00:03:34.139> and<00:03:36.689> then<00:03:37.689> we<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:40.170> we<00:03:41.170> have<00:03:41.379> 18

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
17 18 and then we have the we have 18

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.659 
17 18 and then we have the we have 18
plus<00:03:42.549> 8<00:03:42.819> plus<00:03:42.879> 1<00:03:44.939> so<00:03:45.939> what's<00:03:46.689> that<00:03:46.959> 20<00:03:47.469> well<00:03:47.709> 27

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
plus 8 plus 1 so what's that 20 well 27

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.869 
plus 8 plus 1 so what's that 20 well 27
maybe<00:03:48.909> unless<00:03:49.180> I<00:03:49.450> missed<00:03:49.689> one<00:03:50.579> anyway<00:03:51.579> there's

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
maybe unless I missed one anyway there's

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.330 
maybe unless I missed one anyway there's
a<00:03:51.969> lot<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:53.500> I'm<00:03:53.650> gonna<00:03:53.769> go<00:03:53.950> ahead<00:03:53.980> and<00:03:54.159> get

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
a lot so I'm gonna go ahead and get

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.339 
a lot so I'm gonna go ahead and get
these<00:03:54.489> in<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:55.000> incubator<00:03:55.239> now<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.019> they<00:03:56.169> can

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
these in the incubator now so they can

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.020 
these in the incubator now so they can
get<00:03:56.500> start<00:03:58.709> gumball<00:03:59.709> was<00:03:59.980> all<00:04:00.340> curled<00:04:00.609> up<00:04:00.879> on

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
get start gumball was all curled up on

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.939 
get start gumball was all curled up on
top<00:04:01.299> of<00:04:01.569> them<00:04:01.719> so<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.019> looks<00:04:02.230> like<00:04:02.290> she's<00:04:02.650> done

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:02.949 
top of them so it looks like she's done

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:05.129 
top of them so it looks like she's done
now<00:04:03.489> she<00:04:03.549> may<00:04:03.909> have<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.090> slug<00:04:04.449> or<00:04:04.599> two<00:04:04.780> in<00:04:04.930> her

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
now she may have a slug or two in her

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.649 
now she may have a slug or two in her
she<00:04:05.349> did<00:04:05.530> last<00:04:05.799> year<00:04:06.030> which<00:04:07.030> she<00:04:07.239> held<00:04:07.419> onto

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:07.659 
she did last year which she held onto

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.110 
she did last year which she held onto
for<00:04:08.109> a<00:04:08.139> while<00:04:08.290> and<00:04:08.650> then<00:04:08.829> laid<00:04:09.069> but<00:04:09.459> i'll<00:04:09.939> be

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
for a while and then laid but i'll be

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.819 
for a while and then laid but i'll be
keeping<00:04:10.299> an<00:04:10.599> eye<00:04:10.750> on<00:04:10.780> her<00:04:11.079> maybe<00:04:11.319> she'll<00:04:11.590> still

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
keeping an eye on her maybe she'll still

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.789 
keeping an eye on her maybe she'll still
go<00:04:12.010> ahead<00:04:12.189> and<00:04:12.280> pass<00:04:12.810> whatever<00:04:13.810> slug<00:04:14.290> she<00:04:14.560> has

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
go ahead and pass whatever slug she has

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.219 
go ahead and pass whatever slug she has
so<00:04:15.159> okay<00:04:16.030> these<00:04:16.269> are<00:04:16.449> going<00:04:16.630> in<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.840> incubator

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
so okay these are going in the incubator

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:23.180 
so okay these are going in the incubator
and<00:04:18.630> these<00:04:19.630> eggs<00:04:20.019> will<00:04:20.440> hatch<00:04:21.120> approximately

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
and these eggs will hatch approximately

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.730 
and these eggs will hatch approximately
seven<00:04:24.190> or<00:04:24.310> eight<00:04:24.400> days<00:04:24.699> later<00:04:25.419> than<00:04:25.840> Zorro's

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
seven or eight days later than Zorro's

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.620 
seven or eight days later than Zorro's
eggs<00:04:27.039> so<00:04:27.280> Zorro's<00:04:27.639> eggs<00:04:27.880> will<00:04:28.030> hatch<00:04:28.060> first

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
eggs so Zorro's eggs will hatch first

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.200 
eggs so Zorro's eggs will hatch first
and<00:04:28.990> then<00:04:29.710> we'll<00:04:29.860> have<00:04:30.039> gumballs<00:04:30.550> eggs<00:04:30.880> and

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
and then we'll have gumballs eggs and

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.439 
and then we'll have gumballs eggs and
gumbo<00:04:31.690> always<00:04:32.080> produces<00:04:33.240> some<00:04:34.240> pretty

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
gumbo always produces some pretty

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.290 
gumbo always produces some pretty
amazing<00:04:34.750> babies<00:04:35.409> so<00:04:36.159> now<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:36.849> wait<00:04:37.270> begins<00:04:39.300> 57

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
amazing babies so now the wait begins 57

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.779 
amazing babies so now the wait begins 57
to<00:04:40.419> 60<00:04:40.720> days<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.440> they<00:04:41.560> should<00:04:41.800> hatch<00:04:42.009> I<00:04:42.370> keep

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
to 60 days and they should hatch I keep

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.960 
to 60 days and they should hatch I keep
the<00:04:42.940> temperatures<00:04:43.539> around<00:04:44.070> between<00:04:45.070> 82<00:04:45.550> and

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
the temperatures around between 82 and

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.230 
the temperatures around between 82 and
84<00:04:46.240> degrees<00:04:46.630> so<00:04:47.490> okay<00:04:48.490> well<00:04:48.669> that's<00:04:48.789> it<00:04:49.060> for

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
84 degrees so okay well that's it for

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.089 
84 degrees so okay well that's it for
right<00:04:49.389> now<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:49.659> guys<00:04:50.020> take<00:04:50.380> care<00:04:50.409> have<00:04:51.039> a

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099
