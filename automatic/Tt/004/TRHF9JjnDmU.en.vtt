00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello everyone welcome on the channel 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.200
 techno 01net 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 and thank you for following us every day 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.360
 for all the high tech news a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.750
 TV a real TV to 109 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.759
 euros 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.170
 it's a new breed of products in 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.920
 makes low cost TVs that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 arrive on the market 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.270
 yes and the 01 there had the very good 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.000
 idea to test his local TVs 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.240
 100 200 300 euros what valve does he answer 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.240
 in pictures 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.930
 so we start with the least 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.240
 expensive this is all alone in the atypical 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.750
 television bought in supermarket 109 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.690
 euros 19 inches diagonally so 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.700
 obviously we are on a slab that is 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.870
 not at all hdc 1366 by 768 so no 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.880
 at best it's 720p we'll say and 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.619
 with anyway a tuner tnt hd which 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.100
 receives the rooms of the age scale 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.070
 y is it's a TV that's 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.880
 finally a good surprise since that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.610
 works very well 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.890
 the picture is not bad d acceptable 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.990
 you have to put absolutely in cinema mode 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.970
 because the other modes are very bad 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.630
 set the movie mode is pretty much 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.450
 acceptable 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.110
 rather nice to watch the sound is 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.450
 mediocre we at least he is powerful 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.920
 so what to hear his TV when we 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.050
 cooks in full activity and 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.330
 they went to these zealous finally % 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.789
 taken since she is able to read 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.619
 multimedia files on a 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.200
 external device through its port 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.080
 usb 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.440
 it works very well and she is also 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.509
 it also has a pvr function 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.399
 so recording or timeshifting 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.420
 allow a program to pause time 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.940
 to be absent 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.069
 or else program recording 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.810
 could always reduce on a device 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.810
 external thanks to the USB port 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.110
 so here it is a TV that we 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.629
 recalls the first LCD TVs from 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.690
 market 1 10 to 5 6 years pretty much it's 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.160
 very thick it's not very pretty but it 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.230
 do the job then it does the job 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.930
 rather correctly 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.260
 there for once for a 32 inch 229 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.260
 euros 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.099
 the slab is not full hd remains 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:39.470
 still in 720p hd we will say that a little 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:44.150
 plus 1366 by 768 pixels but still 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:47.330
 in cinema mode it's very acceptable in 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.239
 terms of pure image quality so that's 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.489
 not a TV made in china cleanly 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.470
 says if a TV that is assembled in 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.019
 Turkey 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.480
 the windsor brands is a brand of 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.010
 supermarket like sun next 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.680
 Moreover, we can see that they have a 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.720
 some similarity between the two 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.170
 TVs since they come with 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.739
 the same remote is actually they have 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.889
 exactly the same menu with exactly 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.819
 the same options and the same functions 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:22.340
 so on this television windsor the 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.200
 usb port that reads files 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.450
 multimedia from a hard drive 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.239
 external works much less well 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.930
 than on the ton so we do not know too much 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.880
 why it's a question 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.560
 feeding so there for once this 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.209
 will be mostly to watch TV because 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:41.299
 that the other functions are a lot 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:43.609
 less to the point than on the cup l one 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.870
 switch to a television just a little 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.139
 little more expensive 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.359
 269 euros is 40 euros more than the 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.400
 windsor but it's a TV more 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.280
 little she only makes 26 inches of 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.599
 diagonal it's a typical brand 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.870
 Chinese tcl there the colorline model so 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.130
 the a little star model of the range that 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.829
 sells a lot because he's 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.989
 actually pretty pretty to watch 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:11.060
 colorful so here we can say that at 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.459
 diagonal level price it's a report 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.889
 unbeatable for the courage itself 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.560
 the colors are not very well adjusted 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:21.410
 contrasts are too much to force 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.940
 so even in cinema mode it's a 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.800
 picture quality that is not really 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.230
 satisfactory especially since there are 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.389
 leaky backlighting issues 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.860
 on the sides of the slab so there in 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.940
 term of image quality one is a little 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.150
 below average 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.730
 this model also has a reader 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.370
 multimedia through a USB port so we 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.240
 can play audio video files and 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.560
 photo on an external hard drive yet 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.510
 good it does not support sub 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.600
 titles it works pretty good 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.490
 on the other hand we are disappointed by the absence of 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.470
 PVR function function 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.030
 recording and love shifting then 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.430
 that they are present on both 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.910
 previous models we've been able to 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.650
 present and which are cheaper so 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:10.729
 this is a little lack at the level of this 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:14.150
 acl television so last model the 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.810
 more expensive so this 32 inches and 399 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.850
 euros 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.850
 it is a Chinese brand still 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:23.450
 elsewhere but a mark this time that 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.280
 is a bit more upscale by 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.770
 compared to supermarket televisions 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.350
 it is a television so necessarily in 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.460
 Chinese major but appeared in 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.680
 Czech republic 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.100
 always to avoid the rights of 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.640
 customs at the entrance of the union 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.560
 European 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.870
 the design of stalls and more 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.550
 modern the ledges are thinner the 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.350
 materials are aluminum 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.419
 so we're really on a TV 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.360
 today with a slab 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.460
 of today so full hd a slab that 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.150
 has a very good contrast ratio and a 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.460
 image quality significantly higher than the 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.770
 previous TV that said we have 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.320
 spotted some defects for example here 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.610
 there are backlighting fluids from 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.889
 made of a bad assembly 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.360
 materials so it's a little 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:13.599
 problematic it is not seen much 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.819
 but once we've seen it we can 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.240
 stop to see it actually enough 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.400
 pity 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.770
 secondly the remote does not respond 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.449
 not very well so often strong support 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.129
 on the buttons to be understood 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.949
 by the TV it's extremely 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:29.620
 frustrating everyday and thirdly 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.900
 the menu itself could have been 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.659
 a lot better done of options would have 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.599
 could be added without too much cost 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.849
 think and the multimedia playback function 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.740
 could have been greatly improved 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.830
 especially with the management of 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.349
 titles which is not the case on our 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.529
 test files we failed to 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:52.870
 to display the ear infections it's a shame 

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:55.779
 this is said for 399 euros it's 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:59.229
 also a relatively ok case 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:03.759
 However, TVs will have to be tested 

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:06.520
 32 inches of toshiba particular which are 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.650
 also sold at 399 euros 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.690
 range at toshiba and toshiba having 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:13.870
 still a strong experience of 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.699
 televisions it is quite possible that the 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.349
 toshiba model be clearly 

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.509
 better than that there is thank you bruno 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:21.520
 01 la ben it is we realize that 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:23.110
 its TVs make sense but it's 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.279
 rather extra TVs a 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.870
 little tv in the kitchen for 

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:27.190
 watch info in the morning or so a 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.889
 TV in a child's room for 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.150
 connect a game console that makes sense 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:33.909
 and that makes stories for this price on 

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.979
 will say that's the end of this techno 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:37.449
 review on the 01net techno channel 

00:07:35.979 --> 00:07:41.159
 we find ourselves very quickly for others 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.159
 testing of high tech products very quickly
