played<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.630> while<00:00:22.220> basically

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
played with it for a while basically

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.470 
played with it for a while basically
what<00:00:23.430> you're<00:00:23.490> looking<00:00:23.730> at<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.119> epic<00:00:24.359> on

what you're looking at is an epic on

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.150 
what you're looking at is an epic on
steroids<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.050> technically<00:00:25.439> not<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.710> stair<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
steroids it's technically not a stair a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
steroids it's technically not a stair a
netbook<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.060> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> blurring<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.779> line

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
netbook it's kind of blurring the line

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.450 
netbook it's kind of blurring the line
between<00:00:28.050> netbook<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.859> notebook<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
between netbook and notebook and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.189 
between netbook and notebook and
technically<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.539> netbook<00:00:30.810> I'm<00:00:30.990> going

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
technically it's not a netbook I'm going

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.870 
technically it's not a netbook I'm going
to<00:00:31.260> call<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.500> netbook<00:00:31.740> for<00:00:31.800> now<00:00:32.009> even<00:00:32.820> though

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
to call it a netbook for now even though

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.729 
to call it a netbook for now even though
it<00:00:32.910> does<00:00:33.090> not<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.570> an<00:00:33.750> atom<00:00:34.020> processor<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
it does not use an atom processor and to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.530 
it does not use an atom processor and to
me<00:00:34.829> that's<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.130> best<00:00:35.340> part<00:00:35.579> about<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.969> if

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
me that's the best part about it if

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.299 
me that's the best part about it if
you're<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.780> little<00:00:37.170> bit<00:00:37.290> upset<00:00:37.739> waiting<00:00:38.129> for

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you're a little bit upset waiting for

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.670 
you're a little bit upset waiting for
things<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> happen<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.000> atom<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.780> little

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
things to happen on your atom a little

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.229 
things to happen on your atom a little
bit<00:00:40.770> faster<00:00:41.070> process<00:00:41.460> are<00:00:41.550> actually<00:00:41.760> quite<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
bit faster process are actually quite a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.840 
bit faster process are actually quite a
bit<00:00:42.480> faster<00:00:43.079> performing<00:00:43.739> processor<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
bit faster performing processor and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.920 
bit faster performing processor and
there's<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.030> really<00:00:45.149> good<00:00:45.239> job<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:45.750> top<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
there's a really good job and on top of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.290 
there's a really good job and on top of
that<00:00:46.050> rather<00:00:46.739> than<00:00:46.800> having<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.100> 10.2<00:00:47.820> inch

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
that rather than having that 10.2 inch

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.220 
that rather than having that 10.2 inch
1024<00:00:49.260> x<00:00:49.739> 600<00:00:50.039> resolution<00:00:50.640> screen<00:00:51.149> much<00:00:51.780> larger

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
1024 x 600 resolution screen much larger

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.010 
1024 x 600 resolution screen much larger
11.6<00:00:53.160> inches<00:00:53.539> diagonal<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.870> it's<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
11.6 inches diagonal on this so it's a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.459 
11.6 inches diagonal on this so it's a
much<00:00:55.289> larger<00:00:55.590> screen<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.250> 1366<00:00:57.180> x<00:00:57.329> 768<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
much larger screen it's 1366 x 768 and

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.630 
much larger screen it's 1366 x 768 and
that<00:00:58.920> means<00:00:59.070> you're<00:00:59.160> gonna<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> little<00:00:59.520> bit

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that means you're gonna be a little bit

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.069 
that means you're gonna be a little bit
more<00:00:59.730> work<00:00:59.789> space<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.329> desktop<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.870> on

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
more work space on your desktop and on

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.260 
more work space on your desktop and on
top<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.829> can<00:01:01.949> do<00:01:02.039> native<00:01:02.460> 720p<00:01:03.000> video

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
top of that you can do native 720p video

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.000 
top of that you can do native 720p video
which<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.899> going<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.110> look<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.409> great<00:01:04.769> now

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
which is going to look really great now

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.130 
which is going to look really great now
it's<00:01:05.430> important<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> note<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> regularly<00:01:07.020> I

let's take on an acer aspire one netbook

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700 
let's take on an acer aspire one netbook
has<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> ex<00:01:09.420> 3100<00:01:10.200> integrated<00:01:10.619> graphics

chipset that's not going to cut it for
any<00:01:12.720> HD<00:01:13.049> footage<00:01:13.229> even<00:01:13.650> 720p<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.460> not

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
any HD footage even 720p it's just not

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
any HD footage even 720p it's just not
going<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.880> enough<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.810> luckily<00:01:16.290> they've

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
going to be enough but luckily they've

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.850 
going to be enough but luckily they've
used<00:01:16.890> here<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.280> GMA<00:01:17.580> 4500<00:01:18.080> mhd<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.680> has

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
regular computer power goes right here

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.800 
regular computer power goes right here
and<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.190> here's<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.400> best<00:03:02.700> part<00:03:02.790> hdmi<00:03:03.540> port

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and then here's the best part hdmi port

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.390 
and then here's the best part hdmi port
so<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:03.959> can't<00:03:04.290> output<00:03:04.620> 1080p<00:03:04.739> video<00:03:05.250> footage

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
so you can't output 1080p video footage

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.089 
so you can't output 1080p video footage
to<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> big<00:03:06.599> television<00:03:06.989> if<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.349> have<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.709> it'll

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
to a big television if you have it it'll

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.949 
to a big television if you have it it'll
