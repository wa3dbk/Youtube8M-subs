00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
they're calling it I thought it would be

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.479 
they're calling it I thought it would be
something<00:00:49.149> like<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:49.660> strong<00:00:50.110> plastic<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:51.430> I

pretty<00:00:56.260> different<00:00:56.530> from<00:00:56.770> what<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.520> thought<00:00:58.270> so

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
pretty different from what I thought so

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.139 
pretty different from what I thought so
this<00:00:58.719> is<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.989> large<00:00:59.550> combo<00:01:00.550> box<00:01:00.940> like<00:01:01.120> this

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
this is the large combo box like this

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.160 
this is the large combo box like this
like<00:01:01.660> everything<00:01:02.079> else<00:01:02.260> is<00:01:02.500> mac<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.100> then<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
like everything else is mac and then it

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.949 
like everything else is mac and then it
looks<00:01:05.619> like<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:06.070> so<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:06.880> open<00:01:07.240> it<00:01:07.390> if<00:01:07.569> you<00:01:07.749> can

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:07.959 
looks like this so to open it if you can

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:09.539 
looks like this so to open it if you can
see<00:01:08.200> there's<00:01:08.469> just<00:01:08.679> like<00:01:08.829> or<00:01:09.009> even<00:01:09.039> you<00:01:09.310> just

my<00:02:00.219> station<00:02:00.520> because<00:02:00.759> it's<00:02:00.939> not<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.450> durable

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
my station because it's not that durable

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.649 
my station because it's not that durable
and<00:02:04.709> from<00:02:05.709> there<00:02:05.950> i<00:02:06.399> mean<00:02:06.669> you<00:02:07.209> can<00:02:07.389> kind<00:02:07.599> of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
and from there i mean you can kind of

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.199 
and from there i mean you can kind of
see<00:02:07.719> I<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:09.459> know<00:02:09.580> if<00:02:09.640> my<00:02:09.700> camera<00:02:10.090> will<00:02:10.179> pick

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
see I don't know if my camera will pick

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.250 
see I don't know if my camera will pick
up<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:10.720> like<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.770> plastic<00:02:12.390> air<00:02:13.390> bubbles<00:02:14.020> and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
up but like the plastic air bubbles and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.660 
up but like the plastic air bubbles and
stuff<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.530> little<00:02:14.710> bit<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.070> it

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
stuff a little bit in it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.610 
stuff a little bit in it
and<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.420> large<00:02:16.660> size<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.260> I<00:02:17.290> wonder

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
and this is the large size so I wonder

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.230 
and this is the large size so I wonder
what<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:17.950> small<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.790> look<00:02:18.910> like<00:02:18.940> if

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
what that small is going to look like if

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.280 
what that small is going to look like if
this<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.599> large<00:02:20.010> but<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.489> think<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:23.170> would

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
this is the large but I think it would

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.070 
this is the large but I think it would
be<00:02:23.319> good<00:02:23.560> for<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.950> go<00:02:24.130> but<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.300> something<00:02:25.840> on

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
be good for to go but not something on

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.210 
be good for to go but not something on
your<00:02:26.349> station<00:02:26.950> for<00:02:27.610> permanent<00:02:28.800> situations<00:02:29.800> I
