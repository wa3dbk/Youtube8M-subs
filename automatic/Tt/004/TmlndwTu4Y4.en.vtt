 Hello my name is Dmitry and again 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.889
 our channel is dedicated to the epic stone 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.269
 equipment with you 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.009
 probably many people have in 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.279
 head question what is needed for 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.810
 production of high quality 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.430
 modern and of course beautiful 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.869
 furnace equipment for here for example 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.180
 nevertheless German anyway 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.400
 German quality no one argue 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.439
 will be 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.899
 which has a century of history which 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.730
 also produces double fireproof 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.309
 doors and parts for military 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.570
 the industry is also handling more 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 tons of iron 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.730
 day support protection program 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.250
 environment thanks to modern 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.020
 production technology and of the availability of 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.039
 most modern foundry 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.340
 equipment worth over 30 million 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.379
 Euro 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.199
 just so dear friends is 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.649
 plant art wounds dar who is in 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 Germany and at the same time he is the most or one of 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.869
 the largest 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 cast iron foundries in europe like us 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.960
 already understood the portland factory 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.659
 manufactures stoves and fireplaces from high 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 modern high-quality cast iron 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.150
 primary thanks to modern 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 furnace manufacturing method 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.189
 equipment in this factory has 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.590
 over airtight design which 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.860
 will allow the end user to get 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.270
 from your fireplace or stove maximum 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.159
 thermal assembly of fireplaces and stoves 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.799
 or trans whom the plant is carried out 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.619
 the company is the Czechs 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.210
 which allows you to greatly reduce the price 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.850
 on the already ready but in any case assembly 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.810
 in the Czech Republic is accompanied and monitored 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.509
 German 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.329
 experienced technologists in this way 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.180
 This product This brand is already very 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.909
 common in germany and got out 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.070
 nearby European countries, and now 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.990
 came to our country 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.400
 in our video today we show you 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.890
 oven prototype 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.590
 canaria in the development of which were 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.890
 used the strength of the house engineering company 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.340
 this design of the design and far trans 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.300
 plant all the technical component 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.150
 oven equipment 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.900
 Well, dear friends , we have a stove 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.340
 canaria 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.680
 that is, I drink the prototype appearance with 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.500
 hint of vintage that is really 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.930
 such a style such a design is closest 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.960
 in my opinion the soul of edema 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.490
 to consumers of the user as in 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.970
 most interiors 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.310
 This oven will look great then 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.300
 there is in a sense this unique 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.940
 option 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.390
 the first thing I want to mention is big 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.240
 fire chamber with a viewing glass to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.690
 when burning a man could see fire a 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.190
 thanks to the highest level 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.010
 sealing any though fire will 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.740
 one pleasure all fasteners 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.040
 starting with the handles to loop 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.610
 very soundly designed and assembled and and 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.530
 I personally inspire confidence that is, we 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.930
 must understand what the furnace 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.320
 the equipment is not installed for a year and 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.510
 not even for five years and it is worth noting that 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.200
 leo gives 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.950
 10 years warranty for your heating 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.980
 equipment 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.930
 large patterned compartment running forward 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.500
 I want to say that the furnace is equipped 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.420
 function of shrill dumping of halls with 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.790
 using a special lever we can 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.880
 circular trajectory moving kolesnikova 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:50.830
 the lattice in our case it has a round 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:53.489
 the form thereby cleans the combustion chamber 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.620
 from accumulated for you 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:59.320
 if you look behind you can see 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.450
 that canary has a special hole 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.150
 to supply air for combustion 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.220
 from an alternative source that is all 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.010
 we know perfectly well that with intensive 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.680
 burning and stove heating 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.840
 equipment will pick up so to speak 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.780
 burn in some sense oxygen in 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.790
 where it is located 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.120
 and from thanks to this decision we can 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.740
 save yourself from such not convenient 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.810
 the moment of this let's say an element 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.750
 food itself is set to special 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.080
 legs that from the aesthetic side and and 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.940
 visually separates from the floor and she is no longer 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.290
 looks like a monolithic object 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.010
 fixed attacked 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:48.630
 which gives in my opinion ease 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:51.930
 the construction itself 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:56.130
 friends it's time to melt our already 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.710
 prototype and see for yourself how it is 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:02.870
 leads in operation 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.870
 but what do I propose to start 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.039
 here 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.130
 Well dear friends of ours now! 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.660
 navel is in the so-called mode 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:48.610
 long burning in economy mode 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.389
 wood resource here now we 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.770
 we will switch the mode of intensive burning and 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:58.720
 let's see how this prototype 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.139
 the dynamics of the day will change for the better or 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.710
 the worst 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:09.970
 for this we need to open the valve and 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:13.479
 see what changes so but 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:16.630
 instantly blowing air became 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:19.990
 kindle our poles which were already smoldering 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:23.830
 long burning mode but not here 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:27.450
 words all worked instantly it 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:30.960
 cool really what you need 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:35.620
 man that everything worked quickly and 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.620
 delighted the eye in this mode of course 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.860
 firewood will pick up and much faster 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:44.950
 but then the heat will be given much 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.770
 more well dear friends big 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.860
 thanks for keeping us looking 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:53.460
 With you was Dmitri our operator Sergei 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.139
 Does the company have power with our today's 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.860
 prototype don't forget to subscribe to 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.190
 our channel 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:02.139
 Soon there will be another video in which 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.950
 we will take off the oven which is ready 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:08.770
 for sale here and we compare it to 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:11.760
 prototype which today flooded 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.760
 bye everyone
