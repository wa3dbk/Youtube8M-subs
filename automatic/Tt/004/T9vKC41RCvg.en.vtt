what<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.519> think<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.940> sweetest

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
what do you think about the sweetest

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.779 
what do you think about the sweetest
circus<00:00:15.660> then<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.680> been<00:00:16.920> really<00:00:17.160> good<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:17.400> far

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
circus then it's been really good so far

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.470 
circus then it's been really good so far
this<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.779> third<00:00:19.020> track<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.590> bento<00:00:20.480> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
this is the the third track of bento and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.660 
this is the the third track of bento and
each<00:00:21.750> track<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.590> it's<00:00:23.189> quite<00:00:23.369> unique<00:00:23.519> in

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
each track is is it's quite unique in

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.480 
each track is is it's quite unique in
itself<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.650> first<00:00:25.920> circuit<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.430> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
itself this is the first circuit that is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.179 
itself this is the first circuit that is
quite<00:00:26.939> high<00:00:27.359> speed<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.990> we're<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.890> know<00:00:29.039> I'm

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
quite high speed so we're you know I'm

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.310 
quite high speed so we're you know I'm
just<00:00:29.429> taking<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.090> time<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.779> build

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just taking the time and time to build

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.440 
just taking the time and time to build
up<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> speed<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:33.180> think<00:00:33.270> I'm

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
up the speed and they I don't think I'm

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
up the speed and they I don't think I'm
too<00:00:33.630> far<00:00:33.840> away<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> piece<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.770> trying

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
too far away from the piece but trying

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.830 
too far away from the piece but trying
to<00:00:35.250> find<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> last<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:36.180> bits<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.690> is

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
to find the last little bits you know is

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.350 
to find the last little bits you know is
always<00:00:37.140> difficult<00:00:37.350> ok<00:00:37.980> let's<00:00:38.520> get<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.910> shot

is<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.440> little<00:02:09.009> bit<00:02:09.130> quicker<00:02:09.550> circuit<00:02:10.209> than<00:02:10.420> the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
is a little bit quicker circuit than the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.699 
is a little bit quicker circuit than the
other<00:02:10.690> ones<00:02:10.869> what<00:02:11.020> do<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.140> think<00:02:11.290> about<00:02:11.410> the

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
other ones what do you think about the

the two and all circuits have been till
you<00:02:23.890> are<00:02:23.980> very<00:02:24.250> challenging<00:02:24.850> because<00:02:25.060> you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
you are very challenging because you

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.810 
you are very challenging because you
know<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.720> types<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.550> have<00:02:27.700> to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
know the types and so you have to

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.900 
know the types and so you have to
be<00:02:27.850> very<00:02:27.970> precise<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.190> we<00:02:30.370> need<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.610> continue
