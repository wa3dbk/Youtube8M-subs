Amy in in character design you have to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.890 
Amy in in character design you have to
keep<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.670> mind<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.510> Sonic<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
keep in mind that when Sonic the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.010 
keep in mind that when Sonic the
fighters<00:01:07.350> came<00:01:07.590> out<00:01:07.770> Amy<00:01:08.700> Rose<00:01:09.150> still<00:01:09.630> looked

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
like her Sonic CD version so the fact

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.530 
like her Sonic CD version so the fact
that<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.470> honey<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.460> cat<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:14.909> looked

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that that honey the cat actually looked

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.810 
that that honey the cat actually looked
like<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.020> Dreamcast<00:01:16.710> version<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.250> Amy<00:01:17.460> Rose<00:01:17.790> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
like the Dreamcast version of Amy Rose a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.789 
like the Dreamcast version of Amy Rose a
couple<00:01:18.450> years<00:01:18.689> before<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.110> game<00:01:19.259> even<00:01:19.560> Kings

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
couple years before that game even Kings

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.050 
couple years before that game even Kings
out<00:01:20.040> leads<00:01:20.850> me<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> wonder<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:22.610> that<00:01:23.610> wasn't<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
out leads me to wonder if that wasn't a

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.899 
out leads me to wonder if that wasn't a
little<00:01:24.150> bit<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> inspiration<00:01:25.729> but<00:01:26.729> that's

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
little bit of inspiration but that's

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
little bit of inspiration but that's
speculation<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.960> course<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.380> using<00:01:28.590> an<00:01:28.770> Amy

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
speculation of course I'm using an Amy

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
speculation of course I'm using an Amy

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
start from the head as per usual I

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.179 
start from the head as per usual I
separated<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> eyes<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.840> gave<00:01:37.560> her<00:01:37.740> her<00:01:37.920> bangs

separated the eyes I gave her her bangs
and<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:39.840> might<00:01:39.990> notice<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.860> inside<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
ears are blue that's because there are a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340
