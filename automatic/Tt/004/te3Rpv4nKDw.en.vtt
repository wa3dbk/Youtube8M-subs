decide chucked the thing I like the
simplicity<00:00:13.329> and<00:00:14.789> the<00:00:15.789> key<00:00:16.330> switch<00:00:16.480> does

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
simplicity and the key switch does

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.830 
simplicity and the key switch does
explicity<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.650> plug<00:00:17.830> it<00:00:17.980> into<00:00:18.130> this<00:00:18.400> and<00:00:19.390> I'll

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
explicity and plug it into this and I'll

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.130 
explicity and plug it into this and I'll
show<00:00:19.870> you<00:00:21.330> I'm<00:00:22.330> going<00:00:22.510> to<00:00:22.600> do<00:00:22.690> this<00:00:22.840> in<00:00:23.050> the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
show you I'm going to do this in the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:34.220 
show you I'm going to do this in the
camera<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:32.410> piece<00:00:32.710> was<00:00:33.010> just<00:00:33.039> good<00:00:33.520> guys

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
camera that piece was just good guys

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.470 
camera that piece was just good guys
so<00:00:35.230> I<00:00:35.650> month<00:00:36.130> incorrectly<00:00:36.730> tested<00:00:37.360> the

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
so I month incorrectly tested the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.380 
so I month incorrectly tested the
solenoid<00:00:38.130> but<00:00:39.130> I'm<00:00:39.250> able<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.579> discharge<00:00:39.850> the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
solenoid but I'm able to discharge the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.470 
solenoid but I'm able to discharge the
solenoid<00:00:41.070> Roma<00:00:42.070> this<00:00:42.700> right<00:00:42.970> here<00:00:43.239> with<00:00:43.450> a

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
solenoid Roma this right here with a

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.250 
solenoid Roma this right here with a
screwdriver<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:45.010> it<00:00:45.190> starts<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:45.790> engine<00:00:46.260> so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
screwdriver and it starts the engine so

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.139 
screwdriver and it starts the engine so
that<00:00:47.410> must<00:00:47.710> not<00:00:47.890> mean<00:00:48.100> anything<00:00:48.280> my<00:00:48.640> solenoid

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
that must not mean anything my solenoid

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.319 
that must not mean anything my solenoid
must<00:00:49.420> be<00:00:49.570> bad<00:00:49.810> so<00:00:50.590> guys<00:00:51.010> this<00:00:51.610> is<00:00:51.670> our<00:00:51.970> Keith

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
must be bad so guys this is our Keith

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.000 
must be bad so guys this is our Keith
which<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:52.810> good<00:00:53.050> I<00:00:53.350> am<00:00:54.190> going<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:55.980> order<00:00:56.980> a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
which is good I am going to order a

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.200 
which is good I am going to order a
solenoid<00:00:58.470> and<00:00:59.470> on<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.950> tyre<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:00.850> probably

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
solenoid and on the tyre I'm probably

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.630 
solenoid and on the tyre I'm probably
going<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.660> try<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.930> get<00:01:02.110> it<00:01:02.230> off<00:01:02.410> or<00:01:03.280> I'll<00:01:03.399> wind

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
going to try to get it off or I'll wind

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.929 
going to try to get it off or I'll wind

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
air temporarily but it all leaked out

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.860 
air temporarily but it all leaked out
it's<00:01:12.070> got<00:01:12.310> plugs<00:01:12.670> in<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.090> it's<00:01:13.270> got<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.479> small

leaf out of the hole I'll show you what

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:33.560 
leaf out of the hole I'll show you what
I<00:01:19.330> did<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.960> console<00:01:20.680> hold<00:01:20.890> on<00:01:23.159> cut<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:24.280> open

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.109 

climbing<00:01:34.570> from<00:01:34.720> tractor<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.260> tractor<00:01:35.710> guys

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
climbing from tractor to tractor guys

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.090 
climbing from tractor to tractor guys
see<00:01:37.119> it<00:01:37.270> is<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.630> cut<00:01:38.380> a<00:01:38.409> little<00:01:38.500> hole<00:01:38.740> in<00:01:39.010> the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
see it is I cut a little hole in the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.380 
see it is I cut a little hole in the
console<00:01:39.640> there<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:42.700> get<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.000> ignition

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
console there and I to get the ignition

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.270 
console there and I to get the ignition
coil<00:01:43.630> out<00:01:43.810> there's<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.770> wire

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
coil out there's the wire

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.929 
coil out there's the wire
I<00:01:45.390> guess<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:46.659> wraps<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.290> guys<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.979> Taylor

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
I guess this wraps it up guys you Taylor

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.780 
I guess this wraps it up guys you Taylor
I<00:01:49.240> have<00:01:49.659> a<00:01:49.689> really<00:01:50.020> stupid<00:01:50.409> question<00:01:50.650> but<00:01:51.460> it

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
I have a really stupid question but it

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.719 
I have a really stupid question but it
might<00:01:52.000> make<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.240> lot<00:01:52.570> of<00:01:52.600> sense<00:01:52.930> now<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:54.070> turn<00:01:54.460> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
might make a lot of sense now I turn the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.870 
might make a lot of sense now I turn the
lights<00:01:55.150> on<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.799> turn<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.670> key

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
lights on this that I turn the key

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.929 
lights on this that I turn the key
switch<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> on<00:01:58.869> position<00:01:59.549> does<00:02:00.549> that<00:02:00.729> mean

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
switch to the on position does that mean

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.780 
switch to the on position does that mean
my<00:02:01.150> electricity<00:02:01.689> is<00:02:02.079> okay<00:02:02.530> because<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
my electricity is okay because the

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.120 
my electricity is okay because the
lights<00:02:04.600> are<00:02:04.810> currently<00:02:05.140> working<00:02:05.409> on<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.979> and

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
lights are currently working on it and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.580 
lights are currently working on it and
there's<00:02:06.850> odd<00:02:07.090> no<00:02:07.360> chewed<00:02:07.630> wires<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.289> I<00:02:08.379> just

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
just a three that's what my solenoid

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.690 
just a three that's what my solenoid
looks<00:02:32.379> like<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:34.180> wires<00:02:34.389> connecting<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.700> that

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
looks like the wires connecting it that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.479 
looks like the wires connecting it that
little<00:02:37.090> ground<00:02:37.599> wire<00:02:37.930> there<00:02:38.290> for<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:39.010> starter

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
little ground wire there for the starter

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.369 
little ground wire there for the starter
I<00:02:39.519> lost<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.060> bolt<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.840> tied<00:02:41.139> it<00:02:41.170> with

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
I lost the bolt to it so I tied it with

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.809 
I lost the bolt to it so I tied it with
like<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.730> Cotter<00:02:43.030> key<00:02:44.129> but<00:02:45.129> yeah<00:02:45.340> guys<00:02:45.549> let
