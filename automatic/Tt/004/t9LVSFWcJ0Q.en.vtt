see VHS most common I think I am I might
have<00:01:36.159> misspoke<00:01:36.580> there<00:01:36.970> I<00:01:37.240> think<00:01:37.869> that<00:01:38.080> it's

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
have misspoke there I think that it's

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.139 
have misspoke there I think that it's
actually<00:01:38.470> these<00:01:39.009> high<00:01:39.190> eights<00:01:39.429> that<00:01:39.700> we<00:01:39.909> see

actually these high eights that we see

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.340 
actually these high eights that we see
because<00:01:40.360> folks<00:01:40.690> have<00:01:40.899> these<00:01:41.049> high<00:01:41.170> eight

because folks have these high eight

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.260 
because folks have these high eight
cameras<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:41.950> can't<00:01:42.429> play<00:01:42.640> them<00:01:42.789> back<00:01:42.970> that's

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270
