00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
I mean the main thing but I would say

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.810 
I mean the main thing but I would say
was<00:04:36.530> that<00:04:36.680> shinobi<00:04:37.130> overextend<00:04:37.520> a<00:04:37.550> little<00:04:37.700> bit

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
trades and the over extensions that she

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.390

know<00:04:41.810> we<00:04:41.930> did<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.680> if<00:04:42.740> shinobi<00:04:43.040> Titans<00:04:43.310> his

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
know we did so if shinobi Titans his

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.830 
know we did so if shinobi Titans his
game<00:04:43.580> up<00:04:43.700> we<00:04:43.820> could<00:04:43.910> easily<00:04:44.210> see<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.390> game<00:04:44.600> 3

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.060 
game up we could easily see a game 3
epsilon<00:04:46.000> I<00:04:47.000> would<00:04:47.330> imagine<00:04:47.830> rafa<00:04:48.830> will

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
epsilon I would imagine rafa will

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.450 
epsilon I would imagine rafa will
probably<00:04:49.400> ban<00:04:49.580> stadium<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.890> can<00:04:51.890> see<00:04:52.010> that<00:04:52.040> yeah

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
probably ban stadium I can see that yeah
