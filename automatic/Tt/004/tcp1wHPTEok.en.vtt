fluval<00:00:08.719> think<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.809> doing<00:00:10.110> ok<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.650> is<00:00:10.769> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
fluval think is doing ok this is a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.850 
fluval think is doing ok this is a
low-tech<00:00:11.280> tank<00:00:11.870> low<00:00:12.870> maintenance<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.559> don't<00:00:13.710> do

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
low-tech tank low maintenance I don't do

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.960 
low-tech tank low maintenance I don't do
a<00:00:13.889> lot<00:00:13.980> i<00:00:14.190> did<00:00:14.519> trim<00:00:14.790> up<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:14.969> italian<00:00:15.599> valve

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
a lot i did trim up the italian valve

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:26.029 
a lot i did trim up the italian valve
which<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.180> growing<00:00:18.570> back<00:00:18.750> very<00:00:19.080> slowly<00:00:25.039> Crips

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
which is growing back very slowly Crips

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.730 
which is growing back very slowly Crips
I<00:00:26.310> haven't<00:00:26.519> showed<00:00:26.730> this<00:00:27.349> mostly<00:00:28.349> because<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I haven't showed this mostly because the

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.230 
I haven't showed this mostly because the
quips<00:00:29.010> went<00:00:29.250> through<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> melting<00:00:29.820> stage<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
quips went through the melting stage and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.580 
quips went through the melting stage and
I<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.779> very<00:00:30.869> ugly<00:00:31.289> when<00:00:31.410> they<00:00:31.529> do

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I just think it's very ugly when they do

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.190 
I just think it's very ugly when they do
that<00:00:31.679> but<00:00:32.690> there<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.870> coming<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:36.200> your

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that but there are coming back your

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.600 
that but there are coming back your
growth

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.730 

the<00:00:47.150> power<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.450> attack<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:47.930> longest<00:00:48.380> time<00:00:48.440> to

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:48.740 
the power of attack the longest time to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.640 
the power of attack the longest time to
melt<00:00:49.660> but<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.750> messed<00:00:50.990> with<00:00:51.080> it<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.320> couple<00:00:51.500> times

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
melt but I messed with it a couple times

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.590 
melt but I messed with it a couple times
so<00:00:52.190> maybe<00:00:52.610> that's<00:00:52.850> why<00:00:53.060> I<00:00:53.090> finally<00:00:53.630> did<00:00:53.870> but

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
so maybe that's why I finally did but

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.620 
so maybe that's why I finally did but
also<00:00:56.600> want<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:56.930> show<00:00:56.990> you<00:00:57.140> these<00:00:57.350> are<00:00:57.410> nubius

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
also want to show you these are nubius

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.390 
also want to show you these are nubius
they've<00:00:59.630> been<00:00:59.780> in<00:00:59.870> here<00:01:00.140> for<00:01:00.920> quite<00:01:01.130> a<00:01:01.190> while

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400

pretty much since day one I got a flower
going<00:01:04.729> on<00:01:04.880> back<00:01:05.120> here<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:05.660> just<00:01:06.200> noticed<00:01:06.620> it<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
going on back here I just noticed it the

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:16.690 
going on back here I just noticed it the
other<00:01:07.070> day<00:01:14.110> now<00:01:15.190> what<00:01:16.190> do<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.310> guys<00:01:16.430> might

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
other day now what do you guys might

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.310 
other day now what do you guys might
think<00:01:16.729> I<00:01:17.090> took<00:01:17.150> this<00:01:17.450> out<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.690> my<00:01:17.900> other<00:01:18.050> tank

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
think I took this out of my other tank

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.590 
think I took this out of my other tank
because<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:18.650> said<00:01:18.860> I<00:01:18.890> was<00:01:19.100> talented<00:01:19.460> down<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.970> did

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
because I said I was talented down I did

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.900 
because I said I was talented down I did
tear<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.960> down<00:01:21.020> I<00:01:21.170> took<00:01:21.440> all<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.890> anubias<00:01:22.310> that

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
tear it down I took all the anubias that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.969 
tear it down I took all the anubias that
were<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.360> 56<00:01:24.080> gallon<00:01:24.440> and<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.590> put<00:01:24.770> him<00:01:24.890> into

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
were in the 56 gallon and I put him into

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.560 
were in the 56 gallon and I put him into
36<00:01:25.550> gallon<00:01:26.170> none<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.259> them<00:01:27.380> came<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:27.650> this<00:01:27.890> tank

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
36 gallon none of them came in this tank

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.130 
36 gallon none of them came in this tank
it's<00:01:29.570> just<00:01:31.330> as<00:01:32.330> you<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.600> see<00:01:32.810> there's<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
it's just as you can see there's the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.580 
it's just as you can see there's the
root<00:01:33.320> system<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:34.960> mean<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.050> can<00:01:36.200> tell<00:01:36.350> that's

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
root system I mean you can tell that's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.190 
root system I mean you can tell that's
been<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:36.950> while<00:01:37.180> that's<00:01:38.180> growing<00:01:38.960> right

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
been in a while that's growing right

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:48.270 
been in a while that's growing right
down<00:01:39.410> in<00:01:39.680> there

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.170 

just<00:01:49.240> coincidence<00:01:50.970> for<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.150> nubius<00:01:53.049> I<00:01:53.380> mean

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
just coincidence for the nubius I mean

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.789 
just coincidence for the nubius I mean
amaze<00:01:55.180> myself<00:01:55.450> because<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.170> mean<00:01:56.350> I've<00:01:56.500> had<00:01:56.650> an

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
amaze myself because I mean I've had an

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.060 
amaze myself because I mean I've had an
obvious<00:01:57.190> but<00:01:57.880> one<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.150> my<00:01:58.240> first<00:01:58.479> plans<00:01:59.070> been

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
obvious but one of my first plans been

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.940 
obvious but one of my first plans been
for<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.369> long<00:02:00.400> time<00:02:00.820> and<00:02:01.020> many<00:02:02.020> different<00:02:02.470> tanks

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
for a long time and many different tanks

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.330 
for a long time and many different tanks
and<00:02:04.020> finally<00:02:05.020> get<00:02:05.259> him<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.590> flower<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.130> I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
and finally get him to flower and I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.710 
and finally get him to flower and I
thought<00:02:06.550> it<00:02:06.640> was<00:02:06.700> because<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.240> high<00:02:07.390> tech

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
thought it was because of the high tech

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.050 
thought it was because of the high tech
to<00:02:07.899> pressurize<00:02:08.440> all<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.729> pressure<00:02:09.940> I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
to pressurize all that the pressure I

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.520 
to pressurize all that the pressure I
co2<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:13.330> i<00:02:13.450> said<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.810> tank<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.230> very

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
co2 but like i said this tank is very

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.630 
co2 but like i said this tank is very
low-tech<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:15.280> don't<00:02:15.489> use<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:18.040> use<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.400> little

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
low-tech I don't use I do use a little

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.630 
low-tech I don't use I do use a little
bit<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:18.790> fruits<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.720> flourish<00:02:20.400> when<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
bit of fruits the flourish when I do a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.430 
bit of fruits the flourish when I do a
water<00:02:21.940> change<00:02:22.890> that's<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.430> don't<00:02:24.880> use<00:02:25.440> excel

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
water change that's it I don't use excel

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.860 
water change that's it I don't use excel
in<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.800> tank<00:02:27.900> no<00:02:28.900> co2<00:02:29.140> at<00:02:29.530> all<00:02:30.570> this<00:02:31.570> is<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
in this tank no co2 at all this is the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.530 
in this tank no co2 at all this is the
stock<00:02:32.140> light<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.650> came<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.040> oh<00:02:36.540> just

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
stock light that came with it oh just

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.600 
stock light that came with it oh just
the<00:02:37.750> glass<00:02:37.989> ugly<00:02:38.350> pipe<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:38.769> it's<00:02:38.920> a

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.380 

what<00:02:43.210> I<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.190> thought<00:02:45.430> was<00:02:45.580> pretty<00:02:45.640> amazing
