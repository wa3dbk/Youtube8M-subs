 bring out things that I think are 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.650
 important 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.080
 by viewing what guy nantel has posted 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 this dear morning you mention 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.610

 and tocs keep seals the number of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.230
 names way because I would say that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.780
 I walk a little bit 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.079
 comments from the leaders and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.300
 shoulders then destroys people 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.360
 listen to high tv since comment there 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.230
 above then it's a little bit distressing 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 that I am small focus relay 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.590
 me and I would like to sofa with you not 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.660
 that it is very important to competitors 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.980
 it's indicated at the end of a video that 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.180
 have just keep the answers the 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.850
 negative responses that have watched the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.780
 good answers people who were filmed 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.189
 during the vox pop 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.270
 you're going to make me yes was created to 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.810
 the end that there were answers 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.080
 positive 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.030
 there were just 2 3 yes but they have 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.130
 still been removed because it takes 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.299
 still keep his size it's on the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.770
 principle of vox pop 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.930
 it's going to ask questions in 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.530
 the street and keep the answers the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.479
 more breathtaking to make a video 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.500
 sensational has been done for a long time 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 since a long time 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.729
 it's still very often a 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.159
 show is this really known to the states 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.229
 united called jimmy kimmel live 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.610
 they do the same thing live in the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.650
 street they ask very questions 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 simple to people who pose a slight 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.390
 answered intercitÃ©s because that's it 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.430
 it's on the sports blog bigard gillian 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.189
 simply the countries meet the girls the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.329
 correct answers and removes them from editing 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.920
 accepted bears a downside that 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.329
 they removed the correct answers from 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.149
 videos have kept the country 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.579
 so stop talking about this video there 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.200
 as if tomorrow was representative 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.869
 because that's not the case at all 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.430
 if 2 2 it was a scientific study 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.610
 because it's not at all the case ok 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.009
 to understand it's the second time 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.060
 how much have I suffered from 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.270
 you who negatively commented who 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.220
 students are trisomics 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.150
 mentally retarded 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.120
 how many of you had already 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.160
 so much gameiro gameiro television 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.099
 channel to someone with a microphone for 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.470
 ask questions I will you 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.000
 ask because I have already been in 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.730
 this situation can not I tell you a 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.640
 thing for a lot of young safar but 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.980
 we sport everything is in front of gameiro ok 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.140
 it makes them extremely stressed and 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.510
 what it's all about 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.220
 that his cut the memory that I know 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.660
 make the person you can him I 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.430
 will have bids to answer to 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 questions 5 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.530
 how can i do it 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.080
 understand if you've never been 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.540
 before gameiro had cost how many 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.489
 times it was already dreaming you are 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.250
 with people you have an idea or you 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.590
 have a word a 5th you know you 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.630
 know but not come to mind 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.540
 why because you are in two 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.430
 spots because of the stress of trying to 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.650
 find the answer 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.500
 this effect the water and documented it is known 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.450
 ok that was studied with them both 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.690
 mannequins and wants to be in front of a 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.150
 observer will have an impact on the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.140
 answers are not or should not forget 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.670
 this hockey must not be forgotten 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.549
 the interaction is influenced by 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.870
 the observatory by the camera by the 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.980
 micro we do not dare stress anxiety 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.180
 Judges will not go to you anyway 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.709
 look in your eyes then tell you 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.180
 that answers like the English accent 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.769
 with the acute accent it was borderline 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.000
 delayed ok we'll get along 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.900
 there are officials who was 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.720
 frightful but gaf sounds in loincloth 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.220
 written in front of a camera 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.880
 it's stressful it makes you lose sight of 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.859
 understand you be a good point that 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.930
 I would like to make comments then 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.519
 I see play and I talked about 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.549

 worked with people from 40 to 140 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.680
 feel included in the middle the 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.690

 simple it's so many have to get back a 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.630
 little in question 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:11.190
 you judge have judged the students but to 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.620
 knowledge that you yourself do not 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.110
 do not own you judge people because 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.580
 that he does not really have to lead 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.760
 be a little bit honest the money 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.970
 hypocrisy even manon stone gertrude 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.410

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.950
 ages that are highly grown in Quebec 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.530
 but I would tell you that a big part 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.190
 of the population is uneducated and land 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.120
 can start 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:41.389
 nothing can cultivate to take me let's be 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.820
 have its touch not just the students 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.760
 okay finally the last point 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.889
 I would like to do with you ok understand 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.820
 the guy of nantel guy 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.500
 it's the first time I'm doing 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.789
 a beautiful sport like that there are two 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.560
 negative answers in video 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.080
 sensationalist who announces a lot of 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.530
 view to then plunge his show to 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.849
 the end so we'll see the doctor in 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.250
 perspective suffers pain 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.830
 understand dinantais enjoys extremely 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.190
 videos like that it puts on the 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.130
 map 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.050
 because guy nantel the humorist one 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.490
 mean that on me for me it's a 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.289
 little exceeded in 2015 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.660
 the judge I do not love me I can qualify 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.729
 this man says is only my mauresmo 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.770
 personal opinion 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:25.139
 listen to that and it benefits a lot to guy 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.000
 nantel videos like that because he 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.039
 rain his show at the end a glock 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.020
 which places his show tickets 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.490
 these current rooms it gives him a 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.560
 visit 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.210
 and and that's always important in 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.370
 media in the videos in that we 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.639
 consumes in what we read when 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.699
 look at asking yourself the question 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.050
 born most of the person behind 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.940
 information as present at this time 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.280
 can ask the same question with me 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.810
 what is my goal my goal is 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.060
 just to look at that from our 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:57.050
 perspectives but to people who have 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.849
 goals that have specific goals 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.039
 by introducing you something 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:04.669
 representatives of the media videos 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:07.550
 byte dinan at it takes advantage of this video 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:09.650
 so understand that it was his goal a 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.319
 little bit of lens to sensational and 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.190
 do not be objective not to show 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.069
 reality 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.650
 personally I went through the 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.180
 cg by the university i would like to say to 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.819
 every day every week I 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.569
 jase with young people from 15 to 25 years old I 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.360
 would like one thing 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:28.550
 this youth impresses me 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.199
 mostly with his ideas on this 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.110
 youth wants to change things 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.759
 she is idealistic this youth the to 

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:39.139
 what she wants to change the system of 

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:40.639
 marble that you have left us by what 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.460
 it may be that I do not expect very much 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:44.870
 young cegep kids hat 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.610
 what is the precise reason for what
