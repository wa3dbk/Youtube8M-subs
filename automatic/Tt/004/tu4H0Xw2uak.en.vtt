00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.830
 a wonderful good day everyone 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.930
 together 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.110
 I have this one more for you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.389
 brought ominous bathing for today 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.809
 is a great day we catch 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.240
 namely to rehearse for the loose today 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.210
 album and we will go in next week 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 studio to record this album 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.560
 and of course we will get you out of that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 studio out with fresh video material 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.090
 feed that then uploaded to youtube 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.930
 is going to take a camera 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.610
 and yes we will show you how at home 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.090
 Study looks and how they have 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.809
 record and how jÃ¶rg looks like ours 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.219
 studio master and so on and so forth 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.789
 and we thought about you 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.739
 a little tasty to make the album 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 and, of course, that's the bathing thing 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 exclusive revealing video on the cd 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.289
 will do where he then scarf and cap 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.350
 and everything will decrease and you finally 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.809
 his face looks but only on the tw 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.799
 that will not be uploaded to youtube 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.150
 haha yes marketing marketing and who that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.790
 roof provides the must with legal 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.020
 steps 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.850
 exactly with jail and so and yes we have 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 us a little something 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.670
 written down and become a whole now 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.170
 short metal over 45 songs from the album 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.420
 Let's play it for a very short time 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.490
 insight gets like the album like that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.490
 will generally listen and start 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:18.410
 your sword and ever and then 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.410
 no heavy and f minor 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.390
 that would be legal 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.990
 I can not ask that anymore 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.050
 only the same people ask 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.990
 just want songs over 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.810
 that is certainly not in vain because 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:55.990
 he is not wrong but there I go 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:03:02.760
 but rather beneficial cinema as slowly as 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:08.370
 me the rhymes because of this barrier 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:13.030
 executable career because I'm pure and 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.040
 Then he asks the question I do not know 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.440
 if I was to speak otherwise 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:25.490
 then been cleared when slopes know 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.490
 we get a set 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:04:04.500
 yes yes yes we last yes yes yes yes please 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:04:10.910
 please love him but thank you yes yes yes yes 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.910
 yes yes yes yes yes yes 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.690
 ugh 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.079
 you will see you look merchant 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.530
 we are already standing and sprouting 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.570
 not that many shot 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.530
 We already live in the cellar 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:51.290
 we do not know where to go so buy the cd 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.290
 that is a win for us and you, though 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:04.860
 100% improvised the conclusion yes 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:07.979
 Of course we hope that many 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.729
 Many people buy the CD and look us out 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:14.300
 our under-cave sees us 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.500
 have recorded to record the cd 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.840
 in fact, very quickly 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.000
 catapult out again 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:24.870
 the bader had tuberculosis when their de 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.100
 I want to stand up no we are in the 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.930
 frame illness not that with 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:37.320
 reddish possible trigger that comes 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:40.979
 but the whole thing looks like alcohol 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.570
 from the seventh march hopefully on nannys 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.639
 because everything works with the gema and 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.139
 you had to do a lot 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.210
 now stop dying or bother 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.580
 quietly I would like to micro 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.840
 LOSS 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.880
 we wish you a wonderful 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.020
 rest of the weekend again worry you 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.320
 in the next two weeks with all 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.510
 many snippets of information that you 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.260
 keep up to date and up to date 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.479
 videos and to date remains 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.430
 the run for oh so than as manni 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.349
 Skt concludes it plays 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.860
 our goal is our hitherto sad song 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.860
 providers 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:42.100
 they are the fuel prices I do 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.100
 the thing
