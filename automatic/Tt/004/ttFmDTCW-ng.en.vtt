00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.990 
sure enough she stepped behind a branch
full<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.149> leaves<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.750> just<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.229> no<00:01:55.470> shot<00:01:56.000> so

full of leaves I just I had no shot so

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
full of leaves I just I had no shot so
she<00:01:57.030> stood<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.960> while<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.560> kept

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
she stood there for a while and kept
looking<00:01:59.850> up<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.149> me<00:02:00.180> she<00:02:00.899> knew<00:02:01.020> something

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
looking up at me she knew something

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.770 
looking up at me she knew something
wasn't<00:02:01.469> right<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.939> she<00:02:02.939> started<00:02:03.299> walking<00:02:03.479> away

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
wasn't right so she started walking away

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630 
wasn't right so she started walking away
