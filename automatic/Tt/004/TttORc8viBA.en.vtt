00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.040 

amazingly<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.610> issue<00:02:08.910> has<00:02:09.300> been<00:02:09.509> solved

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
amazingly this issue has been solved

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.130 
amazingly this issue has been solved
well<00:02:10.709> almost<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.580> research<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.690> development

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
well almost the research and development

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.990 
well almost the research and development
is<00:02:13.200> done<00:02:13.470> there's<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.220> treatment<00:02:14.519> out<00:02:14.730> now<00:02:14.940> that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
is done there's a treatment out now that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.729 
is done there's a treatment out now that
carries<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> ninety-five<00:02:16.080> percent<00:02:16.230> chance<00:02:16.560> of

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
carries a ninety-five percent chance of

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.699 
carries a ninety-five percent chance of
success<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.340> his<00:02:17.430> pain<00:02:17.790> free<00:02:18.350> low-cost<00:02:19.350> and

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
success in his pain free low-cost and

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.280 
success in his pain free low-cost and
non-surgical<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.269> it<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.480> be<00:02:21.570> implemented<00:02:22.019> in

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
non-surgical so it can be implemented in

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.050 
non-surgical so it can be implemented in
places<00:02:22.709> where<00:02:22.830> surgery<00:02:23.310> would<00:02:23.489> be<00:02:23.610> expensive

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
places where surgery would be expensive

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.440 
places where surgery would be expensive
and<00:02:24.360> unsanitary<00:02:25.549> but<00:02:26.549> that<00:02:26.700> option<00:02:26.910> simply

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
and unsanitary but that option simply

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.890 
and unsanitary but that option simply
wasn't<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.260> standard<00:02:28.739> when<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.040> was<00:02:29.190> born<00:02:29.400> I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
wasn't the standard when I was born I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.660 
wasn't the standard when I was born I
still<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.080> clubfoot<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.040> my<00:02:32.160> feet<00:02:32.459> had<00:02:32.640> been
