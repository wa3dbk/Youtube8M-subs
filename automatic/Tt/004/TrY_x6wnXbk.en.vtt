00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.320
 hello my dear ones 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.930
 my name is quaco a tricio robbery 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.329
 and today I am going to tell you a beautiful story 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.089
 the story is called 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.349
 the employment president 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.369
 everything started when in 2006 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.519
 candidate felipe calder贸n 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.390
 He promised to create jobs for all Mexicans and Mexicans that Vincent 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.699
 fox I start from wet to united states 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 I do not remember perfectly 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.390
 he took it like him 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.260
 Felipe Calder贸n 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.290
 Germany 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.410
 promising athletes 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.020
 I think we all realize that Calder贸n is not the goal that is not what 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.680
 he promised us 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.060
 and for sample listen to this 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.610
 in a study conducted by the world economic forum in collaboration with 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.750
 the university make it clear it was shown that mexico fell eight positions 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.970
 guatemala rose 3 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.500
 60 of 134 countries evaluated were placed on the site 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.380
 Mexico was placed in 110th place in the labor market 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.060
 qualifying it with 3 points 97 on a scale of 0 to 10 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.830
 labor markets are below the Latin American average 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 which is at four points 15 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.720
 remember that labor lags encourage informal activities that 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.110
 employment this leads to poor tax collection and in turn to 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.979
 a poor investment of the federation and state governments 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.210
 the story is not over yet 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.970
 a few days ago a news was published that the government of Calder贸n has 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.840
 generated more poor 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.840
 the number of unemployed is the worst in nine years 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.869
 and that's why obviously the number of poor people increase 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:58.970
 eleven 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.250
 is ready but can not find work 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.020
 that's why I'm going to strongly promote the investment 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 so that you have a good job you are in danger of the biblical name published data 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.880
 after the survey on the expectations of the specialists in 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.859
 private sector economy as of June 2009 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.319
 that they elaborated 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.969
 it is expected that the economic contraction of the country this year will be located in six 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.000
 31% points 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.260
 which will cause a possible loss of 656 thousand job places 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.329
 We could use the global economic crisis as a pretext 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:41.979
 but we have other Latin American countries like Brazil Costa Rica 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.879
 and even Venezuela has resented it as much as Mexico 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.280
 there will be if we do not win in football but in unemployment 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:55.829
 unfortunately the story has not been finished and we have three more years left 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.079
 of the president's government of unemployment 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.209
 sonicwall cuatriciclo robbery 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.589

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:06.169
