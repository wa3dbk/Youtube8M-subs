 beautiful flowers today 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.160
 to start apply a clear base 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.230
 we will make a thick French with a 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.990
 Sponge for gradient and paint 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.880
 blue green acrylic we will use a brush 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.000
 to apply the paint on our 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.980
 sponge we will use the sponge to make 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.990
 others is thick on the free edge in 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.420
 our nail 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.579
 once dry we will apply enamel 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.200
 litmus on the tip of our nail and what 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.870
 degrade we have towards the center of the 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.120
 pot the same thing we will do in each of 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.840
 our nails only that we will use a 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.879
 different color in each of them 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.040
 we will use a thick totem to perform 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.970
 the petals indo state title for 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.220
 to partner with the center 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.830
 for the first flower use of paint 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.650
 ACRYLIC with fuchsia will make 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.850
 keep them in the same tone at the end 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.850
 from the edge of the pot 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.460
 we will make the second flower in the other 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.119

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.780
 once our flowers are dry 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.480
 we will use another tone very similar to the one 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.330
 we apply but more clearly to make a 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.980
 flower within which we have already had in 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.960
 mind that the flower that we will make in the 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.830
 center will be a little smaller so that 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.750
 you see the color of the base of the ball 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.660
 a yellow flower we will use a yellow 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.660
 cake for the fuchsia flower we use a 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.830
 light pink and for the coral we will use a 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.830
 much older tone 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.600
 then we will make the sheets with a 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.990
 thin doping and green acrylic paint 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.990

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.120
 the top of the unne 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.130
 we will make the center of the flower with the 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.130
 doping tool and black acrylic paint 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.900
