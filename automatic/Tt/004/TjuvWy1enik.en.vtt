first track is sex which is I think one

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.020 
first track is sex which is I think one
of<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> singles<00:00:43.770> he<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.340> one<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> tracks

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
of the singles he or one of the tracks

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
of the singles he or one of the tracks
he<00:00:45.270> teased<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> put<00:00:46.260> up<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> internet

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
he teased and put up on the internet

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.650 
he teased and put up on the internet
before<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.340> album<00:00:47.550> came<00:00:47.579> out<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.539> it's

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
before the album came out and it's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.790 
before the album came out and it's
actually<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> pretty<00:00:49.140> good<00:00:49.289> track<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.710> got

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
actually a pretty good track it's got

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
actually a pretty good track it's got
like<00:00:49.950> an<00:00:50.070> 80s<00:00:50.280> vibe<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.059> very<00:00:51.270> cool

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
like an 80s vibe to it it's a very cool

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
like an 80s vibe to it it's a very cool
song<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.680> great<00:00:52.860> way<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> start<00:00:53.280> off<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
song it's a great way to start off the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.240 
song it's a great way to start off the
album<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.989> next<00:00:55.110> song<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.410> actually<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> lead

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
album the next song is actually the lead

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.430 
album the next song is actually the lead
single<00:00:56.640> off<00:00:56.789> off<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> album<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> think<00:00:58.350> he

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
single off off the album and I think he

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
single off off the album and I think he
performed<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.280> America's<00:00:59.850> Got<00:00:59.969> Talent

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509

on the whole album is a song called
strut<00:02:53.630> which<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.650> also<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.700> name<00:02:55.850> of<00:02:55.880> the

tie<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.360> album<00:02:56.750> but<00:02:57.410> it's<00:02:57.800> probably<00:02:58.160> my

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
tie of the album but it's probably my

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.620 
tie of the album but it's probably my
favorite<00:02:58.730> song<00:02:58.850> after<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.120> album<00:02:59.420> set

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
favorite song after all album set

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.880 
favorite song after all album set
there's<00:02:59.810> really<00:03:00.020> great<00:03:00.230> funky<00:03:00.709> instrumental

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
the lyrics are really good and I really

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.960 
the lyrics are really good and I really
feel<00:03:04.010> like<00:03:04.040> maybe<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.520> should<00:03:04.730> have<00:03:04.820> been

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
feel like maybe this should have been

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.760 
feel like maybe this should have been
the<00:03:05.090> lead<00:03:05.239> single<00:03:05.510> released<00:03:05.900> off<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.230> album

the lead single released off the album

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.440 
the lead single released off the album
that<00:03:07.190> being<00:03:07.400> said<00:03:07.610> it'll<00:03:07.850> probably<00:03:08.090> be<00:03:08.330> the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
that being said it'll probably be the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.880 
that being said it'll probably be the
second<00:03:08.750> or<00:03:08.870> third<00:03:08.900> single<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.530> wouldn't<00:03:09.739> be

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
second or third single I wouldn't be

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.699 
second or third single I wouldn't be
surprised<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.959> next<00:03:12.170> song<00:03:12.260> after<00:03:12.590> that

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
surprised and the next song after that

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.310 
surprised and the next song after that
is<00:03:12.890> a<00:03:12.920> song<00:03:13.220> called<00:03:13.250> she's<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.700> beast<00:03:14.320> it's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
chilled much more relaxed kind of song I

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.360 
chilled much more relaxed kind of song I
feel<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.200> first<00:03:18.380> half<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.890> album<00:03:19.220> is

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
feel like the first half of the album is

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.810 
feel like the first half of the album is
much<00:03:20.090> more<00:03:20.480> I<00:03:21.140> would<00:03:21.500> say<00:03:21.530> up-tempo<00:03:22.310> kind<00:03:22.700> of

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
much more I would say up-tempo kind of

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.880 
much more I would say up-tempo kind of
music<00:03:23.780> it's<00:03:23.930> a<00:03:23.959> lot<00:03:24.049> more<00:03:24.170> funky<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> little

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
music it's a lot more funky a little

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.890 
music it's a lot more funky a little
more<00:03:24.980> faster<00:03:25.400> paced<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.299> second<00:03:26.660> half<00:03:26.810> of

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
more faster paced and the second half of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.330 
more faster paced and the second half of
the<00:03:26.989> album<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.500> little<00:03:27.709> more<00:03:27.860> slower<00:03:28.190> a

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
the album is a little more slower a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.120 
the album is a little more slower a
little<00:03:28.400> more<00:03:28.700> chill<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.739> I'd<00:03:30.739> say<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.070> a

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
little more chill and I'd say it's a

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.280 
little more chill and I'd say it's a
little<00:03:31.220> more<00:03:31.310> stripped-down<00:03:31.730> too<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.390> now

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
little more stripped-down too and now

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.140 
little more stripped-down too and now
she's<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.530> beast<00:03:33.830> is<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.040> really<00:03:34.459> good<00:03:34.640> song<00:03:34.880> the

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
she's a beast is a really good song the

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.120 
she's a beast is a really good song the
guitar<00:03:35.269> there's<00:03:36.110> a<00:03:36.170> great<00:03:36.350> mix<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.799> acoustic

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
guitar there's a great mix of acoustic

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.720 
guitar there's a great mix of acoustic
and<00:03:37.640> electric<00:03:38.060> guitars<00:03:38.390> on<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:39.650> album<00:03:40.010> and<00:03:40.190> I

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
and electric guitars on the album and I

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.610 
and electric guitars on the album and I
think<00:03:41.269> just<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.900> side<00:03:42.080> is<00:03:42.200> just<00:03:42.440> another

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
think just this side is just another

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.440 
think just this side is just another
song<00:03:42.890> it<00:03:43.010> shows<00:03:43.250> how<00:03:43.400> awesome<00:03:43.790> Craig<00:03:44.000> Ross<00:03:44.180> is

me<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.790> little<00:04:26.000> bit<00:04:26.180> of<00:04:26.300> the<00:04:26.690> song<00:04:26.960> Footloose<00:04:27.500> by

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
me a little bit of the song Footloose by

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.290 
me a little bit of the song Footloose by
Kenny<00:04:27.980> Loggins<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.790> you've<00:04:28.940> ever<00:04:29.090> heard<00:04:29.240> of

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
Kenny Loggins if you've ever heard of

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.930 
Kenny Loggins if you've ever heard of
that<00:04:29.419> song<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:30.410> the<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:31.190> riff<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:31.730> just

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
that song just the the riff and it just

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.460 
that song just the the riff and it just
for<00:04:32.120> some<00:04:32.240> reason<00:04:32.419> they<00:04:32.660> sound<00:04:32.930> very<00:04:32.960> similar

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
for some reason they sound very similar

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.020 
for some reason they sound very similar
although<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.950> think<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.340> riff<00:04:34.520> for<00:04:34.730> the<00:04:34.790> bass

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
although I think the riff for the bass

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.650 
although I think the riff for the bass
sounds<00:04:35.419> like<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.600> guitar<00:04:35.990> in<00:04:36.820> Footloose<00:04:37.820> but

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
sounds like the guitar in Footloose but

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.629 
sounds like the guitar in Footloose but
it's<00:04:39.380> still<00:04:39.620> in<00:04:39.800> one<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:40.040> the<00:04:40.100> best<00:04:40.340> it's<00:04:40.520> also
