sculpt<00:01:13.020> lots<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.530> detail<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.180> just

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

the<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> hems<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> everything<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.040> pants

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the the hems and everything on the pants

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.440

the<00:01:17.549> pockets<00:01:19.009> watch<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.340> actual<00:01:20.610> combat

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450

armor<00:01:21.780> she's<00:01:21.960> wearing<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.820> think<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.880> doing<00:01:24.090> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
armor she's wearing I think if doing in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.789 
armor she's wearing I think if doing in
a<00:01:24.270> fairly<00:01:24.479> different<00:01:24.750> look<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.170> Appleseed

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a fairly different look in Appleseed

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.060 
a fairly different look in Appleseed
alpha<00:01:26.570> generally<00:01:27.570> does<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.930> short<00:01:28.229> hair<00:01:28.290> but

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
alpha generally does have short hair but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100 
alpha generally does have short hair but
they<00:01:29.460> give<00:01:29.579> her<00:01:29.729> kind<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.180> little<00:01:30.900> bit

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
they give her kind of a little bit

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.850 
they give her kind of a little bit
shorter<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.040> style<00:01:33.320> I'm<00:01:34.320> actually<00:01:34.530> digging

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
shorter of a style I'm actually digging

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.260 
shorter of a style I'm actually digging
the<00:01:35.040> look<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.549> looks<00:01:35.729> she<00:01:36.119> looks

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
the look I think it looks she looks

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
the look I think it looks she looks
quite<00:01:36.479> nice<00:01:37.220> like<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.310> said<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.520> lots<00:01:38.970> and
