started this one is fairly powerful for
a<00:00:31.140> game<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.560> suppressor<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.920> should<00:00:35.190> not

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
a game like suppressor so it should not

looking at the desk later color quality

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.670 
looking at the desk later color quality
is<00:00:40.559> very<00:00:40.829> saturated<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:43.440> brightness

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
is very saturated and the brightness

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.650 
is very saturated and the brightness
contrast<00:00:44.070> levels<00:00:44.610> are<00:00:44.670> also<00:00:44.820> very<00:00:45.120> good<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
contrast levels are also very good I

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.100 
contrast levels are also very good I
just<00:00:46.530> saw<00:00:46.739> increase<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:48.300> usually<00:00:48.780> happens

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
just saw increase this usually happens

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.520 
just saw increase this usually happens
with<00:00:49.289> softer<00:00:49.680> side<00:00:50.539> but<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.050> gameplay

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
with softer side but do all the gameplay

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:12.400 
with softer side but do all the gameplay
is<00:00:52.770> smooth<00:00:53.039> here

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.600 

and<00:01:13.410> now<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.830> doing<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.250> frontline

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and now we are doing the frontline

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.240 
and now we are doing the frontline
commando<00:01:15.000> 2<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.480> be<00:01:15.830> supremely<00:01:16.830> powerful

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
commando 2 will be supremely powerful

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.940 
commando 2 will be supremely powerful
bit<00:01:17.670> lonely<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.260> can't<00:01:22.500> seem<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> be

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
bit lonely and I can't seem to be

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.460 
bit lonely and I can't seem to be
playing<00:01:23.160> well<00:01:23.460> on<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:26.720> let's<00:01:27.720> pop<00:01:28.050> that<00:01:28.229> any

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
playing well on this let's pop that any

00:01:28.470 --> 00:02:02.770 
playing well on this let's pop that any
and<00:01:28.820> sign<00:01:29.820> shoot<00:01:30.180> at<00:01:30.360> cost

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.330 

the<00:02:03.780> gameplay<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.229> very<00:02:04.470> smooth<00:02:04.979> on<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the gameplay is very smooth on the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.059 
the gameplay is very smooth on the
frontline<00:02:05.820> commando<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.829> we<00:02:07.860> are

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
frontline commando and here we are

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.070 
frontline commando and here we are
playing<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.489> s4<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:08.910> eight<00:02:09.149> let's<00:02:09.690> see<00:02:09.899> how

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
playing the s4 at eight let's see how

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:28.180 
playing the s4 at eight let's see how
this<00:02:10.289> device

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.000 

the<00:02:29.190> display<00:02:29.520> does<00:02:29.730> look<00:02:29.880> fairly<00:02:30.120> sharp<00:02:31.010> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the display does look fairly sharp and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.940 
the display does look fairly sharp and
the<00:02:32.370> control<00:02:32.820> on<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.480> car<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.410> also<00:02:34.680> very<00:02:34.800> good

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
the control on the car is also very good

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.890 
the control on the car is also very good
I'm<00:02:35.880> evil<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.510> very<00:02:36.690> precisely<00:02:36.840> maneuver<00:02:38.900> do

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
I'm evil to very precisely maneuver do

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.990 
I'm evil to very precisely maneuver do
the<00:02:40.050> drapes<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:42.620> control<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.800> ours<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:44.970> it's

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
the drapes and control like ours so it's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.900 
the drapes and control like ours so it's
playing<00:02:45.480> really<00:02:45.660> well<00:02:45.930> when<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> comes<00:02:46.710> to<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
playing really well when it comes to the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:04:56.820 
playing really well when it comes to the
controls

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.910 

and<00:04:57.580> we<00:04:57.850> managed<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.390> finish<00:04:58.540> first<00:04:59.320> in<00:04:59.560> style

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
and we managed to finish first in style

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.400 
and we managed to finish first in style
and<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.670> did<00:05:00.970> not<00:05:01.150> stutter<00:05:01.510> at<00:05:01.870> all<00:05:02.170> when<00:05:02.380> it

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
and it did not stutter at all when it

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.560 
and it did not stutter at all when it
comes<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.830> graphics<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.730> control<00:05:04.090> was<00:05:04.270> very

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
comes to graphics the control was very

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.660 
comes to graphics the control was very
well<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.260> I've<00:05:05.470> been<00:05:05.650> playing<00:05:05.920> this<00:05:06.130> full

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
well and I've been playing this full

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.250 
well and I've been playing this full
level<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.120> there<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.360> slight<00:05:07.660> amount<00:05:08.050> of

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
level and there is slight amount of

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.500 
level and there is slight amount of
vault<00:05:08.590> near<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:09.580> logo<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.120> rear<00:05:10.270> but

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.960 
vault near the you logo in the rear but
it<00:05:10.690> is<00:05:10.810> not<00:05:10.960> uncomfortably<00:05:11.740> hot<00:05:12.040> it<00:05:12.280> does<00:05:12.790> not

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
it is not uncomfortably hot it does not

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.610 
it is not uncomfortably hot it does not
heat<00:05:13.210> up<00:05:13.240> too<00:05:13.570> much<00:05:13.750> probably<00:05:14.020> two<00:05:14.500> or<00:05:14.530> three

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
heat up too much probably two or three

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.230 
heat up too much probably two or three
degrees<00:05:15.040> difference<00:05:15.490> from<00:05:15.760> rest<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.120> the
