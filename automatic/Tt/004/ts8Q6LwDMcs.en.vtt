00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.670 
learning we recognize that a lot of
admission<00:03:55.570> of<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.780> airplane<00:03:56.050> will<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.530> at

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
admission of the airplane will be at

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.040 
admission of the airplane will be at
night<00:03:56.890> once<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.280> airplane<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.730> fielded<00:03:58.180> so<00:03:58.480> we

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
night once the airplane is fielded so we

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.030 
night once the airplane is fielded so we
think<00:03:59.200> that's<00:03:59.440> an<00:03:59.530> important<00:03:59.830> part<00:03:59.980> of

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
think that's an important part of

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.470 
think that's an important part of
testing<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:00.490> we're<00:04:00.640> anxious<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:00.940> get<00:04:01.210> on<00:04:01.270> with

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
testing and we're anxious to get on with

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.000 
testing and we're anxious to get on with

any reason when we came up to the actual

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
testing itself we made sure we had all

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.700 
testing itself we made sure we had all
the<00:04:37.910> subsystems<00:04:38.330> pre<00:04:38.840> position<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:39.470> we<00:04:39.500> were

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
the subsystems pre position so we were

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.430 
the subsystems pre position so we were
getting<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.040> power<00:04:40.220> we<00:04:40.430> needed<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:41.420> keep<00:04:42.380> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
getting the power we needed to keep the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.690 
getting the power we needed to keep the
aircraft<00:04:42.620> flying<00:04:43.010> whilst<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.400> engine<00:04:43.640> was

off<00:04:43.850> when<00:04:44.450> we're<00:04:44.570> happy<00:04:44.870> with<00:04:44.960> all<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.290> when

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
off when we're happy with all that when

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.900 
off when we're happy with all that when
you<00:04:45.530> basically<00:04:45.890> switch<00:04:46.220> the<00:04:46.400> engine<00:04:46.490> switched

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
you basically switch the engine switched

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.770 
you basically switch the engine switched
off<00:04:47.320> waited<00:04:48.320> for<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.860> RPM<00:04:49.190> TDK<00:04:49.640> down<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.660> the

off waited for the RPM TDK down to the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.090 
off waited for the RPM TDK down to the
values<00:04:51.050> we<00:04:51.080> were<00:04:51.290> looking<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:52.070> then

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
values we were looking for and then

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.880 
values we were looking for and then
switch<00:04:52.400> the<00:04:52.430> engine<00:04:52.640> back<00:04:52.910> on<00:04:53.590> where<00:04:54.590> did<00:04:54.710> for

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
switch the engine back on where did for

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.700 
switch the engine back on where did for
the<00:04:55.700> thrust<00:04:56.630> to<00:04:56.750> come<00:04:56.900> back<00:04:57.050> up<00:04:57.170> again<00:04:57.440> and

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
the thrust to come back up again and

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.890 
the thrust to come back up again and
then<00:04:58.070> when<00:04:58.190> we<00:04:58.310> had<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.520> good<00:04:58.700> test<00:04:58.910> point<00:04:59.150> over

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
then when we had a good test point over

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.380 
then when we had a good test point over
all<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.170> testing<00:05:00.560> we<00:05:00.650> actually<00:05:00.920> got<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.850> 27

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
all the testing we actually got the 27
