mid-sized reflector it's about 42 inches

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.160 
mid-sized reflector it's about 42 inches
and<00:00:28.800> they're<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.189> multi<00:00:29.550> colors<00:00:29.910> gold<00:00:30.330> white

silver black and then in the center

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.959 
silver black and then in the center
there's<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.739> translucent<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.610> I'll<00:00:35.700> show<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
there's a translucent and I'll show you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
there's a translucent and I'll show you
that<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.600> second<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.500> purpose<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
that in just a second the purpose of the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.160 
that in just a second the purpose of the
reflector<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.000> move<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> light<00:00:39.600> for

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
reflector is to move the light for

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.410 
reflector is to move the light for
example<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.070> studio<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
example here in the studio or out in the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
example here in the studio or out in the
sunlight<00:00:42.660> what<00:00:43.500> i<00:00:43.530> would<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.129> move<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
sunlight what i would do is move the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.970 
sunlight what i would do is move the
reflector<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.660> see<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.230> bounces

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
reflector in as you can see it bounces

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
reflector in as you can see it bounces
light<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.489> underneath<00:00:47.820> my<00:00:48.090> chin<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.899> eyes

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
light up underneath my chin in the eyes

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.529 
light up underneath my chin in the eyes
if<00:00:49.829> i<00:00:50.100> were<00:00:50.219> wearing<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> ball<00:00:50.850> cap<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.420> would

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
if i were wearing a ball cap it would

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.600 
if i were wearing a ball cap it would
fill<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.989> brighten<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.890> eyes<00:00:53.010> under<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
fill in brighten up the eyes under the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.139 
fill in brighten up the eyes under the
ball<00:00:53.820> cap<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.949> it's<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> very<00:00:56.039> practical<00:00:56.520> tool

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
ball cap so it's a very practical tool

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.939 
ball cap so it's a very practical tool
for<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.600> kind<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.870> an<00:00:58.020> application<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
for that kind of an application in the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.090 
for that kind of an application in the
studio<00:00:59.760> i<00:01:00.149> might<00:01:00.750> bring<00:01:01.050> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.379> reflector

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
studio i might bring in the reflector

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.750 
studio i might bring in the reflector
arm<00:01:02.840> which<00:01:03.840> i<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.140> set<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:05.100> let's

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
arm which i have set up here let's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.850 
arm which i have set up here let's
connect<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.320> reflector<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.860> arm<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.850> so

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
connect the reflector to the arm like so

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.210 
connect the reflector to the arm like so
and<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.140> now<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.170> don't<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.799> stand<00:01:14.010> here

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
and and now i don't have to stand here

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
and and now i don't have to stand here
and<00:01:14.400> hold<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.420> i<00:01:15.540> come<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and hold it but if i come into the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.740 
and hold it but if i come into the
studio<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.460> now<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> reflector

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
studio you can see now how the reflector

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.160 
studio you can see now how the reflector
lights<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.560> side<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> face<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
lights this side of the face the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.630 
lights this side of the face the
translucent<00:01:22.170> comes<00:01:22.350> into<00:01:22.619> play<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.159> those

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
translucent comes into play on those

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.210 
translucent comes into play on those
very<00:01:24.000> very<00:01:24.299> bright<00:01:24.600> sunny<00:01:24.960> days<00:01:25.259> where<00:01:26.100> you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
very very bright sunny days where you

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.100 
very very bright sunny days where you
want<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> block<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.970> Sun<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> cloud

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
want to block the Sun just like a cloud

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.560 
want to block the Sun just like a cloud
for<00:01:28.799> example<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.790> my<00:01:29.820> light<00:01:30.210> source

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
for example here I have my light source

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.440 
for example here I have my light source
if<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.290> bring<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> translucent<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.759> softens

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
if I bring the translucent in it softens

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.179 
if I bring the translucent in it softens
that<00:01:33.659> light<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.930> enlarges<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.619> light<00:01:34.920> source

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
that light and enlarges the light source

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.249 
that light and enlarges the light source
and<00:01:35.490> softens<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.509> see<00:01:36.750> even<00:01:37.079> here

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and softens it up you can see even here

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.109 
and softens it up you can see even here
in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> studio<00:01:37.619> area<00:01:38.070> how<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> does<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.670> in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
in the studio area how it does that in

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.270 
in the studio area how it does that in
daylight<00:01:40.049> you'd<00:01:40.320> use<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.500> exactly<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.189> same

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
daylight you'd use it exactly the same

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.179 
daylight you'd use it exactly the same
way<00:01:41.520> you'd<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.360> an<00:01:42.420> assistant<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.229> use<00:01:43.950> your

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
way you'd have an assistant or use your

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.120 
way you'd have an assistant or use your
arm<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.880> stand<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.810> hold<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> reflector<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
arm and stand to hold the reflector the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.280 
arm and stand to hold the reflector the
other<00:01:47.280> very<00:01:47.820> practical<00:01:48.450> application<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
other very practical application of the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.219 
other very practical application of the
reflector<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.610> broaden<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.299> human<00:01:51.840> flight

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
reflector is to broaden a human flight
