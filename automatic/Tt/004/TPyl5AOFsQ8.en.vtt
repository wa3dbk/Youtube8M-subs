right<00:01:29.509> yep<00:01:31.780> it's<00:01:32.780> really<00:01:33.020> looking<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.470> keep<00:01:33.649> it

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
right yep it's really looking to keep it

your<00:01:33.920> finger<00:01:34.190> next<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:34.820> we<00:01:34.940> can<00:01:35.090> see

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
your finger next to that so we can see

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.960 
your finger next to that so we can see
the<00:01:35.540> size<00:01:35.899> of<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:36.890> it's<00:01:37.100> small<00:01:37.520> it's<00:01:37.759> not

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
the size of it so it's small it's not

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.840 
the size of it so it's small it's not
big<00:01:38.299> but<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:39.649> does<00:01:39.890> look<00:01:39.920> an<00:01:40.220> awful<00:01:40.280> lot<00:01:40.549> like<00:01:40.789> a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
big but it does look an awful lot like a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.210 
big but it does look an awful lot like a
strawberry<00:01:41.560> what<00:01:42.560> else<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:42.799> have<00:01:42.830> going<00:01:42.950> on

coconut<00:02:04.700> matting<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:06.200> build<00:02:06.440> their<00:02:06.590> stupid

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
coconut matting to build their stupid

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.030 
coconut matting to build their stupid
nests<00:02:08.259> stupid<00:02:09.259> birds<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.690> also<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.530> week<00:02:12.739> I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
nests stupid birds and also this week I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.210 
nests stupid birds and also this week I
planted<00:02:13.459> my<00:02:13.519> onion<00:02:14.090> experiment<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.890> can<00:02:16.040> see

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
planted my onion experiment you can see

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.729 
planted my onion experiment you can see
it<00:02:16.310> growing<00:02:16.580> here<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.440> thing<00:02:18.680> that

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
it growing here this is the thing that

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.030 
it growing here this is the thing that
we're<00:02:18.980> hoping<00:02:19.160> will<00:02:19.489> give<00:02:19.670> us<00:02:19.819> onion<00:02:20.209> seeds

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
we're hoping will give us onion seeds

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.880 
we're hoping will give us onion seeds
once<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.190> flowers<00:02:22.670> were<00:02:23.600> I<00:02:23.959> think<00:02:24.500> Tiffany's

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
once the flowers were I think Tiffany's

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.610 
once the flowers were I think Tiffany's
probably<00:02:25.250> pretty<00:02:25.430> skeptical<00:02:25.910> about<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.299> but

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
probably pretty skeptical about that but

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.840 
probably pretty skeptical about that but
hopefully<00:02:27.620> something<00:02:28.010> will<00:02:28.220> happen<00:02:28.430> it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
hopefully something will happen it

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.550 
hopefully something will happen it
smells<00:02:29.269> pretty<00:02:29.510> awful<00:02:30.049> huh<00:02:31.989> and<00:02:32.989> then<00:02:33.350> we<00:02:33.440> got

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
smells pretty awful huh and then we got

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.640 
smells pretty awful huh and then we got

little spinach is growing here uh and

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.590 
little spinach is growing here uh and
then<00:02:39.859> you<00:02:40.760> want<00:02:40.940> to<00:02:41.000> talk<00:02:41.090> about<00:02:41.150> what's<00:02:41.450> going

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
then you want to talk about what's going

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.390 
then you want to talk about what's going

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.849 
on here here we have one carrot maybe a
carrot<00:02:46.880> could<00:02:47.750> be<00:02:47.840> something<00:02:48.049> else<00:02:48.290> could

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
carrot could be something else could

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.250 
carrot could be something else could
easily<00:02:49.220> be<00:02:49.370> something<00:02:49.670> else<00:02:49.760> we<00:02:50.660> just<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:50.989> no

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
easily be something else we just have no

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.370 
easily be something else we just have no
idea<00:02:51.290> right<00:02:51.769> now<00:02:51.799> and<00:02:52.780> how<00:02:53.780> many<00:02:53.840> carats<00:02:54.230> did

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
idea right now and how many carats did

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.810 
idea right now and how many carats did
you<00:02:54.470> say<00:02:54.620> you<00:02:54.680> planted<00:02:55.100> in<00:02:55.160> here<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.459> planted

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
you say you planted in here I planted

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.050 
you say you planted in here I planted
three<00:02:56.030> rows<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.989> planted<00:02:57.350> three<00:02:57.650> rows<00:02:58.060> which

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
three rows you planted three rows which

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.099 
three rows you planted three rows which
is<00:02:59.209> like<00:02:59.359> way<00:02:59.510> more<00:02:59.540> than<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.079> recommended

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
is like way more than the recommended

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.580 
is like way more than the recommended
number<00:03:00.980> for<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.000> container<00:03:02.359> of<00:03:02.420> this<00:03:02.630> size<00:03:02.870> well

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
number for a container of this size well

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.750 
number for a container of this size well
then<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.190> weed<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.579> out<00:03:04.670> once<00:03:04.970> they<00:03:06.700> anyway<00:03:07.700> so

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
then you weed it out once they anyway so

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.479 
then you weed it out once they anyway so
hopefully<00:03:08.680> hopefully<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.010> bunny<00:03:10.220> will

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489
