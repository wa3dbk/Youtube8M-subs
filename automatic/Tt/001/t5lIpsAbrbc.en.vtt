in<00:00:30.919> between<00:00:31.189> these<00:00:31.339> actions<00:00:32.890> now<00:00:33.890> the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
in between these actions now the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.590 
in between these actions now the
mechanic<00:00:34.400> itself<00:00:34.760> is<00:00:34.940> really<00:00:35.120> easy<00:00:35.360> to

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
mechanic itself is really easy to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.299 
mechanic itself is really easy to
execute<00:00:35.870> you<00:00:36.320> simply<00:00:36.680> just<00:00:36.710> queue<00:00:37.100> up<00:00:37.190> a

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
execute you simply just queue up a

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.950 
execute you simply just queue up a
command<00:00:37.579> slightly<00:00:38.090> before<00:00:38.270> you're<00:00:38.570> able<00:00:38.690> to

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
command slightly before you're able to

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.340 
command slightly before you're able to
use<00:00:39.140> it<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.359> although<00:00:41.359> it<00:00:41.600> is<00:00:41.690> really<00:00:41.960> easy<00:00:42.079> to

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
use it so although it is really easy to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.170 
use it so although it is really easy to
perform<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.039> also<00:00:43.250> extremely<00:00:43.460> effective

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
perform it is also extremely effective

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.270 
perform it is also extremely effective
to<00:00:44.960> demonstrate<00:00:45.410> how<00:00:45.500> effective<00:00:45.920> it<00:00:46.039> can<00:00:46.070> be

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
to demonstrate how effective it can be

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.979 
to demonstrate how effective it can be
let<00:00:46.609> me<00:00:46.699> show<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:46.879> guys<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.300> common<00:00:47.629> gameplay

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
buffering in this next clip graves wants

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.130 
buffering in this next clip graves wants
to<00:00:55.429> flash<00:00:55.670> into<00:00:55.969> an<00:00:56.059> auto<00:00:56.239> attack<00:00:56.600> so<00:00:56.899> that<00:00:57.050> he

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
to flash into an auto attack so that he

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.889 
to flash into an auto attack so that he
can<00:00:57.289> finish<00:00:57.469> off<00:00:57.679> the<00:00:57.829> low<00:00:57.949> health<00:00:58.160> Corki

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
can finish off the low health Corki

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.060 
can finish off the low health Corki
however<00:00:59.899> there<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.170> slight<00:01:00.440> delay<00:01:00.739> as<00:01:00.890> well

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
however there is a slight delay as well

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.680 
however there is a slight delay as well
as<00:01:01.160> some<00:01:01.339> in<00:01:01.460> accuracy<00:01:01.789> from<00:01:02.030> having<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.480> flash

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
as some in accuracy from having to flash

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.180 
as some in accuracy from having to flash
forward<00:01:03.050> first<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:03.679> having<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.040> move

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
forward first and then having to move

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.620 
forward first and then having to move
his<00:01:04.339> mouse<00:01:04.519> to<00:01:04.699> right-click<00:01:04.879> Corky<00:01:05.420> and

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
his mouse to right-click Corky and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.690 
his mouse to right-click Corky and
because<00:01:06.500> of<00:01:06.530> this<00:01:06.740> delay<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.250> in<00:01:07.340> accuracy

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
because of this delay and in accuracy

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.890 
because of this delay and in accuracy
Corki<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.210> able<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:08.660> flash<00:01:08.870> out<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.200> safety<00:01:10.900> now

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
Corki is able to flash out to safety now

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.970 
Corki is able to flash out to safety now
let<00:01:12.050> me<00:01:12.080> show<00:01:12.170> you<00:01:12.320> guys<00:01:12.500> what<00:01:12.740> would<00:01:12.890> have

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:12.980 
let me show you guys what would have

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.290 
let me show you guys what would have
happened<00:01:13.250> in<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:13.430> scenario<00:01:13.550> if<00:01:13.910> graveside

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
happened in this scenario if graveside

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.230 
happened in this scenario if graveside
utilized<00:01:14.720> input<00:01:15.080> buffering<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.880> this<00:01:17.030> clip

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
utilized input buffering so this clip

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.850 
utilized input buffering so this clip
starts<00:01:17.390> off<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.690> exact<00:01:18.080> same<00:01:18.290> way<00:01:18.470> we're<00:01:18.710> all

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
starts off the exact same way we're all

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.470 
starts off the exact same way we're all
graves<00:01:19.100> needs<00:01:19.370> to<00:01:19.520> do<00:01:19.670> is<00:01:19.730> flash<00:01:20.090> into<00:01:20.390> an

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
graves needs to do is flash into an

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.140 
graves needs to do is flash into an
auto-attack<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.080> kill<00:01:21.260> Corki<00:01:22.000> however<00:01:23.000> this

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
auto-attack to kill Corki however this

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.000 
auto-attack to kill Corki however this
time<00:01:23.330> graves<00:01:23.600> utilizes<00:01:24.170> input<00:01:24.470> buffering<00:01:24.860> and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
time graves utilizes input buffering and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.650 
time graves utilizes input buffering and
buffers<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.430> auto<00:01:25.580> attack<00:01:25.910> first<00:01:26.180> by<00:01:26.420> right

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
buffers the auto attack first by right

clicks and corky before he flashes the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.080 
clicks and corky before he flashes the
result<00:01:29.810> is<00:01:29.930> an<00:01:30.050> easy<00:01:30.200> kill<00:01:30.580> there's<00:01:31.580> no<00:01:31.880> lag

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
result is an easy kill there's no lag
