 sony has released the sony 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.610
 xperia z ultra one more device 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.160
 close to the tablet that the smartphone 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.279
 what is more striking is its huge 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.519
 64-inch diagonal screen and 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.519
 resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.520
 It is clearly a fablet meant to be 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.520
 used two hands being very comfortable 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.820
 handling in this way 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.980
 They are incorporates its interface so elegant and 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.350
 fluid as always with numerous 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.190
 applications added that fortunately 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.380
 they can be easily uninstallable 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.530
 highlight the possibility of using themes 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.720
 to customize our interface as 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.220
 we have already seen in other gadgets such as 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.220
 tablet xperia zeta 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.690
 the operation is really fruit and 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.140
 fast never giving the feeling of 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.020
 stay behind loading interface has 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.080
 of a qualcomm snapdragon 800 processor 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.390
 from 4 cores to 2 2 gigahertz that together 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.360
 to his 2 gb of ram they endow it with a 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.820
 very high power but the most 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.280
 striking is its resistance to water and 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 dust being submersible up to one meter 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.500
 of depth without needing to cover the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.720
 headphone jack even if the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.570
 no load and micro sd 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.030
 and the screen that itself is not stable under 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.450
 liquid or wet as it loses the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.210
 sensitivity as is logical 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 The quality of the screen is good and if 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.159
 well does not reach the quality of those of the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.590
 samsung indoors outdoors 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.200
 it behaves much better 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.539
 the ultra zeta is a device that we 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.320
 He liked it a lot and we will analyze in depth 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:00.320
