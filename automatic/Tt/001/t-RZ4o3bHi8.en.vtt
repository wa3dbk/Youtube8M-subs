 I believe in the rest of the orchestra 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.980
 You will have to wait for after being at maximum 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.340

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.940
 that you will have more better surely but if you have any problem 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.720

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.889

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.889
 inder 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:45.889

 with those from the outskirts of the carlos comprimis file 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:01.159
