00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:55.370
 cares to play choose without bosses 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.370
 start waiting until the map is loaded 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:09.060
 usual number 3 cargo with probably because of 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 the fact that I'm recording this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.479
 bother 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:21.740
 go to either side wait 6 seconds 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:24.900
 so start you need to choose a weapon 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.710
 here are all represented weapons 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:33.079
 suit and sgu which example windows like 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.150
 choose it just can do 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.320
 bumming on it or pressing the key 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:49.229
 standard actions are set with the e key 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:52.649
 and choose for example to translate 50 further I 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.799
 I will tell you about the scene that is the word is 1 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.130
 lvl now we stand and lay down 2 l m then 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.340
 have all done with and action keys 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.500
 here 3 4 that is further away everything 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.280
 harder to get how to see more 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.230
 this case is spreading 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.670
 go to 1 that is , they are all there 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 so it is 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.850
 game modes and the classic right now is at 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.100
 us 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:27.500
 let's play the classics then tell you about 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.920
 other modes this site site this here 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.160
 for example start too keys and you see 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:40.070
 here are the circles he was here if you put 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:45.130
 for example, 16 it became more that is 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:49.550
 the color the color of this circle 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.700
 Green is more striking is 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.250
 I honestly do not know what it is 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.910
 which house it well short 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:03.110
 hammer it in you come on here 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:09.980
 class before the start here we have to get there 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:18.040
 so the circle is such a train 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:18.040
 these do think you understand 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:29.160
 now i'm sorry i'll make it a little quieter 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:33.790
 too loud like this 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.330
 so that I hear no less than normal 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.940
 let's see the next mode is 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.540
 something like yes you see this 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.310
 crap press start and she for the first 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.890
 get hit and scared went for a circle a 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:55.930
 then green 3 days now these 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:59.819
 the alternation of such i vks very much 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.819
 play what you judge me shooting 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.540
 that's about it so let's take the next mode 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.420
 let's see this is something like 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.250
 reflex that is, you have to wait until it appears 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:20.430
 blue circle sharply shoot damn it 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:26.220
 had time but in principle you understood yes 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:30.810
 now once again try to wear a sharp and 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:36.770
 didn't have time hey-neta got in the way let's 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:39.770
 next mode try this type zozhzhi 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.770
 hold up 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:54.690
 34 ammunition that he got against here 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:05:00.030
 you understand yes you can do 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:00.030
 stop-start need so you shoot 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:13.249
 I do not know what the limit is, he somehow 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:17.490
 strangely works on a mural like this 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:22.080
 next this here will appear here 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.939
 these circles and you need to hit them all 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.939
 will appear and stay like 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.100
 I'm just a cool tag too 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:46.150
 well that's good at all to train aim 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.100
 I now as the day is already here so I'm 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.110
 much better shoot than when 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:57.700
 a coup came here so I hope you all 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:06:02.170
 understandable and told here you can for example 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:06.040
 choose there know well too dare to shoot 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:08.070
