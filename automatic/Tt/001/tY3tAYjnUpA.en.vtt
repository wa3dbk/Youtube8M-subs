00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Mr. shortly before the video wanted to start 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.520
 I'll say something short because I have 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.109
 a little problem and because of this 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.059
 problem I can respect the unfortunately synonymous 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 not yet close because I have yes 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.090
 noticed how some of you know and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.820
 when i try in a zip file 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.949
 people to send the resort pack 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.350
 then people can have the windows 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.510
 do not open this folder the zip-file 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.150
 or the folder is empty and that 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 pretty stupid because if someone knows how 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.420
 I can fix this problem then 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.680
 if it were really cool I would be right 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.420
 I would join in 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.980
 thank him who really cool and then 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.690
 can i respect that too finally 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 Close because I think a lot 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.630
 of you has windows and no more 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 and yes I'll see you in the video is 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:49.950
 today, and welcome to 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.930
 a white again on a canal 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.489
 Today I'll show you the movie parks 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.920
 I finally called it mine 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 own first own - peer group peg 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.309
 if I know what that means there 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.120
 meant ruby pack in english and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.829
 Do not be surprised now 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.899
 the whole thing in the background is one 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.760
 unfortunately, I have it 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.320
 recorded yesterday then you have noticed 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 that recording program a way around 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.460
 spit and now because I'm doing 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.470
 in any case commented on 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.330
 I hope that's not too bad 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.710
 In any case, the swords show that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.850
 Wooden sword is nothing special though 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.610
 the other sword I really 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.020
 all changed and with own textures 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.040
 I 'm really happy that so right 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.240
 I managed to be cool 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.950
 swords are really really epic 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.759
 become what I wanted to I 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.229
 that made it 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.840
 because it's really my very first 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.970
 own risk except once I have there 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.520
 Just hold the bow a bit 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.560
 changed and also bent right there 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 really have many of you right 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.970
 of you have wished that the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 I have shown this bow before 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.030
 I've changed to the other one 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.579
 now also here as you can see 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.290
 made a really cool so me 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.390
 do not know how I think you can 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.729
 already for weeks because of the texture on 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.560
 In any case, I have the tension 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.899
 animation changes and the particles 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.850
 are just rubies so i really have 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.850
 pretty much changed in this 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.680
 respect all the secondaries except tnt 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.259
 and coburg I actually changed 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.069
 and yes it is actually pretty cool 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.349
 become and 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.049
 so far as you can see here 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.569
 so to speak, the weapons come from the axes 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.849
 and the praxis nothing not changed me 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.139
 and by the way the blocks and so are the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.180
 not all is self made 

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:25.079
 but if then I have a two 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.750
 blocks changed so slightly discolored 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.090
 and so and I have food now too 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.590
 not so old too special but here the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.780
 Rott and the fns I have 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.829
 really hard given that right 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.120
 especially to do 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.650
 at the flint I have nothing here now 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.090
 changed as you can see but the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.139
 I really have another time 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.419
 properly given trouble 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.069
 that's just this high road so the 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:47.459
 I have red about that 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.290
 And then I have the red particles 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.549
 what I did to his red flame 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.239
 actually find it really cool how to 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.680
 can see here 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.750
 I think that's really good because 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.659
 I once saw a video 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.579
 this offered with this flame in front 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.439
 and then I wanted that now 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.069
 easy to make out because I'm right 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.810
 curious; excited 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.639
 therefore had to be easy now 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.250
 only I have just made a red flame 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.810
 because everything has to be good that checks 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.879
 action pack is based on the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.780
 The crates may look red in color 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.370
 are all red and yes that's so soon 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.799
 nothing especially not changed or something 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.169
 and yes that 's it then with the 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.549
 segways and the armor of the armor 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:26.189
 to say how disarmament I have 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.930
 So the other day and dark colored blue 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.629
 Normally it is so turquoise 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.459
 light blue and iron chest so 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.109
 at the establishment I have the 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.629
 normal strain on the iron chest 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.430
 I've done a ruby ​​on it and on 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.479
 The helmet is also a ruby ​​that will 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.139
 I have given it because it sees 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.509
 not so good 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.919
 So then finally meseberg 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.139
 not be that then rubin will be 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.639
 and the other armor, so gold chains 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.900
 and leather are just that 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:50.849
 standard services how to best 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.109
 and that with ruby 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.030
 the iron I have I made halt 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:58.259
 because then the iron hanisch from 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.280
 white leather harnisch celebrated 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.319
 then it just looks better 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.379
 I have changed to crafting table 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.549
 changed it is a red craig which had 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.919
 I just wanted this high 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.329
 straight and no change is and 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:11.449
 then I dyed the red because 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.409
 as I said red the foul of texture pack 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.900
 and open 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:16.750
 also transparent apparently emmel 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.359
 transparent 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.210
 and stop at the other blocks like 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.430
 said and here the water particles too 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.460
 standard I did not change anything big 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.320
 and then of course I like lohfeyer 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.120
 So you did not want that one 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.800
 half screen obscures that 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.480
 Half screen is hidden if you 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.460
 goes into the fire and in the dialogue like 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.100
 one has just seen the value is on 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.210
 dark blue does not show at this point 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.510
 just these particles 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.060
 So I have in the last video yet 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.830
 no particles and many of you 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.890
 have desired is particle 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.530
 rubies and decisions particles 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.390
 Engels but with the particles you can see 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.410
 yes here are rubies have the idea 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.270
 I also used and I find it 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.700
 just look really cool from the 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.950
 Particles and the decision makers 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.390
 Particles it is now so that I stop 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:11.260
 no emmerich have taken but a 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:13.240
 diamond in the form of a so ends 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.590
 so ruby in particles has too 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.000
 the form of world because i want that 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.100
 just cool and her the decision 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.720
 Particles are just huge found blue 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.669
 and red that he contrasting color so two 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.830
 and that's why I took money for 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.240
 and if one maintains the particles quickly 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.560
 I have to be there then you can 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.330
 really really hard 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.610
 Sometimes these particles can look like them 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.070
 Look for markus so find it 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.590
 me because yes, so you really get 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.169
 many particles in this pack and then 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:41.500
 here the hearts are rubies essens 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.979
 Keulen standard and inventory to stop 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.270
 my name and my character in it and 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.520
 that was that with it 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.110
 meseberg I hope you like her 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.350
 can now the last suggestions in 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.760
 the combos write and how you in the free 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.440
 and raw if I have one 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.470
 can help then it would be really cool because 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.820
 yes exactly and then be possible 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.940
 school principal has rhine and up to 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.940
 next
