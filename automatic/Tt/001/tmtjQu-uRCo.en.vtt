00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.219
 hello everyone my name is just chutney ever 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.290
 I 'm here to do another video lesson 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.690
 now the subject is going to be fashion the Greeks 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.549
 but a slightly different way 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 we are going to set up the Greek ways to 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.599
 from the smaller scales of the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.349
 minor and harmonic scale and it was better 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.470
 for you that do not have the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.759
 knowledge of the modes generated by 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.220
 larger scale 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.950
 I would advise you to watch another one. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.300
 video modes on first modes 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.300
 generated by the larger scale 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.830
 Greek modes can be associated with 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.780
 any chord generated from any field 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.480
 ie harmonic harmonic field 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.430
 the greater the relative minor of the field 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.680
 harmonic harmonic and field harmonic 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.890
 melodic minor harmonic 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.690
 the scalina monica is formed by the 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.520
 following grades 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.630
 tonic second highest Tuesday minor Wednesday 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.210
 fair fifth just minor sixth and seventh 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.479
 higher, that is, it differs from 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.900
 natural minor scale by 7th grade to be 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.900
 bigger 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.210
 in the same way that we form the field 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.579
 greater harmonic 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.219
 we will form a smaller and harmonic field 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:26.060
 stacking the lowest harmonic notes 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.060
 intense 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 remembering it is fundamental that you know 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.080
 the minor and harmonic scale designs 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.080
 in your instrument so that this matter 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.530
 makes sense in the tool and not a 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.530
 form only theoretical 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.720
 as we saw in the previous video lesson, the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.210
 modes are just names for the degrees of the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.860
 harmonic field representing each 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.860
 the sound of each chord 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.999
 the best is harmonic the name of the modes 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.819
 will be given according to the loudness or 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:06.550
 characteristic of each chord and each 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:13.890
 already generated in the largest harmonic field 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:15.520
 the first grade and oil with seventh largest 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.220
 high school 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:24.240
 love you with sixth-highest third degree 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:31.830
 June with 5th augmented 4th degree 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:36.640
 Doric sharp 11 5th grade mix olÃ­vio 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:40.630
 b9b 13 6th grade 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.330
 increased canvas and the seventh grade 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.810
 is not associated in any way with having 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.950
 result in a minute chord 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.950
 characterizing it in another way 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.700
 the minor melodic scale in my view is a 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.470
 of the greatest tools for 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.060
 improviser 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.470
 because it is a very large scale 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.410
 versatile 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.650
 the smaller scale logic has almost all 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.750
 chords that are widely used or 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.750
 modes constantly used 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.790
 it becomes essential because it appears in 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.790
 several different contexts 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.690
 formed by tonic second major Tuesday 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.970
 minor fourth fair fifth just sixth 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.840
 largest and seventh largest 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.040
 it looks very much like the larger scale 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.489
 differentiating only by Tuesday 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.590
 in relation to the natural minor scale 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.590
 has the sixth and seventh major degree 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.270
 the minor harmonic field modes 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.660
 melodic the following are the first 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.360
 minor degree with seventh major is known 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.200
 as junior junior or Doric with seventh 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.890
 bigger 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.990
 the lower second degree 7 is known by 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.540
 Phrygian with sixth largest 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.670
 the third degree with seventh major and 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.880
 raised fifth recognized as free 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.690
 increased the dominant fourth degree is 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:17.170
 known as the dominant or boundary book 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:21.340
 the dominant fifth grade is 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:24.700
 known as Mixo bemol 13 the sixth 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.840
 minor grade 7 flat 5 or half of a 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.720
 minute is known as block 9 and the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.870
 seventh dominant degree with fifth 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.930
 is known as super store 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.820
 created the dominant loc 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.980
 now with the three harmonic fields 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.200
 duly studied the harmonic field 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.280
 higher or lower harmonic and a lower 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.680
 melodic 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.140
 most of the harmonic situations that 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.380
 You will find there to be 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.420
 analyzed will be resolved with these 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.800
 scales 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.840
 I hope I have helped with these 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.840
 information and until the next
