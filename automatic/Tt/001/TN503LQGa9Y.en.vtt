an<00:01:59.860> issue<00:02:00.040> now<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:00.850> rating<00:02:01.510> i<00:02:01.690> would<00:02:01.840> rate

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
an issue now the rating i would rate

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.830 
an issue now the rating i would rate
this<00:02:02.229> out<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.620> a<00:02:02.650> 9<00:02:03.040> out<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.340> 10<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.510> simple

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
this out is a 9 out of 10 the simple

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.810 
this out is a 9 out of 10 the simple
fact<00:02:04.869> that's<00:02:05.290> recoil<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.010> iron<00:02:06.190> sights<00:02:06.580> to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
fact that's recoil and iron sights to

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.089 
fact that's recoil and iron sights to
begin<00:02:07.150> with<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.360> very<00:02:07.659> very<00:02:08.019> good<00:02:08.349> now<00:02:08.979> this

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
begin with a very very good now this

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.859 
begin with a very very good now this
means<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.399> don't<00:02:09.610> need<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:09.940> bother<00:02:10.209> putting

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
means you don't need to bother putting

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.199 
means you don't need to bother putting
on<00:02:11.080> any<00:02:11.260> external<00:02:11.739> sites<00:02:12.159> such<00:02:12.340> as<00:02:12.430> reflex<00:02:12.970> or

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
on any external sites such as reflex or

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.679 
on any external sites such as reflex or
mms<00:02:13.750> when<00:02:14.049> you<00:02:14.140> unlock<00:02:14.409> it<00:02:14.620> instead<00:02:15.579> you<00:02:16.510> can

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
mms when you unlock it instead you can

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.030 
mms when you unlock it instead you can
just<00:02:16.930> keep<00:02:17.049> with<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.260> iron<00:02:17.439> sights<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> use

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
just keep with the iron sights and use

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.820 
just keep with the iron sights and use
fast<00:02:18.310> megan<00:02:18.670> foregrip<00:02:19.090> fast<00:02:19.840> mag<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.409> for

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
fast megan foregrip fast mag and for

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.670 
fast megan foregrip fast mag and for
it<00:02:20.890> would<00:02:21.160> be<00:02:21.310> my<00:02:22.320> suggestions<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.530> guys

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
it would be my suggestions to you guys

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.850 
it would be my suggestions to you guys
to<00:02:23.890> use<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.250> an-94<00:02:25.020> as<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.470> gives<00:02:26.620> more

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
to use on the an-94 as it gives more

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.550 
to use on the an-94 as it gives more
stability<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.120> have<00:02:28.360> about<00:02:28.750> one<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.470> two

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
stability so you have about one to two

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.910 
stability so you have about one to two
percent<00:02:29.890> recoil<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.570> also<00:02:32.230> you're

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
percent recoil and then also you're

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.770 
percent recoil and then also you're
going<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.130> be<00:02:33.190> effective<00:02:33.850> at<00:02:34.030> reloading<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
going to be effective at reloading and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.810 
going to be effective at reloading and
quickly<00:02:35.170> swapping<00:02:35.530> those<00:02:35.680> mags<00:02:35.980> if<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.610> have

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
quickly swapping those mags if you have

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.690 
quickly swapping those mags if you have
to<00:02:36.940> do<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.300> batting<00:02:38.140> gagement<00:02:38.500> as<00:02:39.370> i<00:02:39.550> said

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
to do in batting gagement as i said

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.070 
to do in batting gagement as i said
before<00:02:39.790> you'd<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:40.330> swap<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.720> mag<00:02:40.870> very

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
before you'd have to swap the mag very

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.960 
before you'd have to swap the mag very
often<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.800> obviously<00:02:42.070> fast<00:02:42.370> mag<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.760> going<00:02:42.910> to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
often so obviously fast mag is going to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.970 
often so obviously fast mag is going to
eliminate<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.690> need<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.740> middle<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.920> a

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
eliminate that need in the middle of a

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.610 
eliminate that need in the middle of a
firefight<00:02:45.250> if<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.670> do<00:02:45.820> when<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.000> have<00:02:46.060> ammo<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
firefight if you do when I have ammo to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.220 
firefight if you do when I have ammo to
get<00:02:47.950> shat<00:02:48.340> on<00:02:48.370> while<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.120> are<00:02:49.150> reloading<00:02:49.780> per

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
get shat on while you are reloading per

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.690 
get shat on while you are reloading per
se<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:52.030> my<00:02:52.780> recoil<00:02:53.320> rating<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.220> gun<00:02:54.490> is<00:02:54.520> a

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
se so my recoil rating for this gun is a

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.070 
se so my recoil rating for this gun is a
probably<00:02:55.030> have<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.180> say<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.540> about<00:02:55.720> two<00:02:55.930> to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
probably have to say it's about two to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.520 
probably have to say it's about two to
five<00:02:56.200> percent<00:02:56.590> recoil<00:02:57.990> compare<00:02:58.990> well<00:02:59.200> on<00:02:59.380> my

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
five percent recoil compare well on my

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.330 
five percent recoil compare well on my
kind<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.860> scale<00:03:00.160> for<00:03:00.610> guns<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.920> damage

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
kind of scale for guns and the damage

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.180 
kind of scale for guns and the damage
rating<00:03:03.820> I'd<00:03:03.940> say<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.209> does<00:03:04.390> per<00:03:04.600> bullet<00:03:04.810> is

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
rating I'd say it does per bullet is

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.910 
rating I'd say it does per bullet is
about<00:03:06.190> probably<00:03:06.730> about<00:03:06.910> two<00:03:07.090> bullet<00:03:07.330> kill

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
about probably about two bullet kill

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.780 
about probably about two bullet kill
waist-high<00:03:09.270> or<00:03:10.709> any<00:03:11.709> lower<00:03:12.190> I'm<00:03:12.520> probably

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
waist-high or any lower I'm probably

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.110 
waist-high or any lower I'm probably
gonna<00:03:13.090> say<00:03:13.450> four<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.440> five<00:03:14.830> bullet<00:03:15.220> kill<00:03:15.459> which

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
gonna say four to five bullet kill which

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.850 
gonna say four to five bullet kill which
is<00:03:16.330> not<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.570> problem<00:03:16.870> as<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.470> gives<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.680> nice

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
is not a problem as it gives a nice

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.760 
is not a problem as it gives a nice
nifty<00:03:18.760> fire<00:03:18.970> rate<00:03:19.240> probably<00:03:19.840> imagine<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.709> be

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
nifty fire rate probably imagine and be

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.800 
nifty fire rate probably imagine and be
able<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.980> spend<00:03:21.370> out<00:03:21.610> a<00:03:21.640> whole<00:03:21.970> entire<00:03:22.120> mag<00:03:22.570> in

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
able to spend out a whole entire mag in

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.660 
able to spend out a whole entire mag in
about<00:03:23.500> probably<00:03:25.590> about<00:03:26.590> seven<00:03:26.950> to<00:03:27.040> eight<00:03:27.070> no

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
about probably about seven to eight no

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.979 
about probably about seven to eight no
wait<00:03:27.880> about<00:03:28.360> five<00:03:28.660> to<00:03:28.840> six<00:03:29.019> seconds<00:03:29.590> or<00:03:29.800> less

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
wait about five to six seconds or less

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.940 
wait about five to six seconds or less
now<00:03:31.989> obviously<00:03:32.110> might<00:03:32.440> think<00:03:32.680> that's<00:03:32.800> not

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
now obviously might think that's not

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.350 
now obviously might think that's not
very<00:03:33.010> fast<00:03:33.280> compared<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.730> something<00:03:34.030> like<00:03:34.150> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
very fast compared to something like the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.810 
very fast compared to something like the
scorpion<00:03:34.840> scorpion<00:03:35.290> evo<00:03:36.010> over<00:03:36.550> it's<00:03:36.700> in<00:03:36.760> a

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
scorpion scorpion evo over it's in a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.670 
scorpion scorpion evo over it's in a
different<00:03:36.970> class<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.600> weapons<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.350> is<00:03:38.440> so

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
different class of weapons and it is so

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.210 
different class of weapons and it is so
effective<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:39.880> unbelievable<00:03:40.560> so<00:03:41.560> this<00:03:42.100> has

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
effective it's unbelievable so this has

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.040 
effective it's unbelievable so this has
been<00:03:42.250> my<00:03:42.610> review<00:03:42.970> on<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.360> weapon<00:03:43.510> now<00:03:43.870> I'm<00:03:43.930> so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
been my review on the weapon now I'm so

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.449 
been my review on the weapon now I'm so
to<00:03:44.140> summarize<00:03:44.470> everything<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:45.070> I'm<00:03:45.250> going<00:03:45.370> to

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
to summarize everything up I'm going to

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.430 
to summarize everything up I'm going to
say<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.730> has<00:03:45.850> little<00:03:46.120> recoil<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:46.900> this<00:03:47.050> weapon
