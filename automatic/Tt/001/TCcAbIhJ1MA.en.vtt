exactly the same and they come in
packages<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:09.020> 52<00:02:09.470> as<00:02:09.590> well<00:02:09.739> each<00:02:09.920> one<00:02:10.130> comes

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
packages of 52 as well each one comes

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.250 
packages of 52 as well each one comes
with<00:02:10.340> packs<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.360> wrapped<00:02:14.720> down<00:02:14.870> most<00:02:15.140> of

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
with packs so I wrapped down most of

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.580 
with packs so I wrapped down most of
those<00:02:15.380> puppies<00:02:15.890> there<00:02:16.989> so<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.050> usually<00:02:18.349> take

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
those puppies there so I usually take

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.070 
those puppies there so I usually take
this<00:02:18.770> access<00:02:19.190> here<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.489> kind<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.730> wrap<00:02:19.940> it<00:02:20.080> and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
this access here and kind of wrap it and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.949 
this access here and kind of wrap it and
then<00:02:21.200> I<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.760> again<00:02:22.840> with<00:02:23.840> another

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
then I just do that again with another

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.680 
then I just do that again with another
dread<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.530> kind<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.739> move<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.100> down<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
dread and kind of move it down the

dread and kind of move it down the
length<00:02:27.380> of<00:02:27.620> these<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.730> end<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.180> guess<00:02:29.360> it's

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
length of these the end I guess it's

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.660 
length of these the end I guess it's
called<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.840> I<00:02:29.870> don't<00:02:30.260> know<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:31.340> end<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.580> the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
called I I don't know the end of the

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.520 
called I I don't know the end of the
dread<00:02:31.850> no<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.269> would<00:02:32.390> meet<00:02:32.510> in<00:02:32.630> there<00:02:32.840> but
