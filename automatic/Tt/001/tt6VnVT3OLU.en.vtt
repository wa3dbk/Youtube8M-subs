00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 m 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:12.519
 I am an environmental activist 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.039
 the diet the result is called borderless ecology that is based on 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.039
 air pollution issues on institutional reforms 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.229
 we work at the Grenelle environment alongside the vwf 

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:25.229
 especially 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.759
 me 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.169
 we indicated this hotel saying it was 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.710
 how are you going to find this place 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 especially this little garden which is really very worried 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.569
 and the possibility of having lots 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:41.230
 and then the concept code 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.830
 the duty 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.620
 the eco hotels points but I think that finally we were 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.620
 sensitive to this argument 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.390
 other solar panels we installed 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.240
 the average head we put on showcase because we find it fun 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.880
 base to show it feeds the signboard and the lights 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.390
 outside who are themselves to their Japanese friends bulbs leds so very 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.600
 low consumption 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.009
 it's also fun to put solar elements in front in the 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.200
 streets of paris 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
 without necessarily asking permission 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.100
 we think we have more time for everything 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.159
 we have aa water recuperator thanks to the water of the gutters 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.630
 which we use for that which comes from the year on the ground and especially we have a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.409
 new plan for now but that's my opinion i think the first 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.409
 water recuperator on public roads in paris 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.140
 here is the reception explains the public transport is very much 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.130
 better and it's very simple we have a map of the neighborhood talk about their fate on 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 also talks about the bottle gives the numbers of bus subway stations 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.050
 and we explain to customers through my eyes 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.380
 with a plan that we distribute that can take public transport is 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.580
 at the end of the street it is very simple and it is much easier than for the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.480
 taxi is so to take his car 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.930
 thanks to our beautiful garden we can store a whole bunch of bike 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.170
 so we pressed bike it's part of the price because rooney economy that 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.140
 can we also be very simple in the management 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.020
 so to recover the water we installed three tanks that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.439
 were swarming hole 1500 liters that are simply 

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:12.469
 for 30 euros with your plumber you can do it connected to the 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:13.189
 gutter 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.539
 who fill up and who serve not rosy and 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:20.649
 or who serves for the other the tank that I liked it feels the summer fed 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.289
 at transco sol the 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:26.089
 the collective toilets of the hotel so that's very important it's pretty much 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:29.489
 500 to 600 liters of water a day used in desserts 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.689
 and then when breakfast finished in the morning for 100 th with all our 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.180
 waste breakfast there is not much organic waste 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.679
 besides the coffee grounds percent 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.920
 % increasing pallet waste 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.920
 we put them in the compost it's a mechanical compost that we turn 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.570
 and that makes us a beautiful little soil for our plantations 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.700
 like that is not enough for our good compost we have an agreement with the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.700
 restaurant across the street that brings us vegetable peelings 

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:57.999
 so it's a little song for his bios 

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:01.729
 do I explain to my colleagues what is cheaper? 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.919
 a classic breakfast why because worse you buy in fat 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:05.570
 amount 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.210
 we buy during elements that make thirty kilos and soon five 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.190
 thanks to all these packaging and the fact that these conditions are 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.149
 big quantity organic breakfast at home 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.119
 we are cheaper than the classic breakfast 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.869
 so it's still a very good argument vis-Ã -vis other workshops 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.079
 to go to 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.079
 to go organic 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:29.409
 like all customers 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.799
 I take the stairs 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.979
 the elevator being reached peaks maximum power consumption of 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.979
 author 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.120
 here is the second floor and as on every floor you have 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:46.590
 selective sorting 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.339
 green on one side 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:49.510
 and paper 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.199
 this is another love story paper blending the plastic 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:56.349
 we really have the client who are working the loans for the Mass planned for 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.169
 the autumn Rennes is unleashed and in addition he is ready 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.359
 and it's happening on the landing in front of the rooms not releasing 24 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.950
 here is a simple formula 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.099
 a small detail in its shape who is who who with all its importance 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.209
 found that customers one out of two customers back throws his suitcase 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.620
 on the bed so he knew the quilt so the quilt and you have to wash it 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.159
 for the dal had every week 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.229
 like a classic blanket one is an object to wash it whenever a 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.280
 suitcase that is placed on it 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.650
 so we had a little way of all that a little place of that much more 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.760
 easily and reduces the quilt wash consumption towards the water and 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.590
 electricity that is not nearly 50% a small detail all 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.539
 beast that cost me 20 euros here per room 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.009
 so obviously the bulbs are low conso the course the hair and 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.199
 so 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.749
 in the bathroom is where we can actually do very 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.449
 good the very good savings of 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:51.539
 the back 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.409
 we have water reducers on the showers and on the sinks that 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.430
 would have 50% bigelow we have liquid soap ideas and geniuses that 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.110
 m and then we have moment locked shows we are the first to 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.379
 propose it in the hotels in the handmade soap produced locally without 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.089
 nowhere to go and then obviously football is disposable and at the level of 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:13.849
 towels obviously cotton towels fair 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.670
 and who are same way with that if they are posed on the ground 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.760
 it is explained in the door to the client that the actions to be performed or 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.180
 the wrong things to do 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.680
 selective sorting doping the tfc terra not to let the sink sink for 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.070
 keep their good at the state get out even though these are very very very jobs 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.790
 economic 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.960
 as much to extinguish them and then disappear had admitted not to throw 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.120
 on the test per person do not use you who are you 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:41.199
 you have to prove that m all these investments meet her a 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.199
 economic interest for hoteliers when I go to see my 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.199
 hotel colleagues 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.590
 I tell them ecology people it's great it's beautiful for his wife you 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.879
 will be a great environmental activist with great decorations north you go 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.029
 earn money you have earned money in you are going to make some 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.919
 savings 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.819
 % and maybe in the medium and long term you will do in all these 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:00.569
 investments are not made for nothing that's the first argument the 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.979
 second argument is in terms of image for you also take place of that 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:06.279
 will serve you if you make really ugly 

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:10.039
 the things thoroughly at 1 and not the greenwashing on which we struggle 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.839
 you will be able to acquire new customers that you will do 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.729
 savings aside make extra turnover from 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:20.499
 the other one here are the two quick arguments that are shocking 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:23.359
 when we talk to business leaders who are sometimes we can 

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:23.919
 in trouble
