the amount of alcohol you have you're

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.499 
the amount of alcohol you have you're
registering<00:01:47.549> very<00:01:47.790> close<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.180> her<00:01:48.299> but

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
registering very close to her but

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.569 
registering very close to her but
because<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> her<00:01:49.020> body<00:01:49.229> size<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:50.040> absorbs

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because of her body size it absorbs

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.950 
because of her body size it absorbs
quicker<00:01:50.820> into<00:01:51.090> her<00:01:51.210> bloodstream<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.720> little

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
quicker into her bloodstream a little

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.840 
quicker into her bloodstream a little
bit<00:01:52.049> more<00:01:52.470> less<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> her<00:01:53.130> basically<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.820> what

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
bit more less to her basically is what

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.660 
bit more less to her basically is what
two<00:01:54.210> glasses<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.780> me<00:01:54.930> yes<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.770> at<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.430> point

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
two glasses to me yes at at this point

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.149 
two glasses to me yes at at this point
as<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.969> drink<00:01:57.689> count<00:01:57.960> went<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.890> did<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
as the drink count went up so did the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.090 
as the drink count went up so did the
readings<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.670> both<00:01:59.880> breathalyzers<00:02:00.689> point<00:02:01.229> 115

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
readings on both breathalyzers point 115

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.999 
readings on both breathalyzers point 115
so<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:03.149> also<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:03.960> way<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.409> while<00:02:04.860> the

so you you also on your way up while the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.920 
so you you also on your way up while the
personal<00:02:05.430> breathalyzer<00:02:05.969> was<00:02:06.329> accurate

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
personal breathalyzer was accurate

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
personal breathalyzer was accurate
officers<00:02:07.500> say<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.920> shouldn't<00:02:08.250> give<00:02:08.429> drinkers

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
officers say it shouldn't give drinkers

the green light to drive after all you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.550 
the green light to drive after all you
can<00:02:11.520> still<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.879> under<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.330> influence<00:02:12.500> even

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
can still be under the influence even

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470 
can still be under the influence even
if<00:02:13.650> you're<00:02:13.800> under<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.580> legal<00:02:14.760> limit<00:02:14.910> after<00:02:15.330> a

if you're under the legal limit after a

glass<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.810> wine<00:02:15.930> we<00:02:16.140> could<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.470> some<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
glass of wine we could see some of the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.280 
glass of wine we could see some of the
things<00:02:17.819> coming<00:02:18.150> out<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.420> heard<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.750> weren't

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
things coming out and heard that weren't

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.890 
things coming out and heard that weren't
there<00:02:19.470> when<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.739> first<00:02:19.980> started<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:20.849> even<00:02:21.750> at<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
there when we first started so even at a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.699 
there when we first started so even at a
point<00:02:22.140> 04<00:02:22.860> 05<00:02:23.459> with<00:02:23.819> her<00:02:24.080> she<00:02:25.080> was<00:02:25.200> getting

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
point 04 05 with her she was getting

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.780 
point 04 05 with her she was getting
borderline<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> where<00:02:26.310> she's<00:02:26.489> probably

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
borderline to where she's probably

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.009 
borderline to where she's probably
couldn't<00:02:27.330> operate<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.630> vehicle<00:02:28.069> fairly<00:02:29.069> well

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
couldn't operate a vehicle fairly well

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.479 
couldn't operate a vehicle fairly well
and<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.200> course<00:02:31.410> officers<00:02:31.830> say<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.160> best<00:02:32.340> way

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
and of course officers say the best way

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.580 
and of course officers say the best way
to<00:02:32.640> avoid<00:02:32.910> becoming<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.780> statistic<00:02:33.959> is<00:02:34.470> to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to avoid becoming a statistic is to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.350 
to avoid becoming a statistic is to
always<00:02:34.769> have<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> designated<00:02:35.459> driver<00:02:36.120> and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
always have a designated driver and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.059 
always have a designated driver and
that's<00:02:36.660> exactly<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.410> did<00:02:37.590> with<00:02:37.769> our<00:02:37.800> two

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
that's exactly what we did with our two

that's exactly what we did with our two
KSBY<00:02:38.580> employees<00:02:39.269> both<00:02:39.569> got<00:02:40.230> rides<00:02:40.500> home
