00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
time to create content I thought it

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.400 
time to create content I thought it
might<00:00:55.100> be<00:00:55.280> cool<00:00:55.940> to<00:00:56.000> take<00:00:56.449> some<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.350> the

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
might be cool to take some of the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.360 
might be cool to take some of the
technologies<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.100> have<00:00:58.340> been

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
technologies that have been

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.310 
technologies that have been
revolutionary<00:01:01.659> put<00:01:02.659> them<00:01:02.870> all<00:01:03.019> into<00:01:03.199> one

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
revolutionary put them all into one

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.950

work<00:01:12.860> hand<00:01:13.130> in<00:01:13.220> hand<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:13.909> how<00:01:14.030> can<00:01:14.090> we<00:01:14.360> blend

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
work hand in hand but how can we blend

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.940 
work hand in hand but how can we blend
them<00:01:14.960> together<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.530> they<00:01:15.650> work

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
them together so that they work

them together so that they work
seamlessly<00:01:16.310> together<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.479> also<00:01:17.750> add<00:01:18.020> some

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
seamlessly together and also add some

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.590 
seamlessly together and also add some
newer<00:01:18.530> technologies<00:01:19.250> at<00:01:19.400> home<00:01:19.520> to<00:01:20.060> create<00:01:20.390> one
