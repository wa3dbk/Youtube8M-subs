00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
all of that information is here or you

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:06.839 
all of that information is here or you
can<00:05:05.500> set<00:05:05.650> up<00:05:05.740> recurring<00:05:05.889> payments<00:05:06.639> and<00:05:06.759> this

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
can set up recurring payments and this

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:07.950 
can set up recurring payments and this
is<00:05:06.970> something<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.270> we<00:05:07.419> are<00:05:07.509> really<00:05:07.630> stoked

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
is something that we are really stoked

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.420 
is something that we are really stoked
about<00:05:08.110> so<00:05:08.349> let's<00:05:08.500> say<00:05:08.590> we<00:05:08.710> have<00:05:08.830> a<00:05:08.860> house<00:05:09.130> a

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
about so let's say we have a house a

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.420 
about so let's say we have a house a
writ<00:05:09.729> that's<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.240> monthly<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.199> it's<00:05:11.680> 300<00:05:12.250> quid

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
writ that's a monthly and it's 300 quid

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.189 
writ that's a monthly and it's 300 quid
so<00:05:12.880> let's<00:05:13.060> go<00:05:13.240> in<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:13.630> will<00:05:13.720> actually<00:05:13.990> change

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
so let's go in and will actually change

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.680 
so let's go in and will actually change
this<00:05:14.789> let's<00:05:15.789> just<00:05:15.849> you<00:05:16.120> could<00:05:16.330> either<00:05:16.419> add<00:05:16.659> a

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
this let's just you could either add a

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.969 
this let's just you could either add a
description<00:05:17.080> or<00:05:17.470> we<00:05:17.530> could<00:05:17.620> change<00:05:17.800> the

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
description or we could change the

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.760 
description or we could change the
category<00:05:18.190> let's<00:05:18.610> just<00:05:18.849> say<00:05:19.030> that<00:05:19.469> instead<00:05:20.469> of

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
category let's just say that instead of

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.830 
category let's just say that instead of
300<00:05:21.520> my<00:05:21.669> rent<00:05:21.909> has<00:05:22.060> been<00:05:22.210> raised<00:05:22.419> to<00:05:22.569> four

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
300 my rent has been raised to four

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.249 
300 my rent has been raised to four
hundred<00:05:23.139> and<00:05:23.229> fifty<00:05:23.800> quid<00:05:24.009> so<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.310> hit<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:25.259> you

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
hundred and fifty quid so I hit that you

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.959 
hundred and fifty quid so I hit that you
can<00:05:26.379> also<00:05:26.469> change<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:26.949> recurrence<00:05:27.639> so<00:05:27.819> let's

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
can also change the recurrence so let's

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:29.459 
can also change the recurrence so let's
say<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.150> have<00:05:28.210> it<00:05:28.419> said<00:05:28.599> to<00:05:28.690> do<00:05:28.810> monthly<00:05:29.199> I<00:05:29.289> can

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:29.469 
say I have it said to do monthly I can

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.189 
say I have it said to do monthly I can
also<00:05:29.590> do<00:05:29.770> two<00:05:29.949> months<00:05:30.250> three<00:05:30.310> months<00:05:31.020> or<00:05:32.020> I<00:05:32.080> can

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
also do two months three months or I can

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.749 
also do two months three months or I can
go<00:05:32.319> in<00:05:32.469> here<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:32.650> add<00:05:32.860> specific<00:05:33.099> day<00:05:33.490> so<00:05:33.699> I

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
go in here and add specific day so I

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.180 
go in here and add specific day so I
can't<00:05:33.909> even<00:05:33.969> do<00:05:34.120> like<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.710> five-day<00:05:35.710> recurring

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
can't even do like a five-day recurring

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.520 
can't even do like a five-day recurring
payment<00:05:36.639> or<00:05:37.180> let's<00:05:37.509> just<00:05:37.659> go<00:05:37.750> back<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:38.199> month

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
payment or let's just go back to a month

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.469 
payment or let's just go back to a month
so<00:05:38.740> all<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:38.949> that<00:05:39.099> is<00:05:39.340> very<00:05:39.580> easy<00:05:39.729> to<00:05:39.909> use<00:05:39.969> very

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
so all of that is very easy to use very

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:41.850 
so all of that is very easy to use very
simple<00:05:40.539> to<00:05:40.870> set<00:05:41.050> up<00:05:41.080> it<00:05:41.289> takes<00:05:41.469> only<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.710> matter

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
simple to set up it takes only a matter

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.290 
simple to set up it takes only a matter
of<00:05:41.979> minutes<00:05:42.099> to<00:05:42.400> either<00:05:42.550> enter<00:05:42.940> a<00:05:42.969> transaction

of minutes to either enter a transaction
or<00:05:43.719> into<00:05:43.900> newer<00:05:44.050> enter<00:05:44.500> a<00:05:44.529> new<00:05:44.710> recurring

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
or into newer enter a new recurring

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.649 
or into newer enter a new recurring
payment<00:05:45.520> even<00:05:45.849> to<00:05:46.060> change<00:05:46.270> your<00:05:46.360> account
