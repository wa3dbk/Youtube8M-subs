it's called the large shader brush and

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.160 
it's called the large shader brush and
basically<00:03:10.129> it's<00:03:10.489> just<00:03:10.639> a<00:03:10.939> larger<00:03:11.569> version<00:03:11.989> of

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.219 
I love is this little small flat shader
brush<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.760> one<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.180> very<00:04:11.540> similar<00:04:12.079> to

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:12.229 
brush and this one is very similar to

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:13.990 
brush and this one is very similar to
the<00:04:12.440> one<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:12.769> showed<00:04:12.799> before<00:04:13.069> only<00:04:13.729> that

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
the one that I showed before only that

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.910 
the one that I showed before only that
it's<00:04:14.150> much<00:04:14.540> much<00:04:14.840> smaller<00:04:15.639> it's<00:04:16.639> a

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
it's much much smaller it's a

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.550 
it's much much smaller it's a
bit<00:04:17.070> more<00:04:17.220> deaths<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:18.300> it's<00:04:18.720> really<00:04:18.900> easy<00:04:19.230> to

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
bit more deaths so it's really easy to

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.720 
bit more deaths so it's really easy to
get<00:04:19.710> right<00:04:19.950> into<00:04:20.420> making<00:04:21.420> that<00:04:21.450> outer<00:04:21.870> V

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
prefer it over the Mach 1 because it's

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.790 
prefer it over the Mach 1 because it's
more<00:05:59.970> pointed<00:06:00.450> it's<00:06:00.660> smaller<00:06:01.200> it<00:06:01.440> can<00:06:01.590> be<00:06:01.680> more

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
more pointed it's smaller it can be more

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.040 
more pointed it's smaller it can be more
precise<00:06:02.640> with<00:06:02.850> it<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.450> does<00:06:03.660> take<00:06:03.870> a<00:06:03.900> little

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
precise with it it does take a little

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.600 
precise with it it does take a little
bit<00:06:04.200> longer<00:06:04.410> to<00:06:04.680> fill<00:06:04.860> in<00:06:04.950> your<00:06:05.040> lips<00:06:05.250> because

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
bit longer to fill in your lips because

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.850 
bit longer to fill in your lips because
it<00:06:05.730> is<00:06:05.850> pointed<00:06:06.270> but<00:06:06.600> I<00:06:06.840> prefer<00:06:07.440> that<00:06:07.650> over

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
it is pointed but I prefer that over

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.980 
it is pointed but I prefer that over
something<00:06:08.580> that<00:06:08.730> is<00:06:08.880> very<00:06:09.060> very<00:06:09.510> wide<00:06:09.960> and

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
something that is very very wide and

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.840 
something that is very very wide and
then<00:06:10.350> you<00:06:10.470> can't<00:06:10.710> really<00:06:10.920> be<00:06:11.040> so<00:06:11.220> precise<00:06:11.610> one

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
then you can't really be so precise one

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.340 
then you can't really be so precise one
of<00:06:11.940> the<00:06:12.030> things<00:06:12.180> that<00:06:12.330> I<00:06:12.540> personally<00:06:12.840> struggle
