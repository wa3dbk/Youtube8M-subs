 the same ears for fashion bloggers and 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.850
 I think they look very beautiful and 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.519
 incredibly sexy in fact these 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.820
 ears are quite expensive and I tell you 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.280
 I suggest they do well I do not know at four 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.840
 times cheaper and simpler easier to say 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.000
 do it yourself 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.990
 so let's go for ears we need 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.899
 black velvet skein wire 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.080
 pliers black lace 2 rim pei 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.170
 and scissors we take the old bezel without 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.140
 pebbles velvet cut into thin 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.320
 stripes that length cut off 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.979
 pliers bend a piece of wire 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.979
 her in half 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.840
 take a velvet ribbon a little glue 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.259
 printed on the tip of velvet fasten on 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.869
 end of the wire and start winding 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.950
 until we get to the end 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.950
 also fix with glue 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.720
 we cut off a piece of lace we cut it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.160
 under the size of our cat's ear and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.950
 glue but try 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.800
 leave a place for tails so that later 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.450
 it was possible to fix them on the bezel 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.450
 Now in this way 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.400

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.400

 after the ears are done do 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.389
 lace veil cut off a piece of lace 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.419
 and the tips are fastened with glue, trim the edges 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:29.719
 to make a sexy oval 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:32.750
 barking can be lowered on the eyes or wear 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:34.400
