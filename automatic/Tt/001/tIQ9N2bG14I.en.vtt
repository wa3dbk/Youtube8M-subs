00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.020 
excited to see how this Drive performs
once<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.769> actually<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.400> fired<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.819> its

reason because this is not a cheap and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.990 
reason because this is not a cheap and
expensive<00:02:30.239> drive<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:31.349> got<00:02:31.549> 512<00:02:32.549> megs<00:02:32.849> of

cash that is ddr3 1333 cash which is one

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.690 
cash that is ddr3 1333 cash which is one
of<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.720> fastest<00:02:37.260> cash<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.680> out<00:02:37.829> there<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:38.579> it

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
of the fastest cash is out there so it

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.839 
of the fastest cash is out there so it
is<00:02:38.730> well<00:02:39.599> its<00:02:40.170> state-of-the-art<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:41.639> new

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
is well its state-of-the-art this new

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.280 
is well its state-of-the-art this new
controller<00:02:42.209> from<00:02:42.389> Marvel<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.870> actually

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
controller from Marvel is actually

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770 
controller from Marvel is actually
technically<00:02:43.739> say<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.069> 3.1<00:02:44.969> so<00:02:45.510> even<00:02:45.750> though

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
technically say to 3.1 so even though

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.809 
technically say to 3.1 so even though
that<00:02:45.989> looks<00:02:46.230> like<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.439> standard<00:02:46.709> say<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.459> say<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
that looks like a standard say to say to

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.449 
that looks like a standard say to say to
Tuesday<00:02:48.329> 23<00:02:48.720> data<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.680> power<00:02:49.799> connector<00:02:50.340> it

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
Tuesday 23 data and power connector it

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.940 
Tuesday 23 data and power connector it
actually<00:02:50.819> supports<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.329> couple<00:02:51.689> of<00:02:51.919> new<00:02:52.919> things

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
actually supports a couple of new things

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.280 
actually supports a couple of new things
including<00:02:53.760> most<00:02:53.909> importantly<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.900> ability

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
including most importantly the ability

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.679 
including most importantly the ability
to<00:02:55.500> prioritize<00:02:56.099> trim<00:02:56.519> commands<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.599> not

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
to prioritize trim commands so it not

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:00.319 
to prioritize trim commands so it not
only<00:02:57.750> supports<00:02:58.409> trim<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.189> can<00:02:59.370> wait<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.209> do

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
only supports trim but it can wait to do

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.940 
only supports trim but it can wait to do
trim<00:03:00.689> in<00:03:00.900> order<00:03:01.169> to<00:03:01.260> finish<00:03:01.439> some<00:03:01.709> outstanding

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
trim in order to finish some outstanding

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.460 
trim in order to finish some outstanding
iOS<00:03:02.519> and<00:03:02.819> then<00:03:03.269> execute<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> trim<00:03:04.049> command<00:03:04.079> in

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
iOS and then execute the trim command in

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.559 
iOS and then execute the trim command in
order<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.829> improve<00:03:05.159> efficiency<00:03:05.849> as<00:03:06.000> long<00:03:06.540> as

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
order to improve efficiency as long as

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.629 
order to improve efficiency as long as
you<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.319> compatible<00:03:07.919> controller<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.609> the

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
you have a compatible controller on the

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.149 
you have a compatible controller on the
other<00:03:08.909> side<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:10.049> of<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.379> data<00:03:10.590> connection

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
other side of the of the data connection

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.240 
other side of the of the data connection
so<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:13.200> drive<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.500> can<00:03:13.799> tell<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.069> guys<00:03:14.189> right

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
so this drive I can tell you guys right

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.940 
so this drive I can tell you guys right
now<00:03:14.459> is<00:03:14.849> pretty<00:03:15.450> much<00:03:15.629> at<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:15.930> top<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.769> terms

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
now is pretty much at the top in terms

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.080 
now is pretty much at the top in terms
of<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.220> sequential<00:03:17.609> read<00:03:17.879> and<00:03:18.030> write

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
of the sequential read and write

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.909 
of the sequential read and write
performance<00:03:18.329> however<00:03:19.139> there's<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.590> lot<00:03:19.889> more

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
performance however there's a lot more

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.460 
performance however there's a lot more
to<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.639> necessarily<00:03:21.180> than<00:03:21.629> that<00:03:21.870> when<00:03:22.349> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
to it necessarily than that when it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.319 
to it necessarily than that when it
comes<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.889> drive<00:03:23.220> performance<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:24.030> can<00:03:24.120> see

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
comes to drive performance you can see

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.610 
comes to drive performance you can see
what's<00:03:24.510> their<00:03:24.690> spec<00:03:24.959> so<00:03:25.139> they're<00:03:25.290> saying<00:03:25.500> up

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
what's their spec so they're saying up

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.369 
what's their spec so they're saying up
to<00:03:25.829> 540<00:03:26.609> MiG's<00:03:26.760> per<00:03:26.849> second<00:03:27.359> reads<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:27.870> up<00:03:28.260> to

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
to 540 MiG's per second reads and up to

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.110 
to 540 MiG's per second reads and up to
450<00:03:29.040> Meg's<00:03:29.220> per<00:03:29.370> second<00:03:29.699> right<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:29.970> those

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
450 Meg's per second right so those

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.699 
450 Meg's per second right so those
reeds<00:03:30.329> are<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.659> fastest<00:03:31.079> out<00:03:31.229> there<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
reeds are the fastest out there and the

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.920 
reeds are the fastest out there and the
rights<00:03:31.949> leg<00:03:32.579> just<00:03:32.849> a<00:03:33.000> little<00:03:33.030> bit<00:03:33.479> behind<00:03:33.810> the

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
rights leg just a little bit behind the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.349 
rights leg just a little bit behind the
vertex<00:03:34.379> 4<00:03:34.650> random<00:03:35.250> read<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:35.819> random<00:03:36.120> right<00:03:36.329> I

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
vertex 4 random read and random right I

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.780 
vertex 4 random read and random right I
ops<00:03:36.720> again<00:03:37.109> are<00:03:37.409> pretty<00:03:38.190> much<00:03:38.430> class-leading

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
ops again are pretty much class-leading

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.990 
ops again are pretty much class-leading
so<00:03:39.389> I'm<00:03:39.510> expecting<00:03:39.949> very<00:03:40.949> very<00:03:41.760> good

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
so I'm expecting very very good

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.640 
so I'm expecting very very good
performance<00:03:42.180> from<00:03:42.599> this<00:03:42.810> drive<00:03:43.019> their<00:03:43.470> mean

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
performance from this drive their mean

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.909 
performance from this drive their mean
time<00:03:43.829> between<00:03:43.859> failure<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:45.650> 2,400,000<00:03:46.650> hours

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
time between failure is 2,400,000 hours

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.469 
time between failure is 2,400,000 hours
so<00:03:47.459> remember<00:03:47.729> guys<00:03:48.000> mean<00:03:48.239> time<00:03:48.449> between

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
so remember guys mean time between

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.659 
so remember guys mean time between
failures<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.409> an<00:03:49.530> industry<00:03:49.829> standard<00:03:49.979> method

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
failures is an industry standard method

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.030 
failures is an industry standard method
to<00:03:50.819> determine<00:03:51.120> what<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.019> average<00:03:52.199> time<00:03:52.739> for

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
to determine what the average time for

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.129 
to determine what the average time for
failure<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.729> I<00:03:54.000> think<00:03:54.510> they<00:03:54.629> have<00:03:54.659> to<00:03:54.959> use

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
failure for I think they have to use

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.080 
failure for I think they have to use
something<00:03:55.650> like<00:03:55.680> however<00:03:56.250> many<00:03:56.549> hundreds<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
something like however many hundreds of

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.369 
something like however many hundreds of
drives<00:03:57.389> at<00:03:57.599> a<00:03:57.659> time<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:57.989> run<00:03:58.139> them<00:03:58.260> all

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
drives at a time they run them all

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.530 
drives at a time they run them all
through<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.620> standardized<00:03:59.129> test<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.790> see<00:04:00.419> how

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
through a standardized test and see how

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.270 
through a standardized test and see how
many<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.840> them<00:04:00.930> fail<00:04:00.989> and<00:04:01.439> after<00:04:01.650> how<00:04:01.799> long<00:04:01.859> to

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
many of them fail and after how long to

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.979 
many of them fail and after how long to
determine<00:04:02.400> how<00:04:02.819> long<00:04:02.879> it<00:04:03.060> would<00:04:03.269> take<00:04:03.299> for<00:04:03.689> the

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
determine how long it would take for the

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.960 
determine how long it would take for the
drugs<00:04:04.199> to<00:04:04.290> fail<00:04:04.560> on<00:04:04.739> average<00:04:05.099> let's<00:04:05.699> just<00:04:05.760> get

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
drugs to fail on average let's just get

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.460 
drugs to fail on average let's just get
and<00:04:06.239> see<00:04:06.359> if<00:04:06.449> they<00:04:06.569> have<00:04:06.659> anything<00:04:06.900> else<00:04:07.199> to

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
and see if they have anything else to

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.979 
and see if they have anything else to
say<00:04:07.500> for<00:04:07.919> themselves<00:04:08.209> besides<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.569> so

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
say for themselves besides that so

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.659 
say for themselves besides that so

right so you can restore it to a like

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.999 
right so you can restore it to a like

although<00:04:32.230> if<00:04:32.350> you're<00:04:32.500> installing<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.980> in<00:04:33.070> a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
although if you're installing it in a

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.790 
although if you're installing it in a
notebook<00:04:33.280> which<00:04:33.670> you<00:04:33.790> can<00:04:34.000> because<00:04:34.270> it's<00:04:34.420> slim

the mounting adapters that you need a

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.310 
the mounting adapters that you need a
ziplock<00:04:39.220> baggie<00:04:39.490> includes<00:04:41.280> no<00:04:42.280> need<00:04:42.550> Oh<00:04:43.320> neat

performance<00:04:46.030> analyzer<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:47.290> mean<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.710> guess

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
performance analyzer I mean I guess

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.960 
performance analyzer I mean I guess
they're<00:04:48.070> not<00:04:48.190> shy<00:04:48.400> about<00:04:48.550> their<00:04:48.820> performance

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
they're not shy about their performance

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.360 
they're not shy about their performance
because<00:04:49.660> they're<00:04:50.170> they're<00:04:50.530> plextor<00:04:50.920> I<00:04:50.950> mean<00:04:51.190> I

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
because they're they're plextor I mean I

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.290 
because they're they're plextor I mean I
had<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.490> meeting<00:04:51.640> with<00:04:51.790> them<00:04:52.000> they're<00:04:52.180> like

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
had a meeting with them they're like

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.840 
had a meeting with them they're like
yeah<00:04:52.480> yeah<00:04:52.870> we<00:04:53.740> we're<00:04:54.160> pretty<00:04:54.190> much<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.700> best

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
yeah yeah we we're pretty much the best

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.040 
yeah yeah we we're pretty much the best
when<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.090> comes<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.480> quality<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:55.870> performance

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
when it comes to quality and performance

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.740 
when it comes to quality and performance
I<00:04:56.640> actually<00:04:57.640> didn't<00:04:58.030> even<00:04:58.180> know<00:04:58.360> this<00:04:58.570> at<00:04:58.720> the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
I actually didn't even know this at the

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.990 
I actually didn't even know this at the
time<00:04:58.870> but<00:04:59.200> they're<00:04:59.380> one<00:04:59.530> of<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.680> top

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000
