and<00:01:12.740> I've<00:01:13.740> told<00:01:14.220> guys<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:14.820> profile

and I've told guys in my profile

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510 
and I've told guys in my profile
analysis<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.750> Nicholas<00:01:16.590> Walters<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> big

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
analysis that Nicholas Walters is a big

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.690 
analysis that Nicholas Walters is a big
feather<00:01:17.820> way<00:01:18.000> who<00:01:18.150> rehydrates<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> 140s

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
feather way who rehydrates into the 140s

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.800 
feather way who rehydrates into the 140s
so<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> don't<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.060> he's<00:01:21.240> gonna<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.479> able<00:01:21.659> to

so I don't think he's gonna be able to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.950 
so I don't think he's gonna be able to
be<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.200> another<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:23.130> another<00:01:23.369> fight

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
very well um I think after maybe three

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.210 
very well um I think after maybe three
or<00:02:25.210> four<00:02:25.450> rounds<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.930> rounds<00:02:26.830> were<00:02:26.920> kind<00:02:27.130> of

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
or four rounds the rounds were kind of

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.040 
or four rounds the rounds were kind of
close<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.580> my<00:02:27.670> mind<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.060> didn't<00:02:28.570> think<00:02:28.690> Walters

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
close in my mind I didn't think Walters

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.720 
close in my mind I didn't think Walters
was<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.530> didn't<00:02:29.800> think<00:02:29.890> Walters<00:02:30.250> began<00:02:30.580> to

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
was I didn't think Walters began to

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.490 
was I didn't think Walters began to
separate<00:02:31.120> himself<00:02:31.300> until<00:02:31.780> around<00:02:32.050> maybe<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
separate himself until around maybe the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.830

seventh<00:02:32.890> or<00:02:33.010> eighth<00:02:33.130> round<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.450> for<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840

to see how he can take away that punch
and<00:02:58.360> that's<00:02:58.960> what<00:02:59.080> he<00:02:59.170> showed<00:02:59.320> today<00:02:59.560> just

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
and that's what he showed today just

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.170 
and that's what he showed today just
like<00:03:00.040> he<00:03:00.130> didn't<00:03:00.430> through<00:03:00.580> nephrite<00:03:00.940> if<00:03:01.060> I

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
like he didn't through nephrite if I

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.670 
like he didn't through nephrite if I
thought<00:03:01.480> he<00:03:01.570> was<00:03:01.660> more<00:03:01.900> impressive<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.530> this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
thought he was more impressive in this

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.710 
thought he was more impressive in this
fight<00:03:02.890> than<00:03:03.070> Donaire<00:03:03.460> because<00:03:04.150> he<00:03:04.300> wasn't<00:03:04.480> as

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
fight than Donaire because he wasn't as

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.560 
fight than Donaire because he wasn't as
wild<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.230> he<00:03:05.770> was<00:03:06.070> able<00:03:06.220> to<00:03:06.460> show<00:03:06.670> us<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.060> he

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
wild and he was able to show us that he

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.420 
wild and he was able to show us that he
can<00:03:07.750> keep<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.020> consistency<00:03:08.740> he<00:03:08.890> didn't<00:03:09.220> show

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
can keep a consistency he didn't show

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.370 
can keep a consistency he didn't show
that<00:03:09.460> laziness<00:03:10.060> he<00:03:10.720> didn't<00:03:10.960> show<00:03:11.050> that<00:03:11.230> he<00:03:11.290> was

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380

his<00:03:28.150> division<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.660> still<00:03:28.780> be<00:03:28.900> competitive<00:03:29.440> I

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
his division and still be competitive I

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.900 
his division and still be competitive I
thought<00:03:29.770> that<00:03:29.980> he<00:03:30.070> was<00:03:30.160> much<00:03:30.370> better<00:03:30.550> than<00:03:30.760> no

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
thought that he was much better than no

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.410 
thought that he was much better than no
much<00:03:31.060> ankles<00:03:31.530> opponent<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.620> me<00:03:32.800> second<00:03:33.250> um<00:03:33.420> he

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
much ankles opponent on me second um he

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.820 
much ankles opponent on me second um he
looked<00:03:34.780> like<00:03:34.870> he<00:03:35.110> took<00:03:35.260> a<00:03:35.380> lot<00:03:35.560> of<00:03:35.590> great

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
looked like he took a lot of great

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.290 
looked like he took a lot of great
punches<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.340> court<00:03:36.550> he<00:03:36.700> did<00:03:36.910> suffer<00:03:37.120> the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
punches of court he did suffer the

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.330 
punches of court he did suffer the
knockdown<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:38.380> at<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.530> same<00:03:38.770> time<00:03:38.980> he<00:03:39.250> has

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
knockdown but at the same time he has

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.770 
knockdown but at the same time he has
really<00:03:39.550> good<00:03:39.730> balance<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.330> he<00:03:40.420> knows<00:03:40.630> how<00:03:40.750> to

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
really good balance and he knows how to

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.970 
really good balance and he knows how to
put<00:03:40.990> those<00:03:41.080> punches<00:03:41.320> up<00:03:41.560> together<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.860> think

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
put those punches up together I think

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.340 
put those punches up together I think
for<00:03:42.490> him<00:03:42.640> he<00:03:42.820> needs<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:43.510> better<00:03:43.540> at<00:03:44.020> not

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
for him he needs to do better at not

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.680 
for him he needs to do better at not

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
stand so still and not to be able to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.330 
stand so still and not to be able to
keep<00:03:49.570> his<00:03:49.630> hands<00:03:50.050> up<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.470> much<00:03:50.710> because<00:03:51.160> he

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
keep his hands up so much because he

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.650 
keep his hands up so much because he
keeps<00:03:51.490> him<00:03:51.670> up<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.850> little<00:03:51.880> too<00:03:52.270> high<00:03:52.390> and<00:03:52.600> that

keeps him up a little too high and that

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.870 
keeps him up a little too high and that

that he can still do a lil mo sang kho
fight<00:04:08.110> in<00:04:08.260> my<00:04:08.410> mind<00:04:08.680> if<00:04:08.860> he<00:04:09.070> can<00:04:09.280> if<00:04:09.490> he<00:04:09.580> goes

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
fight in my mind if he can if he goes

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.510 
fight in my mind if he can if he goes
back<00:04:09.970> into<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.330> gym<00:04:10.620> from<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:11.770> point<00:04:12.040> on<00:04:12.250> and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
back into the gym from this point on and

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.460 
back into the gym from this point on and
tries<00:04:13.000> to<00:04:13.030> keep<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.480> consistent<00:04:13.690> weight<00:04:14.230> and

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
tries to keep a consistent weight and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.970 
tries to keep a consistent weight and
then<00:04:14.620> tries<00:04:14.860> to<00:04:14.890> shoot<00:04:15.370> again<00:04:15.520> for<00:04:15.820> 126<00:04:16.480> I

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
then tries to shoot again for 126 I

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.240 
then tries to shoot again for 126 I
don't<00:04:17.980> think<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.370> it's<00:04:19.530> quite<00:04:20.530> his<00:04:20.770> I<00:04:20.950> think

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
don't think that it's quite his I think

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.680 
don't think that it's quite his I think
that<00:04:21.400> he<00:04:21.549> should<00:04:21.580> take<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.000> launch<00:04:22.419> angle

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
that he should take the launch angle

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.230 
that he should take the launch angle
fight<00:04:22.870> instead<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.380> moving<00:04:23.500> up<00:04:23.800> to<00:04:23.919> 130<00:04:24.370> and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
fight instead of moving up to 130 and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.820 
fight instead of moving up to 130 and
even<00:04:25.480> if<00:04:25.600> he<00:04:25.630> does<00:04:25.900> move<00:04:26.110> up<00:04:26.230> to<00:04:26.380> one-third

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
even if he does move up to one-third

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.469 
even if he does move up to one-third
next<00:04:27.159> I<00:04:27.340> think<00:04:27.639> he<00:04:27.729> would<00:04:27.849> be<00:04:27.879> a<00:04:28.000> really<00:04:28.270> good

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
next I think he would be a really good

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.990 
next I think he would be a really good
boxer<00:04:28.960> i-130<00:04:29.439> regardless<00:04:29.979> but<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.669> think<00:04:30.909> if

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
boxer i-130 regardless but I think if

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.429 
boxer i-130 regardless but I think if
they<00:04:31.090> really<00:04:31.419> are<00:04:31.569> serious<00:04:31.810> about<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.229> Loma

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:32.439 
they really are serious about the Loma

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.899 
they really are serious about the Loma
chango<00:04:32.770> if<00:04:32.830> I<00:04:32.949> even<00:04:33.280> though<00:04:33.370> won't<00:04:33.639> be<00:04:33.789> a

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
chango if I even though won't be a

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:35.339 
chango if I even though won't be a
unification<00:04:34.300> even<00:04:34.840> though<00:04:34.900> that's<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.139> bad

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:35.349 
unification even though that's the bad

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:40.050 
unification even though that's the bad
part<00:04:35.620> I<00:04:36.000> think<00:04:37.000> that<00:04:37.479> for<00:04:37.860> Walters<00:04:38.860> as<00:04:39.159> a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
part I think that for Walters as a

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.659 
part I think that for Walters as a
featherweight<00:04:40.509> I<00:04:40.840> think<00:04:41.469> he<00:04:41.680> should<00:04:41.889> I<00:04:42.189> even

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
featherweight I think he should I even

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.249 
featherweight I think he should I even
after<00:04:43.000> this<00:04:43.120> fight<00:04:43.360> he<00:04:43.599> should<00:04:43.780> take<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:43.990> week

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:44.259 
after this fight he should take a week

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:45.719 
after this fight he should take a week
off<00:04:44.439> and<00:04:44.620> go<00:04:44.710> right<00:04:44.889> back<00:04:44.919> in<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.340> gym<00:04:45.460> trying

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
off and go right back in the gym trying

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.670 
off and go right back in the gym trying

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
to contain his the way he shouldn't be

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.469 
to contain his the way he shouldn't be
taking<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.430> kind<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.669> time<00:04:48.819> that<00:04:48.969> he<00:04:49.090> took<00:04:49.240> off

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
taking the kind of time that he took off

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.290 
taking the kind of time that he took off

the<00:06:00.520> ring<00:06:00.729> off<00:06:00.909> which<00:06:01.180> is<00:06:01.330> why<00:06:01.479> I<00:06:01.509> think<00:06:01.960> he

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
the ring off which is why I think he

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.170 
the ring off which is why I think he
keeps<00:06:02.710> him<00:06:02.860> into<00:06:03.129> the<00:06:03.219> limo<00:06:03.430> chanco<00:06:03.729> fight<00:06:03.969> and

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
keeps him into the limo chanco fight and

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.839 
keeps him into the limo chanco fight and
he's<00:06:04.839> he's<00:06:05.310> physically<00:06:06.310> bigger<00:06:06.550> than<00:06:06.819> a

he's he's physically bigger than a

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.670 
he's he's physically bigger than a
little<00:06:07.000> bit<00:06:07.089> chamber<00:06:07.419> so<00:06:08.139> we'll<00:06:08.319> see<00:06:08.469> how<00:06:08.500> it

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
little bit chamber so we'll see how it

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.079 
little bit chamber so we'll see how it
goes<00:06:08.800> but<00:06:09.310> this<00:06:09.490> was<00:06:09.610> a<00:06:09.639> really<00:06:09.940> good

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089
