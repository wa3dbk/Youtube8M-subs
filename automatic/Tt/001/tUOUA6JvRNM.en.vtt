tank<00:00:05.960> share<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> few<00:00:07.230> thoughts<00:00:07.440> here<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.890> there

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
tank share a few thoughts here and there

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.240 
tank share a few thoughts here and there
let's<00:00:09.929> start<00:00:10.170> with<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.349> tank<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.800> general

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
let's start with the tank in general

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.150 
let's start with the tank in general
it's<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.210> pretty<00:00:12.420> cool<00:00:12.660> looking<00:00:12.870> tank<00:00:13.320> being

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
it's a pretty cool looking tank being

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.090 
it's a pretty cool looking tank being
reminisce<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> need<00:00:16.170> design<00:00:16.650> everything

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
reminisce and the need design everything

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
reminisce and the need design everything
concealed<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.970> everything<00:00:18.390> but<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
concealed and everything but it

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.870 
concealed and everything but it
certainly<00:00:19.619> makes<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> tank<00:00:20.340> far<00:00:20.699> more

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
certainly makes the tank far more

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.759 
certainly makes the tank far more
difficult<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.750> clean<00:00:23.900> because<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.260> piece

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
difficult to clean because this piece

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.500 
difficult to clean because this piece
runs<00:00:26.760> down<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.449> back<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.050> can't<00:00:28.439> get<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
runs down the back you can't get a

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.430 
runs down the back you can't get a
magnetic<00:00:31.099> little<00:00:32.099> cleaning<00:00:32.550> thing<00:00:33.440> behind

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
magnetic little cleaning thing behind

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.420 
magnetic little cleaning thing behind
this<00:00:35.309> area<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:36.000> obvious<00:00:36.329> reasons<00:00:37.219> with<00:00:38.219> that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
this area for obvious reasons with that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
this area for obvious reasons with that
of<00:00:38.579> course<00:00:38.790> taking<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.270> lid<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.480> taking<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
of course taking the lid off taking the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.990 
of course taking the lid off taking the
filter<00:00:40.469> out<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.739> all<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> kind<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.309> stuff<00:00:41.579> so

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
filter out and all that kind of stuff so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.740 
filter out and all that kind of stuff so
you<00:00:42.780> basically<00:00:43.050> have<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:44.270> get<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you basically have to get out the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.000 
you basically have to get out the
classic<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:47.190> know

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
classic you know

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
classic you know
scrubbing<00:00:50.010> wand<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:51.180> whatever<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.570> want<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
scrubbing wand or whatever you want to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
scrubbing wand or whatever you want to
call<00:00:51.960> them<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.940> not<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.329> huge<00:00:54.780> deal<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:55.430> it's

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
call them it's not a huge deal but it's

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.389 
call them it's not a huge deal but it's
definitely<00:00:56.670> nice<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.510> be<00:00:57.600> able<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.930> run<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
definitely nice to just be able to run a

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.799 
definitely nice to just be able to run a
magnetic<00:00:59.399> scrubber<00:00:59.789> across<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> whole<00:01:00.570> tank

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
magnetic scrubber across the whole tank

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.830 
magnetic scrubber across the whole tank
real<00:01:01.050> quick

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
real quick

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.570 
real quick
so<00:01:03.840> if<00:01:04.170> whether<00:01:04.379> or<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:04.830> worth<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.400> I'm

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so if whether or not it's worth it I'm

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.780 
so if whether or not it's worth it I'm
not<00:01:05.880> really<00:01:06.090> sure<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.020> up<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.560> person

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
not really sure kind of up to the person

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.010 
not really sure kind of up to the person
I'm<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> fence<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I'm on the fence about it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
I'm on the fence about it
I<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.350> certainly<00:01:10.530> suggest<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> check<00:01:12.360> out

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
I would certainly suggest you check out

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.730 
I would certainly suggest you check out
a<00:01:13.250> company<00:01:14.250> called<00:01:14.549> adda<00:01:15.350> just<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.500> three

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a company called adda just the three

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.880 
a company called adda just the three
letters<00:01:18.500> they<00:01:19.500> make<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.220> nice<00:01:20.939> looking

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
letters they make really nice looking

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.649 
letters they make really nice looking
frameless<00:01:23.600> rimless<00:01:25.220> tanks<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.479> if<00:01:27.479> you're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
frameless rimless tanks and if you're

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.530 
frameless rimless tanks and if you're
going<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.259> sleek<00:01:28.740> look<00:01:29.540> it's

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
going for that sleek look it's

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
going for that sleek look it's
definitely<00:01:31.049> possible<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.619> achieve<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
definitely possible to achieve with the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.600 
definitely possible to achieve with the
tank<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> I'd<00:01:35.130> certainly<00:01:35.310> look

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
tank like that so I'd certainly look

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.810 
tank like that so I'd certainly look
into<00:01:35.729> those<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.380> also<00:01:37.380> might<00:01:37.979> have<00:01:38.009> seen<00:01:38.430> my

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
into those you also might have seen my

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
into those you also might have seen my

can doesn't look like you can tell on
the<00:02:02.219> camera<00:02:02.960> but<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.409> unit<00:02:05.040> basically<00:02:05.520> casts

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the camera but the unit basically casts

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.520 
the camera but the unit basically casts
a<00:02:06.710> yellow<00:02:08.000> oranges<00:02:09.000> strip<00:02:09.599> of<00:02:09.840> light<00:02:10.140> all

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
along the front for like

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.150 
along the front for like
first<00:02:13.470> inch<00:02:13.830> or<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> tank<00:02:15.950> I'm<00:02:16.950> not

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
first inch or so of the tank I'm not

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.979 
first inch or so of the tank I'm not
sure<00:02:17.430> why<00:02:17.640> I've<00:02:18.000> taken<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.390> lid<00:02:18.569> off<00:02:18.750> I've

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
sure why I've taken the lid off I've

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.660 
sure why I've taken the lid off I've
lifted<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.440> light<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.129> it<00:02:20.190> seems<00:02:20.430> to

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
lifted the light up and it seems to

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.400 
lifted the light up and it seems to
remain<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.180> not<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> huge<00:02:24.840> deal<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.379> for

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
remain so it's not a huge deal but for

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.440 
remain so it's not a huge deal but for
the<00:02:25.650> price<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:25.950> unit<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.700> kind<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.300> it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the price that unit you kind of like it

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.650 
the price that unit you kind of like it
to<00:02:27.540> be<00:02:27.660> perfect<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.950> also<00:02:29.129> gets<00:02:29.550> very<00:02:29.940> very<00:02:30.150> hot

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
to be perfect it also gets very very hot

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.550 
to be perfect it also gets very very hot
and<00:02:31.290> evaporates<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.459> lot<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:33.030> water<00:02:33.560> compared

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
and evaporates a lot of water compared

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.979 
and evaporates a lot of water compared
to<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.040> stock<00:02:35.940> lights<00:02:36.300> which<00:02:36.599> is<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.900> be

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
to the stock lights which is to be

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.729 
to the stock lights which is to be
expected<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.709> some<00:02:37.920> extent<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:39.299> you<00:02:40.260> know<00:02:40.380> you

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
expected to some extent but you know you

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.030 
expected to some extent but you know you
don't<00:02:41.010> have<00:02:41.250> much<00:02:41.580> room<00:02:41.910> up<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.540> collar

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
don't have much room up in the collar

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.220 
don't have much room up in the collar
for<00:02:44.040> water<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.640> evaporate<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.630> then

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
for water to evaporate and then

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.140 
for water to evaporate and then
basically<00:02:46.680> when<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.099> happens<00:02:47.610> you'll<00:02:47.970> get<00:02:48.120> a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
basically when that happens you'll get a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.410 
basically when that happens you'll get a
big<00:02:48.420> air<00:02:49.110> bubble<00:02:49.560> down<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.610> know<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.849> one<00:02:51.180> side

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
big air bubble down you know to one side

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
big air bubble down you know to one side
of<00:02:51.599> the<00:02:51.660> tank<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.319> that's<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:53.910> ugly

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
of the tank and that's just really ugly

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.319 
of the tank and that's just really ugly
but<00:02:56.840> everything<00:02:57.840> else<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.260> doing<00:02:58.590> well<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:59.790> I

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
but everything else is doing well and I

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.270 
but everything else is doing well and I
guess<00:03:00.660> that's<00:03:00.840> about<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.230> all<00:03:01.799> right<00:03:02.010> thank

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
guess that's about it all right thank

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.340 
guess that's about it all right thank
