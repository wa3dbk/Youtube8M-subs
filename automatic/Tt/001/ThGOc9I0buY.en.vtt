first<00:00:23.130> thing<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.369> do<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.519> you<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
first thing you do is you do the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
first thing you do is you do the
standard<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> you'll<00:00:24.900> split<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.350> probes<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
standard and you'll split the probes and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.000 
standard and you'll split the probes and
you<00:00:26.939> send<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.720> first<00:00:27.990> probe<00:00:28.349> actually<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
you send the first probe actually to the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.600 
you send the first probe actually to the
ramp<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:30.349> you<00:00:31.349> know<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.070> it's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
ramp and you know it's it's it's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.580 
ramp and you know it's it's it's
standard<00:00:33.059> right<00:00:33.210> now<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.600> course<00:00:33.780> gather<00:00:34.380> at

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
standard right now of course gather at

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.670 
standard right now of course gather at
minerals<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> stuff<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:36.420> continue<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> build

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
minerals and stuff and continue to build

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.959 
minerals and stuff and continue to build
more<00:00:38.160> probes<00:00:39.440> as<00:00:40.440> soon<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.890> 25<00:00:41.460> energy

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
more probes as soon as you get 25 energy

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.590 
more probes as soon as you get 25 energy
a<00:00:42.000> chrono<00:00:42.660> boost<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.620> probes<00:00:44.059> it<00:00:45.059> lasts<00:00:45.329> 20

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a chrono boost the probes it lasts 20

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.209 
a chrono boost the probes it lasts 20
seconds<00:00:45.989> so<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.350> two<00:00:46.590> probes<00:00:46.920> down

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
seconds so you can get two probes down

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.139 
seconds so you can get two probes down
at<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.430> time<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.020> right<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:50.030> I'm<00:00:51.030> just

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
at that time so right now I'm just

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
at that time so right now I'm just
waiting<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.079> first<00:00:52.500> probe<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.860> get<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
waiting for the first probe to get to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.819 
waiting for the first probe to get to
the<00:00:53.340> ramp<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.899> play<00:00:54.899> five<00:00:55.110> energy<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.559> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the ramp and play five energy now so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.479 
the ramp and play five energy now so
great<00:00:56.039> chrono<00:00:56.309> boost<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.829> see<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:59.250> probes

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
great chrono boost and see up two probes

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.470 
great chrono boost and see up two probes
so<00:01:01.520> first<00:01:02.520> probe<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> wait<00:01:03.449> here

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
so first probe just going to wait here

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.649 
so first probe just going to wait here
until<00:01:04.010> there's<00:01:05.010> enough<00:01:05.250> minerals<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
until there's enough minerals for the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.820 
until there's enough minerals for the
pylon<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.110> here<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.500> goes<00:01:07.680> right<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
pylon and here it goes right here and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.950 
pylon and here it goes right here and
now<00:01:10.830> we're<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.030> wait<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:14.960> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
now we're just going to wait for the you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.690 
now we're just going to wait for the you

you know the if you'll know um basically

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.639 
you know the if you'll know um basically
that<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:57.200> prop<00:01:58.200> or<00:01:58.409> something

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that it's there if prop or something

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.559 
that it's there if prop or something
doesn't<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.579> it's<00:01:59.850> kind<00:02:00.329> of<00:02:00.359> more

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
doesn't see it so it's kind of more

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.590 
doesn't see it so it's kind of more
cheating<00:02:00.929> them<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.770> there<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:03.270> as

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
cheating them and there is now but so as

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.910 
cheating them and there is now but so as
soon<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.170> enough<00:02:04.380> knows<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> want

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
soon as you have enough knows you want

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.559 
soon as you have enough knows you want
to<00:02:04.979> put<00:02:05.189> down<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.640> photon<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.509> endure<00:02:07.099> because

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
to put down a photon can endure because

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.150 
to put down a photon can endure because
anything<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.690> put<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.229> ramp<00:02:10.500> will<00:02:10.860> catch

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
anything you put on the ramp will catch

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.059 
anything you put on the ramp will catch
the<00:02:11.430> attention<00:02:11.519> of<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.269> AI<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:13.230> we<00:02:13.980> don't

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
the attention of the AI and we don't

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.400 
the attention of the AI and we don't
want<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.489> do<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.930> we're<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.230> to

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
want that now do we so we're just to

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.140 
want that now do we so we're just to
continue<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.920> produce<00:02:17.129> probes<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.819> assumes

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
continue to produce probes and assumes

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.449 
continue to produce probes and assumes
that<00:02:18.330> photon<00:02:18.810> cannons<00:02:19.290> finished<00:02:19.680> you're

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
that photon cannons finished you're

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.020 
that photon cannons finished you're
going<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.849> ourselves<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.750> pylon<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.739> top

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
going to get ourselves a pylon on top

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.009 
going to get ourselves a pylon on top
but<00:02:24.030> until<00:02:24.420> then<00:02:25.160> oh<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.940> almost<00:02:27.150> done<00:02:27.390> so

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
but until then oh it's almost done so

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.449 
but until then oh it's almost done so
we're<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.410> move<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.709> probe<00:02:28.980> out<00:02:29.160> now

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
we're going to move the probe out now

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.410 
we're going to move the probe out now
and<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.680> basic<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.190> give<00:02:32.519> them<00:02:32.819> I'm<00:02:33.329> going

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and this is basic to give them I'm going

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.250 
and this is basic to give them I'm going
to<00:02:33.510> put<00:02:33.629> a<00:02:33.690> pile<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:34.019> down<00:02:34.819> right<00:02:35.819> here<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.260> I'm

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
to put a pile on down right here and I'm

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.479 
to put a pile on down right here and I'm
going<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.500> keep<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.769> probe<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.220> basically

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
going to keep the probe here basically

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.199 
going to keep the probe here basically
to<00:02:38.819> give<00:02:39.599> vision<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.859> photon<00:02:41.640> cats<00:02:41.910> like

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
to give vision to the photon cats like

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.349 
to give vision to the photon cats like
it<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.569> defend<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.920> art<00:02:44.099> pylons<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.940> our

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
it can defend the art pylons and our

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.740 
it can defend the art pylons and our
photon<00:02:45.810> cannons<00:02:46.310> okay<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.549> try<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.150> boost<00:02:48.420> to

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
photon cannons okay and try to boost to

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.260 
photon cannons okay and try to boost to
my<00:02:48.870> probes

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
my probes

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.350 
my probes
when<00:02:51.040> once<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.220> power<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.610> finished<00:02:53.060> with<00:02:53.240> a

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
when once the power is finished with a

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.560 
when once the power is finished with a
throw<00:02:53.570> down<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.050> two<00:02:54.680> photon<00:02:55.310> cannons<00:02:55.880> so

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
throw down the two photon cannons so

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.770 
throw down the two photon cannons so
there's<00:02:56.990> one<00:02:58.210> then<00:02:59.210> here's<00:02:59.540> another

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.780 

great<00:03:03.410> great<00:03:03.680> as<00:03:03.890> you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.220> see<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:07.250> takes

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
great great as you can see this it takes

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.790 
great great as you can see this it takes
you<00:03:08.300> takes<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.660> couple<00:03:08.810> more<00:03:09.080> steps<00:03:09.290> down<00:03:09.560> so

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
you takes a couple more steps down so

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.000 
you takes a couple more steps down so
just<00:03:09.950> cannon<00:03:10.340> rushed<00:03:10.520> yeah<00:03:11.350> but<00:03:12.350> now<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.890> we

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
just cannon rushed yeah but now that we

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.360 
just cannon rushed yeah but now that we
got<00:03:13.160> past<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.790> initial<00:03:14.030> part<00:03:14.450> now<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:15.050> can

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
got past the initial part now we can

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.280 
got past the initial part now we can
what<00:03:16.370> they're<00:03:16.520> attacking<00:03:16.819> now<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.450> what<00:03:18.260> I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
what they're attacking now so what I

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.870 
what they're attacking now so what I
usually<00:03:18.470> do<00:03:18.680> is<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:18.860> put<00:03:18.890> down<00:03:19.220> three<00:03:19.640> more

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
usually do is I put down three more

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.420 
usually do is I put down three more
photon<00:03:20.330> cannons<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.900> side<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.250> I<00:03:22.280> can

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
photon cannons on the side so I can

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.210 
photon cannons on the side so I can
defend<00:03:22.819> my<00:03:23.030> Forge<00:03:23.390> its<00:03:23.920> forges<00:03:24.920> most

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
defend my Forge its forges most

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.809 
defend my Forge its forges most
important<00:03:25.610> thing<00:03:25.819> and<00:03:26.000> of<00:03:26.300> course<00:03:26.770> yeah<00:03:27.819> or

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
important thing and of course yeah or

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.880 
important thing and of course yeah or
the<00:03:28.940> pile<00:03:29.120> on<00:03:29.300> but<00:03:30.050> we<00:03:30.380> can<00:03:30.530> see<00:03:30.650> if<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
the pile on but we can see if the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.979 
the pile on but we can see if the
zealots<00:03:31.250> left<00:03:31.550> so<00:03:31.760> you<00:03:31.819> put<00:03:32.270> down<00:03:32.480> about<00:03:32.690> two

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
zealots left so you put down about two

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.979 
zealots left so you put down about two
more<00:03:33.319> I<00:03:33.560> guess<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.640> motor<00:03:34.850> photon<00:03:35.269> cannons<00:03:35.750> as

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
more I guess to motor photon cannons as

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.240 
more I guess to motor photon cannons as
soon<00:03:36.230> as<00:03:36.380> have<00:03:36.800> enough<00:03:37.040> minerals<00:03:37.360> hey<00:03:38.360> go<00:03:38.510> I

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
soon as have enough minerals hey go I

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.790 
soon as have enough minerals hey go I
just<00:03:40.250> canceled<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.880> bottom<00:03:41.540> one<00:03:41.690> it's<00:03:42.560> far

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
just canceled the bottom one it's far

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.770 
just canceled the bottom one it's far
more<00:03:42.950> minerals<00:03:43.550> and<00:03:43.790> here<00:03:44.330> just<00:03:44.510> going<00:03:44.720> to

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
more minerals and here just going to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.080 
more minerals and here just going to
wait<00:03:44.870> for<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.080> cancer<00:03:45.350> fish<00:03:45.739> again<00:03:46.090> potato

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
wait for the cancer fish again potato

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.070 
wait for the cancer fish again potato
British<00:03:47.330> probes<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:49.450> hear<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.600> sentence<00:03:51.019> the

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
British probes and hear the sentence the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.410 
British probes and hear the sentence the
sentence<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.590> entire<00:03:51.950> army<00:03:52.340> here<00:03:52.550> I<00:03:52.790> only

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
sentence the entire army here I only

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.750 
sentence the entire army here I only
have<00:03:53.630> two<00:03:53.810> cannons<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:54.560> they<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.310> can<00:03:55.580> deal

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
have two cannons but they I can deal

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.100 
have two cannons but they I can deal
with<00:03:55.940> it

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
with it

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.820 
with it
yeah<00:03:58.860> probes<00:04:00.050> do<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.080> little<00:04:01.320> dance<00:04:01.560> right

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
yeah probes do a little dance right

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.390 
yeah probes do a little dance right
there<00:04:02.040> getting<00:04:02.790> blown<00:04:03.000> up<00:04:03.170> look<00:04:04.170> that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
there getting blown up look that

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.920 
there getting blown up look that
Cucaracha<00:04:05.960> look<00:04:06.960> at<00:04:07.080> that<00:04:07.820> do-do-do-do

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
Cucaracha look at that do-do-do-do

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.260 
Cucaracha look at that do-do-do-do
do-do-do-do<00:04:09.930> anyway<00:04:10.710> so<00:04:11.100> they<00:04:12.060> don't<00:04:12.210> know

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
do-do-do-do anyway so they don't know

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.370 
do-do-do-do anyway so they don't know
what<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.420> do<00:04:12.540> right<00:04:12.570> now<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.170> they're<00:04:13.290> quite

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
what to do right now but they're quite

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.770 
what to do right now but they're quite
right<00:04:13.590> head<00:04:13.740> back<00:04:13.980> or<00:04:14.280> put<00:04:14.970> an<00:04:15.120> expo<00:04:15.540> it

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
right head back or put an expo it

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.310

fine<00:04:36.600> i'm<00:04:36.900> as<00:04:37.560> soon<00:04:37.800> as<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.100> get<00:04:38.280> your<00:04:38.520> cans<00:04:38.820> in

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
fine i'm as soon as you get your cans in

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.200 
fine i'm as soon as you get your cans in
there<00:04:39.300> early<00:04:39.950> you<00:04:40.950> hold<00:04:41.370> off<00:04:41.520> an<00:04:42.120> attack<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.650> um

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
there early you hold off an attack so um

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.930 
there early you hold off an attack so um
all<00:04:45.210> got<00:04:45.540> the<00:04:45.660> pot<00:04:45.810> destroyed<00:04:46.730> but<00:04:47.730> now<00:04:47.880> we

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
all got the pot destroyed but now we

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.880 
all got the pot destroyed but now we
have<00:04:48.060> three<00:04:48.360> cannons<00:04:48.930> and<00:04:49.169> they're<00:04:49.590> hitting

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
have three cannons and they're hitting

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.280 
have three cannons and they're hitting
back<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.910> we<00:04:51.330> can<00:04:51.480> build<00:04:51.660> some<00:04:51.930> more

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.050 

okay<00:04:56.290> now<00:04:56.470> yeah<00:04:56.620> Afghans<00:04:57.340> offending<00:04:57.880> that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
okay now yeah Afghans offending that

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.660 
okay now yeah Afghans offending that
pile<00:04:58.300> on<00:04:58.480> but<00:04:58.690> not<00:04:59.020> to<00:04:59.140> be<00:04:59.230> scared<00:04:59.400> so<00:05:00.400> I'll<00:05:00.520> put

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
pile on but not to be scared so I'll put

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.050 
pile on but not to be scared so I'll put
down<00:05:00.820> another<00:05:00.910> one<00:05:01.740> just<00:05:02.740> so<00:05:02.860> that<00:05:02.890> we<00:05:03.460> can<00:05:03.730> get

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
down another one just so that we can get

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.590 
down another one just so that we can get
because<00:05:04.240> my<00:05:04.720> own<00:05:05.730> the<00:05:06.730> harvest<00:05:07.120> account<00:05:07.450> is

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
because my own the harvest account is

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.320 
because my own the harvest account is
almost<00:05:08.020> optimal<00:05:08.590> almost<00:05:09.220> I'll<00:05:09.460> say<00:05:09.730> it's<00:05:09.940> like

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
almost optimal almost I'll say it's like

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.030 
almost optimal almost I'll say it's like
five<00:05:10.600> probes<00:05:10.900> away<00:05:11.140> from<00:05:11.320> optimal<00:05:11.740> or

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
five probes away from optimal or

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.300 
five probes away from optimal or
actually<00:05:13.030> I<00:05:13.270> don't<00:05:14.080> know<00:05:14.170> probably<00:05:14.740> optimal

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
actually I don't know probably optimal

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.440 
actually I don't know probably optimal
so<00:05:16.890> you<00:05:17.890> know<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.370> incomes<00:05:19.000> really<00:05:19.240> really

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
so you know the incomes really really

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.320 
so you know the incomes really really
high<00:05:19.600> even<00:05:19.870> off<00:05:20.050> on<00:05:20.260> base<00:05:20.790> built<00:05:21.790> I<00:05:21.970> just

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
high even off on base built I just

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.330 
high even off on base built I just
bought<00:05:22.480> that<00:05:22.510> pylon<00:05:23.020> so<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.830> have

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
bought that pylon so that I can have

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.440 
bought that pylon so that I can have
more<00:05:24.820> places<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.300> waste<00:05:25.570> knows<00:05:27.090> as<00:05:28.090> you<00:05:28.270> see

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
more places to waste knows as you see

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.100 
more places to waste knows as you see
here<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.740> bill<00:05:30.280> working<00:05:30.760> in<00:05:30.880> three<00:05:31.570> photon

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
here the bill working in three photon

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.640 
here the bill working in three photon
cannons<00:05:33.120> dude<00:05:34.120> basically<00:05:34.540> destroy<00:05:34.960> any<00:05:35.290> of

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
cannons dude basically destroy any of

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.350 
cannons dude basically destroy any of
their<00:05:36.990> warp<00:05:37.990> gates<00:05:38.290> so<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:39.010> uh<00:05:39.270> you<00:05:40.270> know

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
their warp gates so that uh you know

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.270 
their warp gates so that uh you know
this<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:40.900> not<00:05:41.020> today<00:05:41.380> reinforcements<00:05:42.160> and

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
this is not today reinforcements and

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.920 
this is not today reinforcements and
then<00:05:42.400> there's<00:05:42.640> just<00:05:42.820> SCV's<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.510> the<00:05:43.600> picking

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
then there's just SCV's of the picking

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.620 
then there's just SCV's of the picking
see<00:05:44.650> see<00:05:44.830> right<00:05:44.980> there<00:05:45.160> the<00:05:45.210> way<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.240> chrono

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
see see right there the way I chrono

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.190 
see see right there the way I chrono
boost<00:05:46.900> itself<00:05:47.320> more<00:05:48.510> probes<00:05:49.510> out<00:05:49.720> but<00:05:50.050> that's

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
boost itself more probes out but that's

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.350 
boost itself more probes out but that's
fine<00:05:50.410> that's<00:05:50.680> fine<00:05:50.830> because<00:05:51.160> you<00:05:51.340> know<00:05:51.490> we

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
fine that's fine because you know we

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.410 
fine that's fine because you know we
work<00:05:52.660> with<00:05:52.900> cannon<00:05:53.290> rushing<00:05:54.060> cannon<00:05:55.060> rushing

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
work with cannon rushing cannon rushing

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.930 
work with cannon rushing cannon rushing
that's<00:05:55.750> right<00:05:55.960> nothing<00:05:56.350> beats<00:05:56.530> cannon<00:05:57.520> rush<00:05:57.730> i

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
that's right nothing beats cannon rush i

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.370 
that's right nothing beats cannon rush i

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
you know basically the circ insane zerg

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.239 
you know basically the circ insane zerg
one<00:06:21.939> base<00:06:22.180> is<00:06:22.449> more<00:06:22.689> like<00:06:22.869> insane<00:06:23.710> Sarah<00:06:24.009> to

00:06:24.239 --> 00:06:24.249 
one base is more like insane Sarah to

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:27.959 
one base is more like insane Sarah to
base<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:25.499> yeah<00:06:26.499> so<00:06:27.069> we're<00:06:27.490> gonna<00:06:27.580> put<00:06:27.639> down

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
base and yeah so we're gonna put down

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.959 
base and yeah so we're gonna put down
some<00:06:28.210> water<00:06:28.389> cannons
