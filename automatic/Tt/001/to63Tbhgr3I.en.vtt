00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
handle their own you know attributes

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.149 
handle their own you know attributes
shall<00:03:39.689> we<00:03:39.780> say<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.470> when<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.680> drive<00:03:40.889> another

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
shall we say so when you drive another

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.569 
shall we say so when you drive another
car<00:03:41.870> if<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.959> drive<00:03:43.139> a<00:03:43.169> 4x4<00:03:43.949> and<00:03:44.159> then<00:03:44.250> moves<00:03:44.489> to

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
car if you drive a 4x4 and then moves to

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.979 
car if you drive a 4x4 and then moves to
a<00:03:44.669> sports<00:03:45.030> car<00:03:45.239> you'll<00:03:45.629> notice<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
a sports car you'll notice the

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.300 
a sports car you'll notice the
difference<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.680> first<00:03:46.829> time<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.129> drive<00:03:47.250> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
difference the first time you drive a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.339 
difference the first time you drive a
sports<00:03:47.430> car<00:03:47.699> in<00:03:47.849> this<00:03:47.970> game<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.930> will<00:03:49.109> crash

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
sports car in this game you will crash

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.679 
sports car in this game you will crash
without<00:03:50.159> a<00:03:50.340> doubt<00:03:50.579> because<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.060> handling<00:03:51.509> is

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:51.689 
without a doubt because the handling is

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.629 
without a doubt because the handling is
so<00:03:51.989> loose<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.560> then<00:03:52.979> that<00:03:53.159> adds<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.549> the

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
so loose and then that adds to the

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.399 
so loose and then that adds to the
customization<00:03:54.060> when<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.959> customize<00:03:55.379> your

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
customization when you customize your

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:56.990 
customization when you customize your
car<00:03:55.620> in<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> garage<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.609> also<00:03:56.849> you<00:03:56.909> can

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
car in the garage is you also you can

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.080 
car in the garage is you also you can
upgrade<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.479> suspension<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:58.109> brakes<00:03:59.090> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
upgrade the suspension the brakes the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.999 
upgrade the suspension the brakes the
engine<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.900> adjust<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.439> handling<00:04:01.859> so

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.009 
engine you can adjust the handling so

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:03.469 
engine you can adjust the handling so
you<00:04:02.040> can<00:04:02.220> essentially<00:04:02.729> make<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.000> cars<00:04:03.239> better

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
you can essentially make the cars better

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:04.879 
you can essentially make the cars better
so<00:04:03.689> if<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.900> was<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.109> have<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.500> sports<00:04:04.680> car

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
so if I was to have that sports car

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.530 
so if I was to have that sports car
again<00:04:05.189> I<00:04:05.400> could<00:04:05.759> upgrade<00:04:05.879> it<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.359> make<00:04:06.449> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
again I could upgrade it and make the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.210 
again I could upgrade it and make the
handling<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.019> lot<00:04:07.199> better<00:04:07.470> than<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:07.799> was<00:04:08.009> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
handling and lot better than it was the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.339 
handling and lot better than it was the
first<00:04:08.459> time<00:04:08.549> I<00:04:08.669> used<00:04:09.569> it<00:04:09.979> your<00:04:10.979> drove<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.370> okay

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
first time I used it your drove is okay

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.509 
first time I used it your drove is okay
