00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
which was just like a very crinkly

feeling mile river unboxing rather I had
it<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> much<00:00:54.660> higher

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it in that and this is a much higher

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.729 
it in that and this is a much higher
quality<00:00:55.559> plastic<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.750> mo<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.809> continue

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
quality plastic so mo you continue

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.569 
quality plastic so mo you continue
simply<00:00:59.690> to<00:01:00.690> protect<00:01:01.020> their<00:01:01.530> sticker<00:01:01.920> quality

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
simply to protect their sticker quality

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.280 
simply to protect their sticker quality
now<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:04.890> doesn't<00:01:05.220> appear<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.020> they<00:01:07.020> change

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
now it doesn't appear that they change

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.980 
now it doesn't appear that they change
the<00:01:07.530> stickers<00:01:07.920> at<00:01:08.040> all<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.659> because<00:01:09.659> they

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
the stickers at all on this because they

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.859 
the stickers at all on this because they
did<00:01:10.170> change<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.560> stickers<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> su<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
did change the stickers on the a su to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.320 
did change the stickers on the a su to
have<00:01:13.290> fitted<00:01:13.950> ones<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.640> normal-sized

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
have fitted ones this is a normal-sized

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.749 
have fitted ones this is a normal-sized
a<00:01:15.570> lassoo<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.110> they<00:01:17.009> used<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.580> much

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
a lassoo and they used to be much

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.179 
a lassoo and they used to be much
smaller<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.380> didn't<00:01:19.680> really

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
smaller than this so they didn't really

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.980 
smaller than this so they didn't really
change<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> stickers<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:21.750> I

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
change the stickers on this which I

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.600 
change the stickers on this which I
thought<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.320> might<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.490> know<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
thought they might do but you know I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
thought they might do but you know I
don't<00:01:23.820> mind<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.360> all<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.630> shades<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.080> still

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
don't mind it all the shades are still

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:37.280 
don't mind it all the shades are still

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
though if I do say so myself this is I

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.940 
though if I do say so myself this is I
felt<00:02:02.729> with<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.299> ouch<00:02:03.540> wang<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> box

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
felt with the ouch wang out of the box

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.340 
felt with the ouch wang out of the box
is<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.509> need<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.110> broken

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
is that it it really need to be broken

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.219 
is that it it really need to be broken
in<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.819> don't<00:02:09.629> get<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> feeling

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
in and this one I don't get that feeling

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.070 
in and this one I don't get that feeling
near<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.950> much<00:02:11.160> on<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.610> as<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> did<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
near as much on it as I did with the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.530 
near as much on it as I did with the
other<00:02:13.230> five<00:02:13.470> by<00:02:13.650> five<00:02:13.830> out<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> box<00:02:14.540> so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
other five by five out of the box so

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.530 
other five by five out of the box so
that<00:02:15.960> is<00:02:16.350> definitely<00:02:16.380> an<00:02:17.010> improvement<00:02:17.310> as<00:02:18.300> of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that is definitely an improvement as of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.220 
that is definitely an improvement as of
now<00:02:18.570> just<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.280> first<00:02:20.520> impressions<00:02:25.760> so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230
