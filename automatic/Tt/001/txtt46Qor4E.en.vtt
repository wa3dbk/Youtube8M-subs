00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Hello everyone, Kirill is my new 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.470
 project simple arrangements in this press i 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 I will fly up immediately shadow mechanism 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.490
 Einkrad at the same time explains the available and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.889
 clear mechanism will be pretty 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.369
 simple but very cool is not necessary 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.250
 write kamentah like fuuu rolled the same 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.980
 ksk stop sopilka get-togethers for gays 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.890
 Manh fold preschoolers Cyril is not 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 will deny any of this i just 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.099
 looking for myself in different genres and think 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.230
 simple mechanisms will be much to whom 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.100
 interesting well, but if you do not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.260
 like you can put dizlike 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.260
 online extra mondays here in canada 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.820
 so the first mechanism is called 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.450
 invisible door invisible 2 you ask 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.260
 yes it is possible let's see so 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.410
 you see the door and think you're a moron 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.530
 Kirill there is no door here and I will prove to you 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:14.150
 go code does not let you through and you 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.770
 ready fact from but I will please you 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.110
 really don't see you push the button 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.430
 you hear the sound of the door and you pass 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 that is, and how um si is very simple in the same way 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.390
 you can using mechanism pin up 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.020
 friends of type disputed jesus will come to you 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.560
 so we argue here but break it 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.140
 There are buttons here. I'm right. But what of the two ? 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.430
 leagues we heard the sound heard very much 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.940
 explained that there is this mechanism 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.340
 intrigued me too such a movie 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.259
 like 17 blocks of 6 any color 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.680
 5 colors wool carpets which have chosen 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.770
 Earlier 4 Redstone but red books on 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.229
 Russian two buttons any wooden there 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.620
 stone signs and now minecraft and 1 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.690
 wicket absolutely any generally begin 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.369
 to start building structures for us 5 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.840
 blocks 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.840
 we break the block in the middle of us on 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.350
 wicket build two pillars in height 4 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.299
 block 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.959
 opposite each other we connect it all 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.530
 one block thereby forming a passage 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.820
 further we break the block here we put 2 blocks so 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.730
 we carry out such a construction with a length of 3 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.880
 roll and arrange that 4 tokens 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.769
 In general, the mechanism is ready to set up 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.600
 there are two buttons for the mechanism to work 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.940
 I will explain how he works here like the gate 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.250
 she doesn't let go press this 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.959
 the button opens you pass but you have to 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.930
 make it more useless for that 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:44.319
 we will need carpets we take cover 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.719
 carpeted and all invisible door ready 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.090
 simple mechanism but pretty cool 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.849
 I hope you still like that swami 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.079
 Cyril was waiting for new mechanisms if 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.609
 you can grow up a project 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.340
 Like comment subscribe to 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:59.859
 Channel recommend to friends but also 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.730
 trimmed to corrupt and swami was kirill 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:06.000
 bring new episodes all good luck to new 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.000
 meeting
