on<00:01:35.969> top<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.149> your<00:01:36.299> stuck<00:01:36.600> pixel<00:01:36.959> for<00:01:37.139> 10

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
on top of your stuck pixel for 10

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.989 
on top of your stuck pixel for 10
minutes<00:01:37.679> and<00:01:37.859> hopefully<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.490> static<00:01:38.850> will

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
minutes and hopefully the static will

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.910 
minutes and hopefully the static will
give<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.329> jump<00:01:39.509> start<00:01:39.869> this<00:01:40.319> method<00:01:40.679> has<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
give it a jump start this method has the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
give it a jump start this method has the
60<00:01:41.279> percent<00:01:41.429> success<00:01:42.060> rate<00:01:42.179> so<00:01:42.569> the<00:01:42.719> majority

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
60 percent success rate so the majority

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.349 
60 percent success rate so the majority
of<00:01:43.229> stuck<00:01:43.560> pixels<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:44.130> be<00:01:44.219> fixed<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.179> for

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
of stuck pixels can be fixed but for
