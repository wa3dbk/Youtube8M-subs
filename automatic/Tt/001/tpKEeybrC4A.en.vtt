technology<00:03:25.490> yes<00:03:25.940> so<00:03:26.150> this<00:03:26.240> is<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.390> razer<00:03:26.750> hydra

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
technology yes so this is a razer hydra

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.720 
technology yes so this is a razer hydra
powered<00:03:27.470> by<00:03:27.620> six<00:03:27.860> cents<00:03:28.130> it's<00:03:28.340> a<00:03:28.460> fully

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
powered by six cents it's a fully

powered by six cents it's a fully
magnetic<00:03:29.300> motion<00:03:29.960> controller<00:03:30.230> we<00:03:30.560> support

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
magnetic motion controller we support

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.700 
magnetic motion controller we support
full<00:03:31.760> six<00:03:32.090> degree-of-freedom<00:03:32.330> 101<00:03:33.320> tracking

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
full six degree-of-freedom 101 tracking

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.610 
full six degree-of-freedom 101 tracking
so<00:03:34.430> i<00:03:34.490> can<00:03:34.640> reach<00:03:34.850> out<00:03:35.060> left<00:03:35.780> right<00:03:36.050> up<00:03:36.470> down

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
so i can reach out left right up down

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.770 
so i can reach out left right up down
absolute<00:03:37.430> position<00:03:37.850> one<00:03:38.060> millimeter<00:03:38.480> and

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
absolute position one millimeter and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.450 
absolute position one millimeter and
absolute<00:03:39.530> orientation<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.130> one<00:03:40.280> degree

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
absolute orientation to one degree

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.190 
absolute orientation to one degree
another<00:03:41.120> feature<00:03:41.330> that<00:03:41.480> we've<00:03:41.690> added<00:03:41.780> is<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
another feature that we've added is the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.530 
another feature that we've added is the
scalable<00:03:42.800> cubes<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:43.880> i<00:03:43.910> can<00:03:44.060> actually<00:03:44.150> scale

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
scalable cubes so i can actually scale

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.350 
scalable cubes so i can actually scale
the<00:03:44.690> cute<00:03:44.930> i<00:03:45.170> can<00:03:46.040> build<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.280> bridge<00:03:46.460> it's<00:03:47.210> just

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
the cute i can build a bridge it's just

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.750 
the cute i can build a bridge it's just
