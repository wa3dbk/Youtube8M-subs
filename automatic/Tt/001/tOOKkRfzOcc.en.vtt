watched that for like I know it's been a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.130 
watched that for like I know it's been a
few<00:00:23.910> years<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.300> used<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.510> watch<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> on<00:00:24.840> Cartoon

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
few years I used to watch it on Cartoon

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.540 
few years I used to watch it on Cartoon
Network<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:27.260> in<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:29.480> green<00:00:30.480> lantern<00:00:31.050> was

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
Network and in that green lantern was

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.530 
Network and in that green lantern was
african-american<00:00:34.910> he<00:00:35.910> didn't<00:00:36.210> look<00:00:36.270> anything

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
african-american he didn't look anything

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.319 
african-american he didn't look anything
like<00:00:36.750> this<00:00:36.930> Green<00:00:37.230> Lantern<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.210> but<00:00:39.210> there

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
like this Green Lantern so but there

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.610 
like this Green Lantern so but there
were<00:00:39.390> episodes<00:00:39.840> where<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.140> were<00:00:40.230> like<00:00:40.379> other

screenshots you've seen green lantern

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.690 
screenshots you've seen green lantern
looks<00:03:13.200> like<00:03:13.320> an<00:03:13.440> extremely<00:03:13.890> fun<00:03:14.130> character<00:03:14.670> to

looks like an extremely fun character to
players<00:03:15.120> he's<00:03:15.299> got<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.510> lot<00:03:15.690> of<00:03:15.750> moves<00:03:16.590> with

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
make hammers and brick walls and I think

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.840

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
a hand that sort of grabs him and stuff

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.520 
a hand that sort of grabs him and stuff
so<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.390> looks<00:03:24.570> like<00:03:24.630> he's<00:03:24.900> going<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.470> a
