00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.310
 hello friends if you focus on today's topic is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.630
 the functioning of the bodies of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 valves 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.340
 The valves or slide bodies are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.599
 hydraulic controllers are part of the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.609
 hydraulic transmission system 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 automatic the functions that are going to 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.769
 play depend on the design of each 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.719
 manufacturer the functions they perform 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:38.159
 they develop them together from the module 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 control of the transmission and a 

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:44.690
 set of solenoid valves or on noi 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.690
 They have two types of components 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.910
 accommodation blocks 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.850
 it can be formed by a single block 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.200
 of accommodation or several divided into 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.270
 sections 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.670
 in the block are contained 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.460
 distributed the valve assembly with 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.560
 which the controller will work 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.380
 valves are housed in slides 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.930
 which may have a diameter or diameters 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.290
 staggered according to the design of the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.290
 valve 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.340
 tapas caps are missing blocks of 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.670
 valves and have different cuts in 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.250
 labyrinth shape have also 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.790
 some cuts that take you to the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.790
 sump 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.720
 the labyrinths of the lid form the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.760
 hydraulic circuits that serve to 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.430
 communicating the valves that are 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.520
 they are located in different 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.800
 positions plates the circuitry of the 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.950
 blocks of the valve body and the 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.560
 tapas is uncovered so they remain 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.350
 sealed and function as ducts 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.210
 They are using the transfer plates 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.090
 which serve binding between 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.420
 different blocks also joining with the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.090
 transmission 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.689
 They use different types of holes 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.299
 some are calibrated to control the 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.299
 volume of liquid flow 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.310
 valves 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.100
 the valves are cylindrical bars with 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.170
 different cuts the cylinders of the 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.430
 valves can have the diameters of 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.020
 the same measure or be 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.850
 staggered 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.310
 the valves are formed by two 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:37.090
 Blog or face elements 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.910
 port or valley 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.250
 Blogs divide the channels 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.430
 hydraulics block the circuits of 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:50.099
 food or the discharges make 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.099
 the valve a hydraulic switch 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.480
 the internal cuts of the valve 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.940
 allow liquid flow two 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.700
 different channels to drive it if 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.510
 some item or download some 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.510
 component 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.780
 cjex these valves can have 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.270
 different ways the simplest are 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.460
 small spheres or pellets that can 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.460
 be made of steel or plastic 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.660
 others can be a disc which can 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.800
 have a hole in the center and some 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.800
 do not get to this hole 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:07.290
 there are also other more sophisticated 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.290
 Composed of two covers and a spring 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.210
 there are also others of forms indicates and 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.160
 aided by a spring which must 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.650
 be a soft dock 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.900
 The main function of the check is 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.510
 allow the flow of liquid in a single 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.650
 sense and block it when this change 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.080
 of direction another function 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.210
 is to control the output of the liquid in the 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.620
 moment of the transition in which 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.620
 feed a component 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:53.149
 and packaging are used different 

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:55.839
 gaskets to seal the ducts 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:59.299
 hydraulic these packages can be 

00:04:55.839 --> 00:05:03.199
 paper or gaskets gaskets 

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:06.660
 round or cylindrical planes or plates 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.760
 with vulcanized strips 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.700
 filters the valve body is 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.060
 Equipped with some filters can be 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.240
 flat or cylindrical the material from which 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.280
 They are commonly made of plastic 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.690
 They are used to protect valves 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.390
 that work with very tolerances 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.750
 narrow also to protect the 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.600
 electro valves or solenoids 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.670
 springs springs are components 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.250
 very important for the control of 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.040
 valves there are different types and 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.170
 measures some springs are very hard and 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.210
 are used to work with 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.940
 pressure regulating valves 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.380
 plugs these components are used 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.180
 at the ends of the bodies of 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.009
 valves serve to limit the 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:54.009
 movement of the valve and will help 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:56.050
 to form a pressure chamber which 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.310
 will affect the control of the 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:02.110
 valve 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:05.420
 insurance these components are used 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.580
 to sustain and prevent the 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.090
 valves and springs of the 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.090
 sliding 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:17.500
 circuits the block and the caps have 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:24.230
 some cuts which form 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:29.490
 cavities long channels short channels 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:32.639
 in the form of labyrinths wells holes 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.250
 cuts with crankcase bypass all is 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:37.800
 part of the spaces where 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.729
 will lodge the fluid to drive it towards 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.729
 the valves 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.120
 and the hydraulic circuits are going to 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.630
 classify according to the function that 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.480
 plays 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.700
 control circuits at the ends of 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.760
 the valves were applied a pressure 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.350
 to place it in a position that 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.440
 position will change when the pressure is removed 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:06.260
 power circuits the circuit 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.409
 food can be found in a 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.779
 cavity or in a channel 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:14.929
 with sweet line pressure to be 

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:18.319
 used when applying a component can 

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:20.949
 be in a waiting state or in 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.949
 active state 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.210
 main circuit the main circuit 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.300
 It can be formed by several channels 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:34.230
 conducts a feeding circuit 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.230
 towards some component 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:43.139
 this can be a clutch a band or 

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:45.240
 The converter ventilation circuits 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:48.270
 or download 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.190
 this circuit can be a cavity or a 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:54.440
 channel that will lead to a circuit 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.440
 Main to the carter
