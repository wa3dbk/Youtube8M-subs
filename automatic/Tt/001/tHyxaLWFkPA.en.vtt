00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hi, how are you? I'm going to make a video today. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 You can not do any 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.290
 fixed bar and post put the mexico in 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.509
 that the produced is and as far as I know that I 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.610
 I can arrive as important as the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.890
 number of back repetitions that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.330
 Are you going to do it obviously? 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.189
 depend on its strength but it was also 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.590
 defined on the body 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.350
 so even an athlete who is weighing 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.720
 150 pounds will not be able to perform the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.269
 same number of repetitions as a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.900
 slightly trained person weighing 50 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.750
 pounds 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.340
 This is an important point for 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.280
 start your training 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.840
 I suggest you start with repetitions 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 isometric so what are you going to do? 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.730
 next sentence no you 're going to roll up 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 position and you will keep 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.969
 Isonomy would rock then you are 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.700
 starting 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.100
 start with a 3 to 4 series of 10 that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.469
 seconds and progresses until you 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.109
 get one of these three four series 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.910
 30 seconds at the same time 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.059
 hence start doing a dynamic job 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.239
 Okay, so we can be first. 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.180
 amazon 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:11.310
 let's hold any obviously goes 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.210
 depend on the type footprint held one 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210
 safe 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.810
 from the moment you have 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.360
 able to maintain this period of 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.820
 contraction 3 to 4 series of three seconds to 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.759
 one minute we 'll get us 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.579
 Let's start trying to perform repetitions. 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.570
 from the top then how is it? 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.520
 What are we going to do? 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.090
 Are you going to try three to four? 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.560
 series of five to six meals 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.130
 partial as if our reflections 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 of the top will go down to the brÃ¡s 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.329
 shape about 90 degrees and climb 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.329
 again then an execution 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.220
 excellent what is important 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.170
 this will help strengthen your 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.270
 but it will not be 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.850
 enough for you to do a repeat 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.920
 total we are going to try to accomplish 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.320
 then from the moment you are 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.750
 achieving these four series 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.940
 of six partial options 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.730
 We're going to start doing some 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.450
 of these series with complex repetition 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.340
 to be anyway I can not get 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.830
 make the complete repetitions 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.450
 we can use another strategy 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.340
 for example performing repetitions 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.970
 the negative effects of the 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.160
 negative you go up and down control 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.190
 the mind then you jump and uncontrolled 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.380
 We jump up and are popular 10 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.970
 a technique and has more muscle stress 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.970
 ok, let's go to the example 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.290
 it is very important to talk about the 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.740
 safety in the execution of the bar 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.680
 then use rough motion or use a 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.630
 body urge called qe to do 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.640
 exercises without having a musculature in the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.510
 least prepared can make the exercise 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 lawful 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.340
 all right and follow a completion 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.110
 Proper little time you will be 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.250
 the bases 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.250
 ok go 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.620
 certain is that the staff hugs good front
