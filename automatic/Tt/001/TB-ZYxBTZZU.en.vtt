that if you blanch them it stops the

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.350 
that if you blanch them it stops the

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
once it comes back up to a boil I will

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.640 
once it comes back up to a boil I will
put<00:02:32.569> them<00:02:32.840> on<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:34.310> ice<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:35.569> will<00:02:36.500> let

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
put them on this ice and and will let

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
asparagus bits but ideally you're going

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.800 
asparagus bits but ideally you're going
to<00:02:45.110> really<00:02:45.500> tuck<00:02:45.890> them<00:02:46.100> in<00:02:46.310> so<00:02:46.880> that<00:02:46.910> they<00:02:47.209> have

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
to really tuck them in so that they have

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.920 
to really tuck them in so that they have

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
a minimum amount of floating so then I

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.810 
a minimum amount of floating so then I
have<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.080> little<00:02:51.440> vinegar<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.160> water<00:02:52.400> solution

have a little vinegar and water solution
you<00:02:53.720> cannot<00:02:54.140> use<00:02:54.709> like<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.130> homemade<00:02:55.610> vinegar

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you cannot use like a homemade vinegar

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.990 
you cannot use like a homemade vinegar

when you're pickling unless you know the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.420 
when you're pickling unless you know the

because the acetic acid is what does the

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
escape it can undermine your seal then

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.509 
escape it can undermine your seal then
you<00:04:14.630> put<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.930> into<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.650> water<00:04:15.859> bath<00:04:16.040> canner

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
you put it into the water bath canner

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.550 
you put it into the water bath canner
then<00:04:16.970> we're<00:04:17.090> going<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.269> put<00:04:18.169> on<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:18.380> heat

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.490 
why that's preferable whenever you can
is<00:04:46.960> because<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:48.310> want<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.699> heat<00:04:49.000> to

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
is because you want the heat to

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.219 
is because you want the heat to

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
give it a few minutes to rest then we'll

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.990 
give it a few minutes to rest then we'll
take<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.330> out<00:04:55.600> and<00:04:55.930> then<00:04:56.889> it'll<00:04:57.070> cool<00:04:57.460> and<00:04:57.729> as

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
take it out and then it'll cool and as

the vacuum process and when the vacuum

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.670 
the vacuum process and when the vacuum
has<00:05:08.380> done<00:05:08.650> the<00:05:09.100> jar<00:05:09.690> like<00:05:10.690> sucks<00:05:11.110> right<00:05:11.410> down

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
has done the jar like sucks right down

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.740 
has done the jar like sucks right down
and<00:05:11.979> seals<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.580> and<00:05:12.940> you've<00:05:13.090> created<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.510> vacuum

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
and seals it and you've created a vacuum

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.680 
and seals it and you've created a vacuum
and<00:05:14.530> I'm<00:05:15.039> going<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.250> show<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:15.639> the<00:05:16.210> difference

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
and I'm going to show you the difference

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.290 
and I'm going to show you the difference
between<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:17.560> jar<00:05:17.949> that's<00:05:18.220> not<00:05:18.490> sealed<00:05:18.940> and

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
between a jar that's not sealed and

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.900 
between a jar that's not sealed and
sealed<00:05:19.660> here<00:05:20.260> can<00:05:20.530> you<00:05:20.620> hear<00:05:20.710> that<00:05:22.470> unsealed

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
sealed here can you hear that unsealed

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.890 
sealed here can you hear that unsealed
then<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.300> have<00:05:25.539> the<00:05:25.950> sealed<00:05:27.330> suck<00:05:28.330> down<00:05:28.570> do

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
then you have the sealed suck down do

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.050 
then you have the sealed suck down do
you<00:05:28.960> take<00:05:29.200> off<00:05:29.349> the<00:05:29.500> band's<00:05:29.919> you<00:05:30.340> only<00:05:30.849> need

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
you take off the band's you only need

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.969 
you take off the band's you only need
the<00:05:31.240> band<00:05:31.479> to<00:05:31.870> hold<00:05:32.139> down<00:05:32.320> the<00:05:32.560> lid<00:05:32.740> and

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
the band to hold down the lid and

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.469 
the band to hold down the lid and
processing<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.669> don't<00:05:33.820> need<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.120> store

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
processing you don't need it to store

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.670 
processing you don't need it to store
but<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:34.990> see<00:05:35.169> look<00:05:36.810> so<00:05:37.810> that's<00:05:37.990> slow<00:05:38.260> that's

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
but you see look so that's slow that's

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.650 
but you see look so that's slow that's
fine<00:05:38.979> then<00:05:39.370> they'll<00:05:39.520> settle<00:05:39.789> down<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.360> then

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
fine then they'll settle down and then

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.810 
fine then they'll settle down and then
they'll<00:05:41.139> hold<00:05:41.380> for<00:05:41.950> quite<00:05:42.130> a<00:05:42.160> while<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:42.700> takes
