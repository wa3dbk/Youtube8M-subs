you<00:05:56.630> want<00:05:56.870> precision<00:05:57.380> you<00:05:57.500> want<00:05:57.800> you<00:05:58.490> know<00:05:58.610> the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
you want precision you want you know the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.240 
you want precision you want you know the
accuracy<00:05:59.390> so<00:06:00.380> don't<00:06:00.560> go<00:06:00.590> with<00:06:00.740> those<00:06:00.890> for<00:06:01.220> a

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
accuracy so don't go with those for a

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.460 
accuracy so don't go with those for a
second<00:06:01.580> and<00:06:01.670> they<00:06:01.790> sputter<00:06:02.150> I<00:06:02.390> and<00:06:03.080> third<00:06:03.320> day

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
second and they sputter I and third day

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.290 
second and they sputter I and third day
they're<00:06:03.680> really<00:06:04.130> just<00:06:04.160> a<00:06:04.550> piece<00:06:04.760> of<00:06:04.790> plastic

something I want to show you guys and
this<00:06:41.120> is<00:06:41.270> also<00:06:41.449> has<00:06:41.660> to<00:06:41.750> do<00:06:41.870> with<00:06:42.020> cheapness

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:42.290 
this is also has to do with cheapness

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:47.950 
this is also has to do with cheapness
how<00:06:43.130> people<00:06:43.490> ask<00:06:43.699> about<00:06:46.300> you<00:06:47.300> know<00:06:47.389> a<00:06:47.630> set<00:06:47.930> a

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
how people ask about you know a set a

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.420 
how people ask about you know a set a
place<00:06:48.260> to<00:06:48.380> set<00:06:48.560> up<00:06:48.590> so<00:06:48.800> your<00:06:49.010> good<00:06:49.100> airbrush

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
place to set up so your good airbrush

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.640 
place to set up so your good airbrush
you<00:06:49.580> know<00:06:49.729> the<00:06:49.940> ventilation<00:06:50.540> stuff<00:06:50.900> here<00:06:51.500> is

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
you know the ventilation stuff here is

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.670 
you know the ventilation stuff here is
it's<00:06:51.830> the<00:06:52.160> cheapest<00:06:52.699> way<00:06:52.910> proof<00:06:53.120> that<00:06:53.419> I

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
it's the cheapest way proof that I

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.050 
it's the cheapest way proof that I
probably<00:06:54.680> mentioned<00:06:55.070> a<00:06:55.100> couple<00:06:55.190> times<00:06:55.340> this

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
probably mentioned a couple times this

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.640 
probably mentioned a couple times this
50<00:06:56.419> bucks<00:06:56.660> are<00:06:57.139> it's<00:06:57.620> portable<00:06:58.449> okay<00:06:59.449> I<00:06:59.660> don't

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
50 bucks are it's portable okay I don't

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.350 
50 bucks are it's portable okay I don't
know<00:07:00.770> if<00:07:00.889> it<00:07:00.979> works<00:07:01.160> so<00:07:01.340> well<00:07:01.370> okay<00:07:01.970> first<00:07:02.240> of

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
know if it works so well okay first of

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.780 
know if it works so well okay first of
all<00:07:02.479> look<00:07:03.080> at<00:07:03.229> this<00:07:03.919> picture<00:07:04.190> here<00:07:04.460> look<00:07:04.729> at

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:04.790 
all look at this picture here look at

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.450 
all look at this picture here look at
this<00:07:04.910> amount<00:07:05.330> of<00:07:05.510> space<00:07:05.780> that<00:07:06.460> you're

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
this amount of space that you're

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.080 
this amount of space that you're
spraying<00:07:07.790> nice<00:07:08.330> decent<00:07:09.110> size<00:07:09.500> right<00:07:10.130> but<00:07:10.970> the

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
spraying nice decent size right but the

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.659 
spraying nice decent size right but the
problem<00:07:11.449> is<00:07:11.539> is<00:07:11.720> therefore<00:07:12.500> is<00:07:12.590> only<00:07:12.770> 50<00:07:13.190> well

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
problem is is therefore is only 50 well

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.700 
problem is is therefore is only 50 well
I<00:07:13.880> think<00:07:14.060> it's<00:07:14.389> CFM<00:07:14.900> I<00:07:15.050> think<00:07:15.229> it's<00:07:15.320> a<00:07:15.380> title

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
I think it's CFM I think it's a title

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.820 
I think it's CFM I think it's a title
but<00:07:15.910> i'm<00:07:16.910> thinking<00:07:17.330> it's<00:07:17.389> saying<00:07:17.660> 50<00:07:18.139> CFM<00:07:18.590> if

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:18.830 
but i'm thinking it's saying 50 CFM if

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.520 
but i'm thinking it's saying 50 CFM if
it's<00:07:19.010> 50<00:07:19.310> CFM<00:07:19.760> that's<00:07:20.180> a<00:07:20.570> really<00:07:21.020> small<00:07:21.229> fan

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530 
it's 50 CFM that's a really small fan

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.560 
it's 50 CFM that's a really small fan
for<00:07:21.889> such<00:07:22.070> a<00:07:22.100> large<00:07:22.310> area<00:07:22.580> so<00:07:23.270> you<00:07:23.300> probably

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:23.570 
for such a large area so you probably

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.760 
for such a large area so you probably
won't<00:07:23.780> get<00:07:23.870> that<00:07:24.020> much<00:07:24.080> pole<00:07:24.410> unless<00:07:24.590> your

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.770 
won't get that much pole unless your

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.469 
won't get that much pole unless your
spring<00:07:25.039> directly<00:07:25.550> writing<00:07:25.789> them<00:07:26.030> all<00:07:26.210> and

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 
spring directly writing them all and

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.650 
spring directly writing them all and
then<00:07:26.600> into<00:07:26.960> the<00:07:27.050> back<00:07:27.260> of<00:07:27.289> the<00:07:28.240> bait<00:07:29.240> spray

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 
then into the back of the bait spray

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.890 
then into the back of the bait spray
