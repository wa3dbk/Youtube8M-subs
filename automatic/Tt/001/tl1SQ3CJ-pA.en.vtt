00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.480
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.030
 Surfing course of scrivener to surfers 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.800
 Had 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.780
 Hello 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.170
 First examination car 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.000
 My name is whether the surfing history of the third year of the village 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.980
 Today about the founding country 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:45.489
 I would like to give a brief explanation for myself so please take a look 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:49.780
 Yes In the body take off post to see commentary take off 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.410
 There are a lot of great shuri if you can, so try searching in bed first 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.590
 Please give me 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.790
 I think that novice beginners work 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.860
 I will tell you a little part of the garage 2 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.210
 If you do nationwide 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:09.240
 After all it says that it's a nose and it 's a parley 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 Well I think that there is often well everyone's, but today methods that do not the par ring 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.600
 I would like to talk about some tips 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.310
 So this is I'll lean in to say the waves come what is that saying, Well here 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.920
 In to the ring for 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.190
 a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:30.240
 I'm sorry but please give it all 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:33.440
 It's just this dazzling angle 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.310
 Kitagaa for this angle 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.060
 Of course, if you get parallel 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:45.290
 Nose will pierce and perl 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.900
 So if you say whether you avoid any number of times a 8 this 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.530
 U 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.430
 For this what 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.400
 It is not the second time 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.460
 For against horizontal 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.410
 Create a state of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.160
 What a place called Do not lower the nose and say what to do in order that 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.680
 is not it 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.310
 Then how do you do it 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.819
 The tax only towards the tail 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:18.500
 You can take this kale off by taking science for a smooth takeoff 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.610
 I will 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.100
 As a point that is necessary again 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.190
 After all it is a place called this chest solo 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.660
 Take it off with this or a guy in the cast 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.510
 When my vamp gets stuck 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:40.450
 For example, the position a little 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:43.810
 Here's a tip to give you a center of gravity behind you 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 When is made of Te Umino said of Nea was the body fear 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.720
 It is not sweet 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.690
 If you become a woman rather a little 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.400
 If ac star zero point is behind 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.740
 Just said 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.490
 I wonder if I think of swimming 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.490
 think 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.500
 I just played with the imager and I just played 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.670
 I'm afraid here 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.830
 Hidaka becomes such an angle 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.129
 Here in Jukov 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.290
 I can not proceed with this 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:26.150
 Please try it in the image 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.150
 I will do my best to get along well, so let's do our best together 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.379
 me
