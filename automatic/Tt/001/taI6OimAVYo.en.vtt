middle split it into light so let's go
whole<00:01:02.239> you<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.680> take<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.830> ponytail

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
loop of the whole side like that so it's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 
loop of the whole side like that so it's
so<00:01:13.560> now<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.860> fully<00:01:14.070> inside<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.640> pull<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.939> out

then you take your elastic and you just
like<00:01:17.280> pull<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.930> thing<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:20.150> if<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.390> that

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.039 

it<00:01:27.990> looks<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.369> well<00:01:29.369> mine<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.299> bad<00:01:30.600> because

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it looks like well mine is bad because

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.569 
it looks like well mine is bad because
you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.350> still<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.710> my<00:01:31.860> elastic<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.369> there
