all so I'm betting I'm gonna have to
charge<00:00:06.089> it<00:00:06.210> in<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.509> middle<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:06.960> video

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
charge it in the middle of this video

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.589 
charge it in the middle of this video
but<00:00:08.040> really<00:00:08.309> quickly<00:00:08.610> before<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:09.120> shuts<00:00:09.389> off

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
but really quickly before it shuts off

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.870 
but really quickly before it shuts off

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.029 
experimenting with what will my goldfish
eat<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.990> potentially<00:00:19.410> add<00:00:19.680> some

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
eat so that I can potentially add some

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.029 
eat so that I can potentially add some
natural<00:00:20.279> sources<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.180> those<00:00:22.080> micronutrients

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
natural sources of those micronutrients

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.029 
natural sources of those micronutrients
and<00:00:23.480> even<00:00:24.480> some<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.810> macronutrients<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
and even some of the macronutrients to

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710

banana<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:38.870> high<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.050> potassium<00:00:40.200> they<00:00:40.890> say

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
banana here high in potassium they say

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.040 
banana here high in potassium they say
in<00:00:42.719> theory<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:44.700> waste<00:00:44.910> from<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
in theory the waste from this and or the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
in theory the waste from this and or the
leftovers<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.890> might<00:00:47.640> add<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> little

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
leftovers from this might add a little

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.510 
leftovers from this might add a little
bit<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.600> potassium<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.590> system<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.129> have

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
bit more potassium to my system I have

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.569 
bit more potassium to my system I have
no<00:00:51.090> idea<00:00:51.449> since<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.079> no<00:00:52.260> test<00:00:52.500> kits<00:00:52.739> but

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
no idea since I have no test kits but

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.189 
no idea since I have no test kits but
I'm<00:00:53.670> gonna<00:00:53.850> get<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.690> all<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:55.110> those

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.899 
see I've got my little foe Pro $50.00
Vivitar<00:01:10.350> underwater<00:01:11.010> camera<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.610> there

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
Vivitar underwater camera going there

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.260 
Vivitar underwater camera going there
hopefully<00:01:12.720> recording<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.530> fish<00:01:13.740> activity

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
hopefully recording some fish activity

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.760 
hopefully recording some fish activity
I'm<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> try<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> point<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> upward<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I'm going to try and point it upward a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.609 
I'm going to try and point it upward a
little<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:17.130> when<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> drop<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.000> bananas<00:01:18.390> in

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
little bit when I drop the bananas in

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.620 
little bit when I drop the bananas in
but<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.939> might<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.450> fish

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
but you know we might get some fish

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.899 
but you know we might get some fish
footage<00:01:22.170> either<00:01:22.470> way<00:01:22.799> we'll<00:01:23.070> see<00:01:23.280> alright

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
footage either way we'll see alright

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.580 
footage either way we'll see alright
I've<00:01:24.180> changed<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.630> angle<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.350> little

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
I've changed that angle just a little

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.609 
I've changed that angle just a little
bit<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.600> fish<00:01:27.750> are<00:01:27.930> terrified<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
bit and the fish are terrified of the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.670 
bit and the fish are terrified of the
camera<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.100> their<00:01:29.280> tank<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:30.390> maybe<00:01:31.350> we'll<00:01:31.530> give

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
camera in their tank so maybe we'll give

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.990 
camera in their tank so maybe we'll give
this<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> couple<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.280> minutes<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:32.610> them<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> get

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
this a couple of minutes for them to get

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.789 
this a couple of minutes for them to get
used<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.570> I'll<00:01:34.049> start<00:01:34.259> tossing<00:01:34.500> in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
used to it and I'll start tossing in

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.640 
used to it and I'll start tossing in
some<00:01:34.979> banana<00:01:35.400> slices
