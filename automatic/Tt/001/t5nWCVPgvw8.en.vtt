00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.920
 talk about a topic a little more serious and 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.820
 delicate today's topic is the syndrome 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.950
 of toxic shock or the cst this is a 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.360
 rare and hard disease that is caused 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.980
 by a bacterium in case it does not 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.020
 have idea what I'm speaking a 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.789
 read it for favors and twitters very well 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.340
 this bacterium is in almost 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.260
 always in the nose in the armpits and in 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.000
 the vagina and can affect both 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.980
 men as women or children however 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.660
 the kiss we have stronger 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.149
 Chats of teenagers and girls 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.429
 under 30 and good even though the 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.379
 theme is a rare medium that can happen to us 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.269
 it is better that we know so that we 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.219
 let's put the batteries and the cis and what 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.679
 we discovered early we can treat them 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.440
 buddy is super important to put 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.479
 much attention and put in trout to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.399
 realize if they have at least one 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:53.260
 of these symptoms three guards and they are and 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.539
 so they run away and everything if you're 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.389
 using a buffer gives you temperatures 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.459
 vomiting or nausea your skin starts to 

00:00:58.389 --> 00:01:03.940
 put as rositas and as burned the 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:05.799
 sun in your muscles faints or almost you 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.670
 fainting these are considered as 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.189
 some of the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.500
 and it is not necessary that we all have 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.360
 that you feel at least one of them and in 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.909
 that moment you remove the tampon 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.290
 immediately and you run to the doctor 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.390
 you say you're feeling half bad 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.310

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.140
 quick as to save you like a little princess 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.479
 we can make this a little bit 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.159
 harder to give us using champions 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.780
 with minimum absorbency required with 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.030
 our body or you can also alternate 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.970
 the use of spot tampons during your 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680
 period was strong that the best way 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.380
 What you have to protect yourself is to know the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.899
 signs and symptoms of tse tse and I will have 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.670

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.409
 I felt like a night newscast 8 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.210
 normal by family portas some of the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.220
 ways with this topic before it 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.409

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.360
 a lot and I'm very soon with another topic 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.069
 of these that interests us so much already 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.799
 Sometimes there is not even how to find someone 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.280
 which helped for that I am to 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.280
