00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.959
 hi hello guys and girls how are you 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.210
 for today we have a super easy route and 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.369
 homemade that is pizza and I know that all 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.050
 we like it and also the good thing is that the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.660
 we can put our own taste 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.630
 let's start let's cut into sheets 6 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.510
 big mushrooms we will start by the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.360
 half 6 slices of chorizo ​​and follow it 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.489
 bump we finely chop 5 slices of 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.309
 Gouda cheese we can also add cheese 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.949
 of goat or white cheese we will sting 4 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.790
 dehydrated tomatoes to make more 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.880
 juicy we can add natural tomato 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.880
 125 grams of Neapolitan pasta 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.300
 a packet of yeast or 15 grams of 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.300
 fresh yeast 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.320
 330 grams of corn flour and 100 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.320
 grams of normal flour 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.170
 Now let's make niro or sift 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.300
 our flours with the help of a colander 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.070
 this process can be repeated about two or 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.850
 three times so that our mass of 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.850
 mothers with just 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.720
 yes 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.480
 we add a teaspoon of salt and 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.480
 we stir well 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.450
 i 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.880
 in half a glass of warm water 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.490
 we dissolve our yeast we leave it 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.149
 stand for about 10 minutes and mix it 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.149
 with the flours 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.560
 we add a cup and a half of water 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.030
 tempered but while it 's the recipe I 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.250
 realized that you can actually 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.200
 take less and so that it comes out very much 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.570
 better our dough let rest a 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.680
 little water with the cornstarch so that 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.230
 absorb well 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.960
 it looks like a nursery but in the end it does not 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.030
 you know how it looks great 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040
 since we have stopped resting our 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.630
 dough we add a quarter cup of 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.630
 olive oil and kneaded 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.890
 sprinkle some flour in 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:36.230
 our countertop and pour the dough there 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.150
 what we are going to do now is to work it 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.290
 and add little by little a little flour 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.360
 until 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.710
 in a consistent way 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.710
 it is very easy they will see it 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.650
 8 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.230
 i 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 Y 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.170
 when we finish kneading, we're going to 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.420
 let the dough rest at least half 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.520
 hour has to double its size as 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.410
 minimum 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.430
 the amounts that used in this 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.880
 recipe is for two pizzas and how I was going 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.690
 to make a big pizza because this 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.150
 let's say the oven plate and with a 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.620
 little aluminum foil but really 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.840
 it is much better to use paper 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.580
 butter or pressure paper sulfurized 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.790
 from the oven 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.890
 and here 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.569
 we stretch the masses well we will return a 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.939
 little flour and with the help of a fork 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.230
 We are making holes together 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.160
 our tomato paste 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.810
 i 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.810
 we will add the natural tomato 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.100
 we put the cheeses we have chopped 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.100
 previously 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:25.790
 we add the chorizo ​​sausage on 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.790
 raw mushroom 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.080
 it's dehydrated tomato 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:38.330
 and the last one that above 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:42.229
 and now we introduce to the oven during 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:45.919
 a half hour or so about 180 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.649
 degrees and for here we have the result 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.999
 a delicious homemade pizza I hope that 

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:52.990
 like them and see you in the next 

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.990
 goodbye video
