tutorial my nice hay merchant in this
tutorial<00:00:11.850> I'm<00:00:12.600> going<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.730> demo<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.030> how<00:00:15.360> to

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
tutorial I'm going to demo you how to

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.690 
tutorial I'm going to demo you how to
make<00:00:17.420> material<00:00:19.490> to<00:00:20.490> create<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.090> material<00:00:21.360> for

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
make material to create a material for

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.610 
make material to create a material for
see<00:00:23.700> calm<00:00:23.940> sea<00:00:24.510> cucumber<00:00:25.170> /<00:00:25.800> turtle<00:00:26.370> like

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:27.620 
see calm sea cucumber / turtle like

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:36.240 
see calm sea cucumber / turtle like
structure<00:00:28.620> texture

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.360 

so<00:00:37.570> we<00:00:38.570> are<00:00:39.079> going<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.470> create<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.280> material

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370 
so we are going to create a material

00:00:42.370 --> 00:01:00.960 
so we are going to create a material
that<00:00:43.370> looks<00:00:44.170> like<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:49.420> and

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.800 

to<00:01:01.970> simplify<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:02.750> process<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:04.300> only<00:01:05.300> apply<00:01:05.750> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
to simplify the process I only apply the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.370 
to simplify the process I only apply the
material<00:01:06.170> to<00:01:06.830> adjust<00:01:07.370> fear<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.480> first<00:01:08.900> creator

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
material to adjust fear so first creator

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:20.440 
material to adjust fear so first creator
geosphere<00:01:10.960> like<00:01:11.960> so

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.120 

and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.560 

because<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.530> because<00:01:32.530> this<00:01:32.829> material<00:01:33.570> we

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
because this because this material we

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.840 
because this because this material we
are<00:01:34.810> going<00:01:35.079> to<00:01:35.229> give<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:36.840> bum<00:01:37.840> this

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
are going to give a bum this

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.050 
are going to give a bum this
displacement<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:42.039> Jews<00:01:42.970> fear<00:01:43.409> therefore

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
displacement to the Jews fear therefore

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.710 
displacement to the Jews fear therefore
we<00:01:46.060> cry<00:01:50.610> displacement<00:01:51.720> approximation

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
we cry displacement approximation

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
we cry displacement approximation
modifying<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:54.270> therefore<00:01:55.270> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
modifying to it therefore the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.249 
modifying to it therefore the
displacement<00:01:57.340> mash<00:01:57.850> will<00:02:00.000> generate<00:02:01.000> arena<00:02:01.960> in

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
displacement mash will generate arena in

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:13.050 
displacement mash will generate arena in
the<00:02:02.380> time<00:02:02.819> and<00:02:08.280> instead<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.780> tell<00:02:11.819> tell<00:02:12.819> you

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
the time and instead of tell tell you

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.020 
the time and instead of tell tell you
every<00:02:13.630> single<00:02:13.930> detail<00:02:14.489> in<00:02:15.489> this<00:02:15.640> video

tutorial<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.950> decided<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.720> another<00:02:20.080> way

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
tutorial I decided to do it another way

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:29.789 
tutorial I decided to do it another way
I<00:02:23.940> made<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.170> schematic<00:02:26.170> view<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:28.799> very

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
I made this schematic view like a very

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.420 
I made this schematic view like a very
similar<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:31.319> maybe<00:02:32.319> take<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.280> shadow<00:02:33.579> tree

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
similar to maybe take on a shadow tree

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.780 
similar to maybe take on a shadow tree
and<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:37.000> put<00:02:37.359> it<00:02:37.540> only<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:38.680> my<00:02:38.890> blog<00:02:39.489> website<00:02:41.790> so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
and I put it only on my blog website so

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.740 
and I put it only on my blog website so
i<00:02:44.190> will<00:02:45.190> not<00:02:45.340> expand<00:02:45.970> every<00:02:46.709> parameter<00:02:47.709> of

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
i will not expand every parameter of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.599 
i will not expand every parameter of
this<00:02:49.750> material<00:02:49.989> but<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.859> can<00:02:51.010> check<00:02:51.220> up<00:02:51.400> check

Photoshop made make it a little bit
greenish

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:51.590 

so<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.300> let<00:04:43.600> let<00:04:43.930> me<00:04:44.190> explain<00:04:45.190> this<00:04:49.530> material

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
so so let let me explain this material

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.600 
so so let let me explain this material
let's<00:04:52.600> run<00:04:53.230> through<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.770> material<00:04:54.130> and

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.970 

first<00:05:00.780> choose<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:02.080> material<00:05:02.770> for<00:05:03.460> riches<00:05:04.980> how

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
first choose the material for riches how

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.010 
first choose the material for riches how
to<00:05:06.040> do<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.990> slightly<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.200> material<00:05:08.860> ball<00:05:09.070> and

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
to do that slightly a material ball and
