00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.080

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.350
 Pretty gold I think it was 157 euros 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.830
 for each mission and five of value too 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.390
 for each mission agreement is not necessary 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.710
 decide what the points of 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.960
 value on this server since these 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.119
 points are one of the one of the points 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 most important is worth as the points of 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.880
 conquest in this case for the pvp but 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.059
 good how to get this right 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.040
 we have to go first to the sanctuary of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.300
 the horde or the sanctuary of the covenant 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.649
 you that this can be done 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.570
 daily agree because they are 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.579
 daily missions or each day 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.760
 we can get 15 of value and 156 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.059
 of gold but there are 256 each issue or 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.070

 of value if we do not get a large sum of 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.819
 Gold is worth only for making those three 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.349
 missions that are daily agreements to 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.170

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.390
 problems and get that free gold and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.610
 the agreement value points are 15 in 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.170
