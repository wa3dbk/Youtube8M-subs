 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.490
 to bring review dotcom today we go 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.300
 analyze a live bar food las bridó 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.240
 trail 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.610
 and you have them we hope to deliver in 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.730
 review this shoe brand 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.300
 dedicated to soccer albert 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.230
 minimalism as you see with this model 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.290
 hybrid trail 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.809
 fixes is a sneaker in principle that 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.000
 The truth is that we have been surprised by a 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:42.070
 little the weight in both the apparatus 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.170
 ostentation of the shoe itself will 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.710
 which is a minimalist sneaker like 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.800
 you see 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.190
 it is really fix how can I 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.769
 twist the how can I turn the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.610
 look but what makes a difference 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.800
 this brand live bar food now we see that 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.260
 it differs from the other brands and 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.600
 minimalist shoes but above all 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.380
 what differentiates the brand and what 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.310
 try to sell the brand is that 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.439
 It is a shoe to practice the trail 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.659
 with maximum sensations but also with 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.000
 protection let's see 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.740
 we start with the sole we will see here 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.439
 you already have the first difference with the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.750
 normal profile sneakers 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.069
 normal minimalism is that you look like 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.229
 here on this line here look at the tacos 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.899
 they are all oriented to favor 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.549
 forward movement 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.340
 while when we get to the part 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.099
 of the heel are just upside down this is 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.599
 more than a normal shoe since in 

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:45.610
 the normal shoes as you know then 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:48.250
 in the descents especially in more sections 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.439
 of heel and thus prevent the skidding not 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.420
 both in the minimalists and therefore 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:57.280
 this slipper here stands out a 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.010
 little of the pure minimalists 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.710
 with pure but of the other models that 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.320
 we have analyzed here and mark this 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.990
 difference compared to other models 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.970
 as you can see the super prominent cue 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.360
 fix a blunt cue 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.740
 more or less soft rubber 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.330
 and let's see how they work on the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.610
 ground is grip that in principle 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.940
 It promises to be at least in more 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.170
 decomposed then something better as you see 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.750
 here already a little including there is a part 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.730
 of the sole and maybe that's why the weight of 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.420
 the shoe is higher a plate 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.910
 that goes for us rather a plate is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.790
 like a fabric a mesh a kind of 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.280
 mesh a fabric between meshes for 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.470
 avoid the whole issue of impacts and that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.640
 they can hurt us on the sole of the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.270
 of the foot 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.970
 so here is one of the 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:01.120
 differences of the shoe compared to 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.610
 other models we have already seen the flex 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.640
 fix as if not much bending has 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:09.550
 a marked bending point that follows 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.310
 perfection fix 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.670
 and let's see the apec the upper one that is 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.380
 Built in a fabric called dry 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.160
 flex 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.850
 well, it basically favors the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.640
 perspiration and rapid drying of 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.130
 weaving as you see very soft the truth 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.710
 is that we have been quite surprised 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:38.740
 the upper part because it's very very very 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.870
 friendly very comfortable and looks like being 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:46.630
 very comfortable fixes here also the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.370
 the quilts fixed that is a 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.010
 shoe that is a bit in between 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.030
 and that the sole is very low 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.540
 but the finishes are more forceful 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.180
 that a minimalist with more protections 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.730
 quite more marked even the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.720
 appearance is more yes it looks 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.100
 minimalist but more than one shoe 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.680
 maybe more street 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.290
 another of the details that prove it 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.410
 is these laces fixed are your 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.030
 very large round cords very very 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.250
 big 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.300
 I remembered very well how you see but yes 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.430
 they mark a little the difference with other 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.080
 also minimalist shoes that are 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.150
 Laces much smaller than 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.160
 let's go here on the tongue how are you going to 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.260
 consider practically literally 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.690
 The pair and when to tighten the cord 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:46.670
 gets a little inward now that 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:49.580
 see here what happens if this one is 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.830
 it's double before it does here it's going to 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.820
 bother or we will not be fixed here 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.940
 the bands are on the sides like 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.090
 completely unloaded to hold the 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.820
 foot tensing the laces as 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.210
 I would squeeze sneaker leaving more free 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.550
 the whole front is not a 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.730
 especially wide shoe front 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.190
 we have tried other minimalist more 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.770
 wide ahead we are this that you 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:23.990
 commented how the tongue is part 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:28.050
 of the same upper and another of those of the 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.760
 novelties of this shoe with respect to 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.530
 the differences with respect to 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.810
 Minimalist sneakers is that it has 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.350
 template and can be removed therefore 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.260
 we can have 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.480
 more protection and a little more 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.140
 damping by inserting the template or 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:49.240
 leave it without a template when we already have 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.430
 perhaps the most controlled theme or do we want 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.160
 More sensations have to be said that both 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.970
 all this part of here inside like the 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:00.580
 upper in this dry lake is a is a 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.310
 antibacterial tissue so 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.810
 also here we have a plus in terms of 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.760
 the time to avoid bad smells 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.830
 set the template a little following him 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.200
 the rhombuses these the hexagons of the 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.010
 brand and what they do is also give a 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.310
 plus cushioning a template as 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:23.070
 you see is very simple let's see them 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:26.930
 when you look at what I was saying 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:30.020
 the quilts are materials 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:32.529
 somewhat heavy to be able 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.409
 minimalist remember 

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:37.509
 and the seams are seen but he 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.819
 they absolutely do not bother you at all 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:42.279
 done if he passed his hand I'm almost incapable 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:45.789
 to say where is the stitching fixed 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:49.969
 here as super easy arrow is without 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:53.280
 no problem 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:56.889
 therefore friends 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.569
 we were missing in the heel part as 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:03.659
 It has a little structure but 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:05.610
 so you have here look if you have 

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:08.129
 a little bit of structures as a part 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.159
 like cardboard or something like that logically 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:14.729
 They say without being cardboard but for you 

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:16.919
 get an idea of ​​the density of 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:18.749
 from the back of the structure of the 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:23.159
 truck therefore friends 

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:25.949
 the opener trail a shoe in fact 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:28.259
 I live to see fut that differs from the 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:30.199
 minimalist by this part of 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:33.240
 protection on this part also from 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:35.219
 configuration a little personalization 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.220
 we can take out the template or it does not give us 

00:07:35.219 --> 00:07:39.530
 that option 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:44.720
 and that part also in the part of the 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:47.390
 different sole with this attack to do more 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.510
 in the traditional style, because here 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.430
 you have friends the live trail opener 

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:54.410
 bar food channeled for bringing running 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.680
 review dotcom see you in the next 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.680
 analysis
