00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.400
 is this and with power to play I say plugins 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.800
 in the third person 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.350
 in a very simple way very simple 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.260
 that mountain 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.410
 a normal game 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.360
 I put it personalized and how can you see 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.460

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.460
 Well, all brother now 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.770

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.000
 then signs to this little one until this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.450
 link that I will leave the description 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 what I went up 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.880
 a media file is a pretty file 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.960
 light 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.960
 we are not going to put 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.370
 what 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.290
 and I think we're going to extract this thing 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.630
 here 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.790
 is going to create this folder and we are going to 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.270
 execute this file that is called from 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:29.289
 camera everything we give you yes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.200
 and here he hopes that he finds the game more 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.750
 well when it was scanned by scanning in 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.079
 against we give him in the third person and we 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.079
 we came back 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.240
 and how can you see 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.899
 we already have this 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.740
 our smell in the third person the only thing 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.240
 bad is that we hear everything well 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.770
 the sound effects since then 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.289
 we have to have another as it is said 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.469
 Well, another way of looking at things is not 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.049
 be another perspective forgiveness and well 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.960
 I hope you like them to leave their like 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.209
 your comments is something quick and 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.970
 simple what we did here is nothing 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.080
 from another world does not harm the absolute sun 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.750
 but not at all 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.200
 and well we want this 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:27.080
 return is exactly the same we 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.080
 we go out and here we take off this see 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.840
 and it is already 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.420
 so it's pretty quick and easy and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.830
 hope you like 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:42.790
 the truth is that it does not look different as 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.010
 that it's different but good and that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.090
 like to apply the new 3 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.629

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.250

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.730

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.730
 What do you think 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.350
 if it's a little harder to 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.310
 manage to put enough 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.300
 do not lower them are half complicated 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.450
 but good for example 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.450
 already arrived fast at blue 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.190
