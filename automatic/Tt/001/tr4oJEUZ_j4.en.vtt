00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
true you can do that without even

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.670 
true you can do that without even
thinking<00:03:15.520> about<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:16.600> couple<00:03:17.020> of<00:03:17.110> tips<00:03:17.320> don't

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
thinking about it a couple of tips don't

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.410 
thinking about it a couple of tips don't
play<00:03:18.010> with<00:03:18.250> your<00:03:18.370> fingertips<00:03:18.850> spread<00:03:19.180> the

play<00:03:22.690> pipes<00:03:22.930> properly<00:03:23.350> if<00:03:23.440> you<00:03:23.470> start<00:03:23.860> using

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
but you play the parts or then the size

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.410 
but you play the parts or then the size
of<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.560> fingers<00:03:29.920> also<00:03:30.640> when<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.210> move<00:03:31.390> from

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
of the fingers also when you move from

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.900 
of the fingers also when you move from
the<00:03:31.750> bottom<00:03:31.900> hand<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.070> top<00:03:33.310> hand<00:03:33.580> which<00:03:33.790> is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
the bottom hand to the top hand which is

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.330 
the bottom hand to the top hand which is
a<00:03:33.940> D<00:03:34.209> 10<00:03:34.450> e<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:35.560> don't<00:03:35.800> want<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.160> get<00:03:36.310> a

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
a D 10 e you don't want to get a

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.100 
a D 10 e you don't want to get a
crossing<00:03:36.640> movement<00:03:37.240> sign<00:03:37.480> which<00:03:37.810> would<00:03:37.990> be

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
crossing movement sign which would be

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.410 
crossing movement sign which would be
this<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:42.310> don't<00:03:42.550> want<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.940> because<00:03:43.120> that's

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
this you don't want that because that's

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.060 
this you don't want that because that's
giving<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:43.750> a<00:03:43.810> little<00:03:44.050> ear<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.350> between<00:03:44.650> what

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
giving you a little ear in between what

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.630 
giving you a little ear in between what
you<00:03:45.190> do<00:03:45.340> want<00:03:45.520> is<00:03:46.030> this

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.530 

ah<00:03:50.670> because<00:03:51.510> it's<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:52.140> movement<00:03:52.380> from<00:03:52.860> D<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.400> e

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
ah because it's one movement from D to e

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.970 
ah because it's one movement from D to e
so<00:03:54.540> play<00:03:54.690> once<00:03:54.900> again<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.380> scale<00:03:55.620> all<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:55.890> way

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
so play once again the scale all the way

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.700 
so play once again the scale all the way
