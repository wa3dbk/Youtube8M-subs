00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:45.429
 It's cool 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.059

 which parts of my body needs to be fictional of the extreme lose control 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:38.719
 I understand it seems like a lot of people end up getting hurt because they support each other.

 muscles - land ownership that should be the largest muscles 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.349

 bigger muscles in your hand 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.929
 relaxed servants 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:58.319
 by talking about it and relaxing years about his certain death approached if his 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.839
 when shaken three or four times with each beat of these 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.879

 his return to the little relaxed season while relations 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.919
 the result 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.590
 out of curiosity about operations in the eyes of the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.610
 movements in front of the hands when 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.650
 the other two higher dishes 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.969
 I'm already thinking about hitting the bass players. 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.080
 António Nóbrega 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.789

 enough drummer 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.370
 What will happen to the battery 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 the athlete has already fulfilled a 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
 impressive 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.149
 in the skin of the box seems almost liquidated while absorbing the impact of the beat 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.719
 The girl was a victim. 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.499
 we should take a look at the dishes 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.499
 We're going to your belly button. 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.630

 access to the camera enters or is not a victim 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.740
 This is how it ends.
