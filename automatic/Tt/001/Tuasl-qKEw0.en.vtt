00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
pretty impressive yeah so that is it

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.360 
pretty impressive yeah so that is it
that's<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.500> global<00:03:28.830> improvement<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.280> all

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
that's a global improvement to all

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.160 
that's a global improvement to all
Chromebooks<00:03:29.940> yes<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.750> think<00:03:30.930> at<00:03:31.050> this

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
Chromebooks yes and you think at this

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.510 
Chromebooks yes and you think at this
point<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.650> means<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.010> Chromebook<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.460> a

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
point that means the Chromebook is a

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.030 
point that means the Chromebook is a
much<00:03:32.760> more<00:03:32.790> usable<00:03:33.210> yes<00:03:33.930> product<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.950> know

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
much more usable yes product you know

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.680 
much more usable yes product you know
what<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.430> see<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.820> lot<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.090> schools<00:03:36.330> use<00:03:36.510> it

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
what I see is a lot of schools use it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.720 
what I see is a lot of schools use it
because<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:37.530> does<00:03:37.830> what<00:03:38.040> kids<00:03:38.310> need<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.610> do

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
because it does what kids need to do

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.010 
because it does what kids need to do
which<00:03:38.910> is<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:39.120> could<00:03:39.240> do<00:03:39.330> research<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.960> can

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
which is you could do research you can

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.290 
which is you could do research you can
write<00:03:40.860> reports<00:03:41.040> has<00:03:41.400> got<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.580> full<00:03:41.820> keyboard<00:03:42.030> is

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
write reports has got a full keyboard is

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.260 
write reports has got a full keyboard is
not<00:03:42.450> a<00:03:42.480> tablet<00:03:43.160> it<00:03:44.160> some<00:03:44.730> businesses<00:03:45.120> are

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
not a tablet it some businesses are

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.520 
not a tablet it some businesses are
buying<00:03:45.660> Chromebooks<00:03:46.110> in<00:03:46.200> fact<00:03:46.350> that<00:03:46.440> they

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
buying Chromebooks in fact that they

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.660 
buying Chromebooks in fact that they
seem<00:03:46.710> to<00:03:46.740> be<00:03:46.860> selling<00:03:47.160> quite<00:03:47.340> well<00:03:47.520> in

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
seem to be selling quite well in

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.880 
seem to be selling quite well in
business<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.210> guess<00:03:48.960> primarily<00:03:49.410> because<00:03:49.620> there

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
business I guess primarily because there

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.380 
business I guess primarily because there
are<00:03:49.980> people<00:03:50.040> who<00:03:50.400> at<00:03:50.550> work<00:03:50.760> who<00:03:50.910> don't<00:03:51.120> need

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
are people who at work who don't need

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.480 
are people who at work who don't need
the<00:03:51.720> full<00:03:51.900> power<00:03:52.110> yes<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.800> a<00:03:52.920> full<00:03:53.160> computer

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
the full power yes of a full computer

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.180 
the full power yes of a full computer
it's<00:03:54.150> more<00:03:54.360> secure<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.200> think<00:03:55.440> for<00:03:55.980> people

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
it's more secure and I think for people

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.060 
it's more secure and I think for people
who<00:03:56.400> are<00:03:56.490> not<00:03:56.670> GU<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:58.020> know<00:03:58.110> real<00:03:58.350> gurus<00:03:58.860> of
