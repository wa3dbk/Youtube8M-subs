 I do not enjoy that much 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.410
 you have to sit around all the time 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 can namely, for example, there is 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.129
 then you can fly a room 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 leave as we get then buy 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.830
 to plan 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.019
 then we have to guide the 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.909
 german olympic teams 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.339
 and that is in different 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.949
 difficulty levels medium and easy 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:10.110
 hard me and then you have different 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:12.689
 My child needs to plan tasks 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.450
 really like to go to school 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.030
 It is partly true if so 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.920
 he has an alternative offer at noon 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 that he says I prefer to go to the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.079

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.009
 not in school today 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.820
 So that's really a great thing 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.289
 where my child is absolutely having fun with it 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.939
 I have two children here in school 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.920
 and they are both in the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.149
 Full time care because I'm tall 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.130
 this is necessary for us 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.990
 have no available grannies here 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.299
 and opas that can jump in then 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.510
 if you get something in between you 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.440
 Both like to go to the core time 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:01.380
 melanie is here in the fifth grade 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.120
 both she likes working in 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.460
 lamp rome a small group worked 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.410
 and I am in search of freedom in the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.140
 school my child still his strength and 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.580
 weakness talks hit 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.680
 a special feature and a strength 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.260
 our school is that we have a right 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.050
 small schools and all students are included 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.600
 the adult persons personally 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.340
 are known and a good personal 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.960
 exist through the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.580
 different professions in our team 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.890
 is it possible for a student 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.260
 to look at different perspectives 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.760
 and to watch more closely 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.440
 that means we at each 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.150
 single student lifting the strengths 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.340
 can and even at weaken targeted 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.310
 can support the diversity of 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.180
 time also exists in that the children 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.680
 different lengths for the same 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.860
 we can have a task 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.720
 the possibility of a child one 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.280
 then it had to work longer 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.410
 not like in the normal closed 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.209
 be ready and teach it 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.490
 possibly finished as homework 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.380
 but it can be done the next day 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.540
 will continue to work another child 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.570
 already can make a new task because 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.000
 that was already done with the task 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.830
 has so many different kids and that 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.100
 is just something very special 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.290
 as a referendar at other schools so 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.360
 can not experience and you also learn 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.580
 always new to it, so it is 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.030
 is not just about what the children are 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.220
 learn each day from each other but 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.450
 I too always learn a lot 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.030
 also from the children 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.100
 I do came from one and a half years 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.750
 time care and we still as 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.360
 homework support we offer ags 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.780

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:42.580
 Diverse work and that makes him 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.140
 so happy and just happy beautiful 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.640
 bloody residential schools has been introduced 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.790
 some years ago already on the way 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.400
 the modern demands of pedagogy 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.200
 and therefore this for 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.700
 We are very happy that now 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.959
 possibility exists the ludwig 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.700
 women's homes school to 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.920
 develop further 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.600
 in particular, the topic of inclusion is included 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.940
 We have a very important concern 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.090
 we work out our own 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.489
 profile to add this profile here 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.709
 School landscape also in the region 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.650
 and I am very sure about that 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.440
 that we are a good addition to the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.850

 undenominational school 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.680
 because there are children with 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.050
 different conditions 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.790
 individually cared for and forward 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.200
