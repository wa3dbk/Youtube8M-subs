behind me is going to demo for me going
to<00:00:11.700> go<00:00:11.820> through<00:00:12.059> our<00:00:12.090> progressions<00:00:12.570> like

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
to go through our progressions like

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
to go through our progressions like
usual<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:14.240> he's<00:00:15.240> going<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.450> be<00:00:15.509> using<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
usual and he's going to be using the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.960 
usual and he's going to be using the
ring<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.289> can<00:00:16.410> also<00:00:16.590> use<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.980> bar<00:00:17.580> which

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
ring but you can also use a bar which

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.970 
ring but you can also use a bar which
it's<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.539> bit<00:00:18.630> different<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.199> find<00:00:19.859> what

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's a little bit different so find what

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.380 
it's a little bit different so find what
you<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.189> better<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.910> want<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.090> work<00:00:21.240> an

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
you like better you want to work an

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.560 
you like better you want to work an
overhand<00:00:21.840> grip<00:00:21.990> about<00:00:22.410> shoulder-width<00:00:23.570> so

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
overhand grip about shoulder-width so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.070 
overhand grip about shoulder-width so
we're<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.900> start<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:27.080> easiest

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
we're going to start with the easiest

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.870 
we're going to start with the easiest
progression<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.800> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.670> position

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
progression is going to be a position

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.410 
progression is going to be a position
where<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:31.430> all<00:00:32.430> Prevention's<00:00:32.969> my<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.239> arm

Jim mass is all about leverage okay so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
Jim mass is all about leverage okay so
as<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.690> move<00:01:01.079> into<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> harder<00:01:01.620> progressions

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
as we move into the harder progressions

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.680 
as we move into the harder progressions
we're<00:01:02.520> going<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.789> extending<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> body

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
we're going to be extending the body

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.170 
we're going to be extending the body
longer<00:01:04.080> making<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.769> movement<00:01:04.979> harder<00:01:05.460> more

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
longer making the movement harder more

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.580 
longer making the movement harder more
tight<00:01:06.540> everything<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> center<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
tight everything is to the center the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.359 
tight everything is to the center the
easier<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
easier it is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.570 
easier it is
so<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.820> next<00:01:09.030> thing<00:01:09.180> he's<00:01:09.330> gonna<00:01:09.450> do<00:01:09.930> same

do<00:02:05.350> the<00:02:05.440> last<00:02:05.619> one<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.430> we<00:02:07.000> have<00:02:07.090> two<00:02:07.810> more<00:02:08.050> all

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
do the last one so we have two more all

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.580 
do the last one so we have two more all
right<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.399> next<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:09.850> once<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.600> can<00:02:10.780> do<00:02:10.959> one

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
right the next one once you can do one

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.350 
right the next one once you can do one
leg<00:02:11.800> out<00:02:11.950> for<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.190> decent<00:02:12.340> amount<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.610> time<00:02:12.700> you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
leg out for a decent amount of time you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.449 
leg out for a decent amount of time you
can<00:02:13.390> go<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.840> straddle<00:02:14.500> position<00:02:14.530> again

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
can go to a straddle position again

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.100 
can go to a straddle position again
because<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.819> legs<00:02:16.030> aren't<00:02:16.630> going<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:17.020> as

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
because the legs aren't going to be as

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.110 
because the legs aren't going to be as
far<00:02:17.350> away<00:02:17.590> out<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.010> front<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.430> body<00:02:18.610> but

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
far away out in front of the body but

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.990 
far away out in front of the body but
rather<00:02:19.270> spreading<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.220> weight<00:02:21.220> out<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.760> front

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
rather spreading the weight out in front

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.090 
rather spreading the weight out in front
so<00:02:22.209> he's<00:02:22.720> going<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.900> straighten<00:02:23.709> both<00:02:23.890> legs

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
so he's going to straighten both legs

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.729 
so he's going to straighten both legs
and<00:02:24.459> try<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.610> hold<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.970> straddle<00:02:25.300> position

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.100
