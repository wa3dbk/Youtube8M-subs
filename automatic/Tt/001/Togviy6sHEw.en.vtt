every<00:00:08.460> once<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> while<00:00:08.970> I'll<00:00:09.179> see<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> problem

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
every once in a while I'll see a problem

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.259 
every once in a while I'll see a problem
with<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.019> photo<00:00:10.349> we're<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.940> white

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
with a photo we're just one white

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.330 
with a photo we're just one white
balance<00:00:12.719> correction<00:00:12.960> doesn't<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> trick

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
balance correction doesn't do the trick

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.099 
balance correction doesn't do the trick
and<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:15.000> this<00:00:15.150> inside<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.599> Camera<00:00:15.870> Raw

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
and we can do this inside of Camera Raw

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.120 
and we can do this inside of Camera Raw
you're<00:00:16.289> gonna<00:00:16.379> see<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.680> I'm<00:00:16.770> talking<00:00:16.800> about

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
you're gonna see what I'm talking about

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.099 
you're gonna see what I'm talking about
in<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.609> second<00:00:18.000> here<00:00:18.150> let's<00:00:18.840> brighten

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
in just a second here let's brighten

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.990 
in just a second here let's brighten
this<00:00:19.289> photo<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.650> little<00:00:19.920> bit<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> then<00:00:20.850> I'm

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
this photo a little bit and then I'm

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.250 
this photo a little bit and then I'm
just<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.330> add<00:00:21.449> some<00:00:21.480> blacks<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.140> that's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
just going to add some blacks and that's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.800 
just going to add some blacks and that's
going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> take<00:00:22.650> care<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.180> making<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.330> overall

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
going to take care of making the overall

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.589 
going to take care of making the overall
color<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.580> tone<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> photo<00:00:27.180> look<00:00:27.420> better

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
color and tone of the photo look better

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.470 
color and tone of the photo look better
you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.869> see<00:00:28.050> before<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:29.460> after<00:00:29.490> now

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you can see before and then after now

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.510 
you can see before and then after now
let's<00:00:30.660> work<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.560> color<00:00:31.830> balance<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
let's work on the color balance or the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.940 
let's work on the color balance or the
white<00:00:32.730> balance<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.300> little<00:00:33.510> bit<00:00:33.690> because

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
white balance here a little bit because

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.190 
white balance here a little bit because
it's<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.239> quite<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.600> golden

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it's just not it's not quite as golden

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.170 
it's just not it's not quite as golden
as<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.190> was<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> Sun<00:00:39.000> was

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
as it was when I was there the Sun was

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
as it was when I was there the Sun was
going<00:00:39.329> down<00:00:39.480> kind<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> behind<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> clouds<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
going down kind of behind the clouds and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.369 
going down kind of behind the clouds and
it<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.579> really<00:00:41.910> shedding<00:00:42.360> some<00:00:42.540> nice<00:00:42.809> golden

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it was really shedding some nice golden

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
it was really shedding some nice golden
light<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.710> here<00:00:43.980> these<00:00:44.399> buildings<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
light on here these buildings are in the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.619 
light on here these buildings are in the
shade<00:00:45.629> ok<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.579> most<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> lights<00:00:48.390> being

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
shade ok so the most of the lights being

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.090 
shade ok so the most of the lights being
picked<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> windows<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> just

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
picked up on the windows and you just

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
picked up on the windows and you just
don't<00:00:50.370> see<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.879> much<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.360> did<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.690> I

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
don't see it as much as you did when I

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.900 
don't see it as much as you did when I
was<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.860> other<00:00:52.890> problem<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.489> we<00:00:53.730> have

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
was there the other problem that we have

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
was there the other problem that we have
is<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.660> sky<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.590> not

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
is that the sky back here is not

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.209 
is that the sky back here is not
necessarily<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.640> not<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> shade<00:00:57.480> ok<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.770> we

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
necessarily is not in the shade ok so we

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.560 
necessarily is not in the shade ok so we
have<00:00:59.250> something<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> shade<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.449> have

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
have something in the shade then we have

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.510 
have something in the shade then we have
the<00:01:00.690> sky<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> background<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.250> try<00:01:02.489> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the sky in the background as we try to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000 
the sky in the background as we try to
adjust<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.120> white<00:01:03.329> balance<00:01:03.530> we're<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
adjust the white balance we're going to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.950 
adjust the white balance we're going to
be<00:01:05.159> sacrificing<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> other<00:01:06.600> we're

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
be sacrificing one or the other we're

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.030 
be sacrificing one or the other we're
going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> try<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> best<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> both

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
going to try to get the best of both

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770 
going to try to get the best of both
worlds<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.729> we're<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.689> be

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
worlds but we're not really going to be

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
worlds but we're not really going to be
able<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.159> daylight's<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
able to do it all right daylight's a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.490 
able to do it all right daylight's a
little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.090> red<00:01:12.299> cloudy<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.080> probably

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
little bit red cloudy it's probably

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
little bit red cloudy it's probably
going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> be<00:01:14.010> where<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> settle<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.930> shades

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
going to be where I settle on shades

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.390 
going to be where I settle on shades
probably<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:17.100> too

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
probably going to get a little bit too

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.219 
probably going to get a little bit too
warm<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.420> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.930> cloudy

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
warm there but I kind of like cloudy

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.560 
warm there but I kind of like cloudy
here<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> problem<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.540> we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
here now you can see the problem that we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.140 
here now you can see the problem that we
have<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.860> doing<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.369> nice<00:01:23.610> job<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
have is that it's doing a nice job to

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.539 
have is that it's doing a nice job to
bring<00:01:24.330> some<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.810> golden<00:01:25.350> color<00:01:25.619> over

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
bring some of that golden color over

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.330 
bring some of that golden color over
here<00:01:26.820> onto<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.540> buildings<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.590> might<00:01:28.920> just

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
here onto the buildings and I might just

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.480 
here onto the buildings and I might just
tweak<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:31.049> tint<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:31.950> maybe<00:01:32.250> even

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
tweak that tint a little bit maybe even

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.910 
tweak that tint a little bit maybe even
make<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.820> little<00:01:33.000> bit<00:01:33.210> warmer<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.829> get

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
make it a little bit warmer just to get

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
make it a little bit warmer just to get
some<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> red<00:01:35.490> out<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.820> here<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.509> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
some of the red out of here but you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.780 
some of the red out of here but you

could see one of the issues that we have
is<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> look<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> sky<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:40.560> our

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
is take a look at the sky here is our

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
before here's our after the sky is now

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.499 
before here's our after the sky is now
getting<00:01:43.829> very<00:01:44.189> yellow<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.970> got<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> yellow

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
getting very yellow it's got a yellow

tint<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.079> ok<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.220> either<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.700> make

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
tint to it ok so we either have to make

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.940 
tint to it ok so we either have to make
a<00:01:47.880> global<00:01:48.450> change<00:01:48.720> by<00:01:48.930> adjusting<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.829> our

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
a global change by adjusting all of our

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.530

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
it's got some yellows so it's cooling

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.710 
it's got some yellows so it's cooling
and<00:02:10.440> warming<00:02:10.610> all<00:02:11.610> right<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.879> is

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and warming all right this is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.110 
and warming all right this is
it's<00:02:12.930> kind<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.920> selective<00:02:14.850> white

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
it's kind of like a selective white

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.760 
it's kind of like a selective white
balance<00:02:15.570> tool<00:02:15.780> because<00:02:16.080> those<00:02:16.260> are<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> main

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
balance tool because those are the main

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.020 
balance tool because those are the main
things<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.130> we're<00:02:17.310> going<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.490> do<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:17.820> white

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
things that we're going to do with white

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.270 
things that we're going to do with white
balance<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.480> cooling<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.050> warming<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:20.160> in

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
balance is cooling and warming so in

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.820 
balance is cooling and warming so in
this<00:02:20.400> example<00:02:20.580> here<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.390> can<00:02:22.350> click<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
this example here I can click on the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.090 
this example here I can click on the
blue<00:02:23.040> color<00:02:23.310> maybe<00:02:23.880> increase<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.510> saturation

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
blue color maybe increase the saturation

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.580 
blue color maybe increase the saturation
up<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.400> about<00:02:26.580> 70<00:02:27.240> here<00:02:27.480> when<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.080> hit<00:02:28.200> okay<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
up to about 70 here when I hit okay and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.320 
up to about 70 here when I hit okay and
then<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> want<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.640> make<00:02:29.760> sure<00:02:29.790> i<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.000> auto

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.490 
over the sky all right and that auto
mask<00:02:36.300> it's<00:02:36.630> going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> do<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.960> pretty<00:02:37.200> good<00:02:37.320> job

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
