00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.349
 good 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.820
 I wanted to continue the 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.830
 subject that we approached in the video 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.320
 We spent talking about the 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.620
 language of the Brazilian battery more 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.470
 specifically about samba is 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.540
 It's important to know that we have 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.180
 basically three kinds of deaf 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.290
 soul samba school of the first 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.940
 second and third or cut 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.540
 I'm going to use here as a reference 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.470
 deaf even from the drums more 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:54.519
 example a few sentences to the 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:59.019
 of the deaf then the deaf is first 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:02.080
 the greater deaf his strong time in the 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:06.700
 truth is 2 is how samba is a 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.920
 Binary Compass is 1212 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:25.510
 then he is deaf at first he accentuated the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:26.850
 time 2 is to be it here 12 the dream of 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.710
 Monday 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.510
 has it accentuates the 1 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.970
 he's a little shorter a little sharper 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.470
 Then there is not much sound pressure. 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.220
 as the first 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:49.090
 I'm going to make him a basic law here. 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:52.120
 112 and the deaf third or cut 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.470
 He is more of a soloist, shall we say? 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.630
 I'll make a few some sentences 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:04.230
 which can be used on a sheet of 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.230
 third 112 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.830
 bringing this into the context of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:25.260
 battery is we can carry this 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.540
 same idea itself probo nÃ© 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.550
 I'm going to take a basic levada here 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:36.060
 is using chimbau and bass drum with this idea 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:55.830
 of the first deaf accentuating the two 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:58.760
 12 12 years then we go there 1 212 one 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.760
 little faster 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:18.110
 the team more then this is the tip of today 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.890
 was the one that the butt of the battery in the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.989
 samba 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.580
 it has a direct relationship with the deaf 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.200
 of the samba school, right? 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.840
 so in the next video we continue 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.080
 this good song for you and subject to the 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.080
 next
