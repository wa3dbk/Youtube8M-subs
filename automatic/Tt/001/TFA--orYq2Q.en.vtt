crystals
very<00:00:48.360> good<00:00:48.890> only<00:00:49.890> eight<00:00:50.070> batteries<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
very good only eight batteries the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.389 
very good only eight batteries the
batteries<00:00:52.460> okay<00:00:53.460> let's<00:00:53.730> turn<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
batteries okay let's turn it on here I

radios<00:00:59.460> uh<00:01:00.920> as<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.370> maybe<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.750> we

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
radios uh as you see maybe I think we

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
radios uh as you see maybe I think we
could<00:01:04.019> see<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.850> have<00:01:05.850> max<00:01:06.210> voltage<00:01:06.780> right

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
could see this I have max voltage right

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.160 
could see this I have max voltage right
here<00:01:07.110> ten<00:01:07.439> point<00:01:07.770> five<00:01:08.240> look<00:01:09.240> let's<00:01:09.810> scroll

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
here ten point five look let's scroll

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.760 
here ten point five look let's scroll
through<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> menu<00:01:12.320> steering<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.380> Reverse

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
through the menu steering in Reverse

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.990 
through the menu steering in Reverse

zero<00:01:15.270> percent<00:01:17.180> steering

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.610 

very<00:01:21.820> nice<00:01:24.210> could<00:01:25.210> change<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.690> lot<00:01:25.960> see<00:01:26.230> a<00:01:26.260> lot

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
very nice could change a lot see a lot

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.750 
very nice could change a lot see a lot
of<00:01:26.650> things<00:01:26.890> on<00:01:27.130> here<00:01:28.980> the<00:01:29.980> only<00:01:30.220> thing<00:01:30.580> I'm

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
of things on here the only thing I'm

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.390 
of things on here the only thing I'm
really<00:01:31.090> wish<00:01:31.720> you<00:01:31.930> could<00:01:31.960> do<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.680> the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
really wish you could do is the

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.480 
really wish you could do is the
left-hand-side<00:01:35.700> conversion<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:39.340> to

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
left-hand-side conversion but have to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.280 
left-hand-side conversion but have to
step<00:01:39.700> up<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.090> 400<00:01:40.630> all-in<00:01:40.840> controller

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
step up to the 400 all-in controller

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.080 
step up to the 400 all-in controller
right<00:01:41.530> there<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:42.460> do<00:01:42.610> that

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
right there to do that

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.670 
right there to do that
it's<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.800> DX<00:01:44.800> 3r<00:01:49.260> but<00:01:50.260> really<00:01:50.530> this

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
it's the DX 3r but really this

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.740 
it's the DX 3r but really this
controller<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:51.370> a<00:01:51.490> nice<00:01:51.759> controller<00:01:52.270> and<00:01:52.479> I

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
controller is a nice controller and I

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.190 
controller is a nice controller and I
highly<00:01:53.200> recommend<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.979> for<00:01:54.630> starters<00:01:55.630> that

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
highly recommend it for starters that

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.130 
highly recommend it for starters that
are<00:01:56.410> wanting<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.400> good<00:01:57.610> radio<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:58.780> could

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
are wanting a good radio that you could

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.180 
are wanting a good radio that you could
drive<00:01:59.680> it<00:01:59.710> far<00:02:00.100> with<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.700> if<00:02:01.390> you're<00:02:01.930> a

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
drive it far with and if you're a

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.520 
drive it far with and if you're a
younger<00:02:03.190> kid<00:02:04.410> parents

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
younger kid parents

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.190 
younger kid parents
I<00:02:05.560> recommend<00:02:06.160> this<00:02:06.330> because<00:02:07.330> then<00:02:07.990> they<00:02:08.170> don't

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
I recommend this because then they don't

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.570 
I recommend this because then they don't
have<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.530> worry<00:02:08.709> about<00:02:08.740> bending<00:02:09.070> this<00:02:09.399> or

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
have to worry about bending this or

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.210 
have to worry about bending this or
breaking<00:02:09.940> this<00:02:12.540> yeah<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.500> steering<00:02:14.860> on

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
breaking this yeah and the steering on

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.880 
breaking this yeah and the steering on
this<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.790> reacts<00:02:16.570> just<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.440> Cardinals

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
this it reacts just like the Cardinals

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.140 
this it reacts just like the Cardinals
it's<00:02:18.700> very<00:02:19.180> smooth<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.200> nice<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.800> can<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.730> love
