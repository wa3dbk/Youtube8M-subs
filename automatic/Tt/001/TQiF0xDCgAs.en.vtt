 of rain Roberto decided to leave 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.290
 walk to do some exercise 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.810
 As I was a little bit cold , the 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.720
 nose and putting on the coat 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.920
 like your umbrella 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.680
 then he opened the door of his house opened 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.550
 the umbrella and went outside under the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.550
 cold rain 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.869
 and walked and walked away from the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:00.030
 city then a strong wind began 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:04.310
 to play a trick on him 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:08.420
 and the wind ripped off his umbrella 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.110
 simply the umbrella went flying 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.200
 and Roberto stayed with the rain 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:21.020
 looking for all the clothes that the cold 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.930
 did it could be now then saw 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.160
 what appeared to be a cabin and there it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.370
 He ran hastily 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.650
 seeking refuge 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.650
 incredible knock on the door 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.240
 not only for having it a tall and robust 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.510
 young brunette who told you only that you do not 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.740
 stay there in the rain because you do not 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.740
 you pass to my house 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:02.770
 everything is not down since the clothes 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.770
 next to the fire so that it is known good 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.650
 she took off her wet clothes and placed it 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.030
 by the fireplace all tea but at 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.790
 take off your clothes 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.910
 Roberto noticed that the young man's gaze 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.240
 it turned glassy 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.290
 the brunette took Roberto he threw 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.890
 the carpet and he did things that he never 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.890
 I would have imagined 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.210
 but 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.410
 what a feeling through roberto de 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.750
 tear and so they could for a long time 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.500
 then the boy told him your clothes and 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.680
 it's dry you can leave when it came out 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.050
 from the house the rain had stopped 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.470
 he started the road and the cold luckily 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:54.140
 had passed and colored red this 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.069
 story has ended up leaving it at 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:02.300

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:06.019
