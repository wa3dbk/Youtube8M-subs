I I'm happy with it I think I think it's
better<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.790> way<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.080> not<00:01:51.320> that<00:01:51.760> much<00:01:52.760> of<00:01:52.790> a

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
better that way it's not that much of a

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.660 
better that way it's not that much of a
hassle<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.360> push<00:01:53.570> it<00:01:53.720> forward<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:55.340> doesn't

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
hassle to push it forward it doesn't

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.119 
hassle to push it forward it doesn't
take<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.790> lot<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:55.970> strength<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.759> my<00:01:58.909> mod
