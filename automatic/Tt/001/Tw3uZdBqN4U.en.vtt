now you also might be wondering well

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.880 
now you also might be wondering well
what's<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> payoff<00:00:27.869> here<00:00:28.170> we'll<00:00:28.590> talk<00:00:28.769> about

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
what's the payoff here we'll talk about

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
what's the payoff here we'll talk about
that<00:00:29.130> shortly<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:30.060> off<00:00:30.210> you're<00:00:30.359> going<00:00:30.539> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
that shortly first off you're going to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479 
that shortly first off you're going to
need<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.869> synchronized<00:00:31.410> Pokemon<00:00:31.859> head<00:00:32.219> over<00:00:32.399> to

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
need a synchronized Pokemon head over to

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.459 
need a synchronized Pokemon head over to
route<00:00:32.640> 102<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.329> go<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.840> catch<00:00:33.989> yourself<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
route 102 and go and catch yourself a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.250 
route 102 and go and catch yourself a
Ralts<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:35.579> Ralts<00:00:36.000> has<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> very<00:00:36.660> low<00:00:36.840> chance<00:00:36.870> I

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
Ralts now Ralts has a very low chance I

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.840 
Ralts now Ralts has a very low chance I
believe<00:00:37.469> five<00:00:37.739> percent<00:00:38.160> chance<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.460> appearing

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
believe five percent chance of appearing

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
believe five percent chance of appearing
so<00:00:39.300> unless<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.840> bring<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.379> X&amp;Y<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.890> get

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
so unless you bring one from X&amp;Y you get

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
so unless you bring one from X&amp;Y you get
one<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> Wonder<00:00:41.910> trade<00:00:42.149> you're<00:00:42.480> going<00:00:42.690> up

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
one on the Wonder trade you're going up

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.660 
one on the Wonder trade you're going up
to<00:00:42.899> encounter<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.469> catch<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.649> first<00:00:44.010> after

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to encounter and catch it first after

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.700 
to encounter and catch it first after
that<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.450> dexnav<00:00:45.750> search<00:00:46.410> for

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
that you can use the dexnav search for

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
that you can use the dexnav search for
it<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.610> cool<00:00:47.789> thing<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.239> dexnav

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
it and the cool thing about the dexnav

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.880 
it and the cool thing about the dexnav
is<00:00:48.809> you'll<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:48.989> able<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> see<00:00:49.379> its<00:00:49.530> nature

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
is you'll be able to see its nature

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.830 
is you'll be able to see its nature
before<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.460> encounter<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.690> now

you continue your search then you can
just<00:00:57.570> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.840> get<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.230> ton<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.739> synchronized

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
just kind of get a ton of synchronized

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.060 
just kind of get a ton of synchronized
waltz<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.570> once<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.079> catch<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.680> ton<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> those

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
waltz so once you catch a ton of those

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.260 
waltz so once you catch a ton of those
you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.340> go<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.489> your<00:01:02.609> box<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.180> you

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you can go to your box and then you

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.299 
you can go to your box and then you
don't<00:01:03.480> need<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.110> every<00:01:04.350> single<00:01:04.799> nature

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
don't need to have every single nature

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010 
don't need to have every single nature
for<00:01:05.549> Pokemon<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.600> think<00:01:06.720> about<00:01:06.840> from

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
for Pokemon now if you think about from

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
for Pokemon now if you think about from
a<00:01:07.110> competitive<00:01:07.560> aspect<00:01:08.010> you're<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.549> just

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
a competitive aspect you're really just

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.770 
a competitive aspect you're really just
going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> need<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> main<00:01:09.510> ones

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
eat so you don't necessarily need all of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
eat so you don't necessarily need all of
them<00:01:20.850> also<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.659> reason<00:01:21.960> why<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.320> good<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
them also the reason why this is good is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.410 
them also the reason why this is good is
because<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> works<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.580> multiple<00:01:23.909> Pokemon

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
because it works for multiple Pokemon

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.050 
because it works for multiple Pokemon
that<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.409> say<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> Jolly<00:01:26.580> ralt

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
that if you have say a Jolly ralt

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.340 
that if you have say a Jolly ralt
that<00:01:27.360> means<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> catch<00:01:28.049> multiple

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that means you can catch multiple

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.899 
that means you can catch multiple
Pokemon<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.280> need<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.549> breed<00:01:29.729> for

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
Pokemon that you need to breed for

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
Pokemon that you need to breed for
Jolley<00:01:30.180> from<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.110> having<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.650> rod<00:01:31.979> set

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
Jolley from just having that one rod set

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
Jolley from just having that one rod set
you<00:01:32.310> call<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> caught<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.210> time<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.960> can

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you call it caught that one time you can

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.020 
you call it caught that one time you can
also<00:01:34.229> kind<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.220> for<00:01:35.460> ditto<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.790> if

though stationary Pokemon do work with

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.010 
though stationary Pokemon do work with
this<00:01:56.850> method<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:57.960> for

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
this method so it is really good for

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.230 
this method so it is really good for
catching<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.590> reggie's<00:01:59.040> Rayquaza<00:01:59.490> as<00:01:59.820> well
