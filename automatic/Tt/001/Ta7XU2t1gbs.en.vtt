00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
say about six months ago but i thought

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.720 
say about six months ago but i thought
it<00:00:51.510> was<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.899> good<00:00:52.079> deal<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.309> normally

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it was really good deal this is normally

it was really good deal this is normally
priced<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.420> 150<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.920> particular

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
priced at 150 at that particular

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.430 
priced at 150 at that particular
retailer<00:00:56.579> I've<00:00:56.969> seen<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.300> elsewhere<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.989> 180

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
retailer I've seen it elsewhere for 180

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.410 
retailer I've seen it elsewhere for 180
so<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> thought<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.550> pretty<00:00:59.730> good<00:00:59.850> deal<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so I thought it was pretty good deal and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
so I thought it was pretty good deal and
what<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.899> sold<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> USB

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
what really sold it for me was the USB

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.390 
what really sold it for me was the USB
3.0<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.140> three<00:01:04.470> point<00:01:04.710> 0<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.040> my

3.0 I do have three point 0 on my

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.350 
3.0 I do have three point 0 on my
desktop<00:01:06.090> PC<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.920> definitely<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

desktop PC so I'm definitely into the
hole<00:01:09.570> faster<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:11.189> better<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:12.240> know<00:01:12.330> what

hole faster is better you know what

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.850

really<00:01:12.540> would<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:12.960> sold<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:13.560> this<00:01:13.650> was

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
really would have sold this if this was

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.789 
really would have sold this if this was

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
a purely solid-state drive that be even
amazing<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:18.180> we'll<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.330> $100

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
not in the near future probably but I

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.410 
not in the near future probably but I
would<00:01:25.619> love<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> eat<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.130> words<00:01:26.420> anyway

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
according to Seagate that it at you can

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.499 
according to Seagate that it at you can

actually get a firewire 800 adapter or a

actually get a firewire 800 adapter or a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
thunderbolt adapter and use these this

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490 
thunderbolt adapter and use these this
particular<00:01:44.759> drive<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.750> Mac<00:01:45.930> or<00:01:46.110> PC<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.470> well

particular drive with Mac or PC as well

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
so the adapters unfortunately are not

so the adapters unfortunately are not
included<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.549> would<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.790> cool<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.479> they

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
included that would be cool if they

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.719

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
with sometimes I don't even know what

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.560 
with sometimes I don't even know what
they<00:04:02.620> do<00:04:02.680> just<00:04:03.340> for<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.670> mere<00:04:03.910> fact<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.240> I

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
they do just for the mere fact that I

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.180 
they do just for the mere fact that I
don't<00:04:05.050> need<00:04:05.230> them<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.620> i<00:04:05.680> know<00:04:05.740> i<00:04:05.890> won't

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
don't need them and i know i won't

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.440 
don't need them and i know i won't
didn't<00:04:06.430> eat<00:04:06.550> them<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:06.880> there's<00:04:07.000> just<00:04:07.120> one

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
didn't eat them and there's just one

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.300 
didn't eat them and there's just one
more<00:04:07.480> folder<00:04:08.350> or<00:04:08.470> one<00:04:08.590> more<00:04:08.770> file<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.190> the

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
more folder or one more file on the

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.580 
more folder or one more file on the
drive<00:04:09.490> that<00:04:09.820> I<00:04:09.880> don't<00:04:10.210> need<00:04:10.480> and<00:04:10.750> it's<00:04:11.290> taking

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
drive that I don't need and it's taking

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.530 
drive that I don't need and it's taking
up<00:04:11.710> room<00:04:11.860> for<00:04:12.100> something<00:04:12.280> else<00:04:12.550> more<00:04:13.030> precious

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
up room for something else more precious

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.750 
up room for something else more precious
so<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.590> said<00:04:14.650> I<00:04:14.800> usually<00:04:15.070> just<00:04:15.130> format<00:04:15.640> the

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
so like I said I usually just format the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.570 
so like I said I usually just format the
drive<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.299> pop<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.989> on<00:04:17.140> in<00:04:17.440> but<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:18.310> is<00:04:18.460> not

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
drive and pop it on in but this is not

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.340 
drive and pop it on in but this is not
my<00:04:18.730> first<00:04:18.880> sigue<00:04:19.359> drive<00:04:19.660> so<00:04:19.840> i'll<00:04:19.960> probably<00:04:20.170> be

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
my first sigue drive so i'll probably be

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.680 
my first sigue drive so i'll probably be

but<00:05:25.389> as<00:05:25.509> I<00:05:25.599> mentioned<00:05:25.629> previously<00:05:26.310> one<00:05:27.310> thing

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
but as I mentioned previously one thing

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.990 
but as I mentioned previously one thing
I'm<00:05:27.639> noticing<00:05:27.789> is<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.270> I'm<00:05:28.539> not<00:05:28.719> seeing<00:05:29.110> any

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
I'm noticing is that I'm not seeing any

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.730 
I'm noticing is that I'm not seeing any
tech<00:05:31.000> specs<00:05:31.270> on<00:05:31.419> this<00:05:31.539> particular<00:05:32.229> hard<00:05:32.529> drive

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
tech specs on this particular hard drive

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.350 
tech specs on this particular hard drive
and<00:05:32.919> I<00:05:33.069> think<00:05:33.310> I<00:05:33.370> didn't<00:05:33.669> care<00:05:33.909> about<00:05:34.029> that<00:05:34.300> at

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
and I think I didn't care about that at

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.629 
and I think I didn't care about that at
first<00:05:34.659> besides<00:05:35.289> the<00:05:35.469> USB<00:05:35.770> 3.1<00:05:36.219> the<00:05:36.370> fact<00:05:36.550> that

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
first besides the USB 3.1 the fact that

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.939 
first besides the USB 3.1 the fact that
was<00:05:36.849> three<00:05:37.000> terabytes<00:05:37.440> but<00:05:38.440> I'm<00:05:38.500> noticing<00:05:38.770> at

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
was three terabytes but I'm noticing at

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.230 
was three terabytes but I'm noticing at
us<00:05:39.069> and<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.520> was<00:05:39.610> the<00:05:39.699> only<00:05:39.789> a<00:05:39.940> hundred<00:05:40.089> bucks
