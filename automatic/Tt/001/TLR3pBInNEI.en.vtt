00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.890
 You see what rocky has in the mouth 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.300
 Now he's going around because he 's playing 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:17.700
 It is a ball of paper or albal 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.980
 Aluminum say brand 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.230
 Well, what he does is that I know 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.370
 he threw and he brings it to me as if he were a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.590
 For just puppy is the best toy 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.470
 What can you do for your kitten? 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.450
 you need to spend nothing, that is, the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.480
 cat is happy with the paper ball 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.809
 albal many times I'm so calm 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.550
 on the computer that has done it before and 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.910
 suddenly brings me the paper ball 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.660
 albal so that it was for me to throw it 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:51.130
 let's see if I can get a look at me 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.800
 well rocky 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.470
 You see, it's a little ball of paper 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:02.130
 of normal aluminum and current to see if 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.130
 I get here that look 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.210
 and then entertains a lot with the 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.670
 little ball what makes rock and is 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.119
 hide it under what is the 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.759
 curtain and there he throws himself like a good time 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.080
 then he takes it to the other corner of 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.090
 let's say of the gallery that we have here and 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.909
 he is entertained, and when he has already 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.560
 tired comes to here I let her 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.210
 next up here to the sofa I get the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.420
 leave it to be thrown again and 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.360
 well and there and I think you get bored 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.009
 that the cat itself is a pass but 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.460
 this is to tell you that there is no need 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.380
 that you spend money on nothing 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.440
 you do not have to spend money on 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 nothing in plastic balls or 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.740
 nothing because they entertain a lot with 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.920
 a simple aluminum foil ball 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.280
 you see there it is possible to be thrown as well as 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.320
 a good time 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.590
 me the first day he got by active 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.580
 oh god the curtains but not the truth 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.820
 what he does is hide it 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.410
 and play as to hunt it as if it were a 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.830
 mouse because of the noise that the paper has 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.830
 albal 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.180
 out there 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.230
 many times the whole gallery is covered 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.620
 is going through the whole gallery the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.010
 There hides and often fijate that 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.420
 shot lots of balls I say where 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.030
 they will walk and often have them 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.390
 hidden in the corners of here from the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.400
 gallery there 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.720
 rocky 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:56.110
 hello where is the little ball hidden 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.110
 where is here where is 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:08.210
 and he's hunting and here I have 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.150
 a mouse that the creator gave us 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.570
 to have an animal to have 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.350
 the smell of your house let's say where you 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.520
 raised to see if he does the same thing he does 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.680
 same 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.680
 titi you like 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.060
 already done at least very rocky and the 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.060
 steal strips 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.800
 Where is 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:53.180
 where is rock and beige 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:58.180
 it's amazing and now it's true 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.180
 so that it is useful again to the other 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:17.310
 and surely that will bring it back to me 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.310
 or hide it there for future occasions 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.440
 Well, nothing has already gotten tired 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.270
 to the war surely pampering good you 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.700
 you already know that cats are truly 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.010
 15 minutes of madness 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.720
 so that way there will be good because without 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.820
 more was to tell you that any 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.510
 toy the cheapest as a beanbag 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.540
 of aluminum foil and you're worth it and 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.750
 nothing then see you in the next video 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.460

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.310

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.409

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.600
 but here 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:06.860
