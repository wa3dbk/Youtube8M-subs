00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
feeling that this is going to be a

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
feeling that this is going to be a
duplicate<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.090> if<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.509> is<00:02:00.630> I'm<00:02:00.810> hoping<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
duplicate but if it is I'm hoping that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.920 
duplicate but if it is I'm hoping that
it's<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> judge<00:02:02.180> this<00:02:03.180> time<00:02:03.420> we're<00:02:03.570> out<00:02:03.630> or
