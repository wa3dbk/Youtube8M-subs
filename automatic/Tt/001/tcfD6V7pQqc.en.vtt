00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.460 

hello<00:00:05.640> I'm<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.690> show<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.960> how<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> build

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
hello I'm going to show you how to build

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.919 
hello I'm going to show you how to build
the<00:00:07.620> simplest<00:00:07.890> possible<00:00:08.189> magnet<00:00:08.760> motor<00:00:08.970> you

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
the simplest possible magnet motor you

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.070 
the simplest possible magnet motor you
will<00:00:09.960> only<00:00:10.260> need<00:00:10.469> two<00:00:11.130> nails<00:00:11.599> two<00:00:12.599> pieces<00:00:12.960> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
will only need two nails two pieces of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.390 
will only need two nails two pieces of
copper<00:00:13.230> wire<00:00:14.000> copper<00:00:15.000> coil<00:00:15.650> piece<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.800> wood<00:00:17.070> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
copper wire copper coil piece of wood a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.109 
copper wire copper coil piece of wood a
hammer<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:19.039> also<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> special<00:00:20.550> magnet<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.970> was

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
hammer and also a special magnet I was

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.870 
hammer and also a special magnet I was
talking<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.869> my<00:00:21.900> last<00:00:22.170> video<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
talking about in my last video the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120 
talking about in my last video the
copper<00:00:24.119> wires<00:00:24.300> are<00:00:24.660> used<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.650> make<00:00:25.830> hooks

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
copper wires are used to make hooks

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.319 
copper wires are used to make hooks
under<00:00:26.670> nails<00:00:31.790> finally<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.910> should<00:00:33.059> look<00:00:33.300> like

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
under nails finally it should look like

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:51.250 
under nails finally it should look like
this<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:35.660> put<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> nails<00:00:37.020> into<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> wood

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.840 

then<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.620> clean<00:00:52.829> each<00:00:53.160> end<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
then you have to clean each end of the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:04.939 
then you have to clean each end of the
wire<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.540> side<00:01:03.259> put<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:04.320> magnet<00:01:04.800> in

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
wire on one side put the magnet in

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:26.200 
wire on one side put the magnet in
between<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> nails<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:08.400> position<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> coil

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.609 

with<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> special<00:01:27.750> magnet<00:01:28.050> I<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.259> made<00:01:28.470> in

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
with the special magnet I have made in

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.859 
with the special magnet I have made in
my<00:01:28.710> previous<00:01:29.009> video<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:30.179> motor<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.690> run

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
my previous video this motor can run

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.540 
my previous video this motor can run
without<00:01:31.110> any<00:01:31.380> external<00:01:31.679> source<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.310> energy

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
without any external source of energy

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.109 
without any external source of energy
and<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:34.110> can<00:01:34.289> even<00:01:34.500> generate<00:01:35.399> some<00:01:35.610> energy<00:01:36.000> as

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and it can even generate some energy as

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.859 
and it can even generate some energy as
you<00:01:36.149> can<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.869> LED<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> motor

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you can see on this LED so now the motor

00:01:42.869 --> 00:02:08.660 
you can see on this LED so now the motor
is<00:01:43.110> generating<00:01:43.679> free<00:01:43.860> energy

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.380 

so<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:09.820> is<00:02:09.910> my<00:02:10.060> new<00:02:10.300> free<00:02:10.570> energy<00:02:10.990> generator
