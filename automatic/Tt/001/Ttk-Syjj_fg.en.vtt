00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
possible and really just focus on what

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.350 
possible and really just focus on what
we<00:01:30.570> saw<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> first<00:01:31.619> team<00:01:32.250> offense<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
we saw from the first team offense and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.999 
we saw from the first team offense and
first-team<00:01:33.750> defense<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> didn't

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
first-team defense because I didn't

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830 
first-team defense because I didn't
really<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.220> much<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.970> second<00:01:36.329> half<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
really see much of the second half and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
really see much of the second half and
no<00:01:37.110> much<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> second<00:01:37.920> or<00:01:38.009> third<00:01:38.040> fingers

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
no much of the second or third fingers

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
no much of the second or third fingers
right<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:38.970> starting<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.540> first<00:01:39.720> team

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
right so starting with the first team

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.080 
right so starting with the first team
offense<00:01:40.250> obviously<00:01:41.250> everyone<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.820> really

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
offense obviously everyone was really

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.929 
offense obviously everyone was really
hyped<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.930> paid<00:01:43.170> mins<00:01:43.439> debut<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
hyped up to see paid mins debut and I

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.249 
hyped up to see paid mins debut and I
thought<00:01:45.180> he<00:01:45.329> looked<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.020> thought

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
thought he looked really good I thought

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.260 
thought he looked really good I thought
our<00:01:46.530> first<00:01:47.159> team<00:01:47.310> offense<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> whole<00:01:48.060> really

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
our first team offense as a whole really

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.330 
our first team offense as a whole really
played<00:01:48.600> well<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.560> thought<00:01:49.710> Peyton<00:01:50.070> Manning

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
played well and I thought Peyton Manning

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.859 
played well and I thought Peyton Manning
had<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.790> performance<00:01:51.390> yes<00:01:51.689> he

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
had a pretty good performance yes he

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.450 
had a pretty good performance yes he
looked<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.170> bit<00:01:52.200> rusty<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.430> be

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
looked a bit rusty but that is to be

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.910 
looked a bit rusty but that is to be
expected<00:01:53.549> with<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> layoff<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.560> he<00:01:55.740> has

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
expected with the the layoff that he has

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.649 
expected with the the layoff that he has
had<00:01:56.130> from<00:01:56.399> actually<00:01:56.820> playing<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.270> live-action

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
had from actually playing a live-action

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.840 
had from actually playing a live-action
football<00:01:58.170> game<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.770> wasn't<00:01:59.189> too<00:01:59.340> shocked<00:01:59.700> at

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
football game so I wasn't too shocked at

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.670 
football game so I wasn't too shocked at
all<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.090> he<00:02:00.240> did<00:02:00.420> look<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.899> little<00:02:01.079> rusty

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
all that he did look a little rusty

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.340 
all that he did look a little rusty
Manning<00:02:02.250> ended<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.579> finishing<00:02:02.759> going<00:02:03.210> 47<00:02:03.780> for

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
Manning ended up finishing going 47 for

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.660 
Manning ended up finishing going 47 for
44<00:02:04.799> yards<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.189> he<00:02:05.250> threw<00:02:05.460> an<00:02:05.549> interception

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
44 yards and he threw an interception

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
44 yards and he threw an interception
which<00:02:06.240> was<00:02:06.420> often<00:02:06.719> tipped<00:02:06.990> pass<00:02:07.259> little

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
which was often tipped pass little

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.260 
which was often tipped pass little

underthrown pass by painting with
Brandon<00:02:09.569> Stokley<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:10.140> nothing<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.739> was

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
Brandon Stokley but nothing that was

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.309 
Brandon Stokley but nothing that was
too<00:02:11.150> big<00:02:11.330> of<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.480> deal<00:02:11.629> but<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:12.050> thought<00:02:12.260> I

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
too big of a deal but I thought I

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.750 
too big of a deal but I thought I
thought<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.680> office<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.190> looked<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.550> lot

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
thought the office just looked a lot

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.520 
thought the office just looked a lot
more<00:02:13.819> fluid<00:02:14.540> than<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.780> has<00:02:14.930> over<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.260> past

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
more fluid than it has over the past

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.809 
more fluid than it has over the past
couple<00:02:15.739> seasons<00:02:15.920> which<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.459> great<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.790> see

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
couple seasons which was great to see

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.360 
couple seasons which was great to see
and<00:02:17.120> even<00:02:17.540> saw<00:02:17.780> paid<00:02:18.050> me<00:02:18.230> making<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.800> couple

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
and even saw paid me making a couple

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.309 
and even saw paid me making a couple
pre-snap<00:02:19.910> audibles<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.930> pre-snap

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
pre-snap audibles and pre-snap

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.290 
pre-snap audibles and pre-snap
adjustments<00:02:22.099> which<00:02:22.280> again<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:23.180> be

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
adjustments which again is to be

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.059 
adjustments which again is to be
expected<00:02:23.510> with<00:02:23.810> Peyton<00:02:24.140> Manning<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:24.800> being

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
expected with Peyton Manning now being

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.470 
expected with Peyton Manning now being
our<00:02:25.190> quarterback<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.209> that's<00:02:26.330> obviously

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
our quarterback and that's obviously

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.089 
our quarterback and that's obviously
something<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.260> expect<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.650> see<00:02:27.830> more<00:02:28.040> of

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
something that I expect to see more of

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.949 
something that I expect to see more of
hopefully<00:02:28.849> over<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.120> next<00:02:29.209> three<00:02:29.599> preseason

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
hopefully over the next three preseason

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.660 
hopefully over the next three preseason
games<00:02:30.319> then<00:02:30.560> obviously<00:02:30.739> into<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> regular

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
games then obviously into the regular

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.820 
games then obviously into the regular
season<00:02:31.849> if<00:02:32.720> I've<00:02:32.900> paid<00:02:33.110> out<00:02:33.290> some<00:02:33.470> really<00:02:33.650> nice

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
season if I've paid out some really nice

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.559 
season if I've paid out some really nice
throws<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.459> game<00:02:34.640> especially<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.330> Eric

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
throws in this game especially the Eric

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.600 
throws in this game especially the Eric
Decker<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:35.989> had<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.200> one<00:02:36.410> throw<00:02:36.739> on<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.430> out

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
Decker you had that one throw on the out

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.430 
Decker you had that one throw on the out
route<00:02:37.910> for<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.239> first<00:02:38.480> rent<00:02:38.780> of<00:02:38.900> first<00:02:39.110> down<00:02:39.290> to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
route for a first rent of first down to

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.750 
route for a first rent of first down to
Eric<00:02:39.620> Decker<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.920> thought<00:02:40.129> that<00:02:40.310> was<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:40.519> big

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
Eric Decker I thought that was a big

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.729 
Eric Decker I thought that was a big
pass<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.209> kind<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.480> showed<00:02:41.720> off<00:02:41.900> pains<00:02:42.260> arm

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
pass I kind of showed off pains arm

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.130 
pass I kind of showed off pains arm
strength<00:02:43.069> and<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.459> shows<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.880> his<00:02:44.060> his<00:02:44.239> he's

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
strength and it shows that his his he's

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.900 
strength and it shows that his his he's
making<00:02:45.799> progress<00:02:46.099> and<00:02:46.400> that<00:02:46.549> he's<00:02:46.730> almost

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
making progress and that he's almost

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.370 
making progress and that he's almost
backed<00:02:47.269> on<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.569> percent<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.900> thought<00:02:48.049> that<00:02:48.200> was<00:02:48.290> a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
backed on a percent I thought that was a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.470 
backed on a percent I thought that was a
big<00:02:48.620> confidence<00:02:49.280> builder<00:02:49.640> that<00:02:49.910> throw<00:02:50.239> that

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
big confidence builder that throw that

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.479 
big confidence builder that throw that
paid<00:02:51.110> Manning<00:02:51.470> had<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:51.980> out<00:02:52.069> route<00:02:52.280> to

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
paid Manning had on the out route to

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:53.890 
paid Manning had on the out route to
Eric<00:02:52.670> Decker<00:02:52.849> and<00:02:53.269> then<00:02:53.390> he<00:02:53.450> also<00:02:53.599> had<00:02:53.780> another

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
Eric Decker and then he also had another

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.869

the offense in general was really

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.180 
the offense in general was really
refreshing<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.810> see<00:03:26.840> for<00:03:27.560> me<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.799> Broncos

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190

fan<00:03:28.220> because<00:03:28.430> that<00:03:28.609> something<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:28.940> we

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
fan because that something that we

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.490 
fan because that something that we
really<00:03:29.120> haven't<00:03:29.599> had<00:03:29.690> from<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.079> quarterback

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500

position<00:03:30.579> in<00:03:31.579> quite<00:03:31.849> some<00:03:32.060> time<00:03:32.090> especially

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
position in quite some time especially

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.629 
position in quite some time especially

the team in general I thought the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.289 
the team in general I thought the
offensive<00:04:12.980> line<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.489> defensive<00:04:13.910> line<00:04:14.090> all
