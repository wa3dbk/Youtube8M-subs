hey<00:00:01.290> everyone<00:00:01.920> I<00:00:02.070> was<00:00:02.460> at<00:00:02.580> Target<00:00:02.850> last<00:00:03.330> week

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
hey everyone I was at Target last week

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey everyone I was at Target last week
and<00:00:03.840> they<00:00:04.440> have<00:00:04.470> these<00:00:05.180> mystery<00:00:06.180> boxes<00:00:06.240> of

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
and they have these mystery boxes of

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.600 
and they have these mystery boxes of
cards<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.649> think<00:00:07.859> it's<00:00:08.099> when<00:00:08.250> they<00:00:08.370> take<00:00:08.580> a

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
cards I think it's when they take a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.520 
cards I think it's when they take a
whole<00:00:08.820> bunch<00:00:08.940> of<00:00:09.090> stupid<00:00:09.300> cards<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.929> hide

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
whole bunch of stupid cards and hide

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.200
