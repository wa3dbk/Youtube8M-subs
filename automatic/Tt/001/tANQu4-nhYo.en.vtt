department today we're going to focus
our<00:00:07.200> attention<00:00:07.290> on<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:08.220> water<00:00:08.429> cycle<00:00:08.719> now<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
our attention on the water cycle now the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.930 
our attention on the water cycle now the
water<00:00:10.019> cycle<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.500> a<00:00:10.530> cyclic<00:00:10.980> event<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.460> an

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
water cycle is a cyclic event it's an

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.339 
water cycle is a cyclic event it's an
event<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.240> happens<00:00:12.540> over<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:12.990> over<00:00:13.110> and

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
event that happens over and over and

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.440 
event that happens over and over and
over<00:00:13.440> again<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.400> some<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.730> processes<00:00:15.299> are

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
over again and some of the processes are

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.750 
over again and some of the processes are
very<00:00:15.690> easy<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.199> identify<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:17.310> by<00:00:17.430> looking

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
very easy to identify just by looking

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.040 
very easy to identify just by looking
outside<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.390> terms<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.930> atmosphere

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
outside in terms of what the atmosphere

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.439 
outside in terms of what the atmosphere
is<00:00:19.500> doing<00:00:19.859> now<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> energy<00:00:21.119> from<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.330> water

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
is doing now the energy from the water

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
is doing now the energy from the water
cycle<00:00:21.689> basically<00:00:22.109> comes<00:00:22.289> from<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.529> Sun<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
cycle basically comes from the Sun the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.400 
cycle basically comes from the Sun the
Sun<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.609> going<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.910> heat<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.810> majority<00:00:25.350> of

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
Sun is going to heat up the majority of

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.050 
Sun is going to heat up the majority of
the<00:00:25.500> water<00:00:25.619> on<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> planet<00:00:26.250> which<00:00:26.699> we<00:00:26.880> can

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the water on the planet which we can

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.759 
the water on the planet which we can
find<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.420> our<00:00:27.510> oceans<00:00:27.930> which<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.590> going<00:00:28.710> to

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
find in our oceans which is going to

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.209 
find in our oceans which is going to
kick<00:00:28.920> off<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.340> process<00:00:30.269> called<00:00:30.420> evaporation

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
kick off a process called evaporation

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.200 
kick off a process called evaporation
now<00:00:32.219> believe<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.550> or<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
now believe it or not out of all the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.790 
now believe it or not out of all the
water<00:00:33.360> that's<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.930> planet<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.620> can

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
water that's on the planet we can

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.860 
water that's on the planet we can
actually<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.160> less<00:00:35.340> than<00:00:35.370> 1%<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> here<00:00:36.750> on

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
actually use less than 1% of it here on

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.139 
actually use less than 1% of it here on
the<00:00:36.989> planet<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.469> human<00:00:37.500> consumption<00:00:38.149> let's

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the planet for human consumption let's

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.670 
the planet for human consumption let's
jump<00:00:39.300> into<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> water<00:00:39.809> cycle<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.469> all

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
jump into the water cycle and see all

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.530 
jump into the water cycle and see all
the<00:00:41.040> different<00:00:41.160> processes<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.000> go<00:00:42.149> into<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the different processes that go into it

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.930 
the different processes that go into it
the<00:00:43.050> first<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.500> evaporation<00:00:44.040> that's

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
the first one is evaporation that's

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
the first one is evaporation that's
basically<00:00:45.239> when<00:00:45.420> liquid<00:00:45.600> water<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.530> ocean

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
basically when liquid water from ocean

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.279 
basically when liquid water from ocean
streams<00:00:47.340> lakes<00:00:47.850> k<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.020> turn<00:00:49.170> into

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
streams lakes k are going to turn into

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.330 
streams lakes k are going to turn into
gas<00:00:49.559> that's<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.550> call<00:00:50.730> water<00:00:50.910> vapour

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
gas that's what we call water vapour

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.459 
gas that's what we call water vapour
well<00:00:53.370> liquid<00:00:53.820> water<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.750> change<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> gas

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
well liquid water can change to gas

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.380 
well liquid water can change to gas
through<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> process<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.699> plants<00:00:57.059> giving<00:00:57.210> off

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
through the process of plants giving off

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.069 
through the process of plants giving off
water<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:58.109> what<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.289> call<00:00:58.440> transpiration

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
water that's what we call transpiration

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
water that's what we call transpiration
together<00:01:01.460> transpiration<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.579> evaporation

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
together transpiration and evaporation

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
together transpiration and evaporation
has<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> fancy<00:01:04.710> name<00:01:04.860> called

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
has a fancy name called

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.609 
has a fancy name called
evapotranspiration<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.750> that's<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> way

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
evapotranspiration and that's just a way

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.200 
evapotranspiration and that's just a way
that<00:01:07.650> scientists<00:01:08.220> explain<00:01:08.490> how<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.880> water

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that scientists explain how all water

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.070 
that scientists explain how all water
changed<00:01:09.810> from<00:01:09.930> liquid<00:01:10.290> water<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.979> gas

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
changed from liquid water to gas

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.940 
changed from liquid water to gas
eventually<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.200> water<00:01:13.350> vapor<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
eventually that water vapor is going to

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.499 
eventually that water vapor is going to
rise<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.490> cool<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.820> dew<00:01:15.060> point<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
rise and cool to the dew point in the

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.060 
rise and cool to the dew point in the
upper<00:01:15.600> troposphere<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
upper troposphere and you're going to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
upper troposphere and you're going to
get<00:01:17.189> condensation<00:01:17.610> that's<00:01:18.119> when<00:01:18.299> water<00:01:18.540> vapor

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
get condensation that's when water vapor

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.480 
get condensation that's when water vapor
is<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> change<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> liquid<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.340> that's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
is going to change the liquid and that's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.270 
is going to change the liquid and that's
basically<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> formation<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> our<00:01:21.540> clouds

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
basically the formation of our clouds

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
basically the formation of our clouds
get<00:01:23.280> enough<00:01:23.430> condensation<00:01:24.119> you'll<00:01:24.600> end<00:01:24.780> up

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
get enough condensation you'll end up

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.600 
get enough condensation you'll end up
getting<00:01:25.020> precipitation<00:01:25.860> that's<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.430> liquid

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
getting precipitation that's when liquid

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
getting precipitation that's when liquid
or<00:01:26.850> frozen<00:01:27.060> water<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.509> going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> fall<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
or frozen water is going to fall to the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.280 
or frozen water is going to fall to the
surface<00:01:29.540> once<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.689> water<00:01:30.810> falls<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
surface once that water falls the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
surface once that water falls the
surface<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.100> one<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.430> two<00:01:32.579> things

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
surface it can do one of two things

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.600 
surface it can do one of two things
it<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.930> even<00:01:34.049> either<00:01:34.350> infiltrate<00:01:35.100> which

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it can even either infiltrate which

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.890 
it can even either infiltrate which
means<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> sink<00:01:36.420> into<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.780> earth

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
means it's going to sink into the earth

means it's going to sink into the earth
or<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:38.189> water<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> travel<00:01:39.000> as

or that water is going to travel as

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.920 
or that water is going to travel as

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
runoff can travel along the surface now

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
runoff can travel along the surface now

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.589 
allow water to pass through and in many
cases<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.879> can<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:21.390> little

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
cases you can have very little

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.479 
cases you can have very little
vegetation<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.069> actually<00:02:23.220> have

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
vegetation and you can actually have

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.000 
vegetation and you can actually have
very<00:02:23.550> dry<00:02:24.239> land<00:02:24.629> almost<00:02:25.019> like<00:02:25.440> Death<00:02:25.980> Valley

very dry land almost like Death Valley
in<00:02:26.879> which<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> land<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.690> dry<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.260> actually

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
in which the land is so dry it actually

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.289 
in which the land is so dry it actually
becomes<00:02:28.739> baked<00:02:29.129> and<00:02:29.640> will<00:02:29.730> not<00:02:29.849> allow<00:02:30.030> water

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
becomes baked and will not allow water

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.449 
becomes baked and will not allow water
to<00:02:30.420> go<00:02:30.629> into<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.709> even<00:02:31.950> throw<00:02:32.160> into

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
to go into it you can even throw into

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.800 
to go into it you can even throw into
the<00:02:32.549> category<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.090> runoff

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
the category of runoff

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.170 
the category of runoff
neither<00:02:34.319> also<00:02:35.129> throw<00:02:35.310> into<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.670> area<00:02:36.000> of

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
neither also throw into the area of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.740 
neither also throw into the area of
concrete<00:02:37.080> asphalt<00:02:37.819> blacktop<00:02:38.819> any<00:02:39.299> can<00:02:39.510> be

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
concrete asphalt blacktop any can be

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.720 
concrete asphalt blacktop any can be
impermeable<00:02:40.349> will<00:02:40.680> not<00:02:40.860> allow<00:02:41.099> water<00:02:41.340> to<00:02:41.610> go

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
impermeable will not allow water to go

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.369 
impermeable will not allow water to go
into<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.629> what's<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:42.930> happen<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.290> that

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
into so what's going to happen is that

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.530 
into so what's going to happen is that
water<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.650> going<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.799> act<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.190> runoff<00:02:44.540> so

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
water is going to act as runoff so

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.670 
water is going to act as runoff so
that's<00:02:45.720> basically<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> water<00:02:46.410> cycle

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that's basically the water cycle

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.050 
that's basically the water cycle
definitely<00:02:47.370> not<00:02:47.519> need<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.910> know<00:02:47.940> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
definitely not need to know the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.860 
definitely not need to know the
difference

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
difference

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.410 
difference
differences<00:02:49.799> in<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.430> characteristics<00:02:50.880> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
differences in the characteristics and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.670 
differences in the characteristics and
the<00:02:51.630> differences<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> different

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the differences in the different

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.009 
the differences in the different
processes<00:02:53.160> so<00:02:53.910> with<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.150> being<00:02:54.329> said<00:02:54.420> thank
