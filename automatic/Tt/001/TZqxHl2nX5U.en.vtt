00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.040 
next to that a nice darkest I'll put
next<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.020> that<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.800> on<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:49.180> passed<00:03:49.600> now

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
next to that and so on and I passed now

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.710 
next to that and so on and I passed now
these<00:03:50.380> are<00:03:50.590> really<00:03:51.220> easy<00:03:51.370> if<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.270> go<00:03:52.450> back

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
these are really easy if you go back

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.740 
these are really easy if you go back
there's<00:03:53.230> hard<00:03:53.830> which<00:03:54.490> is<00:03:54.640> really<00:03:54.880> hard<00:03:55.120> you

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
there's hard which is really hard you

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.330 
there's hard which is really hard you
have<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.960> go<00:03:56.050> through<00:03:56.230> all<00:03:56.290> these<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:57.160> then

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
have to go through all these and then

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.430 
have to go through all these and then
there's<00:03:57.520> even<00:03:57.610> harder<00:03:58.270> if<00:03:58.300> you<00:03:58.480> want<00:03:58.780> called

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440

recommended<00:04:02.680> because<00:04:02.830> how<00:04:03.190> small<00:04:03.850> they<00:04:04.060> get

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
recommended because how small they get

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.570 
recommended because how small they get
because<00:04:04.840> there's<00:04:05.410> so<00:04:05.560> much<00:04:05.710> going<00:04:05.920> on<00:04:06.130> by<00:04:06.520> the

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
because there's so much going on by the

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.190 
because there's so much going on by the
game<00:04:06.880> itself<00:04:07.150> is<00:04:07.330> addicting<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:07.990> like<00:04:08.170> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
game itself is addicting and I like the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.530 
game itself is addicting and I like the
menu<00:04:08.590> how<00:04:08.770> just<00:04:09.040> drops<00:04:09.340> like<00:04:09.460> that<00:04:09.850> and<00:04:10.090> go

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
menu how just drops like that and go

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.500

this<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.440> also<00:04:14.650> a<00:04:14.830> game<00:04:15.100> which<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.760> kind<00:04:16.060> of

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
this is also a game which is kind of

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.030 
this is also a game which is kind of
like<00:04:16.270> speedx<00:04:16.840> 3d<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.530> one<00:04:17.650> that<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:17.890> just

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
like speedx 3d the one that I just

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.159 
like speedx 3d the one that I just
showed<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.340> guys<00:04:18.520> but<00:04:19.419> it's<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.660> similar<00:04:20.020> idea

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
showed you guys but it's a similar idea

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:22.400 
showed you guys but it's a similar idea
to<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.250> start<00:04:21.549> out<00:04:21.669> here

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
they look like buildings these things

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.480 
they look like buildings these things
are<00:04:24.840> here<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.560> try<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.830> go<00:04:26.040> through<00:04:26.250> them

are here and you try to go through them
if<00:04:26.760> you<00:04:27.150> go<00:04:27.270> next<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.660> building<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.110> get<00:04:28.380> a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
if you go next to a building you get a

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.790 
if you go next to a building you get a
near<00:04:28.710> miss<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.310> that<00:04:30.230> multiplies<00:04:31.230> your<00:04:31.260> score

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
score higher now you see these little

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.970 
score higher now you see these little
floating<00:04:35.940> blocks<00:04:36.390> flying<00:04:37.200> around<00:04:37.500> you<00:04:37.800> can

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
floating blocks flying around you can

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.640 
floating blocks flying around you can
take<00:04:38.190> those<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:38.790> get<00:04:39.300> power-ups<00:04:39.720> like

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
take those and get power-ups like

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.070 
take those and get power-ups like
invincibility<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.760> stuff<00:04:42.360> like<00:04:42.570> that<00:04:42.630> which

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
invincibility and stuff like that which

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.900 
invincibility and stuff like that which
basically<00:04:43.440> if<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.680> had<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.800> building<00:04:44.310> you

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
won't die you'll just keep going and

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.310 
won't die you'll just keep going and
