00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.309
 okay it was a very race 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.900
 special and I'm ready to continue 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.900
 it's my passion no it's clear 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.080
 there are big names in the rally raid that 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.509
 is that they were able to win in motorcycle and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.489
 self am I able 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.489
 will I be able to see it 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:36.039
 why pure it's not very difficult to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.020
 answers the payers' philosophy 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.760
 it was all the time through her every 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.860
 many times he did some 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.340
 thing on the level of motorsport he has it 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.190
 done at a very high level with the same 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.970
 philosophy that I have in my career 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.460
 do the best of passion and 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.820
 try to do everything to win 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.570
 racing 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.880
 so that's not difficult to take 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.520
 actually decide a question that 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.920
 will come back often that's why 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.649
 after fifteen years of motorcycle riding at the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.710
 car that was the moment he did not 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.450
 have been wanting for some time and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.479
 is a dream that materializes in a 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.799
 team like peugeot game to learn and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.979
 try to progress to get to 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.200
 to get to that and that's healthy it's 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.990
 motivating we clearly succeeded 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.399
 our shot at pikes peak by mixing a 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.560
 exceptional driver 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.389
 a remarkable technical team a 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.159
 car at the best level we 

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:38.229
 let's go back to the daaka with ambitions 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.630

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.610
 talents and all skills 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.010
 so we are really happy to 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.990
 engaged there with his two partners 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.070
 red bull is total before anything else 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.890
 which we are very proud of 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.020
 to have two huge talents like 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.030
 carlos sainz and Cyril desprÃ©s in 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.400
 the team of very complementary profiles 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.190
 carlos on one side who has a track record 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.830
 incredible and who has this reputation for 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.620
 good car maker and the other 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.230
 car world 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.000
 I am sure that the transfer of knowledge 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.410
 on the steering of 4 or will be done very 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.910
 very quickly for cyril who will take very 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.100
 quickly who will quickly be competitive 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.340
 to be sitting in the middle of two deaths of 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.170
 car it's probably from there that comes 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.360
 my passion for the desert is without 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.180
 doubt that comes my passion for the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.090
 dakar of these images of wide open spaces 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.310
 when I was still a young teenager 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.190
 in the Paris region and it's a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.580
 indescribable sensation in fact of 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.620
 find here in the middle two of his two 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.330
 cars that call back so many 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.420
 memories and very soon climb into 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.720
 one of his peugeot enough it'll be a 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.720
 great moment 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.510
 if you doubt that pierce and a lot of 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:25.180
 sanex and the drummer who are behind 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:29.150

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:34.940
 summers and pressing presented in the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.830
 competition at the wrc level 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.820
 even happy today 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.520
 these engines to rally current us 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.740
 are ready skin to catch a 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.140
 new challenge 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.340
 we absolutely have a team 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.470
 extraordinary 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.590
 a skewer of talent absolutely 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.000
 incredible who goes who will boost the team 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.210
 you have to work professionally 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.740
 very very hard especially for youri for 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.700
 win the sai and become the actors 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.190
 worlds so lot of teams with 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.470
 lots of experience 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.020
 it's going to be not easy I trust 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.950
 in the team is very very motivated a 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:21.709
 exciting case in the car really 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.730
 pretty with a very motivating sponsors 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.860
 like red bull 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.870
 I have been able to feel for many 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.880
 years ago when we were French 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.260
 it's something it's an event 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.130
 it's a competition that touched us 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:37.430
 and we manage to surpass I think the 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.650
 Peugeot return with a team 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:45.530
 French and good drivers 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.260
 I think it's going to make some noise 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.580
 even though this competition is 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.550
 particularly demanding 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.370
 there are very experienced competitors 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.570
 and oh how competent we are going 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.370
 not to do figuration and 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.900
 clearly 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.560
 we aim and the first participation 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.560
 victory
