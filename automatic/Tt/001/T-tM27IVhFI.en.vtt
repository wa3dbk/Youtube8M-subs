00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
for a little while I'm sick of being

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.250 
for a little while I'm sick of being
inside<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.180> I'm<00:00:57.329> sick<00:00:57.539> of<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.719> using<00:00:57.960> any

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
inside and I'm sick of not using any

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.670 
inside and I'm sick of not using any
knives<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:59.160> any<00:00:59.730> real<00:01:00.000> work<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.590> figured<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
knives for any real work so figured I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.670 
knives for any real work so figured I
would<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:02.039> like<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.280> steak<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.500> see<00:01:04.500> what

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
would just get like a steak and see what

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.500 
would just get like a steak and see what
it<00:01:04.799> took<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> cut<00:01:05.250> through<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> see<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
it took to cut through it see if it

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.859 
it took to cut through it see if it
could<00:01:06.659> cut<00:01:06.900> through<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.310> then<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.850> guess<00:01:09.720> I'll

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
could cut through it then I guess I'll

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.460 
could cut through it then I guess I'll
bet<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.110> ahead<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:12.320> you<00:01:13.320> don't

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
bet go ahead and get to it you don't

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
bet go ahead and get to it you don't
really<00:01:14.040> see<00:01:14.460> people<00:01:14.490> using<00:01:17.210> Stratton<00:01:18.210> eyes

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
really see people using Stratton eyes

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.360

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
get through with that so let's test the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.689 
get through with that so let's test the
edge<00:04:59.780> see<00:05:00.500> what<00:05:00.650> it'll<00:05:00.800> do<00:05:02.319> still<00:05:03.400> still<00:05:04.400> very

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
edge see what it'll do still still very

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:12.550 
edge see what it'll do still still very
sharp<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:06.699> he<00:05:07.699> has<00:05:07.880> abandoned<00:05:11.169> still<00:05:12.169> really

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560
