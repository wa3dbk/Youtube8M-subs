00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
uh I didn't know at this point that I

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.950 
uh I didn't know at this point that I
should<00:01:17.060> probably<00:01:17.299> move<00:01:17.540> somewhere<00:01:17.900> else

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
should probably move somewhere else

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.140

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
around the bomb plant side so I'm trying

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.450 
around the bomb plant side so I'm trying
to<00:01:20.240> turn<00:01:20.570> into<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.900> fucking<00:01:21.310> contortionist<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
to turn into a fucking contortionist and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.789 
to turn into a fucking contortionist and
fit<00:01:22.700> into<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:22.970> small<00:01:23.330> bomb<00:01:23.810> briefcase<00:01:24.560> so

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
fit into that small bomb briefcase so

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.990 
fit into that small bomb briefcase so
that<00:01:24.950> way<00:01:25.070> no<00:01:25.189> one<00:01:25.220> would<00:01:25.430> see<00:01:25.700> me

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
that way no one would see me

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.820 
that way no one would see me
but<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:26.689> really<00:01:26.869> not<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.140> best<00:01:27.320> way<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.650> do

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
but it's really not the best way to do

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.929 
but it's really not the best way to do
that<00:01:27.979> that's<00:01:28.100> why<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.280> really<00:01:28.460> got<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:28.729> change

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
that that's why you really got to change

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.990 
that that's why you really got to change
positions<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:29.509> armed<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:29.869> here<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.350> then<00:01:31.100> some

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
positions I armed it here and then some

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.069 
positions I armed it here and then some
fucking<00:01:32.890> legend<00:01:33.890> finds<00:01:34.250> me<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.729> he<00:01:35.570> shoots<00:01:35.840> me

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
fucking legend finds me and he shoots me

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.609 
fucking legend finds me and he shoots me
and<00:01:36.320> that's<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:38.329> is<00:01:38.689> also<00:01:39.079> a

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
and that's it this is also a

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.700 
and that's it this is also a
one-and-done<00:01:40.189> scenario<00:01:40.939> I<00:01:41.000> armed<00:01:41.299> it<00:01:41.450> once

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
one-and-done scenario I armed it once

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.990

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
gets the fuse and armed it one more time

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.620 
gets the fuse and armed it one more time
and<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:45.650> actually<00:01:45.799> gets<00:01:46.220> destroyed<00:01:46.790> now<00:01:47.450> here

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
and it actually gets destroyed now here

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.450

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.289 
dead in a desperate attempt to stay
alive<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.310> actually<00:01:52.490> worked<00:01:52.970> because

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
alive and it actually worked because

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.480 
alive and it actually worked because
this<00:01:53.600> Dookie<00:01:54.049> sniffer<00:01:54.560> didn't<00:01:54.860> realize<00:01:55.220> that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
this Dookie sniffer didn't realize that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.190 
this Dookie sniffer didn't realize that
I<00:01:55.549> didn't<00:01:56.180> actually<00:01:56.329> die<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.689> guess<00:01:56.930> he<00:01:57.020> thought

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
I didn't actually die I guess he thought

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.130 
I didn't actually die I guess he thought
he<00:01:57.320> got<00:01:57.350> an<00:01:57.590> assist<00:01:58.009> but<00:01:58.970> uh<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.899> fine

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
he got an assist but uh it's fine

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.530 
he got an assist but uh it's fine
because<00:02:00.560> I<00:02:00.740> survived<00:02:01.430> that's<00:02:02.149> really<00:02:02.420> all

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
because I survived that's really all

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.039 
because I survived that's really all
that<00:02:02.570> matters

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
that matters

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.620
