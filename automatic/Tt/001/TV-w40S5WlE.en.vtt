00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.570
 next you need one 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.570
 commercially available at an angle from the front 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.980
 since I own the machine , however 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.960
 with which I bender the diagonally 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.859
 I can go sculpting automatically 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.170
 Let's go now and become the next 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.529
 The gate machine belongs as start 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.130
 So that the band in the oblique band forma 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.130
 threading 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.560
 as an aid I use here simply 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.680
 a needle but you also like 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.090
 Taking a pair of tweezers was what else you did 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.590
 yet all object just as you so 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:57.100
 now comes the first piece already 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.830
 out now it is important the whole 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:05.080
 revolution 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:09.100
 this is just the way it needs to be 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.700
 be as good in it as the side it is 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 comes at the end of a misfolded 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 obliquely band out 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:25.300
 one-handed something that should be so difficult 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:34.830
 whole then look and now off with the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:39.630
 Iron on it then iron 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.630
 with 2 behind it is much better 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:49.979
 when our connection comes 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:55.149
 you have to pay attention that the corner 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.440
 good with informer comes and then that is 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.440
 rest no problem 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.260
 with you is also like that with the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.670
 Machine works this machine 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:50.049
 I've just started heating now 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:52.450
 her underneath a plate on the not 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:57.670
 get up is going very fast 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.280
 Hot next we take ours here 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.590
 School out develop our bias band 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.500
 on it and now from behind for it 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:17.709
 I have the end in this brace 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:19.409
 Just let the tip in 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.720
 the role disappear 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.090
 Now I wanted to get on with it all 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.120
 little tension 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.370
 the machine is now ready to go 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.799
 green light is on here 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.220
 a few more things like me 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.919
 can 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.870
 this is the start button on it is called off 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:44.859
 at the time , the roller transports 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.780
 the far is here in front of the part then 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.729
 there is still the possibility heat 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.859
 I realize that already nice 

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:55.750
 I 'm very hot on cotton 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:57.879
 Do not put cotton linen yet 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.260
 completely on max if you but a fabric 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.519
 you really are not feeling well 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.139
 you always have to iron the 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.359
 temperature to match the fabric exactly how 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.040
 but you could as well at the temple old 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.959
 you still regulate a bit 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.120
 either lower or stronger of the 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.299
 temperature and this is the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.690
 speed which is now in the 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:20.919
 wait for a moment 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.080
 that would be home now, but we want it 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.669
 slow easy 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.539
 Now I have the role here 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.360
 used 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.039
 the diagonal band runs i have with 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.169
 this rubber still the possibility that 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:35.650
 to set it up a bit 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.770
 really just too transported 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.770
 becomes 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:50.370
 and this part is now turned and 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.580
 comes in here pushed zack it is 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.580
 in it 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.910
 all once again I turn have 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.600
 can also stop the profi times 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.600
 happen 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.060
 the most important thing now is that of course 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.820
 we put the roller on because without 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.380
 We can do that without the pressure 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.850
 not iron an iron for a whole year 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.500
 is the pressure of us and need here 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.950
 we put the world back in it 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.460
 see four points 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:33.120
 ok, now I'm controlling my 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.630
 the band is running straight 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.080
 is good and it is easy in here 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.080
 so i would say 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.590
 always have to be careful that it is here 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.810
 free 6 can be pushed away 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.300
 otherwise you would not wake up and know 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.470
 you are still warm in the end we get 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.880
 then the folding cleaning procedures 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.880
 want to have donations in it 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:10.900
 then a sleep is constant 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:12.250
 The whole just have to go 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.470
 you really control that 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.760
 demonstrated 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.380
 when the heat and the 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.919
 speed are aware or you 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.110
 Here for the 3 5 then tried that 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.370
 all of course not be ironed 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.990
 want to finish building 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:33.729
 Nevertheless , you can see it very much 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:36.900
 Collections trainspotting and who now 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:36.900
 wings very well 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:47.439
 finished so there we have ours 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.460
 step belt let's go then we can 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.460
 so so what take a
