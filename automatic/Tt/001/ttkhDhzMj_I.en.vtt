00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.080
 value production so he commented I do not know 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.350
 if I do not know if we have time to live is the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.190
 scenario to make it clearer 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.930
 lights the stage the music everything is 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.910

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.180
 here fast of the chair yes yes me 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.630

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.090
 left side and here some guys and 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:21.239
 They are waiting to go out modeling 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.340
 let's see the main stage 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.150
 all this has been mounted in full 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.180
 heart of gamarra a giant screen 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.690
 and that points 30 now goes to more 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.760
 2010 fashion in staying with this 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.709
 Guinness record as I had already 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.239
 mentioned Miami has the record in 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.200
 these moments with 24 hours of parade 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.239
 uninterrupted and hopefully we 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.430
 we stay with this record that goes to 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.430
 be very important for our country 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:01.950
 we have to say that what are the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.379
 requirements suddenly because we have to 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.110
 have a fashion show that is the satyr 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:10.800
 typical with an audience that they eat 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:14.580
 I live in the model of all types with 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:20.040
 is different designers have something more 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.470
 of 24 hours because now for the 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.720
 initiation is done so you can 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.720
 track and incidentally improve
