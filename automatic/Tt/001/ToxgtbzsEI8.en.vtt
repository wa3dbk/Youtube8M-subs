00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.389
 hello to all I started to present 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.389
 and quite improbable victory their life 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.710
 it's true that it's the fifth 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.640
 are quite happy with the result it's 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.530
 especially since there are many more 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.380
 show and necessarily the first 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.220
 editions the festival is only 5 years old so 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.260
 it's a young festival 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.880
 so we are we are all the happier 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.430
 that this gives a good perspective 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.680
 for the sequel and here we continue in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.239
 anyway we hope it should have to do 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.540
 even more shows for them 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.540
 years to come 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.370
 the vision is very simple it's everything 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.860
 this is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.390
 perennial for the coming years and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.489
 rhymes in any case make laugh after 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.329
 only goal to follow is to make a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.329
 maximum of world 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.130
 my show and everything is 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.240
 autobiographical I'm talking about a young 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.640
 girl who goes to conquer the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 pride of his father and that's a little my 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.420
 story my father did not accept me at 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.130
 early I become dancers and then 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.080
 actress and I wanted absolutely 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.730
 succeed and who come to applaud and 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.730
 it's a bit like that 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.550
 quiet little loafers without 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.230
 socks 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.160
 to be good in his shoes 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.430
 it's important violence and 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.430
 shoes 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.549
 no it's complicated I like the idea 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.619
 that a character who knows what 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.789
 mean but who has trouble saying it and 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.789
 I find it interesting what
