00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone we find ourselves for 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.820
 a small mountain bike video on the sequence 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:13.530
 I teach you to cabrières so already 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.940
 to frame for being not suspended 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.949
 just a goal but for me a real 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
 suspense before otherwise I tell you not the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.970
 blow that take took them outright 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.380
 missed because you're going to see that's going 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.000
 to be a lot so what are we going to do 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's the email that I do not put in 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.530
 cause like that the pedal m that could 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.559
 make 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:42.000
 alert to the masters of the big shots of 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 pedal like that after having it with 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.480
 the handlebars especially not pull up 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.920
 do not shoot up 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 because actually conscious but because 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.620
 she intends to continue backwards 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:03.840
 like that so it's the trade space 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
 that they know have done them a lot for 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.250
 some obstacles like my father said 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.490
 that she is it's good it's always 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:17.880
 bad tax the front now you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.530
 get into bank only beauty of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.130
 lenses mounir the back are said to 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.130
 good scratch will stop 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.820
 the effect will be on the stage goes up to 12 pm 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.810
 jazz the messenger at the beginning my best 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.930
 party after family speed we can 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:51.229
 like that there you see when you stop there 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:55.380
 believe that if we hear too long 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:03.560
 but that should pass normally have 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.560
 been filmed here is yabré 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:24.510
 so here's setting is needed 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:26.459
 habré and for the coast is well framed 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.590
 have already started well for us 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.850
 can win like that so now 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.850
 so here I would like a little demo 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:04.000
 video on a month of training hi
