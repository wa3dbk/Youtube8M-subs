fooled many people or at least you think
you<00:00:32.070> have<00:00:32.369> cuz<00:00:32.610> there's<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.820> catch<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.420> if

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you have cuz there's a catch so if

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.790 
you have cuz there's a catch so if
you're<00:00:33.660> gonna<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.960> faking<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.469> til<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.770> make

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
it
again<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.700> means<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.030> play<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.630> are

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.060 
again that means the play is if you are
great<00:00:37.110> even<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.559> don't<00:00:37.710> really<00:00:37.829> feel

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
great even if you don't really feel

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.470 
great even if you don't really feel
greater<00:00:38.399> if<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:38.969> you're<00:00:39.120> not<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
greater if you know that you're not so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.209 
greater if you know that you're not so
great<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.899> kind<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.260> does<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.890> great

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
great it kind of does have to be great

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.440 
great it kind of does have to be great
because<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> mean<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> last<00:00:41.879> thing<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.239> want

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
really sound like crap look confidence
is<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> state<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> feeling<00:00:47.219> certain<00:00:47.820> about

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
is the state of feeling certain about
