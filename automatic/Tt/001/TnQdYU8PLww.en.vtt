 the sg dynamo dresden against the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.170
 Spielvereinigung Unterhaching 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.500
 the game ended with the highest 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.030
 season win for the 51st 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.470

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.000
 Chef trainer Peter Nemeth and Claus 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.100
 scrape from the game association and 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.690
 in it the first word belongs in the guest like 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.040
 their conclusion after the defeat in 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.430
 first of all congratulations to 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:57.559
 My eyes deserved at height 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.579
 victory hurts a little bit 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.590
 then stay at the small one 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.000
 bad news 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.500
 you have schwab with marco then we 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.539
 had to replace it in the short term 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.970
 but that 's definitely not the case 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:11.330
 be an excuse, I believe 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.920
 then there was a lot to do 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.289
 we had to do 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.789
 I think the dresdner had right 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.920
 enjoy the game would like 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.100
 played on then we were to 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.539
 circuit is already happy then was over 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.950
 are of course the same with the course 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.140
 first chance has been punished 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.349
 that was not planned we wanted too 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.220
 a little bit a bit 

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:34.610
 be your turn 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.789
 i believe the queen or yes i believe 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.160
 that everyone had fun in short for 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.569
 Of course, not only does it mean we are here now 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.270
 lost the three points but also 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:47.319
 still in the goal difference too 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.369
 our little bear service proved 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:54.289
 now called as quickly as possible down 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.819
 lick and I think that was that 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.170
 have so much wrong today 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.940
 is certainly positive is 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.510
 Thanks for your analysis coach like 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:10.610
 your conclusion turns out to be a victory 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:13.220
 Good day we have I am glad that 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.620
 we that our great fans too 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 have shown good football we have 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:27.260
 was deservedly won by simply 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:29.270
 that was that football was maybe coming 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.360
 I think it's hard words what 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.410
 what I should say now 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 okay we have only half past time 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.180
 no football played second second 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.740
 Main page was goal hungry 100 am 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.070
 We have won the end deservedly 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.070
 Thank you
