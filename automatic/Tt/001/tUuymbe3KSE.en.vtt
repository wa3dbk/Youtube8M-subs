00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
human and mice brains my first question

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.229 
human and mice brains my first question
was<00:00:30.660> aqua<00:00:30.990> teton<00:00:31.350> was<00:00:31.680> if<00:00:32.579> there<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:34.100> biological

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
was aqua teton was if there a biological

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.419 
was aqua teton was if there a biological
mechanism<00:00:36.239> by<00:00:36.690> which<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.289> quat<00:00:37.620> eaten<00:00:38.010> cooked

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
mechanism by which a quat eaten cooked

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.599 
mechanism by which a quat eaten cooked
could<00:00:38.940> act<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.890> biological<00:00:40.890> tissue<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
could act on biological tissue to

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.579 
could act on biological tissue to
adjusted<00:00:41.969> general<00:00:42.300> question<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.929> since<00:00:43.350> I'm

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
adjusted general question and since I'm

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.860 
adjusted general question and since I'm
a<00:00:43.620> neuroscientist<00:00:44.429> I<00:00:44.760> studied<00:00:45.449> it<00:00:45.629> with

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
a neuroscientist I studied it with

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.759 
a neuroscientist I studied it with
neurons<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.429> what<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.089> found<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.659> that<00:00:48.870> aqua

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
neurons and what we found is that aqua

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.069 
neurons and what we found is that aqua
Titan<00:00:50.129> changes<00:00:50.909> the<00:00:51.300> resting<00:00:51.839> membrane

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
Titan changes the resting membrane

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.919 
Titan changes the resting membrane
potential<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.039> neurons<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:54.359> changes

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
potential of neurons and it changes

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.079 
potential of neurons and it changes
their<00:00:55.260> properties<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.829> fire<00:00:56.399> action

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
their properties to fire action

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.419 
their properties to fire action
potentials<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.979> especially

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
potentials and this is especially

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.889 
potentials and this is especially
important<00:01:00.239> for<00:01:01.219> pathways<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:03.149> transmit

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
important for pathways that transmit

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.469 
important for pathways that transmit
pain<00:01:04.350> stimuli<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.299> less

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
pain stimuli because they are less

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.999 
pain stimuli because they are less
severe<00:01:07.110> if<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:08.610> treat<00:01:08.939> for<00:01:09.600> example<00:01:10.170> mice<00:01:10.380> with

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
severe if we treat for example mice with

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.230 
severe if we treat for example mice with
a<00:01:11.040> quarter-ton<00:01:11.700> tape<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:14.250> purpose<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.909> to

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
a quarter-ton tape the purpose was to

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810 
a quarter-ton tape the purpose was to
find<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.079> mechanism<00:01:16.740> by<00:01:17.219> which<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
find out the mechanism by which a

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.330 
find out the mechanism by which a
quarter-ton<00:01:18.509> might<00:01:18.840> act<00:01:19.229> on<00:01:19.500> biological

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
quarter-ton might act on biological

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.600 
quarter-ton might act on biological
tissues<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.000> my<00:01:21.270> case<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.930> neurons<00:01:22.579> when<00:01:23.579> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
tissues in my case on neurons when I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.980 
tissues in my case on neurons when I
first<00:01:23.969> came<00:01:24.360> into<00:01:24.600> contact<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.439> aqua<00:01:26.340> Titan

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
first came into contact with aqua Titan

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
first came into contact with aqua Titan
it<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.469> doctor<00:01:28.890> who<00:01:29.009> transcribed<00:01:29.399> it

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
it was was a doctor who transcribed it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
it was was a doctor who transcribed it
to<00:01:29.969> me<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.600> he<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.930> transcription<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> said

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
to me so he had a transcription and said

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.849 
to me so he had a transcription and said
well<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.280> recipe<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.659> should<00:01:33.869> try<00:01:34.170> these<00:01:34.530> tapes

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
well a recipe you should try these tapes

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.950 
well a recipe you should try these tapes
because<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.340> had<00:01:35.609> a<00:01:35.640> certain<00:01:36.000> inflammation<00:01:36.810> in

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
because I had a certain inflammation in

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.349 
because I had a certain inflammation in
my<00:01:37.109> achilles<00:01:37.590> tender<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.219> then<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.880> tried<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
my achilles tender and then I tried it

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:43.039 
my achilles tender and then I tried it
and<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.750> worked<00:01:40.020> quite<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.549> but<00:01:41.630> pain<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:43.020> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and it worked quite well but pain is a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
and it worked quite well but pain is a
very<00:01:43.320> sensitive<00:01:43.859> issue<00:01:44.130> because<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.030> might

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
very sensitive issue because you might

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.300 
very sensitive issue because you might
have<00:01:45.390> played<00:01:45.659> sable<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.170> effect<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.280> a

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
have played sable is effect so as a

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.029 
have played sable is effect so as a
scientist<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.000> was<00:01:48.149> still<00:01:48.390> very<00:01:48.600> skeptical<00:01:49.079> and

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
scientist I was still very skeptical and

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.010 
scientist I was still very skeptical and
saying<00:01:50.340> well<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.969> know<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.329> could<00:01:51.509> be<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.689> plot

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
saying well you know it could be a plot

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.169 
saying well you know it could be a plot
saber<00:01:52.409> effect<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.920> myself<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.579> then<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
saber effect on myself and then I

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.330 
saber effect on myself and then I
started<00:01:54.719> to<00:01:54.960> talk<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> fighting<00:01:55.890> company

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
started to talk to the fighting company

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.580 
started to talk to the fighting company
and<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.329> could<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.659> some<00:01:57.990> tapes<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and see if I could get some tapes and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.099 
and see if I could get some tapes and
then<00:01:58.859> we<00:01:59.039> started<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.939> try<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> out<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.509> single

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
then we started to try it out on single

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:03.709 
then we started to try it out on single
neurons<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.679> indeed<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.549> found<00:02:02.789> biological

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
neurons and indeed we found biological

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.190 
neurons and indeed we found biological
effects<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:05.539> tissue<00:02:06.539> of<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.079> brain<00:02:08.929> what<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> do

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
effects on tissue of the brain what I do

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.220 
effects on tissue of the brain what I do
is<00:02:10.379> basic<00:02:11.310> research<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.780> study<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is basic research so we study the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
is basic research so we study the
biological

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
biological

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.110 
biological
mechanisms<00:02:14.910> but<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:16.500> are<00:02:16.560> some<00:02:17.120> possible

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
mechanisms but there are some possible

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.300 
mechanisms but there are some possible
implications<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.170> might<00:02:19.590> be<00:02:19.770> interesting

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
implications that might be interesting

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.170 
implications that might be interesting
one<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:21.740> processes<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.950> pain<00:02:23.340> might<00:02:24.000> be

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
one is that processes of pain might be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.660 
one is that processes of pain might be
changed<00:02:24.720> under<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.770> influence<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.490> our

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
changed under the influence of our

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
is less severe if one treats for example

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.240 
is less severe if one treats for example

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
intensive sport might be less long which

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.229 
intensive sport might be less long which

of<00:03:11.640> all<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:12.030> has<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> biological<00:03:12.690> effect<00:03:13.230> so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
of all it has a biological effect so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.720 
of all it has a biological effect so
it's<00:03:14.070> not<00:03:14.250> some<00:03:14.610> kind<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:15.150> Asian<00:03:15.660> magic<00:03:16.580> so<00:03:17.580> as

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it's not some kind of Asian magic so as

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.220 
it's not some kind of Asian magic so as
a<00:03:17.760> scientist<00:03:18.299> we<00:03:18.450> want<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:18.690> know<00:03:18.810> what<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.110> the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
a scientist we want to know what is the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.289 
a scientist we want to know what is the
cause<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.500> something<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.880> effect

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
cause of something what is the effect

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.240 
cause of something what is the effect
and<00:03:21.420> for<00:03:21.600> example<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.200> we<00:03:22.230> block<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.890> effect

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
and for example can we block the effect

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.220 
and for example can we block the effect
and<00:03:23.489> yes<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.850> can<00:03:24.000> block<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.330> effect<00:03:24.690> if<00:03:24.900> we

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and yes we can block the effect if we

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.430 
and yes we can block the effect if we
put<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> lead<00:03:25.910> plate<00:03:26.910> between<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.840> tape<00:03:28.110> and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
put a lead plate between the tape and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.920 
put a lead plate between the tape and
for<00:03:28.890> example<00:03:29.220> tissue<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.600> nervous<00:03:30.900> system

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
for example tissue of the nervous system

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.289 
for example tissue of the nervous system
we<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.470> block<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.799> effect<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:32.880> see<00:03:33.090> on

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
we can block the effect that we see on

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.360 
we can block the effect that we see on
neurons<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.230> one<00:03:34.410> general<00:03:34.739> implication<00:03:35.250> is

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
neurons so one general implication is

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.729 
neurons so one general implication is
yes<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.730> has<00:03:35.880> a<00:03:35.910> biological<00:03:36.150> effect<00:03:37.019> another

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
yes it has a biological effect another

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.460 
yes it has a biological effect another
issue<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.390> might<00:03:39.630> actually<00:03:39.660> mainly

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
issue is that it might actually mainly

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.819 
issue is that it might actually mainly
act<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.220> our<00:03:41.730> stress<00:03:42.209> system<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.680> it

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
act on our stress system so it so it

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.910 
act on our stress system so it so it
might<00:03:44.040> make<00:03:44.790> stress<00:03:45.299> responses<00:03:46.079> of<00:03:46.350> our<00:03:46.620> body

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
might make stress responses of our body

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.210 
might make stress responses of our body
less<00:03:47.400> severe<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.570> many

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
less severe and this is many

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.520 
less severe and this is many
applications<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:50.459> example<00:03:51.019> pain<00:03:52.019> stimuli

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
applications for example pain stimuli

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.460 
applications for example pain stimuli
would<00:03:52.860> become<00:03:53.250> less<00:03:53.519> strong<00:03:54.260> relaxation<00:03:55.260> time

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
would become less strong relaxation time

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.069 
would become less strong relaxation time
would<00:03:55.650> become<00:03:55.920> shorter<00:03:56.400> probably<00:03:57.390> even<00:03:57.840> our

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
would become shorter probably even our

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.590 
would become shorter probably even our
memory<00:03:58.650> system<00:03:59.220> might<00:03:59.700> be<00:03:59.730> strengthened

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
memory system might be strengthened

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.750 
memory system might be strengthened
because<00:04:00.930> if<00:04:01.079> we<00:04:01.290> are<00:04:01.440> less<00:04:01.650> stressed<00:04:02.130> we<00:04:02.640> are

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
because if we are less stressed we are

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.050 
because if we are less stressed we are
more<00:04:02.970> open<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.900> learn<00:04:04.110> new<00:04:04.799> stimuli<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.820> all

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
more open to learn new stimuli in all

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.030 
more open to learn new stimuli in all
these<00:04:06.239> are<00:04:06.360> interesting<00:04:06.870> implications<00:04:07.560> that

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
these are interesting implications that

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
should be studied in further experiments

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.780 
should be studied in further experiments
the<00:04:12.540> most<00:04:12.840> surprising<00:04:13.410> finding<00:04:13.829> so<00:04:14.340> far<00:04:14.370> is

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
the most surprising finding so far is

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.780 
the most surprising finding so far is
that<00:04:15.079> for<00:04:16.079> the<00:04:16.169> Aqua<00:04:16.620> Titan<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.549> need

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
that for the Aqua Titan we need

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.810 
that for the Aqua Titan we need
magnesium<00:04:18.359> ions<00:04:19.019> in<00:04:19.290> order<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:20.010> act<00:04:20.220> on<00:04:20.400> urines

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
magnesium ions in order to act on urines

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.000 
magnesium ions in order to act on urines
this<00:04:21.390> is<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.570> brand<00:04:21.870> new<00:04:22.019> result<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.740> we<00:04:22.919> were

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
this is a brand new result and we were

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.070 
this is a brand new result and we were
completely<00:04:23.280> surprised<00:04:23.910> by<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:24.810> what<00:04:24.960> we

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
completely surprised by it so what we

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.790 
completely surprised by it so what we
believe<00:04:25.410> is<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
believe is the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.270 
believe is the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
nanoparticles and these nanoparticles

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.250 
nanoparticles and these nanoparticles
might<00:04:33.220> interact<00:04:33.610> with<00:04:33.910> magnesium<00:04:34.720> iron<00:04:34.930> and

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
might interact with magnesium iron and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.740 
might interact with magnesium iron and
this<00:04:35.890> might<00:04:36.130> change<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:37.180> membrane

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
this might change the membrane

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.830 
this might change the membrane
properties<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.620> neurons<00:04:39.010> in<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.790> way<00:04:40.000> that<00:04:40.660> the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
properties of neurons in a way that the

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.670 
properties of neurons in a way that the
opening<00:04:41.620> time<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:42.670> ion<00:04:43.600> channels<00:04:44.020> has<00:04:44.200> changed

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
opening time of ion channels has changed

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.860 
opening time of ion channels has changed
and<00:04:45.160> this<00:04:45.460> means<00:04:45.760> this<00:04:46.510> could<00:04:46.690> be<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
and this means this could be the

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.380 
and this means this could be the
explanation<00:04:47.200> how<00:04:47.740> our<00:04:47.950> credit<00:04:48.310> an<00:04:48.460> X<00:04:48.910> on

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
explanation how our credit an X on

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.900 
explanation how our credit an X on
neurons<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:51.360> think<00:04:52.360> one<00:04:52.690> advance<00:04:53.560> is<00:04:53.980> or<00:04:54.730> one

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
neurons I think one advance is or one

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.550 
neurons I think one advance is or one
advantages<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:56.970> we<00:04:57.970> try<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:59.020> get<00:04:59.230> at<00:04:59.380> the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
advantages that we try to get at the

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.950 
advantages that we try to get at the
cause<00:04:59.890> at<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.610> mechanism<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.330> action<00:05:01.540> I<00:05:01.900> think

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
cause at the mechanism of action I think

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.880 
cause at the mechanism of action I think
this<00:05:02.320> is<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:02.470> strength<00:05:02.950> of<00:05:03.390> our<00:05:04.390> study<00:05:04.810> on<00:05:05.080> the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
this is a strength of our study on the

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.380 
this is a strength of our study on the
other<00:05:06.010> hand<00:05:06.190> it's<00:05:06.280> also<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.580> weakness<00:05:06.850> because

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
other hand it's also a weakness because

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.930 
other hand it's also a weakness because
to<00:05:08.020> find<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.440> mechanism<00:05:08.590> does<00:05:09.160> not<00:05:09.400> at<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.670> same

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
to find a mechanism does not at the same

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.450 
to find a mechanism does not at the same
time<00:05:10.240> mean<00:05:10.480> you<00:05:10.660> have<00:05:10.810> an<00:05:10.930> application<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.430> I

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
time mean you have an application so I

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.090 
time mean you have an application so I
can<00:05:12.760> suggest<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.600> look<00:05:13.630> at<00:05:13.990> pain<00:05:14.290> systems<00:05:14.800> at

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
can suggest to look at pain systems at

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.340 
can suggest to look at pain systems at
recovery<00:05:15.640> it<00:05:16.240> stress<00:05:16.630> responses

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
recovery it stress responses

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.620 
recovery it stress responses
strengthening<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.430> learning<00:05:18.880> paradigms<00:05:19.360> but

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
strengthening of learning paradigms but

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.810 
strengthening of learning paradigms but
this<00:05:20.020> is<00:05:20.140> now<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.350> next<00:05:20.770> step<00:05:20.980> that<00:05:21.190> needs<00:05:21.640> to

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
this is now the next step that needs to

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.640 
this is now the next step that needs to
happen<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:23.730> think<00:05:24.730> that<00:05:25.060> three<00:05:25.630> reasons<00:05:25.990> one

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
happen I think that three reasons one

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.040 
happen I think that three reasons one
reason<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.220> that<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.910> stress<00:05:28.300> response<00:05:28.570> of

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
reason is that the stress response of

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.040 
reason is that the stress response of
the<00:05:29.170> body<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:29.820> damned<00:05:30.820> weakened<00:05:31.570> which<00:05:31.780> means

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
the body is damned weakened which means

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.140 
the body is damned weakened which means
you<00:05:32.650> know<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:32.860> mean<00:05:33.100> an<00:05:33.220> S<00:05:33.370> let<00:05:33.610> especially<00:05:34.090> if

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
you know I mean an S let especially if

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.850 
you know I mean an S let especially if
they're<00:05:34.300> professionals<00:05:34.960> there<00:05:35.500> are<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.620> lot<00:05:35.830> of

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
they're professionals there are a lot of

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.010 
they're professionals there are a lot of
stress<00:05:36.280> many<00:05:36.880> people<00:05:37.210> are<00:05:37.330> watching<00:05:37.480> they

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
stress many people are watching they

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.240 
stress many people are watching they
earn<00:05:38.200> their<00:05:38.440> money<00:05:38.500> by<00:05:38.920> it

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
earn their money by it

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.240 
earn their money by it
so<00:05:39.610> if<00:05:39.850> that<00:05:40.210> stress<00:05:40.870> level<00:05:40.900> is<00:05:41.380> reduced<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.220> a

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
so if that stress level is reduced to a

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.460 
so if that stress level is reduced to a
normal<00:05:42.670> level<00:05:42.850> they<00:05:43.390> can<00:05:43.420> better<00:05:43.720> concentrate

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
normal level they can better concentrate

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.520 
normal level they can better concentrate
on<00:05:44.740> their<00:05:45.550> sports<00:05:45.820> activity<00:05:46.450> another<00:05:47.200> reason

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
on their sports activity another reason

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.280 
on their sports activity another reason
is<00:05:47.650> that<00:05:47.860> many<00:05:48.340> athletes<00:05:48.850> do<00:05:49.810> need<00:05:50.050> some

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
is that many athletes do need some

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.850 
is that many athletes do need some
recovery<00:05:50.770> time<00:05:50.860> after<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.940> a<00:05:52.360> in<00:05:52.720> an<00:05:53.020> intensive

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
recovery time after in a in an intensive

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.770 
recovery time after in a in an intensive
sport<00:05:54.160> event<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:54.790> the<00:05:55.000> recovery<00:05:55.270> time<00:05:55.600> might

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
sport event and the recovery time might

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.750 
sport event and the recovery time might
be<00:05:55.810> shortened<00:05:56.320> the<00:05:56.920> other<00:05:57.070> thing<00:05:57.370> might<00:05:57.580> be

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
be shortened the other thing might be

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.110 
be shortened the other thing might be
that<00:05:58.000> the<00:05:58.150> processes<00:05:58.840> of<00:05:58.870> pain<00:05:59.700> might<00:06:00.700> be<00:06:00.910> less

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
that the processes of pain might be less

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.650 
that the processes of pain might be less
severe<00:06:01.570> so<00:06:01.780> they<00:06:01.900> recover<00:06:03.060> in<00:06:04.060> a<00:06:04.180> better<00:06:04.420> way

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
severe so they recover in a better way

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.430 
severe so they recover in a better way
from<00:06:05.290> an<00:06:05.650> injury<00:06:06.370> okay<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.660> became<00:06:08.110> interested

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
from an injury okay I became interested

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.300 
from an injury okay I became interested
in<00:06:08.860> aqua<00:06:09.400> teton<00:06:09.790> when<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.390> was<00:06:10.570> a<00:06:10.600> patient<00:06:11.310> when

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
in aqua teton when I was a patient when

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.730 
in aqua teton when I was a patient when
I<00:06:12.340> was<00:06:12.550> treated<00:06:13.000> with<00:06:13.120> aqua<00:06:13.480> Titan<00:06:13.900> tapes<00:06:14.170> when

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
I was treated with aqua Titan tapes when

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.220 
I was treated with aqua Titan tapes when
I<00:06:14.770> had<00:06:15.040> an<00:06:15.190> infection<00:06:15.730> of<00:06:15.850> our<00:06:16.480> inflammation

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
I had an infection of our inflammation

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.590 
I had an infection of our inflammation
of<00:06:17.410> the<00:06:17.440> Achilles<00:06:17.950> tendon<00:06:18.310> and<00:06:18.550> it<00:06:19.270> actually

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
of the Achilles tendon and it actually

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.870 
of the Achilles tendon and it actually
helped<00:06:19.930> but<00:06:20.710> being<00:06:20.950> a<00:06:21.040> scientist<00:06:21.550> I<00:06:21.670> was<00:06:21.850> a

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
helped but being a scientist I was a

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.130 
helped but being a scientist I was a
little<00:06:22.150> skeptical<00:06:22.480> because<00:06:22.750> I<00:06:22.960> know

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
little skeptical because I know

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.950 
little skeptical because I know
especially<00:06:23.560> was<00:06:23.920> plain<00:06:24.280> placebo<00:06:25.210> effects<00:06:25.780> are

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
especially was plain placebo effects are

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.350 
especially was plain placebo effects are
quite<00:06:26.200> common<00:06:26.650> so<00:06:27.250> I<00:06:27.280> asked<00:06:27.910> the<00:06:28.000> feyten

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
quite common so I asked the feyten

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.330 
quite common so I asked the feyten
company<00:06:28.810> hey<00:06:28.960> would<00:06:29.140> I<00:06:29.170> be<00:06:29.380> allowed<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:29.710> study

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
company hey would I be allowed to study

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.660 
company hey would I be allowed to study
it<00:06:30.550> in<00:06:31.290> biological<00:06:32.290> tissue<00:06:32.830> and<00:06:33.250> since<00:06:33.460> I'm<00:06:33.640> a

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:33.670 
it in biological tissue and since I'm a

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.270 
it in biological tissue and since I'm a
neuroscientist<00:06:34.390> I<00:06:34.690> started<00:06:35.200> to<00:06:35.590> look<00:06:35.800> at<00:06:35.919> the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
neuroscientist I started to look at the

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.190 
neuroscientist I started to look at the
effect<00:06:36.640> of<00:06:36.730> aqua<00:06:37.090> T<00:06:37.150> turn<00:06:37.419> on<00:06:37.600> your

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200 
effect of aqua T turn on your

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.810 
effect of aqua T turn on your
yeah<00:06:40.200> I'm<00:06:40.440> involved<00:06:40.740> in<00:06:40.950> a<00:06:41.070> study<00:06:41.340> that's<00:06:41.580> done

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
yeah I'm involved in a study that's done

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.020 
yeah I'm involved in a study that's done
with<00:06:41.970> patients<00:06:42.450> where<00:06:43.320> we<00:06:43.410> now<00:06:43.590> look<00:06:43.920> at<00:06:44.190> how

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
with patients where we now look at how

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.830 
with patients where we now look at how
they<00:06:45.270> recover<00:06:45.750> from<00:06:46.320> severe<00:06:46.770> severe<00:06:47.460> pain

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 
they recover from severe severe pain

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.300 
they recover from severe severe pain
another<00:06:48.840> thing<00:06:49.140> is<00:06:49.260> we<00:06:49.380> will<00:06:49.530> look<00:06:49.710> at<00:06:49.950> at

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
another thing is we will look at at

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.810 
another thing is we will look at at
memory<00:06:50.940> and<00:06:51.410> also<00:06:52.410> at<00:06:52.530> concentration<00:06:53.460> with

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:53.820 
memory and also at concentration with

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.290 
memory and also at concentration with
humans<00:06:54.270> for<00:06:54.990> example<00:06:55.350> with<00:06:55.470> older<00:06:55.800> humans<00:06:56.300> 65

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
humans for example with older humans 65

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.080 
humans for example with older humans 65
years<00:06:57.600> and<00:06:57.810> older<00:06:57.990> will<00:06:58.590> they<00:06:58.830> be<00:06:58.890> affected<00:06:59.310> by

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
years and older will they be affected by

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.960 
years and older will they be affected by
aqua<00:07:00.360> Titan<00:07:01.070> products<00:07:02.070> in<00:07:02.370> a<00:07:02.490> way<00:07:02.640> that<00:07:02.820> they

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
aqua Titan products in a way that they

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.760 
aqua Titan products in a way that they
can<00:07:03.150> better<00:07:03.360> concentrate<00:07:04.080> that<00:07:04.350> they<00:07:04.530> can

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
can better concentrate that they can

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.340 
can better concentrate that they can
better<00:07:05.400> learn<00:07:05.790> and<00:07:06.150> these<00:07:06.690> are<00:07:06.870> studies<00:07:07.080> we

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
better learn and these are studies we

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:13.220 
better learn and these are studies we
would<00:07:07.530> love<00:07:07.710> to<00:07:07.770> do<00:07:08.100> in<00:07:08.340> the<00:07:08.490> future<00:07:11.600> yes<00:07:12.600> we

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230 
would love to do in the future yes we

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.920 
would love to do in the future yes we
already<00:07:13.380> started<00:07:14.070> doing<00:07:14.490> this<00:07:14.930> this

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
already started doing this this

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.770 
already started doing this this
experiments<00:07:16.650> in<00:07:16.740> this<00:07:16.860> very<00:07:17.100> moment<00:07:17.400> we<00:07:18.090> look

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
experiments in this very moment we look

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.740 
experiments in this very moment we look
at<00:07:18.990> the<00:07:19.710> memory<00:07:19.920> system<00:07:20.550> in<00:07:20.850> that<00:07:21.090> case<00:07:21.150> of

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750 
at the memory system in that case of

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.740 
at the memory system in that case of
young<00:07:22.320> people<00:07:22.770> but<00:07:23.280> in<00:07:23.730> this<00:07:24.150> year<00:07:24.420> we<00:07:24.450> will

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:24.750 
young people but in this year we will

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.530 
young people but in this year we will
also<00:07:24.870> look<00:07:25.230> at<00:07:25.470> the<00:07:25.770> memory<00:07:26.390> performance<00:07:27.390> of

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
also look at the memory performance of

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.750 
also look at the memory performance of
older<00:07:27.870> people<00:07:28.050> under<00:07:28.830> the<00:07:28.980> influence<00:07:29.010> of

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:29.760 
older people under the influence of

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.360 
older people under the influence of
fight<00:07:30.480> and<00:07:30.750> necklaces<00:07:31.230> of<00:07:31.440> equity<00:07:32.130> tar

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
fight and necklaces of equity tar

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.720 
fight and necklaces of equity tar
necklaces<00:07:32.910> and<00:07:33.090> also<00:07:33.450> tapes
