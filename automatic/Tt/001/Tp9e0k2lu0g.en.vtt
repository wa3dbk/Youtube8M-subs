I gotta say the black I think looks well

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.580

I<00:05:17.789> don't<00:05:18.029> know<00:05:18.120> ok<00:05:18.659> I<00:05:18.870> don't<00:05:19.050> know<00:05:19.229> if<00:05:19.319> it<00:05:19.409> looks

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
I don't know ok I don't know if it looks

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.950 
I don't know ok I don't know if it looks
better<00:05:19.949> than<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:21.120> way<00:05:21.330> it's<00:05:21.569> definitely<00:05:21.930> a

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
better than the way it's definitely a

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.339 
better than the way it's definitely a
personal<00:05:22.289> preference<00:05:22.560> but<00:05:23.210> I<00:05:24.210> am<00:05:25.080> lucky

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
personal preference but I am lucky

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.920 
personal preference but I am lucky
enough<00:05:25.529> to<00:05:25.830> have<00:05:25.949> the<00:05:26.189> option<00:05:26.940> between<00:05:27.599> both

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
enough to have the option between both

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.300 
enough to have the option between both
of<00:05:27.960> these<00:05:28.199> okay<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.860> only<00:05:29.039> difference

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
of these okay and the only difference

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.029 
of these okay and the only difference
again<00:05:29.729> is<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:30.150> fact<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.479> we<00:05:31.259> motion<00:05:31.589> plus<00:05:31.830> is

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
again is the fact that we motion plus is

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.610 
again is the fact that we motion plus is
built-in<00:05:32.599> on<00:05:33.599> the<00:05:33.750> inside<00:05:34.050> which<00:05:34.289> is<00:05:34.440> very

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
built-in on the inside which is very
