know I mean mentally he his confidence

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.740 
know I mean mentally he his confidence
you<00:01:41.810> know<00:01:41.929> was<00:01:42.349> probably<00:01:42.770> shot<00:01:43.069> now<00:01:43.940> he's

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
you know was probably shot now he's

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.690 
you know was probably shot now he's
developing<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:45.800> confidence<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.399> he<00:01:46.520> can<00:01:46.610> go

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
developing a confidence that he can go

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.510 
developing a confidence that he can go
back<00:01:46.849> in<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.979> actually<00:01:48.979> go<00:01:49.099> in<00:01:49.250> there<00:01:49.369> and

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
back in and and actually go in there and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.550 
back in and and actually go in there and
help<00:01:50.149> us<00:01:50.270> win<00:01:50.450> a<00:01:50.509> football<00:01:50.630> game<00:01:50.840> like<00:01:51.229> he<00:01:51.349> did

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
help us win a football game like he did

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.859 
help us win a football game like he did
so<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:52.069> think<00:01:52.550> that's<00:01:52.700> a<00:01:52.789> big<00:01:53.000> step<00:01:53.209> form<00:01:53.569> where

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
so I think that's a big step form where

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.260 
so I think that's a big step form where
he<00:01:54.349> now<00:01:54.530> believes<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.130> all<00:01:55.640> right<00:01:55.789> I<00:01:56.030> could

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
he now believes it all right I could

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.449 
he now believes it all right I could
take<00:01:56.599> a<00:01:56.630> look<00:01:56.840> at<00:01:56.959> this<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.410> can<00:01:58.099> make<00:01:58.280> some

00:01:58.449 --> 00:01:58.459 
take a look at this I can make some

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:00.339 
take a look at this I can make some
adjustments<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.270> can<00:01:59.479> come<00:01:59.810> back<00:01:59.929> in<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.200> game

00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:00.349 
adjustments I can come back in the game

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:20.120 
adjustments I can come back in the game
and<00:02:00.500> help<00:02:00.649> us<00:02:00.770> win

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.040 

we<00:02:21.130> went<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.550> what<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:22.120> believe<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.810> his

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
we went to what we believe that his

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.140 
we went to what we believe that his
strengths<00:02:23.650> because<00:02:23.950> we<00:02:24.310> needed<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.820> shot<00:02:25.000> in

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
strengths because we needed a shot in

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.730 
strengths because we needed a shot in
the<00:02:25.240> arm<00:02:25.270> by<00:02:25.780> opening<00:02:26.110> up<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.350> offense

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
the arm by opening up the offense

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.230 
the arm by opening up the offense
spreading<00:02:27.220> it<00:02:27.340> out<00:02:27.460> giving<00:02:28.030> him<00:02:28.150> an

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
spreading it out giving him an

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.510 
spreading it out giving him an
opportunity<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.110> throw<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.680> football<00:02:29.890> or

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
opportunity to throw the football or

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.240 
opportunity to throw the football or
keep<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.210> run<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.630> think<00:02:32.140> really<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.920> was

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
keep it and run I think really it was

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:51.690 
keep it and run I think really it was
beneficial

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.730 

the<00:02:52.700> conversation<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:53.720> have<00:02:54.319> to<00:02:54.560> get<00:02:54.709> a

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740
