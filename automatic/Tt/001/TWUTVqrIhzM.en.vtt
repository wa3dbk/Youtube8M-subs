00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that and as the personnel changes then

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.370 
that and as the personnel changes then
maybe<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.620> office<00:02:53.950> changes<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.380> main

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
maybe the office changes but the main

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.560 
maybe the office changes but the main

with<00:03:04.090> your<00:03:04.780> bidding<00:03:05.050> I<00:03:05.230> think<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.160> tower

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
with your bidding I think the tower

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.670 
with your bidding I think the tower
level<00:03:07.030> here<00:03:07.300> is<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:08.310> good<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.550> think<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.680> what

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
level here is is good I think that what

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.400 
level here is is good I think that what
my<00:03:12.459> goal<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.760> being<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.450> recruiter<00:03:13.810> in<00:03:14.050> Los

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
my goal is being the recruiter in Los

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.290 
my goal is being the recruiter in Los
Angeles<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:15.160> make<00:03:15.310> sure<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.730> we<00:03:15.850> upgrade

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
Angeles to make sure that we upgrade

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.890 
Angeles to make sure that we upgrade
that<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.780> make<00:03:17.590> it<00:03:17.739> better<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.420> think

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
that and make it better but I think

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.210 
that and make it better but I think
there's<00:03:20.110> enough<00:03:20.350> talent<00:03:20.560> here<00:03:20.830> to<00:03:20.950> do<00:03:21.070> some

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
there's enough talent here to do some

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.550 
there's enough talent here to do some
positive<00:03:21.640> things<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.660> key<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.380> make

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
positive things but the key is to make

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.180 
positive things but the key is to make
sure<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.950> we<00:03:24.070> maximize<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.150> potential<00:03:25.570> and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
sure that we maximize the potential and

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.800 
sure that we maximize the potential and
and<00:03:27.190> have<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.030> standard<00:03:28.630> of

excellence<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.860> that's<00:03:30.310> not<00:03:30.690> numbers<00:03:31.690> that's

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
excellence and that's not numbers that's

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.740

not<00:03:32.430> wins<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.640> losses<00:03:33.730> that's<00:03:34.180> about<00:03:34.420> being

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
not wins and losses that's about being

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.320 
not wins and losses that's about being
the<00:03:34.870> best<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.380> can<00:03:35.530> be<00:03:36.000> every<00:03:37.000> single

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
the best that you can be every single

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
day every single play and if we do that

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.280
