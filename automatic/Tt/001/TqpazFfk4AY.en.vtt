always<00:04:34.820> had<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.450> cabinet<00:04:35.900> but<00:04:36.110> I

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.170 
always had it in the cabinet but I

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.830 
always had it in the cabinet but I
forget<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.800> use<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:38.410> for<00:04:39.410> reworking<00:04:39.890> stuff

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840

that<00:04:41.840> is<00:04:42.200> what<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.590> want<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.970> lot<00:04:44.390> of<00:04:44.540> guys<00:04:45.260> say

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.220 
through a 1.0 tip and a touch-up gun but
it<00:05:16.610> doesn't<00:05:16.970> seem<00:05:17.180> like<00:05:17.360> it's<00:05:17.570> thick<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:18.020> just

it comes out with a gun well and then
here's<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.400> hardener<00:05:22.790> for<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.200> meta<00:05:24.200> luxe<00:05:24.470> I

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
here's the hardener for the meta luxe I

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.070 
here's the hardener for the meta luxe I
was<00:05:24.830> using<00:05:25.070> this<00:05:25.370> is<00:05:25.580> just<00:05:25.820> their<00:05:29.080> medium

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
was using this is just their medium

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.350 
was using this is just their medium
solid<00:05:30.440> hardener<00:05:30.830> this<00:05:31.520> is<00:05:31.700> I<00:05:31.880> think<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.180> same

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
solid hardener this is I think the same

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.580 
solid hardener this is I think the same
partner<00:05:32.690> that<00:05:32.840> goes<00:05:32.960> in<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.170> clear<00:05:33.410> and

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
partner that goes in the clear and

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:34.900 
partner that goes in the clear and
everything<00:05:34.010> that<00:05:34.190> this<00:05:34.310> is<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.610> hardener

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
everything that this is the hardener

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.260 
everything that this is the hardener
they<00:05:35.060> recommend<00:05:35.570> on<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.900> text<00:05:36.200> sheet<00:05:36.940> so<00:05:37.940> I

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
they recommend on the text sheet so I

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.630 
they recommend on the text sheet so I
use<00:05:38.660> that<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:39.169> then<00:05:39.350> there's<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.740> 78<00:05:40.280> clear

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
use that and then there's the 78 clear

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.050 
use that and then there's the 78 clear
we<00:05:41.000> use<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.300> 78<00:05:41.870> on<00:05:42.080> that<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.860> still<00:05:43.580> have<00:05:43.760> two

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
we use the 78 on that I still have two

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.659 
we use the 78 on that I still have two
thirds<00:05:44.330> of<00:05:44.419> a<00:05:44.510> gallon<00:05:44.810> a<00:05:45.020> g40<00:05:45.560> in<00:05:45.800> here<00:05:46.130> it's

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
thirds of a gallon a g40 in here it's

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.720 
thirds of a gallon a g40 in here it's
right<00:05:46.970> there<00:05:47.240> but<00:05:48.130> maybe<00:05:49.130> I<00:05:49.250> don't<00:05:49.310> have<00:05:49.610> that

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
right there but maybe I don't have that

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.210 
right there but maybe I don't have that
much<00:05:49.880> maybe<00:05:50.120> I<00:05:50.240> have<00:05:50.480> half<00:05:50.840> but<00:05:51.770> when<00:05:52.070> it's

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:52.220 
much maybe I have half but when it's

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.830 
much maybe I have half but when it's
mixed<00:05:52.490> there's<00:05:52.820> probably<00:05:53.060> a<00:05:53.150> gallon<00:05:53.570> of<00:05:53.660> that

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
mixed there's probably a gallon of that

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.680 
mixed there's probably a gallon of that
left<00:05:54.140> so<00:05:54.919> once<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.700> grow<00:05:55.910> up<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:58.390> learn<00:05:59.390> shoot

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
left so once I grow up and learn shoot

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.810 
left so once I grow up and learn shoot
clear<00:05:59.930> like<00:06:00.140> the<00:06:00.290> pros<00:06:01.130> do<00:06:01.340> it<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:01.610> I'll<00:06:01.700> be

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
clear like the pros do it and I'll be

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.760 
clear like the pros do it and I'll be
able<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:02.060> shoot<00:06:02.270> that<00:06:02.540> but<00:06:02.840> until<00:06:03.380> then<00:06:03.590> I'll

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
able to shoot that but until then I'll

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.850 
able to shoot that but until then I'll
shoot<00:06:03.980> that<00:06:04.160> m/s<00:06:04.490> 78<00:06:05.030> because<00:06:05.560> this<00:06:06.560> is<00:06:06.680> my
