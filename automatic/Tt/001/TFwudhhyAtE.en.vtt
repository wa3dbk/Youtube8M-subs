certainly work it has some interesting

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.290 
certainly work it has some interesting
side<00:00:52.379> effects<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.860> must<00:00:53.070> admit<00:00:53.250> um<00:00:53.610> when<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> wash

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300

side effects I must admit um when I wash
my<00:00:54.480> hair<00:00:54.660> i<00:00:55.190> shampooed<00:00:56.570> dribbles<00:00:57.570> down<00:00:57.629> your

my hair i shampooed dribbles down your

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
my hair i shampooed dribbles down your
arm<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.199> I'd<00:00:58.440> never<00:00:58.649> actually<00:00:58.890> had<00:00:59.340> hair<00:01:00.239> on

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
arm and I'd never actually had hair on

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.950 
arm and I'd never actually had hair on
the<00:01:00.570> inside<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:01.020> my<00:01:01.140> arm<00:01:01.170> before<00:01:02.480> which<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.510> an

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the inside of my arm before which is an

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.649 
the inside of my arm before which is an
interesting<00:01:04.199> side<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.390> but<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> suppose

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.820 
you'll see from the before pictures that
I've<00:01:57.340> basically<00:01:57.550> got<00:01:58.090> about<00:01:58.450> half<00:01:58.870> an<00:01:59.080> inch<00:01:59.200> of

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
I've basically got about half an inch of

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.300 
I've basically got about half an inch of
proper<00:02:00.280> hair<00:02:00.490> here<00:02:01.330> now<00:02:01.600> and<00:02:01.830> then<00:02:02.830> I've<00:02:03.100> also

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
proper hair here now and then I've also

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.640 
proper hair here now and then I've also
got<00:02:03.670> some<00:02:03.700> coming<00:02:04.630> down<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:05.020> little<00:02:05.260> bit<00:02:05.440> lower

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
got some coming down a little bit lower

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.940 
got some coming down a little bit lower
so<00:02:06.990> basically<00:02:07.990> anything<00:02:08.140> that<00:02:08.230> was<00:02:08.410> fine<00:02:08.650> hair

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
so basically anything that was fine hair

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.770 
so basically anything that was fine hair
seems<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.369> have<00:02:09.490> come<00:02:09.640> back<00:02:09.880> now<00:02:10.390> also<00:02:10.600> the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
seems to have come back now also the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.030 
seems to have come back now also the
other<00:02:10.840> problem<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.170> was<00:02:11.230> having<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.890> was

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
other problem I was having is it was

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.150 
other problem I was having is it was
cutting<00:02:12.490> right<00:02:12.850> back<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.420> sort<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.660> standard

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
cutting right back the sort of standard

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.470 
cutting right back the sort of standard
baldness<00:02:15.160> pattern<00:02:15.610> where<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.790> cuts<00:02:16.090> right

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
baldness pattern where it cuts right

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.340 
baldness pattern where it cuts right
back<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.110> up<00:02:17.380> here<00:02:17.490> now<00:02:18.490> this<00:02:19.210> piece<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.930> has

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
back in up here now this piece here has

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.840 
back in up here now this piece here has
definitely<00:02:20.590> come<00:02:21.010> back<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.430> see<00:02:21.610> there<00:02:21.760> at

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
definitely come back you see there at

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.740 
definitely come back you see there at
least<00:02:21.970> half<00:02:22.330> an<00:02:22.480> inch<00:02:22.630> has<00:02:22.870> come<00:02:23.110> back<00:02:24.750> right

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.930 
least half an inch has come back right
there<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.130> same<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.730> other

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
there and then the same on the other

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.200 
there and then the same on the other
side<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:29.590> actually<00:02:29.770> I'd<00:02:30.460> say<00:02:30.490> almost<00:02:31.030> more

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
side it's actually I'd say almost more

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.400 
side it's actually I'd say almost more
like<00:02:31.240> three<00:02:31.570> quarters<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.930> an<00:02:32.020> inch<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.260> this

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
like three quarters of an inch on this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.450 
like three quarters of an inch on this
side<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.920> bit<00:02:33.100> bit<00:02:33.640> better<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.420> well<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:36.010> know

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
side and a bit bit better as well I know

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.100 
side and a bit bit better as well I know
this<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.730> very<00:02:36.850> this<00:02:37.240> isn't<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.510> way<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.630> do<00:02:37.960> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
this is very this isn't the way to do it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.890 
this is very this isn't the way to do it
but<00:02:38.290> it's<00:02:38.530> some<00:02:38.830> yeah<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.610> can<00:02:39.790> see<00:02:40.060> it's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
but it's some yeah and you can see it's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.290 
but it's some yeah and you can see it's
not<00:02:41.110> superb<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.190> it's<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:42.790> I've<00:02:42.970> always<00:02:43.150> had

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
not superb but it's it's I've always had

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.000 
not superb but it's it's I've always had
thin<00:02:43.690> hair<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.380> never<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.830> know<00:02:44.920> I've

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
thin hair so it's never you know I've

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.800 
thin hair so it's never you know I've
never<00:02:45.130> had<00:02:45.370> like<00:02:45.550> massive<00:02:46.210> it's<00:02:46.480> always<00:02:46.630> been

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
never had like massive it's always been

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.750 
never had like massive it's always been
really<00:02:46.930> spaced<00:02:47.290> apart<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:47.860> still<00:02:48.130> yeah<00:02:48.730> I

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
really spaced apart but still yeah I

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.460 
really spaced apart but still yeah I
reckon<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.300> like<00:02:49.450> half<00:02:49.750> an<00:02:49.870> inch<00:02:50.020> at<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.170> front

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
reckon it like half an inch at the front

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.560 
reckon it like half an inch at the front
and<00:02:50.620> definitely<00:02:51.610> half<00:02:51.880> an<00:02:52.060> inch<00:02:52.209> has<00:02:52.360> come

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
and definitely half an inch has come

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.540 
and definitely half an inch has come
back<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.959> here<00:02:53.350> so<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.040> doesn't<00:02:54.280> look<00:02:54.370> like

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
back in here so it doesn't look like

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.760
