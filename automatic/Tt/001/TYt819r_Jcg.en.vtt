00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.960
 third and last point and ideas 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.859
 serious thoughts have consequences 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.809
 implications has a counterpart 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.590
 of institutional change behavior of scientific practice 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.990
 I think one of the really salient features of intellectual life 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.560
 of Brazil 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.730
 the lightness 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.779
 with kimonos in general we treat our beliefs 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:27.279
 not here 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.359
 what do you believe 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.359
 without the slightest commitment to note 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.310
 ensure consistency 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.900
 between what we like to imagine we believe and what we 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.110
 really says juices 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.460
 henrique can be observed 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.100
 I have been collecting examples of this dissociation from Brazilian life 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.889
 long time 

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:51.889
 and I will not want to vote here for your patience 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.120
 with growing it by second example but at least 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.810
 one or two I go 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.720
 I'll share it with you guys until 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.120
 if it is the case then explore a little more 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 one of them 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.710
 it is an example 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 I'll come back and I'll get a little something I'll mention here. 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.970
 is an example that comes from the diaries of David 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.570
 when you were in Brazil aboard the beagle 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.850
 but on that trip that resulted 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 the monumental shoah discovered I already reported 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.770
 at some point ow 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.020
 stopped in Rio de Janeiro and stayed in the house 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.210
 a family 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.550
 tostes boasted enormous religiosity 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.460
 and he gives the following testimony I will read the testimony of the die 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.700
 look how impressive 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.220
 how does this refer to so many experiences that I'm sure are ours 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.400
 around today 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.400
 although it was written in the mid-19th century 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.450
 near rio de janeiro 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.230
 I stayed near the house of an old sound 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.910
 who held bolts to crush the fingers of his roads 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.490
 I lived in a house where the young domestic slave 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.660
 in the house where he was staying 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.069
 I lived in the house 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.129
 that of a young domestic slave was daily 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.119
 hourly 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:16.079
 cursed 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.129
 that's the problem 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.759
 now I have to go 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:23.539
 every hour, every hour, scolded, beaten and pursued 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.219
 in a way that would be enough to break the spirit of any animal 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.829
 I saw a little boy 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.029
 six or seven years old 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:34.370
 will be requested 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.880
 three or four times in the head on a goal 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.299
 with a whip 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:39.469
 horse 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.539
 before I could interfere 

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:44.539
 for having served me in a glass of water that was not very well 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.779
 and these actions were done r 

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:51.549
 by men 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.729
 offer to love your neighbor as yourselves 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:55.709
 who believe 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.859
 in God 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.480
 I will err in order that his will be done upon the earth 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:06.729
 David could not understand how people ostensibly 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.849
 piccin religious 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.699
 they treated humans 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.729
 as if it were a 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:16.179
 worse than animals 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:17.649
 pounding 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:20.649
 imagine to frighten the crush or bid 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.529
 This is an example of dissociation. 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:26.279
 in between 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:30.709
 the plan of self-representation, which also opposed the belief that 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.709
 and what objectively 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.299
 There is a lot of chance of this kind more 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:42.190
 see how it was the most concrete case closest to our opinion polls 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.489
 in Brazil 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.489
 You ask for a show Brazilian action theft 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.879
 probabilistic everything else 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.879
 Do you consider yourself racist? 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.949
 about 98% will declare that they do not 

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.409
 you ask for the same show 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.209
 same exists in Brazil 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.209
 more than 90% will say yes 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:10.969
 these two things can not be true at the same time 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.959
 people do not represent themselves this way and I do not think I'm lying is not a 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.870
 question of merit and krizia, however, when looking at the 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.110
 beside you psb 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.900
 same happiness 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.390
 you ask for lunch the Brazilian population you consider yourself happy 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.309
 more than two-thirds will say yes 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.949
 depend on income level of education 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.830
 You ask the same show the Brazilians in general are happy. 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.370
 only 23% will say yes 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.569
 I did not hit 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.050
 the way the person is represented and what he believes is not consistent with 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.389
 what the others 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.270
 we believe about it 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.080
 It's a bit of what I called a paradox of the Brazilian Brazilian is the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.080
 other 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.659
 I never met a Brazilian who did. 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:06.759
 it looks like 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.759
 all that is condemnable to carry around 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.780
 everyone feels different and above all that the list 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.860
 but all of us together are exactly all that is there 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.110
 is a consultant from Brazil considered that the sum of the parts 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:26.599
 people do not take 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:27.780
 what they want 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.909
 very seriously 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.909
 the issue of slavery I mentioned here 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.020
 there is only one in the united states there was a movement 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.590
 d intellectual defense including slavery 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.219
 I saw it as an argument to justify it 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.610
 and it took a war 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.439
 to end it 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.809
 It's in Brazil 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:53.089
 To Brazil, everyone was an account. 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.349
 everyone is like the unanimous mind 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.319
 exp. 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.779
 and yet we went to cuba side the last country 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.259
 of americas 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.009
 she fell from ripe 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:08.119
 shamefully at the end of the 19th century 

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:11.119
 and everyone finds 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:15.569
 you see that this has changed a lot, who is in favor of the inequality that 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.569
 exists today in Brazil if they have already found someone to defend 

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:22.309
 the difference of opportunity that exists in our country 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.990
 and basic education have only ever found someone who is 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.889
 satisfied with the quality of teaching our country 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.889
 we are all out of mind mind 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.300
 indignant 8pm 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.520
 thinking that it is wrong to change that it is no longer possible to reach the 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.749
 21st century so 

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:41.449
 in reality it remains indifferent 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.180
 we continue in the 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.490
 all indicators of elementary education foot of south america 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.439
 and it is as if it did not make very different 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.960
 in Brazil, this dimension is lacking. 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.310
 we take seriously enough in what we are supposed to believe 

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:03.989
 there is a detachment between the way we perceive the way we 

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:06.110
 we like to represent ourselves 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.110
 and what we have actually been 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.180
 the last example I'll conclude 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.220
 I decided the classroom that I found a 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.089
 pearl 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:17.139
 the face of Brazil 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.610
 my students at the time of the pt not from the lap 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.020
 all of them very excited to mobilize said did not take to the streets is that by 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.619
 let's go politics 

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:31.369
 if the impasse the country's corruption has all my support was also the same 

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:32.639
 thing 

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.409
 this same class 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:36.499
 at the end of the course 

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:38.899
 will be evaluated in a test 

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:43.069
 and I realize that they are shamelessly putting each other 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.199
 will the children not read in the head 

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:51.960
 if you're asking for ethics in politics and how are you going to stick in the room? 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.099
 class when it comes to giving the best example of respect for rules 

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:58.599
 of coexistence 

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.389
 normal 

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.669
 you stick 

00:08:01.669 --> 00:08:05.110
 I am embarrassed to separate them with a wallet away 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.419
 they all find themselves progressive intellectuals like all of us 

00:08:11.069 --> 00:08:14.149
 we Brazil only has predicted the progressive is an incredible thing
