little<00:00:16.770> bit<00:00:17.100> different<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.670> can<00:00:17.910> easily

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
little bit different you can easily

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.160 
little bit different you can easily
create<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:19.199> living<00:00:19.470> seat<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.130> garden<00:00:21.170> can

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
create a living seat in your garden can

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500 
create a living seat in your garden can
be<00:00:22.380> used<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> create<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.150> here

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
be used but I'm going to create one here

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.540 
be used but I'm going to create one here
on<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.170> wooden<00:00:25.650> bench<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.130> I've<00:00:26.310> made

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
on this wooden bench that I've made

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390 
on this wooden bench that I've made
using<00:00:27.449> time<00:00:28.019> because<00:00:28.529> time<00:00:28.830> isn't<00:00:29.099> a

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
using time because time isn't a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.880 
using time because time isn't a
low-growing<00:00:29.910> creeping<00:00:30.630> herb<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:31.769> got

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
low-growing creeping herb but it's got

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.520 
low-growing creeping herb but it's got
really<00:00:32.250> really<00:00:32.669> fragrant<00:00:33.120> foliage<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
really really fragrant foliage so the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.740 
really really fragrant foliage so the
idea<00:00:34.950> being<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.610> will<00:00:35.790> create<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.300> solid

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
idea being is we will create a solid

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
idea being is we will create a solid
mass<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> times<00:00:37.620> lamps<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.120> sit<00:00:39.329> on

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
mass of times lamps that you can sit on

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.090 
mass of times lamps that you can sit on
now<00:00:39.719> yes<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> little<00:00:40.649> bit<00:00:40.860> damp

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
now yes it's gonna be a little bit damp

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
now yes it's gonna be a little bit damp
if<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.520> wet<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.030> you've<00:00:42.149> got<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> pick<00:00:42.570> your

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
if it's wet so you've got to pick your

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.299 
if it's wet so you've got to pick your
days<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:43.770> look<00:00:43.890> very<00:00:44.160> attractive

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
days but it will look very attractive

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.000 
days but it will look very attractive
and<00:00:44.969> on<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.149> lovely<00:00:45.539> warm<00:00:45.809> summer's<00:00:46.260> day<00:00:46.469> you

and on a lovely warm summer's day you

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
and on a lovely warm summer's day you
can<00:00:47.190> sit<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> aroma<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
can sit on this and get the aroma so the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
can sit on this and get the aroma so the
first<00:00:49.500> thing<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.770> need<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.579> wooden<00:00:51.120> bench

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
first thing we need is a a wooden bench

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.150 
first thing we need is a a wooden bench
structure<00:00:51.989> which<00:00:52.079> I've<00:00:52.289> made<00:00:52.500> out<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.920> wood

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
structure which I've made out of wood

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.549 
structure which I've made out of wood
this<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> nice<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.510> strong<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.289> we've<00:00:55.410> got

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
this is nice and strong and we've got

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.790 
this is nice and strong and we've got
the<00:00:55.649> compost<00:00:56.160> bin<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.840> using<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
the compost bin for this I'm using a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.700 
the compost bin for this I'm using a
mixture<00:00:59.520> of<00:00:59.699> alone<00:01:00.270> based<00:01:00.570> compost<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.289> John

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
mixture of alone based compost like John

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.009 
mixture of alone based compost like John
it<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.219> multi-purpose<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.300> some<00:01:03.750> added

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it is a multi-purpose and some added

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
it is a multi-purpose and some added
glitter<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.650> what's<00:01:04.860> very<00:01:05.100> important<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
glitter because what's very important is

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.060 
glitter because what's very important is
that<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.119> get<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.600> drainage<00:01:06.890> around<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that we get good drainage around the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.990 
that we get good drainage around the
time<00:01:08.310> planner<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.750> simply<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.229> case<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
time planner and it's simply a case of

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.750 
time planner and it's simply a case of
space<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.240> our<00:01:12.330> fronts<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> compost<00:01:14.159> these

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
space in our fronts on the compost these

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.179 
space in our fronts on the compost these
are<00:01:15.030> quite<00:01:15.210> large<00:01:15.290> plants<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.710> buy<00:01:16.890> them

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
are quite large plants you can buy them

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
are quite large plants you can buy them
much<00:01:17.460> smaller<00:01:17.729> than<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> be

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
much smaller than this if you want to be

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.130 
much smaller than this if you want to be
four<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.340> five<00:01:20.820> inches<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.420> square<00:01:21.750> pots

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
four or five inches of square pots

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
four or five inches of square pots
they're<00:01:22.740> perfectly<00:01:23.400> okay<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.240> grow

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
they're perfectly okay because they grow

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.990 
they're perfectly okay because they grow
and<00:01:24.689> fill<00:01:24.960> out<00:01:25.110> quickly<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> on

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and fill out quickly so you can do it on

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.289 
and fill out quickly so you can do it on
a<00:01:27.180> quite<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> tight<00:01:28.320> budget<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.490> using<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
a quite a tight budget but I'm using the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.260 
a quite a tight budget but I'm using the
bigger<00:01:30.479> ones<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.350> instant<00:01:31.799> effect

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
bigger ones to get the instant effect

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.789 
bigger ones to get the instant effect
and<00:01:33.270> once<00:01:33.450> we've<00:01:33.600> spaced<00:01:33.960> them<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.290> on<00:01:34.530> there

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
and once we've spaced them out on there

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.580 
and once we've spaced them out on there
it's<00:01:35.280> simply<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> case<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.810> plankton<00:01:37.409> them

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it's simply a case that's plankton them

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
it's simply a case that's plankton them
into<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> compost<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:40.140> we've<00:01:40.320> got

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
into the compost and because we've got

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.140 
into the compost and because we've got
the<00:01:40.740> grit<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.400> that's<00:01:41.670> gonna<00:01:41.850> give<00:01:42.060> this

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the grit in there that's gonna give this

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.560 
the grit in there that's gonna give this
really<00:01:42.990> good<00:01:43.259> drainage<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> plants<00:01:45.390> will

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
really good drainage so the plants will

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.450 
really good drainage so the plants will
grow<00:01:45.780> away<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.590> won't<00:01:46.860> leave<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> hot

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
grow away and it won't leave a hot

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.359 
grow away and it won't leave a hot
horrible<00:01:48.030> wet<00:01:48.329> soggy<00:01:48.810> come<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.710> I'll<00:01:50.159> get

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
horrible wet soggy come for so I'll get

00:01:50.369 --> 00:02:01.330 
horrible wet soggy come for so I'll get
these<00:01:50.520> planted
