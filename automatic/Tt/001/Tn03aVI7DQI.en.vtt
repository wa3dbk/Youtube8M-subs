something we bringing as well is the
converge<00:04:31.440> platform<00:04:32.010> so<00:04:32.490> now<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.639> can<00:04:32.880> build<00:04:33.030> an

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
converge platform so now we can build an

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.940 
converge platform so now we can build an
app<00:04:33.330> which<00:04:33.900> is<00:04:34.050> going<00:04:34.230> to<00:04:34.350> run<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.800> those

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950
