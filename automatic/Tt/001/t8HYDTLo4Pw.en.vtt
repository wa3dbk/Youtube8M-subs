protector I'm not planning to use this

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.670 
protector I'm not planning to use this
because<00:01:04.820> I<00:01:05.300> will<00:01:05.600> go<00:01:05.750> with<00:01:05.990> a<00:01:06.170> tempered<00:01:06.650> glass

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
because I will go with a tempered glass

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:22.020 
because I will go with a tempered glass
screen<00:01:07.100> protector<00:01:07.490> but<00:01:07.729> here's<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.180> skin

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.750 

you<00:01:22.630> can<00:01:22.780> see<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.110> grains

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
you can see the grains

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.260 
you can see the grains
so<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.840> does<00:01:26.020> look<00:01:26.200> like<00:01:26.380> wood<00:01:27.090> feels<00:01:28.090> like

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
so it does look like wood feels like

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.320 
so it does look like wood feels like
wood<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:30.310> could<00:01:30.430> see<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.760> wood<00:01:30.940> grain<00:01:30.970> right

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
wood you could see the wood grain right

00:01:31.330 --> 00:02:35.700 
wood you could see the wood grain right
there<00:01:34.500> let's<00:01:35.500> go<00:01:35.590> ahead<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.830> get<00:01:35.920> this<00:01:36.040> on

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:44.240 

okay

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.850 

looks<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.240> slightly<00:02:45.690> off<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.800> I'm

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
looks like it's just slightly off so I'm

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.470 
looks like it's just slightly off so I'm
gonna<00:02:46.980> take<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.310> back<00:02:47.340> off<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:51.150> seems<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
gonna take it back off this seems a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.270 
gonna take it back off this seems a
little<00:02:51.690> bit<00:02:51.810> easier<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.440> put<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:52.860> this<00:02:53.070> way

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
little bit easier to put on this way

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.830 
little bit easier to put on this way
it's<00:02:53.580> hard<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.060> get<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.270> straight<00:02:54.540> because<00:02:54.660> of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
it's hard to get it straight because of

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.360 
it's hard to get it straight because of
the<00:02:55.020> curved<00:02:55.460> 2.5<00:02:56.460> back<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.960> note<00:02:58.350> 5<00:02:58.590> so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
the curved 2.5 back of the note 5 so

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.070 
the curved 2.5 back of the note 5 so
instead<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.760> trying<00:03:00.000> to<00:03:00.120> line<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.360> up<00:03:00.570> towards

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
instead of trying to line it up towards

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.960 
instead of trying to line it up towards
the<00:03:01.230> middle<00:03:01.560> I've<00:03:01.800> lined<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.310> up<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.610> an<00:03:02.730> edge

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the middle I've lined it up on an edge

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:20.360 
the middle I've lined it up on an edge
and<00:03:03.950> then<00:03:04.950> pushing<00:03:05.340> down<00:03:14.330> there<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.420> goes<00:03:19.370> okay

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
and then pushing down there it goes okay

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.720 
and then pushing down there it goes okay
so<00:03:20.430> here's<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:20.970> back<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:22.440> note<00:03:22.680> 5<00:03:25.730> one

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
so here's the back of the note 5 one

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.060 
so here's the back of the note 5 one
thing<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:26.970> do<00:03:27.030> wish<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.630> had<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
thing I do wish that it had is the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.860 
thing I do wish that it had is the
cutout<00:03:29.400> right<00:03:29.430> here<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.270> logos<00:03:30.600> which

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
cutout right here for the logos which

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:48.370 
cutout right here for the logos which
some<00:03:31.320> brands<00:03:31.740> do<00:03:33.470> but<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.560> does<00:03:34.740> look<00:03:34.950> nice

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.750 

let's<00:03:49.380> go<00:03:49.560> ahead<00:03:49.680> and<00:03:50.070> put<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.460> side

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
let's go ahead and put on the side

00:03:50.760 --> 00:05:10.589 
let's go ahead and put on the side
pieces

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:07:07.170 

so<00:05:11.259> here's<00:05:11.469> one<00:05:11.649> side

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.730 

all<00:07:07.720> right<00:07:07.840> so<00:07:08.020> one<00:07:08.170> thing<00:07:08.320> I<00:07:08.380> noticed<00:07:08.710> right

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
all right so one thing I noticed right

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.900 
all right so one thing I noticed right
away<00:07:08.860> is<00:07:09.070> just<00:07:09.520> that<00:07:09.730> the<00:07:09.970> curved<00:07:10.330> nature<00:07:10.870> of

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
away is just that the curved nature of

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:19.220 
away is just that the curved nature of
the<00:07:12.910> sides<00:07:13.210> and<00:07:14.580> these<00:07:15.580> individual<00:07:16.300> pieces

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:19.230 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.830 

they're<00:07:20.230> probably<00:07:20.800> I<00:07:21.130> mean<00:07:21.550> it's<00:07:21.760> a<00:07:22.030> good

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:22.840 
they're probably I mean it's a good

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.360 
they're probably I mean it's a good
chance<00:07:23.110> one<00:07:23.320> of<00:07:23.350> them<00:07:23.500> is<00:07:23.560> gonna<00:07:23.650> fall<00:07:23.950> off<00:07:24.160> on

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
chance one of them is gonna fall off on

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.530 
chance one of them is gonna fall off on
the<00:07:24.460> note<00:07:25.390> 4<00:07:25.420> you<00:07:26.290> had<00:07:26.440> just<00:07:26.740> force<00:07:27.520> long<00:07:28.150> solid

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:28.540 
the note 4 you had just force long solid

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.240 
the note 4 you had just force long solid
strips<00:07:28.960> but<00:07:29.200> these<00:07:29.380> are<00:07:29.530> like<00:07:29.650> multiple

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.250 
strips but these are like multiple

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.660 
strips but these are like multiple
pieces<00:07:30.840> so<00:07:31.840> as<00:07:32.410> you're<00:07:32.740> using<00:07:32.950> it<00:07:33.160> I<00:07:33.250> could<00:07:33.430> see

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670 
pieces so as you're using it I could see

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.850 
pieces so as you're using it I could see
one<00:07:34.240> of<00:07:34.330> these<00:07:34.390> little<00:07:34.540> smaller<00:07:34.990> ones<00:07:35.380> coming

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
one of these little smaller ones coming

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.150 
one of these little smaller ones coming
off<00:07:36.570> hopefully<00:07:37.570> in<00:07:37.630> a<00:07:37.720> day<00:07:37.870> or<00:07:38.020> two<00:07:38.230> it's<00:07:38.440> you

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 
off hopefully in a day or two it's you

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.960 
off hopefully in a day or two it's you
know<00:07:39.250> it's<00:07:39.460> a<00:07:39.580> little<00:07:39.880> bit<00:07:39.970> stickier<00:07:41.850> but<00:07:42.850> the

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:42.970 
know it's a little bit stickier but the

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.670 
know it's a little bit stickier but the
good<00:07:43.120> thing<00:07:43.300> about<00:07:43.390> skeino<00:07:43.900> me<00:07:44.050> is<00:07:44.200> that<00:07:44.350> it<00:07:44.530> is

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:44.680 
good thing about skeino me is that it is

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.370 
good thing about skeino me is that it is
lifetime<00:07:45.640> warranty<00:07:46.270> and<00:07:46.390> replacements<00:07:47.050> which

lifetime warranty and replacements which
is<00:07:47.590> why<00:07:47.740> I<00:07:48.130> ordered<00:07:48.760> from<00:07:49.090> them<00:07:49.270> instead<00:07:49.600> of

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 
is why I ordered from them instead of

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.400 
is why I ordered from them instead of
another<00:07:50.370> brand<00:07:51.370> of<00:07:51.580> the<00:07:51.730> skin<00:07:52.380> but<00:07:53.550> here<00:07:54.550> is<00:07:54.820> a
