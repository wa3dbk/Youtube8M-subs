00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.529
 so you him 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.400
 I will try shipper and display on 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.759
 about direction for secured mean to me 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.590
 here 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:23.000
 the tire was cut off by 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.000
 put or let here 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.770
 minimum approximation when we set 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:37.260
 pore so that it connects with per capita 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:43.290
 it turns out somewhere else millimeter remains 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:49.399
 the gap between the edge of the tire and the disk 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:55.770
 there is a principle of course you can under this saw 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:58.219
 trim new here but in that particular sense i 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.219
 I do not see it 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.280
 cleanly sawing enough so that these 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.820
 schools 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.910
 although show but how many times and 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.760
 absent yes but I will not yet 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:15.380
 now experiment 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:20.390
 not easier to use 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:25.880
 tape means I put the disk on again 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:34.930
 laminate which 24 dental rescue tires 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.930
 strengthened plus so nothing goes try 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.410
 but 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.780
 lower weight here it is now on my part 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:54.599
 he is practically very neat 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.599
 It turned out that the upper weight which 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:09.540
 further for that millimeter it turns out 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:17.000
 edge remains tops on so here's the dough 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.000
 of course the right angle is right 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.689
 that is, ok, that's when you are across 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:36.540
 didn't you so quickly get ahead of the gift 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:38.879
 car along I know the answer to my 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.329
 fiber it seems to take too on 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.329
 wire 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:51.170
 that's most likely of course 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.580
 this is the time to slow down 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.490
 as if she comes up against starts 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.800
 put tatsii 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.620
 compilers this is played on radiation 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:06.360
 a certain speed is no longer 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:15.300
 comfortable here just plays 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:18.230
 freedom ok so good schools ear in 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.230
 would not be good 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.630
 here 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.470
 let the cork in 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.470
 internal 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.020
 its hatch as America and there and not see 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.550
 massaged 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.660
 from this country almost perfect 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.290
 and coming and going all the way enough 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.500
 exactly neatly we are with this 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.500
 no side 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.500
 tips
