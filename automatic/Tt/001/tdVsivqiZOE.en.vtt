00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
stains and dirt soft so that way you've

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.770 
stains and dirt soft so that way you've
applying<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> clean<00:01:08.130> tank<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.659> then

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
applying it to a clean tank and then

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560 
applying it to a clean tank and then
basically<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.650> did<00:01:10.830> was<00:01:11.369> try<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.150> line<00:01:12.390> up

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
basically what I did was try to line up

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.130 
basically what I did was try to line up
as<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.260> each<00:01:13.970> bit<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.330> joins<00:01:15.659> here

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
as you can see each bit like joins here

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.670 
as you can see each bit like joins here
they<00:01:16.409> say<00:01:16.680> join<00:01:17.659> going<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they say join going you know and so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.580 
they say join going you know and so
forth<00:01:20.420> what<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.479> did<00:01:21.720> was<00:01:21.869> trying<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> line<00:01:22.409> up

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
forth what I did was trying to line up

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.789 
forth what I did was trying to line up
that<00:01:22.619> line<00:01:24.049> with<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.979> fuel<00:01:26.280> tank<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.619> this<00:01:28.619> is

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that line with my fuel tank so this is

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.940 
that line with my fuel tank so this is
like<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.070> arrow<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.900> it<00:01:30.900> points<00:01:31.259> down<00:01:31.350> and<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
like an arrow and it points down and I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.380 
like an arrow and it points down and I
what<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.250> try<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.759> work<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.119> down<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:35.390> line

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
what I do try to work it down and line

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.569 
what I do try to work it down and line
it<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.350> went<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it up like that and I went actually to

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.260 
it up like that and I went actually to
go<00:01:38.790> from<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> bottoms<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> applied<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
go from the bottoms up so I applied the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.230 
go from the bottoms up so I applied the
bottom<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:43.369> sort<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.430> looking<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> then<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
bottom to sort of looking and then I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
bottom to sort of looking and then I
would<00:01:45.420> rub<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:45.990> as<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.649> push<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
would rub that on as I would push the

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.429 
would rub that on as I would push the
next<00:01:48.119> bit<00:01:48.240> down<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.600> rub<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.140> push<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
next bit down and rub it and push the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.530 
next bit down and rub it and push the
next<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.710> down<00:01:49.860> above<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.250> until<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.180> finally

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
next it down above it until it's finally

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.170 
next it down above it until it's finally
applied<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> then<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.680> give<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> good

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
applied and then you just give it a good

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.429 
applied and then you just give it a good
once-over<00:01:54.180> rub<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.869> actually<00:01:55.200> not<00:01:55.380> that

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
once-over rub it's actually not that

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.249 
once-over rub it's actually not that
hard<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.090> I<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.840> looks<00:01:57.960> pretty<00:01:58.049> good

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
hard at all I think it looks pretty good

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.420 
hard at all I think it looks pretty good
you<00:01:58.560> know<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.710> mean<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.369> got<00:01:59.520> out<00:02:01.219> like<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you know I mean if you got out like a

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.950 
you know I mean if you got out like a
level<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.000> might<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.540> completely

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
level it might not be completely

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.280 
level it might not be completely
straight<00:02:04.670> even<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> use<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> little<00:02:06.869> ruler

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
straight even if you use a little ruler

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.090 
straight even if you use a little ruler
maybe

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
maybe

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.250 
maybe
but<00:02:09.100> either<00:02:09.220> way<00:02:09.340> either<00:02:10.120> either<00:02:10.390> man<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.900> think

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
but either way either either man I think

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.630 
but either way either either man I think
