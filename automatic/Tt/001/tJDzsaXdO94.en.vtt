00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
we looked up places where you can

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.280 
we looked up places where you can
recycle<00:03:12.790> single<00:03:13.300> use<00:03:13.480> batteries<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.230> the

first one on the list is the place that
we<00:03:16.300> went<00:03:16.330> but<00:03:17.260> they<00:03:17.380> don't<00:03:17.590> do<00:03:17.709> it<00:03:17.830> anymore<00:03:17.920> and

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
we went but they don't do it anymore and

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.280 
we went but they don't do it anymore and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
doing it that place that we went to

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.050 
doing it that place that we went to

took the batteries to the library when

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.500 
took the batteries to the library when
you<00:03:33.160> gave<00:03:33.340> them<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.640> them<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:33.940> now<00:03:34.090> they<00:03:34.269> don't

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
you gave them to them so now they don't

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.490 
you gave them to them so now they don't
then<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.260> found<00:03:35.500> this<00:03:35.620> article<00:03:35.830> by<00:03:36.160> we'll<00:03:36.459> Taft

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
then I found this article by we'll Taft

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.960 
then I found this article by we'll Taft
there<00:03:38.500> may<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.680> no<00:03:38.920> need<00:03:39.069> to<00:03:39.220> recycle<00:03:39.489> alkaline

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
there may be no need to recycle alkaline

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.610 
there may be no need to recycle alkaline
batteries<00:03:40.420> in<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.720> he<00:03:40.870> talks<00:03:41.140> about<00:03:41.290> how

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
batteries in it he talks about how

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.620 
batteries in it he talks about how
darest<00:03:42.010> cell<00:03:42.220> doesn't<00:03:42.610> use<00:03:42.730> mercury<00:03:42.970> in<00:03:43.390> their

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
darest cell doesn't use mercury in their

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.240 
darest cell doesn't use mercury in their
bed<00:03:43.780> they're<00:03:44.140> alkaline<00:03:44.470> batteries<00:03:44.830> I<00:03:44.950> haven't

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
bed they're alkaline batteries I haven't

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.880 
bed they're alkaline batteries I haven't
since<00:03:45.370> 1993<00:03:46.150> energizer<00:03:47.049> says<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.590> can<00:03:47.739> throw

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
since 1993 energizer says you can throw

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.620 
since 1993 energizer says you can throw
them<00:03:48.069> away<00:03:48.220> but<00:03:48.370> not<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.819> rechargeable<00:03:49.330> ones

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
them away but not the rechargeable ones

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.960 
them away but not the rechargeable ones
so<00:03:50.110> apparently<00:03:50.410> alkaline<00:03:51.340> batteries<00:03:51.760> don't

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
so apparently alkaline batteries don't

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.539 
so apparently alkaline batteries don't
contain<00:03:52.750> toxic<00:03:53.380> components<00:03:53.590> they<00:03:54.220> do<00:03:54.280> contain

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
contain toxic components they do contain

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.670 
contain toxic components they do contain
metals<00:03:55.090> but<00:03:55.269> they're<00:03:55.450> not<00:03:55.569> easily<00:03:55.989> recyclable

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
metals but they're not easily recyclable

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.729 
metals but they're not easily recyclable
medals<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.670> I<00:03:58.030> think<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.290> can<00:03:59.410> just<00:03:59.590> throw

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
medals so I think you can just throw

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.199 
medals so I think you can just throw
them<00:03:59.950> away<00:04:00.099> I'm<00:04:00.489> gonna<00:04:00.700> wait<00:04:00.849> and<00:04:00.940> see<00:04:01.090> what

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
them away I'm gonna wait and see what

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.670 
them away I'm gonna wait and see what

I<00:04:35.169> like<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.710> fact<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.039> he<00:04:36.310> kept<00:04:36.490> it<00:04:36.610> really

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
I like the fact that he kept it really

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.879 
I like the fact that he kept it really
short<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.510> wasn't<00:04:37.660> just<00:04:37.840> shooting<00:04:38.650> his

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
short and it wasn't just shooting his

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.980 
short and it wasn't just shooting his
his<00:04:39.310> poop<00:04:39.610> or<00:04:40.000> whatever<00:04:40.240> maybe<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.870> was<00:04:40.960> the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
his poop or whatever maybe that was the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.719 
his poop or whatever maybe that was the
wrong<00:04:41.200> example<00:04:41.740> I'm<00:04:42.039> forgetting<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:42.669> I

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
wrong example I'm forgetting that I
