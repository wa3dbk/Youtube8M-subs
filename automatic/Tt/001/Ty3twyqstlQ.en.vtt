00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
because the way Kubo played it out was

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.690 
because the way Kubo played it out was
that<00:02:09.979> Jinjo<00:02:10.979> never<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.670> had<00:02:11.849> any<00:02:12.090> powers

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
that Jinjo never really had any powers

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.210 
that Jinjo never really had any powers
his<00:02:12.849> own<00:02:13.260> like<00:02:14.260> he<00:02:14.440> just<00:02:14.620> took<00:02:14.800> ichigo's

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
his own like he just took ichigo's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.009 
his own like he just took ichigo's
powers<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.180> know<00:02:16.300> rocked<00:02:16.750> his

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
powers and then you know rocked his

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.270 
powers and then you know rocked his
powers<00:02:17.500> for<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.800> longest<00:02:18.190> so<00:02:19.200> it's<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.440> what

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
powers for the longest so it's like what

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.640

were<00:02:21.459> giggles<00:02:22.060> original<00:02:22.660> powers<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.170> doubt

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
were giggles original powers I doubt

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.860
