well we got a whole stack of them back
here<00:01:36.470> alright<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.530> what's<00:01:37.830> this<00:01:37.920> puppy<00:01:38.250> Hacha

here alright so what's this puppy Hacha
it's<00:01:39.150> supposed<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.660> hundred<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.110> eighty

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it's supposed to do a hundred and eighty

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560 
it's supposed to do a hundred and eighty
Giga<00:01:40.470> hatch<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.580> taking<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:42.360> don't

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
Giga hatch so it's like taking I don't

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.420 
Giga hatch so it's like taking I don't
know<00:01:42.630> 90<00:01:43.080> of<00:01:43.170> these<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.710> kind<00:01:43.830> of<00:01:43.920> stuffing

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
know 90 of these and kind of stuffing

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.310 
know 90 of these and kind of stuffing
them<00:01:44.550> in<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.900> these<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.110> little

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
them in here and is these a little

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.469 
them in here and is these a little
overclock<00:01:46.650> stable<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.610> about<00:01:47.790> 2<00:01:47.970> Giga<00:01:48.300> hash

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
overclock stable to about 2 Giga hash

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.700 
overclock stable to about 2 Giga hash
okay

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
okay

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.290 
okay
this<00:01:50.100> thing<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.580> little<00:01:50.670> more<00:01:50.820> power<00:01:51.090> though

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
this thing is a little more power though

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.760 
this thing is a little more power though
I<00:01:51.330> think<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.810> we'll<00:01:51.960> figure<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> out<00:01:52.619> yes

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
I think there we'll figure that out yes

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.140 
I think there we'll figure that out yes
so<00:01:52.950> you're<00:01:53.280> gonna<00:01:53.400> get<00:01:53.580> about<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.790> hundred<00:01:54.119> and

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
so you're gonna get about a hundred and

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.090 
so you're gonna get about a hundred and
eighty<00:01:54.330> Giga<00:01:54.660> hash<00:01:54.900> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.260> overclock<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:55.770> I

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
eighty Giga hash you can overclock it I

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.670 
eighty Giga hash you can overclock it I
guess<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.580> but<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:58.050> just<00:01:58.200> uses<00:01:58.500> more

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
guess a little but it just uses more

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
guess a little but it just uses more

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
now now that's about bitcoins are

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.740 
now now that's about bitcoins are
hanging<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.430> around<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.970> don't<00:03:24.209> check<00:03:24.360> our<00:03:24.510> site

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
hanging in around I don't check our site

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.360 
hanging in around I don't check our site
you'll<00:03:24.900> see<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.290> think<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:25.799> about<00:03:26.070> eight

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you'll see I think it's about eight

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.190 
you'll see I think it's about eight
hundred<00:03:26.549> thirty<00:03:26.970> dollars<00:03:27.150> buddy<00:03:27.810> yeah

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
hundred thirty dollars buddy yeah

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.449 
hundred thirty dollars buddy yeah
roughly<00:03:28.890> with<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:30.350> current<00:03:31.350> pricing<00:03:31.799> crisis

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
roughly with the current pricing crisis

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.449 
roughly with the current pricing crisis
that<00:03:32.640> right<00:03:32.850> now<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:34.019> course<00:03:34.230> I<00:03:34.470> probably

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
that right now so of course I probably

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.790 
that right now so of course I probably
got<00:03:35.790> two<00:03:36.000> of<00:03:36.090> them

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
got two of them

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.150 
got two of them
but<00:03:37.520> I<00:03:37.790> did<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:39.380> what<00:03:39.500> does<00:03:39.590> this<00:03:39.710> thing<00:03:39.770> tell

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
but I did so what does this thing tell

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.470 
but I did so what does this thing tell
it's<00:03:40.370> kind<00:03:40.520> of<00:03:40.580> plug<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:40.940> play<00:03:41.090> out<00:03:41.240> of<00:03:41.270> the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
it's kind of plug and play out of the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.030 
it's kind of plug and play out of the
box<00:03:42.580> from<00:03:43.580> what<00:03:43.790> is<00:03:44.000> your<00:03:44.210> sin<00:03:44.860> you<00:03:45.860> got<00:03:46.010> a

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
box from what is your sin you got a

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.100 
box from what is your sin you got a
night<00:03:46.280> in<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.580> regular<00:03:47.000> Joe<00:03:47.240> Schmoe<00:03:47.510> do<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:47.900> I

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
night in a regular Joe Schmoe do this I

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.810 
night in a regular Joe Schmoe do this I
don't<00:03:48.500> know<00:03:48.560> about<00:03:48.620> that<00:03:48.890> yeah<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.640> want<00:03:49.790> to

a Mikey over here yeah this is not my
network<00:03:55.580> site<00:03:55.820> Pete<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.660> we<00:03:57.020> got<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.290> do<00:03:57.650> a

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
network site Pete so we got to do a

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.650 
network site Pete so we got to do a
little<00:03:57.920> magic<00:03:58.280> here<00:03:58.700> a<00:03:58.730> computer<00:03:59.390> on<00:03:59.480> that

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
little magic here a computer on that

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.080 
little magic here a computer on that
subnet<00:03:59.930> plug<00:04:00.380> it<00:04:00.500> into<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.770> ethernet<00:04:01.220> you<00:04:01.580> got

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
subnet plug it into the ethernet you got

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.520 
subnet plug it into the ethernet you got
to<00:04:02.210> do<00:04:02.270> the<00:04:02.390> ethernet<00:04:02.750> first<00:04:03.020> then<00:04:03.200> you<00:04:03.290> can<00:04:03.440> do

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
to do the ethernet first then you can do

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.580 
to do the ethernet first then you can do
Wireless<00:04:03.920> after<00:04:04.280> if<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.430> have<00:04:04.520> an<00:04:04.640> antenna

Wireless after if you have an antenna
once<00:04:06.590> it's<00:04:06.770> on<00:04:06.890> the<00:04:06.980> ethernet<00:04:07.250> there's<00:04:07.850> a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
once it's on the ethernet there's a

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.600 
once it's on the ethernet there's a
little<00:04:08.180> webpage<00:04:08.570> you<00:04:09.350> set<00:04:09.740> up<00:04:09.860> either<00:04:10.160> static

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
little webpage you set up either static

or dynamic IP however you want to do it
I<00:04:13.520> know<00:04:14.270> should<00:04:14.540> we<00:04:14.570> teach<00:04:14.750> networking<00:04:15.200> or

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
I know should we teach networking or

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.349 
I know should we teach networking or
just<00:04:15.530> go<00:04:15.800> for<00:04:16.070> it<00:04:16.190> let's<00:04:16.370> go<00:04:16.580> let's<00:04:16.880> go<00:04:17.000> for<00:04:17.239> it

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
just go for it let's go let's go for it

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.830 
just go for it let's go let's go for it
okay<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.760> earlier<00:04:20.030> we<00:04:20.239> pinged<00:04:20.570> for<00:04:20.780> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
okay so earlier we pinged for the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.870 
okay so earlier we pinged for the
computer<00:04:21.260> itself<00:04:21.590> now<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.550> ant<00:04:22.670> miner

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
computer itself now that the ant miner

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.080 
computer itself now that the ant miner
has<00:04:23.260> apparently<00:04:24.260> booted<00:04:24.650> in<00:04:24.830> Ethernet<00:04:25.700> is<00:04:25.940> on

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
has apparently booted in Ethernet is on

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.490 
has apparently booted in Ethernet is on
we<00:04:26.210> should<00:04:26.390> be<00:04:26.480> able<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.690> ping<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.290> look<00:04:27.380> at

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
we should be able to ping it and look at

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.380 
we should be able to ping it and look at
that<00:04:28.180> look<00:04:29.180> at<00:04:29.240> that

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.860 

Mamma<00:04:32.390> Mia<00:04:32.540> I<00:04:34.510> don't<00:04:35.510> know<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.690> password

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
Mamma Mia I don't know the password

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.630 
Mamma Mia I don't know the password
maybe<00:04:36.380> there<00:04:36.620> isn't<00:04:36.710> one<00:04:39.160> invalid<00:04:40.160> route<00:04:40.430> how

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
maybe there isn't one invalid route how

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.880 
maybe there isn't one invalid route how
about<00:04:40.760> password<00:04:42.550> no<00:04:43.550> rude<00:04:45.820> huh<00:04:46.820> it's<00:04:47.150> route<00:04:47.890> so

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
about password no rude huh it's route so

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.230 
about password no rude huh it's route so
we've<00:04:49.010> managed<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.310> find<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.610> antenna<00:04:49.940> in<00:04:50.090> its

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
we've managed to find the antenna in its

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.060 
we've managed to find the antenna in its
car<00:04:50.419> we're<00:04:50.600> going<00:04:50.690> to<00:04:50.870> try<00:04:51.110> connecting<00:04:51.680> to<00:04:51.980> the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
car we're going to try connecting to the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:57.430 
car we're going to try connecting to the
Wi-Fi<00:04:55.180> see<00:04:56.180> how<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.510> actually<00:04:56.690> how<00:04:57.230> well

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
Wi-Fi see how that actually how well

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.670 
Wi-Fi see how that actually how well
that<00:04:57.560> works<00:04:58.419> it's<00:04:59.419> got<00:04:59.570> a<00:04:59.600> scan<00:04:59.960> out<00:05:00.230> and<00:05:00.560> it's

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
that works it's got a scan out and it's

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.270 
that works it's got a scan out and it's
found<00:05:01.040> the<00:05:01.160> Wi-Fi<00:05:01.580> in<00:05:01.730> my<00:05:01.880> house<00:05:02.060> here<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:03.280> we

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
found the Wi-Fi in my house here so we

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.700 
found the Wi-Fi in my house here so we
decided<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.700> go<00:05:04.850> with<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.180> wired<00:05:05.750> LAN<00:05:06.020> for<00:05:06.290> now

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
decided to go with the wired LAN for now

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.890 
decided to go with the wired LAN for now
the<00:05:08.190> wireless<00:05:08.430> seemed<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.940> little<00:05:09.030> bit<00:05:09.240> flaky

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
the wireless seemed a little bit flaky

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.930 
the wireless seemed a little bit flaky
it's<00:05:10.290> actually<00:05:11.160> got<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.370> figure<00:05:11.639> out<00:05:11.669> a<00:05:11.790> little

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
it's actually got to figure out a little

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.409 
it's actually got to figure out a little
bit<00:05:12.090> more<00:05:12.210> than<00:05:12.449> config<00:05:12.810> but<00:05:13.110> it's<00:05:13.530> mining<00:05:14.419> if

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
bit more than config but it's mining if

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:16.939 
bit more than config but it's mining if
you<00:05:15.509> look<00:05:15.660> at<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.870> stats<00:05:16.169> it's<00:05:16.440> gonna<00:05:16.800> read

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
you look at the stats it's gonna read

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.850 
you look at the stats it's gonna read
about<00:05:17.130> 186<00:05:17.820> right<00:05:18.150> now<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:19.440> can<00:05:19.560> see<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> little

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
about 186 right now you can see a little

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.490 
about 186 right now you can see a little
green<00:05:20.039> light<00:05:20.250> flashing<00:05:20.789> and

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
green light flashing and

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.550 
green light flashing and
yeah<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.700> reminded<00:05:24.120> well<00:05:24.570> what<00:05:25.140> up<00:05:25.230> the<00:05:25.350> post

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
yeah so reminded well what up the post

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.460 
yeah so reminded well what up the post
apart<00:05:25.890> -<00:05:26.100> with<00:05:26.250> all<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.400> configs<00:05:27.020> once<00:05:28.020> we<00:05:28.260> dig

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
apart - with all the configs once we dig

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.820 
apart - with all the configs once we dig
more<00:05:28.680> in<00:05:28.830> depth<00:05:29.040> you<00:05:29.670> know<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.810> software<00:05:31.260> it

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
more in depth you know the software it

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.550 
more in depth you know the software it
looks<00:05:32.010> like<00:05:32.100> it's<00:05:32.280> just<00:05:32.520> open<00:05:33.210> dd-wrt<00:05:33.960> just

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
looks like it's just open dd-wrt just

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.280 
looks like it's just open dd-wrt just
like<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:34.740> network<00:05:35.520> card<00:05:35.730> but<00:05:36.030> we'll<00:05:36.450> post<00:05:36.660> video
