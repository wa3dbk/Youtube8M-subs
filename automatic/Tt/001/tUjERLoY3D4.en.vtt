00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
at some point you may have to use a

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.240 
at some point you may have to use a
database<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.990> was<00:00:10.139> created<00:00:10.620> by<00:00:10.740> someone

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
new job in this lesson we're actually

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.650 
new job in this lesson we're actually
going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.580> work<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:17.970> an<00:00:18.060> existing<00:00:18.180> database

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
going to work with an existing database

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.550 
going to work with an existing database
as<00:00:19.109> well<00:00:19.140> they're<00:00:20.100> ready<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.400> read<00:00:20.699> database

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
as well they're ready to read database

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.349 
as well they're ready to read database
one<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.769> common<00:00:23.220> tasks<00:00:23.550> you'll<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.150> when

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
one of the common tasks you'll do when

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.300 
one of the common tasks you'll do when
working<00:00:24.539> with<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> database<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.619> create

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
working with a database is create

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.359 
working with a database is create
reports<00:00:27.410> reports<00:00:28.410> are<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.130> ways<00:00:29.310> you

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
reports reports are one of the ways you

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.009 
reports reports are one of the ways you
can<00:00:29.730> extract<00:00:30.119> information<00:00:30.359> from<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
can extract information from the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
can extract information from the
database<00:00:31.170> tables<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.099> display<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
database tables and display that

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.990 
database tables and display that
information<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.809> meaningful<00:00:34.170> way

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
information in a meaningful way

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.780 
information in a meaningful way
basically<00:00:36.000> reports<00:00:36.960> summarize<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:38.129> present

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
basically reports summarize and present

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.319 
basically reports summarize and present
data<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> stored<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.320> tables<00:00:41.329> reports

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
data that is stored in tables reports

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.630 
data that is stored in tables reports
and<00:00:42.540> access<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.200> look<00:00:43.410> just<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.829> any<00:00:44.190> report

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and access can look just like any report

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.270 
and access can look just like any report
you<00:00:44.730> create<00:00:45.059> manually<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.870> Word<00:00:46.280> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you create manually in Word the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.250 
you create manually in Word the
difference<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:47.910> access<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.020> don't

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
difference with access is that you don't

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
difference with access is that you don't
have<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.710> enter<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> data<00:00:50.309> directly<00:00:50.969> into<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
have to enter the data directly into the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.600 
have to enter the data directly into the
report<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:53.520> you're

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
report like you have to when you're

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.229 
report like you have to when you're
working<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.149> word<00:00:54.420> document<00:00:55.640> instead<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
working with a word document instead the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
working with a word document instead the
report<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> created<00:00:58.020> using<00:00:58.739> information

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
report is created using information

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
report is created using information
you've<00:00:59.520> already<00:00:59.730> stored<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.600> database

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you've already stored in your database

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.039 
you've already stored in your database
tables<00:01:01.730> let's<00:01:02.730> take<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> look<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> few<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
tables let's take a look at a few of the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.280 
tables let's take a look at a few of the
ways<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:04.619> create<00:01:04.769> reports<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.640> access

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
ways you can create reports and access

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.070 
ways you can create reports and access
to<00:01:07.290> see<00:01:07.530> these<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.580> select<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.299> create<00:01:09.510> tab

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to see these just select the create tab

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.820 
to see these just select the create tab
and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.979> locate<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> reports<00:01:12.030> group<00:01:12.830> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and then locate the reports group you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.550 
and then locate the reports group you
can<00:01:13.979> create<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.610> new<00:01:14.909> blank<00:01:15.720> reports<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
can create a new blank reports and

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.219 
can create a new blank reports and
design<00:01:16.920> view<00:01:17.340> or<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:18.659> layout<00:01:18.930> view<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:22.049> can

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
design view or in layout view you can

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.399 
design view or in layout view you can
also<00:01:22.470> create<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.340> simple<00:01:23.909> reports<00:01:24.509> using<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
also create a simple reports using this

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 
also create a simple reports using this
reports<00:01:25.920> commands<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:27.150> produces<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
reports commands which produces and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530 
reports commands which produces and
reports<00:01:28.320> automatically<00:01:29.009> or<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> reports

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
reports automatically or use the reports

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.810 
reports automatically or use the reports
wizard<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.439> specify<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.009> details<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.670> want

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
wizard to specify the details you want

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.080 
wizard to specify the details you want
to<00:01:33.000> include<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.720> report<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.729> lesson

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
to include in your report in this lesson

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.630 
to include in your report in this lesson
we'll<00:01:36.960> take<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> look<00:01:37.590> at<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.740> reports<00:01:38.189> command

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
we'll take a look at the reports command

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.270 
we'll take a look at the reports command
and<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.420> reports<00:01:39.869> wizard<00:01:42.680> let's<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.890> started

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and the reports wizard let's get started

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
and the reports wizard let's get started
by<00:01:44.399> creating<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:45.000> reports<00:01:45.479> automatically

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
by creating a reports automatically

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.510 
by creating a reports automatically
using<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> reports<00:01:47.460> command<00:01:48.590> first<00:01:49.590> click
