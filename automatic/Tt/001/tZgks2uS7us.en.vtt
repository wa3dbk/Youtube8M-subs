00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
so the idea was that I was going to do

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.730 
so the idea was that I was going to do
something<00:01:21.340> for<00:01:21.760> somebody<00:01:21.970> big<00:01:22.530> which<00:01:23.530> would

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
something for somebody big which would

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.560 
something for somebody big which would
give<00:01:23.950> me<00:01:24.100> money<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.640> fund<00:01:24.850> doing<00:01:25.240> my<00:01:25.390> own<00:01:25.420> thing

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
give me money to fund doing my own thing

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.250 
give me money to fund doing my own thing
so<00:01:26.080> I<00:01:26.500> was<00:01:27.100> I<00:01:27.430> kind<00:01:27.729> of<00:01:27.820> read<00:01:28.090> in<00:01:28.360> pop<00:01:28.810> magazine

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
so I was I kind of read in pop magazine

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.990 
so I was I kind of read in pop magazine
at<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.500> time<00:01:29.710> there<00:01:29.920> was<00:01:30.040> this<00:01:30.070> assclown<00:01:30.610> Rick

wanted to you know do this whole kind of
Michael<00:02:02.740> Jackson

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
Michael Jackson

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.300 
Michael Jackson
so<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:05.720> know<00:02:05.840> had<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.110> few<00:02:06.470> little<00:02:06.650> ideas<00:02:06.890> kick

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
so you know had a few little ideas kick

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.180 
so you know had a few little ideas kick
around<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.970> while<00:02:08.270> ago<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:09.350> then<00:02:09.619> it<00:02:09.740> just<00:02:09.770> made

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
around a while ago and then it just made

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.250 
around a while ago and then it just made
sense<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.850> mean<00:02:11.210> everything<00:02:11.450> from<00:02:11.780> my<00:02:11.900> show<00:02:12.110> is

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
sense I mean everything from my show is

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.470 
sense I mean everything from my show is
still<00:02:12.500> made<00:02:12.740> by<00:02:12.920> me<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.760> would<00:02:13.940> make<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.270> big

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
still made by me it would make a big

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.850 
still made by me it would make a big
difference<00:02:14.540> because<00:02:15.080> then<00:02:15.380> things<00:02:15.650> don't

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
difference because then things don't

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.500 
difference because then things don't
have<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.040> be<00:02:16.160> done<00:02:16.460> on<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> cheap<00:02:16.910> or<00:02:17.360> and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
have to be done on the cheap or and

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.810 
have to be done on the cheap or and
favors<00:02:17.990> or<00:02:18.230> you<00:02:18.830> know<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:18.950> can<00:02:19.160> do<00:02:19.310> things<00:02:19.580> how<00:02:19.790> I

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820
