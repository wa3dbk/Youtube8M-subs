00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
at that wall the scene and I'm gonna get

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.870 
at that wall the scene and I'm gonna get
the<00:01:05.880> ambient<00:01:06.450> exposure<00:01:06.570> right

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.990 

okay<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:16.680> gives<00:01:16.860> me<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> rough<00:01:17.220> ballpark<00:01:17.460> I'm

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
okay that gives me a rough ballpark I'm

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
okay that gives me a rough ballpark I'm
about<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.540> don't<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.930> about<00:01:19.080> 250<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.799> f/11

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
about I don't know about 250 at f/11

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.070 
about I don't know about 250 at f/11
that<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:20.939> change<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.360> course<00:01:21.570> when<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> get<00:01:21.930> my

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that will change of course when I get my

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140 
that will change of course when I get my
subject<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.740> front<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.700> camera<00:01:24.030> because

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
subject in front of the camera because

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.570 
subject in front of the camera because
aperture<00:01:24.780> priority<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.680> start<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> factor

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
aperture priority will start to factor

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.359 
aperture priority will start to factor
my<00:01:27.000> subjects<00:01:27.659> exposure<00:01:28.350> value<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.310> as

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
my subjects exposure value as well as

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.070 
my subjects exposure value as well as
the<00:01:29.580> background<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> gives<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> rough

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
the background but it gives me a rough

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.190 
the background but it gives me a rough
starting<00:01:31.530> point<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.430> gonna<00:01:32.610> ask<00:01:32.729> my<00:01:33.200> very

I do think that this silver splash is a

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.180 
I do think that this silver splash is a
little<00:03:40.599> too<00:03:40.750> much<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.620> what<00:03:41.770> I'm<00:03:41.860> going<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.010> do

little too much so what I'm going to do

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.780 
little too much so what I'm going to do
here<00:03:42.750> is<00:03:43.750> I'm<00:03:43.930> going<00:03:44.050> to<00:03:44.110> take<00:03:44.319> this<00:03:44.790> diffuser

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
here is I'm going to take this diffuser

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.860 
here is I'm going to take this diffuser
and<00:03:46.860> expose<00:03:47.860> just<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.430> translucence<00:03:49.150> get<00:03:49.690> rid

good beautiful very pretty easy to work
this<00:04:35.400> way<00:04:35.580> I<00:04:35.820> could<00:04:36.150> put<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.510> on<00:04:36.720> another

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
this way I could put this on another

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.200 
this way I could put this on another
clamp<00:04:37.290> like<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.040> have<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:38.490> right

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
clamp like that and have it just right

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.420 
clamp like that and have it just right
in<00:04:39.420> here<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.350> actually<00:04:40.650> approximates

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
in here and that actually approximates

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.780 
in here and that actually approximates
that<00:04:41.550> classic<00:04:42.210> sort<00:04:42.450> of<00:04:42.570> you<00:04:42.750> know<00:04:43.790> clamshell

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
that classic sort of you know clamshell

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.370 
that classic sort of you know clamshell
type<00:04:45.030> of<00:04:45.210> light<00:04:45.390> or<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.630> little<00:04:45.990> bit<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.230> beauty

type of light or a little bit of beauty
light<00:04:46.680> an<00:04:46.890> overhead<00:04:47.490> source<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.060> an

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
light an overhead source and an

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.070 
light an overhead source and an
underneath<00:04:48.840> bounce<00:04:49.200> I've<00:04:50.100> adjusted<00:04:50.450> this<00:04:51.450> for

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
underneath bounce I've adjusted this for

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.190 
underneath bounce I've adjusted this for
her<00:04:52.290> height<00:04:52.580> okay<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:54.210> clamp<00:04:54.630> that<00:04:54.780> you<00:04:54.990> put

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
her height okay the clamp that you put

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.620 
her height okay the clamp that you put
these<00:04:55.350> tri<00:04:56.310> grips<00:04:56.580> on<00:04:56.760> is<00:04:57.030> pretty

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
these tri grips on is pretty

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.630 
these tri grips on is pretty
omnidirectional<00:04:58.020> so<00:04:58.620> I<00:04:58.650> am<00:04:58.770> able<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.130> tilt<00:04:59.490> it

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
omnidirectional so I am able to tilt it

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.610 
omnidirectional so I am able to tilt it
over<00:04:59.730> I<00:05:00.000> have<00:05:00.420> the<00:05:00.540> flash<00:05:00.780> radiating<00:05:01.410> right

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
over I have the flash radiating right

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.400 
over I have the flash radiating right
into<00:05:01.890> here<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:02.280> now<00:05:03.090> let's<00:05:03.780> see<00:05:03.930> what<00:05:03.960> happens
