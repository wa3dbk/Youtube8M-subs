00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.689
 the channel then we have our channel 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 equalizer increase better in the middle and me 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.099
 I think that's pretty nice 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.320
 breed in the new position 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:32.070
 then like from here on from which source 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.140
 the channel is saved cd tractor or 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.539
 aux either borrow or where signal 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.379
 we can then we have 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:42.960
 the channel feud crossfader the error 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.420
 for the ipod volume and then comes 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.020
 Here you can choose our chieming area here 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.609
 from which source to the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.410
 headphone output is then sent 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:54.600
 we have our kyu volume here 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.320
 we can cross over between bka and b 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.210
 dazzle 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 then I still have the ipod control 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.679
 is something really nice because I can 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 over here completely my ipod serve 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.550
 for example, start recording and 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.250
 just no longer has the ipod itself rom 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.270
 push to the deck we have here in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.979
 his cinema button 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.540
 because we need a track one 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.409
 want a certain state 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 stop button 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.049
 startbutton pitch bend then we have 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.409
 still the search button is quite nice 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.329
 the mixtape old stretchers 75 frames a 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.340
 and I can easily do a certain one 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:28.189
 place in the song again 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.869
 then we have our pad slider here 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:34.079
 being here between a pid range of 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.240
 6 12 25 and 100 percent can choose and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.740
 I also have a key lock 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.720
 function is long pressed the button 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 I think that's what I need 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.200
 piece has with singing and that pretty much 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.479
 whip up and this mickey mouse 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.460
 avoid the effect here wants the regulator 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.290
 we need our library in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.009
 tractor or just on the hard drive too 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.540
 move 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.909
 here we come back to the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.130
 next higher level here I can still 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.490
 select if a track plays 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.560
 becomes 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.640
 whether constantly the same trick again 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.219
 I will not give any 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.630
 turn on random play or me 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.219
 can adjust just that the whole cd 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.380
 is continuously reproduced 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.750
 Here I can get my cube points 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.400
 save and retrieve again 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.290
 I always need ship if I have the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.390
 double occupancy of the keys wants to achieve 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.280
 then we have our little one here 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 Luke area and our little temple 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.370
 ready where I record in the samples and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.200
 can play 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.760
 at time little off if I'm the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.370
 already one step at a time 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.200
 remaining time show nose prock 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.459
 I can create my previously created one 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.950
 retrieve playlist 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.990
 with source I can select the source 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.920
 if she is a tractor for example now 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.380
 or just the cd of my way then what 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.239
 We also have a nice one here 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.950
 integrated effect board with six 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.760
 effects that we can select here 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.310
 that once echo job penning feser 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.840
 flanger and filter the parameters 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.870
 above that we will talk about the parameter 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.420
 and then controlled the wet dry riegler 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.280
 have you stayed and reverse repos 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.160
 The name already says the track is running 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.080
 normal backward at remained running 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.730
 the track backwards, however, starts 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.640
 because back where he actually is now 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.480
 would be located sap to the tempo 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.520
 typing 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.400
 and then we have start here and 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.650
 stop part where we can adjust 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.350
 if the track starts slowly and fast 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.080
 but then slowly expires or the same 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.910
 abruptly ended and last but not least the 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.470
 discovered button around the cd from ours 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.600
 slot in drive to raise 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.299
 I've got my back on 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.760
 there we have twice master out 1 x 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.880
 symmetrical xlr once in jeans 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.200
 good for the defense monitors record around 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.709
 to record a mix 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.690
 then you still have out in 218 1 I can 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.900
 optional bonds or funds signal 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.519
 connect and I can see the two cd 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.600
 text once again individually tap it 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.209
 For example, it is quite nice when I am 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.709
 home short then use the usb port 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.430
 and that gets to the computer 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.260
 connect 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.360
 the socket for the power supply and next to it 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.470
 the power switch on the prepared 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.060
 Let's see for both slot in 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.410
 drive then we can here one more 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.570
 connect the microphone 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.370
 Here is the microphone volume then 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.530
 we still have a small microphone 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.070
 equalizer for the heights and for the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.989
 bass 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.660
 then we can cross peter korff 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.640
 then I can still normal and 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.769
 set the world and then we have 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.450
 here our headphones outputs optional 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.519
