00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.900
 the last one is going to take the mx act efe 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:20.180
 you'll see the last one to be 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.180
 exactly although subscribers 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:39.530
 also the banks already was already we are 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.530
 in first person 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.480
 you have to jump 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.220
 port or something like that could say it's 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:06.760
 a kind of felipe park 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.760
 prepared what flip 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.119
 on the way to this one 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.080
 we're fighting that throws me towards there 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.750
 twice worth 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.960
 I'm going through the first one in second 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 let's position dead 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.230
 however distances I can 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.390
 afford me the luxury of recharging this very 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.200
 back another video has just fallen 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.200
 a ramp I've seen 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.040
 I have to run into the drum that is 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.040
 that the sum we have taken 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:16.590
 a road that has passed all 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.590
 has triumphed 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.260
 and obstacles to me 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:35.709
 to see what more just behind me the noise 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:38.709
 in the rubÃ©n and I go and is 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.709
 Awesome 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:51.830
 now that is the goal and I think 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.830
 who is this love 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.170
 if not 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.230
 upside down 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.230
 let's go now 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.290
 we go 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:52.040
 let's go to the end of the whole forward 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:03.350
 throw back back left behind 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.680
 ay ay ay ay yes 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.680
 the homeland was behind the beginning 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.870
 there is braking 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.129
 before it comes 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:57.880
 fixed efe what happens is that it is 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.880
 demotivated 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.000
 the three intractable 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.639
 being in front of the container know if 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.719
 it can happen but there it is 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.629
 images of triple companions of f2 and 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:18.770
 a very fast victory highly in a 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:18.770
 46 minutes of the facts
