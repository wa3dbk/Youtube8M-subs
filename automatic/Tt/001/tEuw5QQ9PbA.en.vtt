well<00:00:10.480> let<00:00:10.660> me<00:00:10.710> start<00:00:11.710> out<00:00:11.920> by<00:00:12.099> saying<00:00:12.280> that

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
well let me start out by saying that

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.799 
well let me start out by saying that
teachers<00:00:12.880> matter<00:00:13.150> a<00:00:13.360> lot

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
teachers matter a lot

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.040 
teachers matter a lot
in<00:00:13.870> fact<00:00:14.440> we<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:16.119> research<00:00:16.450> shows<00:00:16.750> that

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.050 
in fact we the research shows that

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.660 
in fact we the research shows that
teachers<00:00:17.349> matter<00:00:17.560> more<00:00:17.830> than<00:00:17.890> anything<00:00:18.340> else

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:18.670 
teachers matter more than anything else

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.730 
teachers matter more than anything else
in<00:00:18.880> a<00:00:18.970> school<00:00:19.240> you<00:00:20.050> can<00:00:20.230> have<00:00:20.380> better

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
in a school you can have better

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.859 
in a school you can have better
textbooks<00:00:21.340> worse<00:00:21.580> textbooks<00:00:22.240> nicer

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
textbooks worse textbooks nicer

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.900 
textbooks worse textbooks nicer
facilities<00:00:23.020> worse<00:00:23.619> facilities<00:00:24.189> doesn't

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
facilities worse facilities doesn't

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.330 
facilities worse facilities doesn't
really<00:00:25.269> matter<00:00:25.539> all<00:00:25.750> that<00:00:25.779> much<00:00:25.960> but<00:00:26.890> teachers

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
really matter all that much but teachers

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.109 
really matter all that much but teachers
do<00:00:27.730> matter

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
do matter

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.620 
do matter
and<00:00:28.300> it<00:00:29.019> turns<00:00:29.289> out<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.300> difference

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
and it turns out that the difference

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.850 
and it turns out that the difference
between<00:00:31.869> a<00:00:31.900> good<00:00:32.050> teacher<00:00:32.290> and<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.500> bad<00:00:32.650> teacher

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
between a good teacher and a bad teacher

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.620 
between a good teacher and a bad teacher

things<00:00:47.530> are<00:00:47.860> good<00:00:48.610> at<00:00:48.730> predicting<00:00:49.239> whether<00:00:49.420> a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
things are good at predicting whether a

teacher is going to be a good classroom
teacher<00:00:51.879> and<00:00:52.120> actually<00:00:52.539> raise<00:00:52.750> student

teacher and actually raise student

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.549 
teacher and actually raise student
achievement<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.879> what<00:00:55.090> we<00:00:55.239> need<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:55.930> American

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
achievement so what we need in American

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.770 
achievement so what we need in American
schools<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:57.370> we<00:00:57.640> need<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.030> flexibility<00:00:58.750> to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
schools is we need the flexibility to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.569 
schools is we need the flexibility to
find<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.649> people<00:00:59.800> who<00:00:59.949> are<00:01:00.190> good<00:01:00.399> teachers

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
find the people who are good teachers

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.510 
find the people who are good teachers
and<00:01:01.030> retain<00:01:01.629> them<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.320> best<00:01:03.070> way<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.280> do

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
and retain them and the best way to do

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.369 
and retain them and the best way to do
that<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.910> not<00:01:04.059> by<00:01:04.119> reading<00:01:04.629> their<00:01:04.750> CVS<00:01:05.170> and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
that is not by reading their CVS and

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.390 
that is not by reading their CVS and
trying<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.680> find<00:01:05.890> out<00:01:06.040> whether<00:01:06.189> they're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
trying to find out whether they're

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.300 
trying to find out whether they're
certified<00:01:06.729> or<00:01:07.360> not<00:01:07.479> it<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.260> put<00:01:09.010> them<00:01:09.159> in<00:01:09.250> a

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
certified or not it is put them in a

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.640 
certified or not it is put them in a
classroom<00:01:09.520> see<00:01:10.420> how<00:01:10.600> well<00:01:10.780> students<00:01:11.140> do<00:01:11.350> and

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
classroom see how well students do and

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.640 
classroom see how well students do and
if<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.520> students<00:01:12.850> are<00:01:12.939> doing<00:01:13.060> well

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
if the students are doing well

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.289 
if the students are doing well
achievement<00:01:14.650> is<00:01:14.740> rising<00:01:15.159> keep<00:01:15.760> that<00:01:16.030> person

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
achievement is rising keep that person

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.210 
achievement is rising keep that person
in<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.630> classroom<00:01:17.080> and<00:01:17.259> that<00:01:17.500> means<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:18.070> you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
in the classroom and that means that you

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.420 
in the classroom and that means that you
have<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.580> have<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.850> flexibility<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.530> pay

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
have to have the flexibility to pay

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.070 
have to have the flexibility to pay
teachers<00:01:21.820> more<00:01:21.850> when<00:01:22.450> their<00:01:22.570> students<00:01:22.930> are

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
teachers more when their students are

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.480 
teachers more when their students are
doing<00:01:23.110> better<00:01:23.320> because<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.830> need<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.130> retain

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
doing better because you need to retain

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.219 
doing better because you need to retain
them<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.060> means<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.600> you<00:01:25.810> need<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
them it means that you need to have the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.380 
them it means that you need to have the
flexibility<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.009> say<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.520> some<00:01:27.970> teachers

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
flexibility to say to some teachers

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.820 
flexibility to say to some teachers

who've been in the classroom for six or
eight<00:01:29.950> months<00:01:29.979> you<00:01:30.880> know<00:01:31.000> this<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.659> not

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
eight months you know this is not

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.080 
eight months you know this is not
working<00:01:32.619> out<00:01:32.860> perfectly<00:01:33.400> maybe<00:01:33.670> you<00:01:33.880> want<00:01:34.030> to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
working out perfectly maybe you want to

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.120 
working out perfectly maybe you want to
consider<00:01:34.420> doing<00:01:35.110> something<00:01:35.439> else<00:01:35.710> with<00:01:35.979> your

life because there are other jobs and it
also<00:01:39.280> means<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:39.970> need<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.570> the

also means that you need to have the

also means that you need to have the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
all of those types of flexibility which

all of those types of flexibility which
we<00:01:48.250> think<00:01:48.369> are<00:01:48.520> crucial<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.060> successful
