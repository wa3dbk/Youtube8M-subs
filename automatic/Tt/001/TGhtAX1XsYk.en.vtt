there there you go nice you see that
doesn't<00:05:14.820> obscure<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.360> view<00:05:15.510> at<00:05:15.630> all<00:05:15.720> which<00:05:16.020> is

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
doesn't obscure the view at all which is

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.730 
doesn't obscure the view at all which is
nice<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:17.340> it's<00:05:18.120> nice<00:05:18.330> it's<00:05:18.960> nice<00:05:19.080> extra

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
nice and it's nice it's nice extra

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.880 
nice and it's nice it's nice extra
surface<00:05:20.010> on<00:05:20.370> top<00:05:20.610> so<00:05:21.450> that<00:05:21.660> basically<00:05:21.900> when<00:05:22.740> we

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
surface on top so that basically when we

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.750 
surface on top so that basically when we
open<00:05:23.700> little<00:05:23.850> programs<00:05:24.470> like<00:05:25.670> you<00:05:26.670> know

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
open little programs like you know

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.230 
open little programs like you know
Netflix<00:05:27.270> and<00:05:27.630> go<00:05:28.200> till<00:05:28.440> like<00:05:28.650> say<00:05:28.800> something

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
like my sketchbook Pro for example pull

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.010 
like my sketchbook Pro for example pull
the<00:05:36.180> pin<00:05:36.330> out<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:38.390> he<00:05:39.390> doesn't<00:05:39.570> obscure<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
the pin out and he doesn't obscure the

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.500 
the pin out and he doesn't obscure the
view<00:05:40.140> at<00:05:40.260> all<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:42.170> can<00:05:43.170> now<00:05:43.290> draw<00:05:44.510> without

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
view at all and I can now draw without

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.660 
view at all and I can now draw without
worrying<00:05:45.720> about<00:05:46.100> roughing<00:05:47.100> up<00:05:47.190> the<00:05:47.250> screen

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
worrying about roughing up the screen

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.450 
worrying about roughing up the screen
although<00:05:48.360> I<00:05:48.450> must<00:05:48.630> admit<00:05:48.890> this<00:05:49.890> one<00:05:50.190> surface

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
although I must admit this one surface

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.760 
although I must admit this one surface
does<00:05:50.700> add<00:05:50.910> it<00:05:51.630> actually<00:05:51.900> affects<00:05:52.440> the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
does add it actually affects the

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.400 
does add it actually affects the
smoothness<00:05:53.550> a<00:05:53.580> little<00:05:53.880> bit<00:05:54.030> of<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.390> s-pen<00:05:54.900> and

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
smoothness a little bit of the s-pen and

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.100 
smoothness a little bit of the s-pen and
I'm<00:05:55.920> actually<00:05:56.430> why<00:05:56.610> it's<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:56.970> little<00:05:57.180> it's

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
I'm actually why it's a little it's

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.340 
I'm actually why it's a little it's
catches<00:05:58.530> it<00:05:58.650> ever<00:05:59.100> so<00:05:59.250> slightly<00:05:59.280> so<00:06:00.060> I<00:06:00.480> think

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
catches it ever so slightly so I think

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.070 
catches it ever so slightly so I think
we're<00:06:01.500> getting<00:06:01.620> used<00:06:01.920> to<00:06:02.040> so<00:06:02.370> I'm<00:06:02.460> not<00:06:02.640> sure

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
we're getting used to so I'm not sure

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.200 
we're getting used to so I'm not sure
what<00:06:04.080> to<00:06:04.200> make<00:06:04.230> of<00:06:04.380> it<00:06:04.590> but<00:06:04.760> it<00:06:05.760> does<00:06:05.970> add<00:06:06.180> that

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
what to make of it but it does add that

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.540 
what to make of it but it does add that
extra<00:06:06.480> layer<00:06:06.780> of<00:06:06.870> protection<00:06:07.290> so<00:06:07.950> Japan<00:06:08.340> it

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
extra layer of protection so Japan it

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.210 
extra layer of protection so Japan it
depends<00:06:08.820> if<00:06:08.910> if<00:06:09.150> you<00:06:09.570> want<00:06:10.140> that<00:06:10.410> but<00:06:11.010> it<00:06:11.100> does

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
depends if if you want that but it does

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.440 
depends if if you want that but it does
feel<00:06:11.400> a<00:06:11.460> little<00:06:11.640> rougher<00:06:11.970> now<00:06:12.120> it<00:06:12.300> doesn't

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:12.450 
feel a little rougher now it doesn't

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.510 
feel a little rougher now it doesn't
actually<00:06:13.050> doesn't<00:06:13.290> doesn't<00:06:14.100> this<00:06:14.340> one

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
actually doesn't doesn't this one

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.850 
actually doesn't doesn't this one
doesn't<00:06:14.670> glide<00:06:15.000> as<00:06:15.180> smoothly<00:06:15.450> as<00:06:15.630> it<00:06:15.750> does<00:06:15.930> in

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
doesn't glide as smoothly as it does in

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.800 
doesn't glide as smoothly as it does in
the<00:06:17.850> past<00:06:18.060> I<00:06:18.180> might<00:06:18.270> be<00:06:18.390> just<00:06:18.540> about<00:06:18.630> this

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
the past I might be just about this

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.660 
the past I might be just about this
might<00:06:19.050> be<00:06:19.140> just<00:06:19.320> having<00:06:19.740> to<00:06:20.010> break<00:06:20.250> this<00:06:20.400> in<00:06:20.580> a

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
might be just having to break this in a

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.450 
might be just having to break this in a
little<00:06:20.760> bit<00:06:20.970> and<00:06:21.210> and<00:06:22.200> stuff<00:06:22.500> but<00:06:22.740> something

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
little bit and and stuff but something

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.690 
little bit and and stuff but something
to<00:06:23.520> think<00:06:23.610> about

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:25.700 
to think about

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.350 
to think about
yeah<00:06:26.700> so<00:06:27.950> but<00:06:28.950> once<00:06:29.430> again<00:06:29.490> if<00:06:29.850> you're<00:06:30.060> if

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
yeah so but once again if you're if

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.660 
yeah so but once again if you're if
you're<00:06:30.390> a<00:06:30.540> rough<00:06:30.870> on<00:06:31.080> your<00:06:31.260> devices<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:32.100> you

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
you're a rough on your devices and you

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.790 
you're a rough on your devices and you
put<00:06:32.880> a<00:06:32.910> lot<00:06:33.030> and<00:06:33.150> you<00:06:33.210> have<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.360> heavy<00:06:33.570> hand<00:06:33.990> you

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
put a lot and you have a heavy hand you

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.320 
put a lot and you have a heavy hand you
may<00:06:34.920> want<00:06:35.100> to<00:06:35.130> consider<00:06:35.430> it<00:06:35.700> if<00:06:35.910> you<00:06:36.210> don't

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
may want to consider it if you don't

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.760 
may want to consider it if you don't
want<00:06:36.480> to<00:06:36.540> scuff<00:06:36.780> up<00:06:36.930> through<00:06:37.080> the<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:37.290> gorilla
