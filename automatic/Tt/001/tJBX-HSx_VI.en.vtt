here again to the seventh fret so they

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:40.490 
here again to the seventh fret so they
do<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:24.780> slow<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> really<00:02:39.390> weird<00:02:40.049> one<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.349> play

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.289 
do that slow so really weird one to play
slow<00:02:40.799> because<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.069> know<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.700> know<00:02:41.790> sliding

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
slow because you know you know sliding

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:43.670 
slow because you know you know sliding
slow<00:02:42.540> just<00:02:42.750> turns<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.079> into<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.290> completely

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
slow just turns it into a completely

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.949 
slow just turns it into a completely
different<00:02:44.040> sound<00:02:50.450> but<00:02:51.450> anyway<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.810> get<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
different sound but anyway you get the

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.449 
different sound but anyway you get the
idea<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.290> important<00:02:52.709> part<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.069> keep<00:02:53.310> it

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459
