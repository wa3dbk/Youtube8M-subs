on itself it kind of automatically does

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.869 
on itself it kind of automatically does
it<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.530> then<00:00:53.930> over<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> tree<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.989> just

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
place it towards the back take a tree

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.500 
place it towards the back take a tree
branch<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.280> twist<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.430> around<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:20.060 

it's<00:01:11.260> not<00:01:11.380> far<00:01:11.590> back<00:01:12.450> here<00:01:13.450> we<00:01:13.540> go

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:31.020 

and<00:01:21.070> then<00:01:21.370> I'll<00:01:21.760> add<00:01:22.000> one<00:01:22.480> more<00:01:22.660> right<00:01:22.840> here

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.830 

so<00:01:32.030> what<00:01:32.480> this<00:01:32.630> does<00:01:32.870> is<00:01:33.230> this<00:01:33.800> style<00:01:34.580> I<00:01:35.030> think

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
so what this does is this style I think

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.650 
so what this does is this style I think
is<00:01:37.330> more<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.630> wimps<00:01:38.960> whimsical<00:01:39.620> look<00:01:43.660> this

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
is more of a wimps whimsical look this

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.080 
is more of a wimps whimsical look this
would<00:01:44.900> be<00:01:45.080> really<00:01:45.320> pretty<00:01:45.680> with<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.790> mesh

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
would be really pretty with the mesh

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.320 
would be really pretty with the mesh
that<00:01:47.660> have<00:01:47.990> like<00:01:48.440> the<00:01:48.710> red<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.120> lime-green

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
that have like the red and lime-green

00:01:50.330 --> 00:02:01.880 
that have like the red and lime-green
colors<00:01:51.080> with<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.770> stripe

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:22.010
