crusty land I think it's really nice in

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.159 
crusty land I think it's really nice in
my<00:05:54.580> opinion<00:05:54.700> and<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.510> people<00:05:55.780> I've<00:05:55.870> already

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
my opinion and the people I've already

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:57.840 
my opinion and the people I've already
showed<00:05:56.380> so<00:05:56.650> far<00:05:56.890> I<00:05:56.919> think<00:05:56.979> it's<00:05:57.190> nice<00:05:57.430> as<00:05:57.610> well

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850

but I'm always nice to see you guys
think<00:06:00.490> and<00:06:00.760> probably<00:06:01.720> the<00:06:01.900> most<00:06:02.050> like<00:06:02.800> cool

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
think and probably the most like cool

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.040 
think and probably the most like cool
feature<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.520> think<00:06:03.880> is<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.419> I've<00:06:04.539> made<00:06:04.780> like

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
feature I think is that I've made like

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.770 
feature I think is that I've made like
lines<00:06:05.590> out<00:06:06.010> of<00:06:06.039> fences<00:06:06.610> like<00:06:06.789> people<00:06:07.720> to

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
lines out of fences like people to

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.960 
lines out of fences like people to
actually<00:06:07.930> wait<00:06:08.350> and<00:06:08.590> get<00:06:08.710> on<00:06:08.919> I've<00:06:09.550> done<00:06:09.820> that

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
actually wait and get on I've done that

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.350 
actually wait and get on I've done that
for<00:06:10.030> I<00:06:10.570> think<00:06:11.200> all<00:06:11.470> or<00:06:12.070> most<00:06:12.490> of<00:06:12.669> the<00:06:12.729> rides<00:06:13.030> I'm

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
for I think all or most of the rides I'm

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.890 
for I think all or most of the rides I'm
pretty<00:06:13.570> sure<00:06:13.780> but<00:06:15.419> just<00:06:16.419> a<00:06:16.479> really<00:06:16.750> nice

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
pretty sure but just a really nice

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.750 
pretty sure but just a really nice
feature<00:06:17.169> and<00:06:17.650> I<00:06:17.919> like<00:06:18.130> that<00:06:18.250> they<00:06:18.400> you<00:06:18.729> know

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
feature and I like that they you know

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.020

allow<00:06:19.060> us<00:06:19.240> to<00:06:19.419> do<00:06:19.570> that<00:06:19.750> and<00:06:20.190> I<00:06:21.190> really<00:06:21.820> wanted

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
allow us to do that and I really wanted

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.760 
allow us to do that and I really wanted
to<00:06:22.090> take<00:06:22.240> advantage<00:06:22.539> of<00:06:22.840> those<00:06:22.960> fences<00:06:23.470> and

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
even use any of the land so I mean I

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.540 
even use any of the land so I mean I
could<00:06:29.289> have<00:06:29.380> spread<00:06:29.560> this<00:06:29.770> out<00:06:29.919> a<00:06:29.979> lot<00:06:30.250> more

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550
