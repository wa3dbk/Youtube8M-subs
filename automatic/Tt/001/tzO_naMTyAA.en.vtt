00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
was thinking basically in between last

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.690 
was thinking basically in between last
episode<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.439> episode<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.219> guys<00:01:59.340> missed

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
episode in this episode you guys missed

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.260 
episode in this episode you guys missed
it<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.939> threw<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.509> my<00:02:01.549> Venus<00:02:02.549> or<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.090> mess

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it I threw out my Venus or just to mess

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.050 
it I threw out my Venus or just to mess
around<00:02:03.420> with<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.020> think<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.439> l<00:02:04.740> eight<00:02:05.060> 177

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
around with I think it was l eight 177

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
around with I think it was l eight 177
and<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.750> caught<00:02:07.259> my<00:02:07.680> Venus<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.280> fire<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and I caught my Venus or on fire and

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.520 
and I caught my Venus or on fire and
he's<00:02:08.849> running<00:02:08.970> around<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> idea

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
he's running around so this is the idea

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.860 
he's running around so this is the idea
to<00:02:10.950> protect<00:02:11.340> from<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.819> happening<00:02:12.270> again<00:02:12.360> so

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
to protect from that happening again so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.940 
to protect from that happening again so
basically<00:02:13.260> we're<00:02:13.349> just<00:02:13.379> going<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.620> build

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
basically we're just going to build

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.530 
basically we're just going to build
Towers<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.610> side<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.270> right

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
Towers up on the side like that right

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.630 
Towers up on the side like that right
and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:16.379> we're<00:02:16.530> gonna<00:02:16.620> in<00:02:16.830> case<00:02:17.129> this<00:02:17.340> fire

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and then we're gonna in case this fire

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.949 
and then we're gonna in case this fire
so<00:02:17.910> then<00:02:18.090> basically<00:02:18.269> what<00:02:18.690> we're<00:02:18.780> gonna<00:02:18.870> be

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959
