00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello how am I just hernandez and this 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.040
 it's my last meal with julen we're in 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.040
 the 9th 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.390
 and I will not miss the truth 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:22.050
 in these nine days I have consumed nine 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 bags like these but full worthy of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.490
 powder of about 500 grams of boyle in 525 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.489
 more or less the average per bag of four 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:39.570
 different flavors chocolate banana 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:42.540
 vanilla and strawberry had three vanilla 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.180
 two chocolate two banana and two 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.130
 strawberry and I told you I do not know why 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.430
 It was theoretically the challenge, it was ten days 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.070
 but I got nine bags and nothing 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.440
 finished today is already this is the last 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:00.100
 shake that it was about time I have some 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.590
 desire to eat that you do not know well 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.890
 as I have already commented many times 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.500
 you go hungry I have lost two kilos 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.570
 this morning I weigh 85 three are two 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.380
 exact kilos since I started on day 9 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.920
 which is pretty good almost a kilo 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.720
 and something per week would be the average but 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.350
 I repeat again that this is not for 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.539
 lose weight is a diet in quotation marks of 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.560
 that gives you 100% of the nutrients 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:32.950
 daily but you have 2119 calories if you do not 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.979
 you move to the best in fat and if it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.429
 better what in 2,119 calories are not 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.580
 for you you have to check with your 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.350
 height with your weight and with your activity 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.720
 daily what are the calories that you 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.869
 are needed for your body to be 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.659
 completely satisfied in my case with 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.399
 the height and the weight I had more or 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.440
 less yes, what were these calories 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.500
 I needed them with a little activity 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.750
 daily physical because the managed to do not 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.350
 just keep me if I do not lose weight a bit 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.880
 lose a little weight something that for another 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.250
 part with a normal diet 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.980
 balanced with a number of calories 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.709
 more or less the same would happen exactly what 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.709
 same then it's not miraculous it's a 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.860
 substitute for the food if 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.690
 I would recommend for someone yes the truth 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.750
 I would recommend them but 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.730
 always combining with some more food 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.099
 that nothing so that you do not have the monkey that 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.290
 I have to eat right now that I'm 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.890
 Looking forward to tomorrow so I can 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.810
 I planted on the plate and eat whatever 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.989
 the truth that has been an experience 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.120
 nice different everyone has 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.420
 said I was crazy I got it 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.549
 at the end and that gratifies you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.230
 personally it is a challenge and in the end 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.349
 end of the day is an achievement that you have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.799
 to aim I invite you to try it 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.400
 because it's quite economical the other day 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.470
 talking to my partner marc 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.390
 We commented a bit on the subject and that is 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.420
 clear when you're hungry you go to 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.050
 mcdonald burden kilo all these things and 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.290
 when it costs you dinner 678 euros according to 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.380
 this goes to two euros the food if the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.810
 you make the fat to the 175 grams that 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.360
 would be three shots a day yo I'm 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.650
 making 55 shots a day that are 105 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.220
 grams because I drink it much better and it's 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.420
 kindest truth with others 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.210
 note a lot 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.730
 has a lot of grumo if it does not happen very 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.310
 ok with that with five meals a day 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.220
 that they would skip about 400 and little 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.490
 calories 450 calories more or less 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.170
 it would come out at a 20 euro 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.520
 If you are hungry this will not take away 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.620
 good hunger itself takes away hunger 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.430
 because when you take it you are 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.470
 sated and you feel good is healthy because 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.110
 carries everything he needs the 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.090
 body the necessary nutrients and the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.010
 true that it's economical to leave 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.990
 trip a weekend you get two 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.330
 bags of these and arranged you know that 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.180
 you will not spend anything more than that and not 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.940
 you are going to die here you have proof of 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.940
