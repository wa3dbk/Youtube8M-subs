00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
a pattern and then I just traced it onto

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.820 
a pattern and then I just traced it onto
all<00:01:11.310> those<00:01:11.520> pieces<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.479> showed<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
this pattern is going to be four and a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.270 
this pattern is going to be four and a
half<00:01:17.460> inches<00:01:17.850> tall<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.630> then<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.979> gonna<00:01:20.189> be

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
half inches tall and then it's gonna be

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
half inches tall and then it's gonna be
four<00:01:20.729> inches<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.299> top<00:01:21.450> which<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.259> fit

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
four inches at the top which will fit

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.090 
four inches at the top which will fit
about<00:01:23.540> almost<00:01:24.540> perfectly<00:01:25.259> at<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.409> top<00:01:25.770> there

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
about almost perfectly at the top there

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.030 
about almost perfectly at the top there
and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.630> end<00:01:27.869> goes<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.799> two

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
and then that the end goes down to two

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460 
and then that the end goes down to two
and<00:01:29.070> 3/4<00:01:29.850> inches<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.479> how<00:01:30.689> wide<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and 3/4 inches that's how wide that is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.370 
and 3/4 inches that's how wide that is
so<00:01:32.159> all<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.400> did<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.090> set<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
so all I did was I set it on here and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.899 
so all I did was I set it on here and
then<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.670> traced<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:40.130> don't<00:01:41.130> cringe<00:01:41.579> when

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
then I just traced it don't cringe when

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.819 
then I just traced it don't cringe when
you<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> scissors<00:01:42.750> I'm<00:01:42.930> gonna<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.380> these

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you see the scissors I'm gonna use these

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.469 
you see the scissors I'm gonna use these
are<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.460> ribbon<00:01:44.820> scissors<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.450> I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
are actually ribbon scissors but I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.260 
are actually ribbon scissors but I
designate<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:47.100> pair<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:48.229> cardstock

designate this pair just for cardstock

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.109 
designate this pair just for cardstock
so<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.630> cut<00:01:51.840> along<00:01:52.079> those<00:01:52.320> lines<00:01:56.119> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119

know<00:03:46.860> how<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.160> use<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.700> you're<00:03:47.940> gonna<00:03:48.060> line

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
know how to use this you're gonna line

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.530 
know how to use this you're gonna line
up<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.890> scallop<00:03:49.890> with<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.519> pattern<00:03:51.360> that's

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
up that scallop with the pattern that's

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:05.080 
up that scallop with the pattern that's
on<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.840> punch<00:04:02.540> now<00:04:03.540> for<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.019> card<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.530> did<00:04:04.739> not

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
on the punch now for this card I did not

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.680 
on the punch now for this card I did not
tape<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.330> shut

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
tape it shut

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.100 
tape it shut
on<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.050> sides<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.739> reason<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.430> because

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
on the sides and the reason is because

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.500 
on the sides and the reason is because
if<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.260> tape<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.709> it's<00:04:10.920> going<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.580> get<00:04:11.760> even

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
if you tape it it's going to get even

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.350 
if you tape it it's going to get even
tighter<00:04:13.290> so<00:04:13.769> when<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.370> put<00:04:14.640> that<00:04:14.790> card<00:04:15.150> in

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
tighter so when you put that card in

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.630 
tighter so when you put that card in
it's<00:04:15.600> not<00:04:15.720> gonna<00:04:15.840> slide<00:04:16.200> up<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.590> down<00:04:16.680> very

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
it's not gonna slide up and down very

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.330 
it's not gonna slide up and down very
well<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:19.049> we're<00:04:19.380> just<00:04:19.410> going<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.799> tie<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.070> with

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
well so we're just going to tie it with

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.920 
well so we're just going to tie it with
this<00:04:20.489> ribbon<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.210> just<00:04:21.450> striping

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
this ribbon this is just striping

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.590 
this ribbon this is just striping
grosgrain<00:04:22.410> ribbon<00:04:22.950> and

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
this is just gonna prevent the card from

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.030 
this is just gonna prevent the card from
the<00:04:45.400> ribbon<00:04:45.850> from<00:04:46.090> sliding<00:04:46.480> down<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.350> what

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760 
but it really doesn't waste as much

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.170 
but it really doesn't waste as much
paper<00:06:45.030> as<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.680> piece<00:06:46.680> in<00:06:46.890> there<00:06:47.040> so<00:06:47.760> anyway<00:06:48.150> just

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 
use tape or if you prefer the tombow

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.730 
use tape or if you prefer the tombow
glue<00:07:23.330> but<00:07:24.330> the<00:07:24.510> little<00:07:24.750> trick<00:07:24.990> to<00:07:25.020> this<00:07:25.410> is

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
glue but the little trick to this is

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.610 
glue but the little trick to this is
you're<00:07:26.400> gonna<00:07:26.490> want<00:07:26.790> to<00:07:26.880> start<00:07:27.120> building<00:07:27.620> from

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 
you're gonna want to start building from

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.950 
you're gonna want to start building from
the<00:07:28.830> to<00:07:29.790> the<00:07:29.940> back

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
the to the back

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.370 
the to the back
and<00:07:31.800> so<00:07:32.340> that<00:07:32.670> you<00:07:33.120> see<00:07:33.300> how<00:07:33.480> I<00:07:33.510> started<00:07:34.140> back

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
and so that you see how I started back

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.150 
and so that you see how I started back
here<00:07:34.860> and<00:07:35.870> just<00:07:36.870> do<00:07:37.020> the<00:07:37.200> top<00:07:37.410> ones<00:07:37.710> here<00:07:38.010> and

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 
here and just do the top ones here and

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.010 
here and just do the top ones here and
you<00:07:38.310> want<00:07:38.520> to<00:07:38.610> kind<00:07:38.820> of<00:07:38.850> arc<00:07:39.150> it<00:07:39.450> and<00:07:39.690> then<00:07:39.810> just

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 
you want to kind of arc it and then just

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.380 
you want to kind of arc it and then just
layer<00:07:40.350> them<00:07:40.650> so<00:07:40.890> that<00:07:41.130> the<00:07:41.760> ones<00:07:41.970> that<00:07:42.150> are<00:07:42.270> on

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:42.390 
layer them so that the ones that are on

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.630 
layer them so that the ones that are on
top<00:07:42.630> are<00:07:42.900> in<00:07:43.020> the<00:07:43.110> front<00:07:43.440> and<00:07:43.800> I<00:07:44.010> would<00:07:44.220> maybe

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:44.640 
top are in the front and I would maybe

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.640 
top are in the front and I would maybe
go<00:07:44.910> down<00:07:45.150> I<00:07:45.180> measure<00:07:45.600> that's<00:07:45.870> about<00:07:46.290> an<00:07:46.500> inch

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:46.650 
go down I measure that's about an inch

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.430 
go down I measure that's about an inch
down<00:07:47.070> so<00:07:47.460> that's<00:07:47.670> about<00:07:47.850> how<00:07:48.540> far<00:07:48.810> down<00:07:48.990> you<00:07:49.260> go

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 
down so that's about how far down you go

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.730 
down so that's about how far down you go
so<00:07:50.430> I'll<00:07:51.060> just<00:07:51.240> move<00:07:51.450> that<00:07:51.660> to<00:07:51.870> the<00:07:52.050> side<00:07:52.080> but

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 
so I'll just move that to the side but

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.000 
so I'll just move that to the side but
you<00:07:52.890> kind<00:07:53.130> of<00:07:53.190> get<00:07:53.340> the<00:07:53.460> idea<00:07:53.490> and<00:07:54.090> then<00:07:55.010> put

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.010 
you kind of get the idea and then put

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.560 
you kind of get the idea and then put
your<00:07:56.220> gift<00:07:56.400> card<00:07:56.760> on<00:07:56.880> there<00:07:57.120> and<00:07:57.330> then<00:07:57.450> you
