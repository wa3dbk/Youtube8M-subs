do<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:24.989> think<00:03:25.110> is<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.350> be<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.500> most

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
do you think is going to be the most

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.979 
do you think is going to be the most
challenging<00:03:25.739> part<00:03:26.480> getting<00:03:27.480> Britt<00:03:27.750> off<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
challenging part getting Britt off the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.360 
challenging part getting Britt off the
ferry<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:28.320> think<00:03:28.680> we'll<00:03:28.799> probably<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> most

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
ferry I think we'll probably be the most

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.340 
ferry I think we'll probably be the most
challenging<00:03:29.519> part<00:03:30.209> was<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.690> got<00:03:30.840> these<00:03:30.930> fry<00:03:31.170> up

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
challenging part was it got these fry up

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.780 
challenging part was it got these fry up
and<00:03:31.530> his<00:03:31.620> shot<00:03:31.860> since<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.310> didn't<00:03:32.640> whilst

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
and his shot since I didn't whilst

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.340 
and his shot since I didn't whilst
imagine<00:03:33.150> would<00:03:33.269> have<00:03:33.390> to<00:03:33.510> carry<00:03:33.750> him<00:03:33.900> off<00:03:34.079> but

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
imagine would have to carry him off but

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.620 
imagine would have to carry him off but
other<00:03:35.130> than<00:03:35.220> that<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.670> think<00:03:36.239> we've<00:03:36.510> got<00:03:36.600> a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
other than that now I think we've got a

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
other than that now I think we've got a
little<00:03:36.720> bit<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.900> a<00:03:36.989> hill<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.140> start<00:03:37.500> with

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
little bit of a hill to start with

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.680 
little bit of a hill to start with
otherwise<00:03:37.950> now<00:03:38.220> can't<00:03:38.730> wait<00:03:38.850> looking<00:03:39.420> for<00:03:39.540> two

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
otherwise now can't wait looking for two

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.900 
otherwise now can't wait looking for two
