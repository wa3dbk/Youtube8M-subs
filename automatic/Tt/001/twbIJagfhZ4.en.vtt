and<00:02:18.330> Cena<00:02:18.570> wins<00:02:18.870> maybe<00:02:19.320> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> plan<00:02:20.190> or

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
and Cena wins maybe this is the plan or

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.790 
and Cena wins maybe this is the plan or
you<00:02:20.580> know<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.840> tough<00:02:22.020> match<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.560> call

you know it's it's a tough match to call
but<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> reason<00:02:23.550> why<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.820> went<00:02:24.180> with<00:02:24.390> Seth

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.340 
but the reason why it went with Seth
