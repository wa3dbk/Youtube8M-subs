00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
case and it is available in two colors

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
case and it is available in two colors
one<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.390> which<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.540> white<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> one

one of which is white which is the one
you<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> actual<00:00:38.579> system<00:00:39.030> built<00:00:39.239> in

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you see with the actual system built in

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.180 
you see with the actual system built in
it<00:00:39.480> now<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> other<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.829> black

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so we're using a seasonic 6 20 watt

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.620 
so we're using a seasonic 6 20 watt
power<00:01:41.130> supply<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.759> means<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.090> yes<00:01:42.420> you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
power supply which means that yes you

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.510 
power supply which means that yes you
can<00:01:42.810> go<00:01:42.960> sli<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:43.500> crossfire<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
can go sli or crossfire in this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.600 
can go sli or crossfire in this
configuration<00:01:44.880> with<00:01:45.810> no<00:01:46.380> sweat<00:01:46.799> we're<00:01:47.399> also

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
configuration with no sweat we're also

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.730 
configuration with no sweat we're also
using<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.390> gigabyte<00:01:48.869> motherboard<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.590> this

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
using a gigabyte motherboard here this

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.980 
using a gigabyte motherboard here this
is<00:01:49.829> an<00:01:49.920> am3+<00:01:50.430> board<00:01:50.970> supporting<00:01:51.509> both<00:01:51.659> well

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
is an am3+ board supporting both well

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.319 
is an am3+ board supporting both well
SLI<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.590> crossfire<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.030> default

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
SLI and crossfire so the default

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.499 
SLI and crossfire so the default
configuration<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.200> either<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.680> 68<00:01:56.189> 70<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.729> 560

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
configuration is either a 68 70 or a 560

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.429 
configuration is either a 68 70 or a 560
and<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:59.280> particular<00:01:59.520> one<00:01:59.880> has<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.270> 68<00:02:00.810> 70<00:02:01.320> in

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it what else we got here we got 16 gigs

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.709

sorry eight gigs is the default

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.130 
sorry eight gigs is the default
configuration<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.910> got<00:02:09.509> confused<00:02:09.750> because

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
configuration I got confused because

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
configuration I got confused because
when<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.410> saw<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.679> on<00:02:10.830> rub<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.220> Russians

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
when I saw it on rub the Russians

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.180 
when I saw it on rub the Russians
test<00:02:11.879> bench<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.420> saw<00:02:12.870> 16<00:02:13.230> gigs<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.830> reason

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
test bench I saw 16 gigs and the reason

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.160 
test bench I saw 16 gigs and the reason
he<00:02:14.220> was<00:02:14.459> testing<00:02:14.879> that<00:02:15.030> was<00:02:15.540> because<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.019> don't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
he was testing that was because I don't

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.600 
he was testing that was because I don't
know<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.349> you<00:02:16.440> can<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:16.950> logo<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.550> I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
know if you can see that logo in there I

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.759 
know if you can see that logo in there I
hope<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.629> there's<00:02:18.810> an<00:02:18.959> AMD<00:02:19.290> Radeon

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
hope you can but there's an AMD Radeon

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.619 
hope you can but there's an AMD Radeon
logo<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.280> memory<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.910> means<00:02:21.150> zero

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
logo on that memory that means zero

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.320

tweaking<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.470> AMD<00:02:22.980> chipsets<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:24.000> get<00:02:24.180> exactly

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
tweaking on AMD chipsets you get exactly

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.150 
tweaking on AMD chipsets you get exactly
what's<00:02:24.840> advertised<00:02:25.379> this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.769> something<00:02:26.129> that

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
what's advertised this is something that

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.070 
what's advertised this is something that
I<00:02:26.280> would<00:02:26.489> consider<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.030> be<00:02:27.150> sort<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.959> an

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
I would consider to be sort of an

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.160 
I would consider to be sort of an
equivalent<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.709> Intel<00:02:29.069> XMP<00:02:29.760> but<00:02:30.269> more<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.930> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
equivalent to Intel XMP but more on the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.990 
equivalent to Intel XMP but more on the
basis<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.650> compatibility<00:02:32.370> rather<00:02:32.790> than

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
basis of compatibility rather than

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.339 
basis of compatibility rather than
trying<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.330> squeeze<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> little<00:02:33.930> bit<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.230> extra

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
trying to squeeze a little bit of extra

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.470 
trying to squeeze a little bit of extra
performance<00:02:34.709> out<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.370> because<00:02:35.640> honestly

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
performance out of it because honestly

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.360 
performance out of it because honestly
memory<00:02:36.930> compatibility<00:02:37.709> from<00:02:37.920> my<00:02:38.069> perspective

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
memory compatibility from my perspective

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.759 
memory compatibility from my perspective
is<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> much<00:02:39.060> bigger<00:02:39.299> concern<00:02:39.840> than<00:02:40.110> memory

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
is a much bigger concern than memory

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.410 
is a much bigger concern than memory
performance<00:02:41.010> which<00:02:41.580> doesn't<00:02:41.940> impact<00:02:42.209> your

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
performance which doesn't impact your

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.000 
performance which doesn't impact your
system<00:02:42.750> performance<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.470> much<00:02:43.739> these<00:02:43.950> days

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
system performance that much these days

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.309 
system performance that much these days
so<00:02:44.519> basically<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.660> they're<00:02:45.810> going<00:02:45.959> for<00:02:46.049> is

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
so basically what they're going for is

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.050 
so basically what they're going for is
plug-and-play<00:02:46.590> perfect<00:02:47.310> compatibility<00:02:47.910> so

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
plug-and-play perfect compatibility so

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.789 
plug-and-play perfect compatibility so
that's<00:02:48.239> why<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.450> Russian<00:02:48.840> had<00:02:48.989> 16<00:02:49.380> gigs<00:02:49.650> of

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
that's why the Russian had 16 gigs of

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.410 
that's why the Russian had 16 gigs of
RAM<00:02:49.950> in<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.250> before<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.849> only<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.209> eight

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
RAM in there before but I only see eight

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.050 
RAM in there before but I only see eight
now<00:02:51.690> Oh<00:02:52.220> what<00:02:53.220> else<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:53.459> got<00:02:53.579> here<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.849> got<00:02:54.000> a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
now Oh what else we got here we got a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.600 
now Oh what else we got here we got a
one<00:02:54.269> terabyte<00:02:54.739> seagate<00:02:55.739> drive<00:02:56.130> we've<00:02:56.430> also

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
one terabyte seagate drive we've also

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.270 
one terabyte seagate drive we've also
got<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.360> cool<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.840> eco<00:02:58.319> cooler<00:02:58.860> which<00:02:59.040> actually

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
got a cool it eco cooler which actually

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.880 
got a cool it eco cooler which actually
has<00:02:59.670> a<00:03:00.000> push-pull<00:03:00.599> fan<00:03:00.870> configuration<00:03:01.650> on<00:03:01.769> it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
has a push-pull fan configuration on it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.500 
has a push-pull fan configuration on it
so<00:03:02.010> it's<00:03:02.130> using<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.459> stock<00:03:02.700> fan<00:03:02.910> back<00:03:03.180> here

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
so it's using the stock fan back here

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.660 
so it's using the stock fan back here
and<00:03:03.660> then<00:03:04.110> an<00:03:04.200> aftermarket<00:03:04.620> fan<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.250> match<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and then an aftermarket fan to match the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.069 
and then an aftermarket fan to match the
ones<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.150> up<00:03:06.269> in<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.510> top<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.900> case

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
ones that are up in the top of the case

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.750 
ones that are up in the top of the case
right<00:03:07.319> there<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.739> we've<00:03:07.860> got<00:03:07.980> three<00:03:08.310> red<00:03:08.519> fans

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
right there so we've got three red fans

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.039 
right there so we've got three red fans
you're<00:03:08.940> going<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.120> have<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.299> ton<00:03:09.569> of<00:03:09.599> cooling

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
you're going to have a ton of cooling

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.220 
you're going to have a ton of cooling
here<00:03:10.230> we<00:03:10.739> are<00:03:10.920> using<00:03:11.160> an<00:03:11.489> FX<00:03:11.880> 4100<00:03:12.390> quad-core

you'll<00:04:00.480> probably<00:04:00.690> need<00:04:01.019> an<00:04:01.170> adapter<00:04:01.620> if<00:04:01.709> you

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
you'll probably need an adapter if you

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.289 
you'll probably need an adapter if you

system<00:04:03.599> which<00:04:03.690> I<00:04:03.810> would<00:04:03.989> definitely

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
system which I would definitely

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.490 
system which I would definitely
recommend<00:04:04.730> because<00:04:05.730> at<00:04:05.910> 999<00:04:06.599> we<00:04:06.989> can't<00:04:07.290> really

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
recommend because at 999 we can't really

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.580 
recommend because at 999 we can't really
get<00:04:07.799> an<00:04:07.889> SSD<00:04:08.400> into<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.819> budget<00:04:08.970> but<00:04:09.500> it's<00:04:10.500> a

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
get an SSD into the budget but it's a

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.710 
get an SSD into the budget but it's a
pretty<00:04:10.859> good<00:04:11.099> incremental<00:04:11.760> upgrade<00:04:12.209> I<00:04:12.389> think

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
pretty good incremental upgrade I think

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.690 
pretty good incremental upgrade I think
that<00:04:12.930> pretty<00:04:13.200> much<00:04:13.319> yeah<00:04:13.980> again<00:04:14.220> no<00:04:14.340> no<00:04:14.489> hold

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
that pretty much yeah again no no hold

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.400 
that pretty much yeah again no no hold
on<00:04:14.790> there's<00:04:14.970> more<00:04:15.030> okay<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:15.780> I'm<00:04:16.200> going<00:04:16.380> to
