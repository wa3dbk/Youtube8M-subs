and i only have the skin colors so um
yeah<00:01:21.289> i<00:01:21.320> have<00:01:21.920> i'm<00:01:22.430> going<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.670> get<00:01:22.970> them<00:01:23.090> all

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.660 
yeah i have i'm going to get them all
out<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:23.720> i<00:01:24.259> think<00:01:24.590> this<00:01:24.920> is<00:01:25.130> like<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.430> perfect

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
out so i think this is like the perfect

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.340 
out so i think this is like the perfect
set<00:01:26.210> because<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.630> has<00:01:26.780> like<00:01:26.930> all<00:01:27.140> different

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
set because it has like all different

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.389 
set because it has like all different
shades<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:28.640> my<00:01:29.299> first<00:01:29.539> is<00:01:29.810> e<00:01:30.170> 50<00:01:30.649> eggshell<00:01:31.159> and

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
shades so my first is e 50 eggshell and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.130 
shades so my first is e 50 eggshell and
i<00:01:32.300> really<00:01:32.539> like<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:32.869> at<00:01:33.110> my<00:01:33.409> lightest<00:01:33.830> tone<00:01:34.100> i

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
i really like this at my lightest tone i

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.540 
i really like this at my lightest tone i
also<00:01:36.140> like<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.740> second<00:01:37.159> tool<00:01:37.280> that<00:01:37.460> i<00:01:37.520> use

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
also like the second tool that i use

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.809 
also like the second tool that i use
which<00:01:37.940> is<00:01:38.060> e<00:01:38.240> 53<00:01:38.810> raw<00:01:39.200> silk<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.920> i<00:01:43.190> usually

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
which is e 53 raw silk then i usually

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.389 
which is e 53 raw silk then i usually
will<00:01:44.060> use<00:01:44.330> a<00:01:44.600> 11<00:01:45.140> which<00:01:45.319> is<00:01:45.350> barely<00:01:45.710> beige<00:01:46.069> I

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
will use a 11 which is barely beige I

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.130 
will use a 11 which is barely beige I
don't<00:01:46.819> really<00:01:47.030> use<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.360> powder<00:01:47.539> pink<00:01:47.869> just

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
don't really use the powder pink just

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.840 
don't really use the powder pink just
because<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:48.590> like<00:01:48.770> messes<00:01:49.280> up<00:01:49.399> the<00:01:49.550> blending

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
because it like messes up the blending

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.279 
because it like messes up the blending
because<00:01:50.000> these<00:01:50.149> are<00:01:50.360> like<00:01:50.479> more<00:01:50.659> like<00:01:50.690> sandy

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
because these are like more like sandy

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.320 
because these are like more like sandy
colors<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.830> this<00:01:52.340> is<00:01:52.460> like<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.610> pinkish<00:01:53.090> I'll

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
colors and this is like a pinkish I'll

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.169 
colors and this is like a pinkish I'll
usually<00:01:53.509> use<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.170> yr<00:01:54.500> 0<00:01:54.770> 0<00:01:55.159> with<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.490> e<00:01:55.640> double

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
usually use the yr 0 0 with the e double

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.510 
usually use the yr 0 0 with the e double
zero<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:57.470> I'll<00:01:57.590> put<00:01:57.709> this<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.039> side<00:01:58.159> and

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
zero so I'll put this to the side and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.680 
zero so I'll put this to the side and
this<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.789> powder<00:01:59.030> pink<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.850> as<00:02:02.179> my<00:02:02.330> darker

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
this is powder pink and as my darker

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.139 
this is powder pink and as my darker
shading<00:02:03.170> tone<00:02:03.350> i<00:02:03.590> usually<00:02:03.979> do<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:04.310> 95<00:02:04.820> flesh

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
shading tone i usually do you 95 flesh

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.359

um<00:05:37.270> another<00:05:38.270> bv<00:05:38.780> i<00:05:38.810> have<00:05:39.169> is<00:05:39.350> bv<00:05:39.770> 08<00:05:40.190> which<00:05:40.880> is

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
um another bv i have is bv 08 which is

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.630 
um another bv i have is bv 08 which is
like<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.210> very<00:05:41.570> very<00:05:41.840> dark<00:05:42.140> deep<00:05:42.710> blue<00:05:43.310> purple

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:45.980 
and i think it could like be similar to

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.000 
and i think it could like be similar to
like<00:05:46.250> you<00:05:46.730> can<00:05:46.910> use<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.090> first<00:05:47.360> sky<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:48.110> then<00:05:48.950> i

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
like you can use a first sky and then i

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.480 
like you can use a first sky and then i
also<00:05:49.100> have<00:05:49.700> BVO<00:05:50.600> for<00:05:51.290> which<00:05:51.830> is<00:05:52.010> blueberry

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
also have BVO for which is blueberry

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.850 
also have BVO for which is blueberry
right<00:05:52.820> here<00:05:53.090> and<00:05:53.270> that<00:05:53.810> is<00:05:53.990> also<00:05:54.230> deep<00:05:54.650> it

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
right here and that is also deep it

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.470 
right here and that is also deep it
doesn't<00:05:55.190> look<00:05:55.280> deep<00:05:55.550> on<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.910> cat<00:05:56.120> but<00:05:56.390> it

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
doesn't look deep on the cat but it

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.350 
doesn't look deep on the cat but it
really<00:05:56.690> is<00:05:57.070> it's<00:05:58.070> like<00:05:58.340> I<00:05:58.460> think<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.760> used<00:05:59.030> all<00:05:59.270> I

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360

so<00:06:05.639> for<00:06:05.820> the<00:06:05.880> purple<00:06:06.300> I<00:06:06.479> have<00:06:06.630> like<00:06:06.750> a<00:06:06.900> lot<00:06:07.139> of

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:07.289 
so for the purple I have like a lot of

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:08.990 
so for the purple I have like a lot of
similar<00:06:07.680> shades<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.220> are<00:06:08.280> together<00:06:08.520> in<00:06:08.910> a

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
similar shades that are together in a

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.060 
similar shades that are together in a
group<00:06:09.210> and<00:06:09.419> that<00:06:10.110> will<00:06:10.229> be<00:06:10.320> v<00:06:10.530> 12<00:06:10.860> which<00:06:11.039> is

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
group and that will be v 12 which is

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.820 
group and that will be v 12 which is
light<00:06:11.780> v15<00:06:12.780> which<00:06:12.990> i<00:06:13.139> would<00:06:13.289> say<00:06:13.530> would<00:06:13.770> be

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
light v15 which i would say would be

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.640 
light v15 which i would say would be
like<00:06:14.100> a<00:06:14.130> normal<00:06:14.699> purple<00:06:15.120> and<00:06:15.300> then<00:06:15.690> v<00:06:15.930> 17<00:06:16.350> is

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
like a normal purple and then v 17 is

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.400 
like a normal purple and then v 17 is
just<00:06:16.830> a<00:06:16.919> tad<00:06:17.190> darker<00:06:17.610> so<00:06:18.539> I<00:06:18.570> like<00:06:18.930> that<00:06:19.229> group

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
just a tad darker so I like that group

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.790 
just a tad darker so I like that group
of<00:06:19.590> purples<00:06:19.949> that<00:06:20.070> I<00:06:20.100> have<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:20.850> then<00:06:21.780> for<00:06:22.380> the
