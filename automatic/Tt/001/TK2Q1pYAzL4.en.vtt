00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
xbox now that sometimes it doesn't

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.319 
xbox now that sometimes it doesn't
connect<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.459> internet<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.000> then<00:03:15.090> when<00:03:15.209> it

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
connect to the internet and then when it

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:16.850 
connect to the internet and then when it
does<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.690> nukes<00:03:15.900> everything<00:03:16.350> else<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.769> the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
does it nukes everything else on the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.560 
does it nukes everything else on the
fucking<00:03:17.190> network<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.700> can't<00:03:17.940> figure<00:03:18.150> out<00:03:18.239> why

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
fucking network I can't figure out why

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.660 
fucking network I can't figure out why
it's<00:03:19.350> probably<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.799> port<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.370> probably<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's probably the port it's probably the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.910 
it's probably the port it's probably the
DNS<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.360> don't<00:03:21.540> fucking<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:21.930> wireless<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
DNS I don't fucking know wireless is a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.860 
DNS I don't fucking know wireless is a
completely<00:03:23.310> different<00:03:23.700> beast<00:03:23.880> than<00:03:24.060> Wyatt<00:03:24.480> I

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
completely different beast than Wyatt I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.840 
completely different beast than Wyatt I
have<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.709> little<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.100> history<00:03:26.370> with<00:03:26.610> wired

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
have a little bit of history with wired

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.460 
have a little bit of history with wired
networks<00:03:27.329> but<00:03:27.600> I've<00:03:27.690> run<00:03:27.810> out<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.989> ethernet

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
networks but I've run out of ethernet

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.319 
networks but I've run out of ethernet
port<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:28.980> can't<00:03:29.250> really<00:03:29.430> use<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.209> be

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
port so I can't really use it to be

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.699 
port so I can't really use it to be
wired<00:03:31.130> which<00:03:32.130> sucks<00:03:32.549> um<00:03:33.230> but<00:03:34.230> yeah<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.380> used<00:03:34.620> to

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
wired which sucks um but yeah I used to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.590 
wired which sucks um but yeah I used to
have<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.860> problem<00:03:35.190> back<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.640> day<00:03:35.820> when<00:03:36.209> you

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
have a problem back in the day when you

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.509 
have a problem back in the day when you
pick<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.959> phone<00:03:37.170> up<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:38.070> would<00:03:38.160> nuke<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
pick the phone up and it would nuke the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.009 
pick the phone up and it would nuke the
internet<00:03:38.880> my<00:03:39.030> figured<00:03:39.329> out<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.900> was<00:03:39.989> a

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
internet my figured out that it was a

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.420 
internet my figured out that it was a
poor<00:03:40.290> thing<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.739> I've<00:03:40.799> changed<00:03:40.829> ports

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
poor thing and I've changed ports

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.069 
poor thing and I've changed ports
figured<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.239> don't<00:03:42.390> know<00:03:42.480> why<00:03:42.720> it's

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
figured that so I don't know why it's

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.780 
figured that so I don't know why it's
been<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> bitch<00:03:43.769> recently<00:03:44.340> it's<00:03:44.489> only<00:03:44.670> just
