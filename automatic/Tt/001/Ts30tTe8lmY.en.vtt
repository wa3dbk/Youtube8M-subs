00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 today we will be the nintendo of pokémon 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.969
 but we will only talk about the games the animal is a 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.700
 case that will be addressed 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 later when creating a pokémon red 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.109
 come, they had already planned their 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.420
 sequence that would introduce new 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.039
 pokémons our mechanics to the game and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.320
 would continue with the history of the first 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.689
 generation boy left a journey to 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 complete pokédex and win all 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.590
 gyms and then face the league to 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.780
 to become a champion 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.630
 after making a champion he expects none 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.879
 pollutant strong enough to win 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.410
 the idea was for players to create a 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200
 character who became a master 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.879
 pokémon and with the second generation the same 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.100
 player has the opportunity to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.379
 win mexico because you really monkeys 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.149
 created this to be the end of the franchise 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 however the game was very successful 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.980
 so they decided to stay ahead 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.570
 and so the third generation was born 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.129
 but it does not follow a direct line of 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.440
 time with the other games 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.789
 good first we explain why that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 the second generation following a line 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.799
 direct with the first to second generation 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.810
 three years after the first 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.369
 this is proven in the game itself where 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.909
 the actions of the first generation player 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.680
 are said to have occurred three years earlier 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.990
 and that for you to change your Pokemon 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.590
 corner with joined you should use call 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 team wants that the time capsule 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 allows exchanges with the passing of our 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.490
 that parents of different time than the two 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.680
 first generations 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.140
 What can not happen, this happens 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.060
 fact that when the third 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.430
 generation 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.899
 opportunity to visit the series because 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.970
 although obviously not allow 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.950
 exchange with previous games 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.299
 to solve this problem is to 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.030
 launch the movement of the first generation 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:50.119
 but when switching pokémons the third 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.369
 generation with games fire régine order there are no 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.020
 need of the time capsule therefore 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.110
 many things believe that the third 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.329
 simultaneous generation with the first 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.920
 the games of milan seems to have influence 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.720
 some new chronological 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.060
 they have less need to use 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.580
 of the time capsule to exchange pokémons 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.140
 with rebound games made then pokémon 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.989
 cook comes soon after the first 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.180
 third generation and pokémon x must after 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.580
 the second because these solvents occur 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.440
 five years after leading the other games 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.209
 of Pokémon does not seem to be part of 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.549
 same size of main games 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.790
 receives little income that has a 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.280
 other fourth generation good reference 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.200
 speaking from the action a beginning of the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900
 game to a red cat reference 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.540
 in the second and if our events of the fourth 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.780
 generation occurs after the second the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.760
 during this because jasmine that appears 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.709
 both on the court and on the second round 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.000
 your chiliques with you in the heart games 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.100
 gold soul civil 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.709
 Let me explain this better in the game. 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.790
 tore its way before you 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.530
 the right number 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.989
 you can see that they and the lines are 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.160
 talking about garden going live 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.319
 in the new region 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.480
 this means that after the player 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.579
 will win the Libyan jasmine championship 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.709
 travel to the new region to participate 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.329
 of the competition, which competes against 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.340
 the main country of the generation using its 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.959
 titles 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.880
 so when she comes back to join her 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.150
 offers exchange with the player even 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.150
 movies 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.900
 also in the game tore silva is a member 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.640
 rocket team that says it will 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.590
 return to your homeland to 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.200
 reorganize and hip hop 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.239
 he returned to the new one but required this 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.040
 of the rocket team can already marry and have 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.330
 a son 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.580
 which shows that the events of the fifth 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.170
 generation occurs after the second that 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.060
 shows that it is only the one who comes after 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.160
 fourth is that the game Batman haiti 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.410
 then the player wins the first time 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.110
 time she says that he reminds her of a 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.150
 coach who faced gelatin and 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.459
 end of the timeline without point games 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.160
 black white two that passes two years 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.010
 after the events the blackboard this is 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.569
 called the game itself 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.790
 recapitulating the first generation and 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.530
 third occurs at the same time followed 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.470
 of pokémon cooks a little time later 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.590
 and after three years the second fourth 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.019
 the next generation just before him and 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.760
 so come fifth generation with black 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.610
 white and meg white of them 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.400
 but after all, the time passed from 16 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.440
 second part are already in play here 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.840
 neighborhood haiti training that was of the neighborhood 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.570
 whether it positioned and becomes a member of the 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.850
 elite of this picture but he does not look 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.610
 take 25 minutes so the fans speculate 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.150
 who has spent 57 years up 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.010
 black white 2 with that timeline 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.229
 that most fans believe until 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.000
 now we do not know exactly how 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.220
 sixth generation will affect 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.380
 I particularly believe in a line 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.720
 of time a little different where the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.449
 first to third I play cooking 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.400
 takes the same amount of time after three 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.050
 years comes the second and fourth generation 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.660
 occurring simultaneously 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.430
 after two years my game if it 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.860
 because we do not know that he had time and 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.699
 Cooking games this says exactly five 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.130
 years 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.050
 then after 2nd 4th generation passed 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.300
 three years ago black events 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.820
 then we have two more years until 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.479
 black white 2 totaling a new cycle 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.910
 five years as an alert for today is only 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:13.560
 but we even have more clicks like 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.240
 if you liked the favorite video 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.310
 share so that more people come 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.710
 have access to this information in 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.690
 add on facebook and sign up for 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.560

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.070
 weekly 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.070
 to the next
