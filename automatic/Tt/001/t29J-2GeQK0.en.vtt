00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello everyone guys are not drills 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.049
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.849
 finally the bungee has made public the 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.880
 special gift he had in store for 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.780
 get us for the new year and delivered it 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.570
 to the administrator at the post master 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.400
 so we're going to discard it together for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
 see what it is like you see 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.609
 I also have these other two 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.199
 packages I am accumulating for a 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.330
 another video where we'll split them together 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.150
 This is where the special orders are 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.730
 you will find everyone from the administrator or 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.890
 will deliver one per account and not one per 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 character then who of you had the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.489
 hope to get 23 based 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.170
 characters he owned 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.690
 I'm sorry but will be disappointed because of it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 will deliver repeat one per account is 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
 a weapon that is received we will go to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.649
 to see I hope for a primary weapon 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.329
 maybe a scout rifle see 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.750
 a little bit 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.250
 we hope for good the incredible one 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 that I already had that this game makes me 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 really really really pissing off 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.399
 see that I already have it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 with those same because also no ok 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 this is perhaps the best this I have 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.920
 found now it sucks a little 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.650
 but then let's see this here in damage 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.900
 like bow surplus then expect 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.840
 to find more ammo for this quest 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.369
 weapon and even if the self a stroke is missing the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.860
 target there is a chance that you will come back 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:25.259
 in the charger you see ldr 501 5100 praises 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.759
 let's jump happily because I keep myself 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.040
 I'll show you this here already 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.650
 we have to fire damage yet 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.140
 empower as a dragonfly perch 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.720
 much much better than what 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.890
