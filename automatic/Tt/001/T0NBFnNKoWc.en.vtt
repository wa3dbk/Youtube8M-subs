00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.770 
battery a lot of times you'll also find
that<00:00:28.530> I<00:00:28.920> keep<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:29.850> cover<00:00:30.119> off<00:00:30.330> on<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> back

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:30.780 
that I keep my cover off on the back

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.540 
that I keep my cover off on the back
because<00:00:31.110> when<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> covers<00:00:31.890> want<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> gets

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
because when the covers want it gets

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.330 
because when the covers want it gets
even<00:00:32.730> hotter<00:00:33.300> right<00:00:33.690> now<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.949> thing<00:00:35.160> is

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
even hotter right now that thing is

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
even hotter right now that thing is
almost<00:00:35.580> enough<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.030> burn<00:00:36.270> us<00:00:36.540> about<00:00:36.840> 120

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
almost enough to burn us about 120

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.610 
almost enough to burn us about 120
degrees<00:00:38.150> so<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.540> other<00:00:39.870> thing<00:00:39.989> you'll<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
cooling down this is what I used to cool

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.490 
cooling down this is what I used to cool
down<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:17.510> usually<00:01:18.510> just<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.870> this<00:01:19.050> bad<00:01:19.260> boy

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

down I usually just take this bad boy
right<00:01:19.980> here<00:01:20.660> and<00:01:21.660> I<00:01:21.750> simply<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:22.560> phone

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
right here and I simply take the phone

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
right here and I simply take the phone
on<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> edge<00:01:23.190> of<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.930> it's<00:01:24.930> cooling<00:01:25.260> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
on the edge of it so it's cooling the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
on the edge of it so it's cooling the
battery<00:01:25.800> because<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.640> happens<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.270> one

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
battery because what happens is that one

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.070 
battery because what happens is that one
when<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.110> hot<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:29.310> won't<00:01:29.550> charge<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.930> then

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
when it's hot it won't charge and then

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.660 
when it's hot it won't charge and then
wanted<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:31.800> doing<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> once<00:01:32.490> it's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
wanted to start doing is once it's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
wanted to start doing is once it's
trying<00:01:32.910> to<00:01:33.000> charge<00:01:33.300> it<00:01:33.950> don't<00:01:34.950> charge<00:01:35.250> it

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
trying to charge it don't charge it

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.410 
trying to charge it don't charge it
discharges<00:01:36.440> he<00:01:37.440> gets<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.950> hot<00:01:38.370> that<00:01:38.730> as<00:01:39.180> soon

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
discharges he gets so hot that as soon

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.880 
discharges he gets so hot that as soon
as<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:39.600> plug<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.470> starts<00:01:40.830> going

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
as you plug it in it just starts going

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.220 
as you plug it in it just starts going
backwards<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.810> can't<00:01:43.050> get<00:01:43.170> a

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
backwards and then you can't get a

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.130 
backwards and then you can't get a
recharge<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.130> takes<00:01:44.460> half<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.420> day<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.660> get<00:01:45.960> this

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
recharge it takes half a day to get this

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.290 
recharge it takes half a day to get this
thing<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.250> normal<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:47.850> way<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.000> do<00:01:48.150> it

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
thing back to normal so the way I do it

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.630 
thing back to normal so the way I do it
is<00:01:48.620> cool<00:01:49.620> it<00:01:49.650> down<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.190> minute<00:01:50.220> with<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
is cool it down just a minute with a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.970 
is cool it down just a minute with a
cool<00:01:50.850> pack<00:01:51.260> don't<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.440> got<00:01:52.590> watch<00:01:52.770> what

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
cool pack don't you got watch what

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.560 
cool pack don't you got watch what

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
you're doing so if it starts pulling up

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.700 
you're doing so if it starts pulling up
moisture<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.110> stuff<00:01:55.290> like<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.680> don't
