I<00:00:00.300> must<00:00:01.300> say<00:00:01.480> I've<00:00:01.600> always<00:00:01.750> wanted<00:00:01.990> to<00:00:02.169> build

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.260 
I must say I've always wanted to build

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.260 
I must say I've always wanted to build
one<00:00:02.530> more<00:00:02.800> for<00:00:03.009> 30<00:00:03.219> years<00:00:03.519> I<00:00:03.759> built<00:00:04.630> a<00:00:05.130> deck<00:00:06.270> two

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.270 
one more for 30 years I built a deck two

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.180 
one more for 30 years I built a deck two
years<00:00:07.510> ago<00:00:07.750> and<00:00:10.499> to<00:00:11.499> pull<00:00:11.740> behind<00:00:11.860> my

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
years ago and to pull behind my

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.980 
years ago and to pull behind my
four-wheeler<00:00:12.429> stand<00:00:13.209> back<00:00:13.389> a<00:00:13.419> little<00:00:13.599> bit

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
four-wheeler stand back a little bit

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.820 
four-wheeler stand back a little bit
football<00:00:14.919> behind<00:00:15.249> my<00:00:15.369> four-wheeler<00:00:15.639> and<00:00:16.830> it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
football behind my four-wheeler and it

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.189 
football behind my four-wheeler and it
didn't<00:00:18.099> work<00:00:18.130> out<00:00:18.599> real<00:00:19.599> worked<00:00:20.019> out

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
didn't work out real worked out

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.019 
didn't work out real worked out
fantastic<00:00:21.009> in<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.220> straightaway<00:00:21.550> but<00:00:21.699> around

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
fantastic in the straightaway but around

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.400 
fantastic in the straightaway but around
the<00:00:22.090> trees<00:00:22.330> it<00:00:22.480> just<00:00:22.720> didn't<00:00:23.080> work<00:00:23.199> out<00:00:23.349> very

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
the trees it just didn't work out very

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.929 
the trees it just didn't work out very
well<00:00:23.849> so<00:00:24.849> I<00:00:24.880> decided<00:00:25.300> to<00:00:26.339> make<00:00:27.339> a<00:00:27.400> zero<00:00:27.699> turn

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
well so I decided to make a zero turn

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.450 
well so I decided to make a zero turn
out<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.210> it<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.619> wheelbase<00:00:29.919> has<00:00:30.160> gotten<00:00:30.429> a

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
out of it the wheelbase has gotten a

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.660 
out of it the wheelbase has gotten a
little<00:00:30.580> long<00:00:30.849> on<00:00:31.029> me<00:00:31.240> I'd<00:00:32.110> say<00:00:32.349> probably<00:00:32.670> well

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
little long on me I'd say probably well

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.760 
little long on me I'd say probably well
maybe<00:00:33.910> 8<00:00:34.120> inches<00:00:34.450> too<00:00:34.660> long<00:00:34.690> but<00:00:35.050> I'm<00:00:35.410> well<00:00:35.620> to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
maybe 8 inches too long but I'm well to

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.950 
maybe 8 inches too long but I'm well to
deal<00:00:35.920> with<00:00:36.039> that<00:00:36.190> I<00:00:37.030> had<00:00:37.660> to<00:00:37.719> make<00:00:37.840> an

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
deal with that I had to make an

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.420 
deal with that I had to make an
oscillator<00:00:38.320> in<00:00:38.410> front<00:00:38.649> end<00:00:38.800> which<00:00:38.980> lengthened

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
oscillator in front end which lengthened

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.189 
oscillator in front end which lengthened
me<00:00:39.520> out<00:00:39.670> into<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.879> five<00:00:40.360> five<00:00:40.629> six<00:00:40.840> inches

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
me out into the five five six inches

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.580 
me out into the five five six inches
here<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.690> without<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.870> oscillating<00:00:44.260> in<00:00:44.350> front

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
here so without the oscillating in front

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.549 
here so without the oscillating in front
end<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:46.000> one<00:00:46.809> of<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:46.989> wheels<00:00:47.140> would<00:00:47.320> be<00:00:47.440> off

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
end the one of the wheels would be off

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.020 
end the one of the wheels would be off
the<00:00:47.739> ground<00:00:47.949> if<00:00:48.100> you<00:00:48.190> ever<00:00:48.340> had<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.489> hole<00:00:48.730> what

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
the ground if you ever had a hole what

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.000 
the ground if you ever had a hole what
should<00:00:49.239> with<00:00:50.020> the<00:00:50.050> drive<00:00:50.320> wheels<00:00:50.559> which<00:00:50.800> would

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
should with the drive wheels which would

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.470 
should with the drive wheels which would
stop<00:00:51.280> it<00:00:51.489> but<00:00:51.960> anyway<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.670> had<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:54.969> do<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.239> I

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
stop it but anyway so I had to do that I

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.880 
stop it but anyway so I had to do that I
have<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.850> bagger<00:00:57.850> which<00:00:58.480> works<00:00:59.140> on<00:00:59.289> this<00:00:59.440> end<00:00:59.710> a

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
have a bagger which works on this end a

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.709 
have a bagger which works on this end a
blower<00:01:00.370> which<00:01:00.789> I<00:01:00.969> do<00:01:01.030> in<00:01:01.239> fact<00:01:01.449> it's<00:01:01.600> right

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
blower which I do in fact it's right

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.850 
blower which I do in fact it's right
behind<00:01:01.989> me<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:02.890> my<00:01:03.010> trailer<00:01:03.370> or<00:01:03.760> there<00:01:04.089> is<00:01:04.860> I'm

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
behind me so my trailer or there is I'm

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.200 
behind me so my trailer or there is I'm
not<00:01:06.040> having<00:01:06.189> decided<00:01:06.490> I'm<00:01:06.790> going<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:06.970> use<00:01:07.060> that

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
not having decided I'm going to use that

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.440 
not having decided I'm going to use that
or<00:01:07.360> not<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.710> this<00:01:09.270> zero<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:12.070> anyway<00:01:12.400> I<00:01:12.450> bought

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
or not on this zero but anyway I bought

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.840 
or not on this zero but anyway I bought
a<00:01:14.070> snapper<00:01:15.070> mower<00:01:15.430> and<00:01:16.680> kind<00:01:17.680> of<00:01:17.850> hybridity

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
a snapper mower and kind of hybridity

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.999 
a snapper mower and kind of hybridity
two<00:01:19.299> of<00:01:19.360> them<00:01:19.450> together

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
two of them together

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:28.069 
two of them together
cut<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.640> snapper<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.150> half<00:01:24.060> right<00:01:25.060> here<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
cut the snapper in half right here and

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.370 
cut the snapper in half right here and
the<00:01:29.079> back<00:01:29.259> half<00:01:29.500> is<00:01:29.530> up<00:01:29.890> here<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.320> took

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
the back half is up here and then I took

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.249 
the back half is up here and then I took
and<00:01:32.710> mounted<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.159> on<00:01:33.340> top<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.960> which<00:01:34.960> did

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
and mounted it on top of it which did

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.859 
and mounted it on top of it which did
raise<00:01:35.470> it<00:01:35.649> up<00:01:35.740> probably<00:01:36.579> six<00:01:36.909> inches<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:39.100> it

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
raise it up probably six inches but it

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.030 
raise it up probably six inches but it
works<00:01:40.869> out

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
works out

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.850 
works out
I<00:01:42.869> didn't<00:01:43.869> want<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.110> completely<00:01:44.469> redesign

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
I didn't want to completely redesign

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.709 
I didn't want to completely redesign
this<00:01:45.219> deck<00:01:45.549> and<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.090> motor<00:01:46.299> and<00:01:46.479> everything

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
this deck and the motor and everything

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.190 
this deck and the motor and everything
that's<00:01:46.780> all<00:01:46.990> on<00:01:47.200> it<00:01:47.350> and<00:01:47.500> so<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.579> tried<00:01:48.820> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
that's all on it and so I just tried to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.020 
that's all on it and so I just tried to
cut<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.320> frame<00:01:50.560> where<00:01:51.399> it<00:01:51.460> goes<00:01:51.610> into<00:01:51.909> the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
cut the frame where it goes into the

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.480 
cut the frame where it goes into the
sides<00:01:52.270> of<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.570> right<00:01:52.750> there<00:01:53.189> cut<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.310> frame

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
sides of it right there cut the frame

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.109 
sides of it right there cut the frame
off<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:55.149> I<00:01:55.509> build<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.810> subframe<00:01:56.259> underneath<00:01:56.710> it

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
off and I build a subframe underneath it

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
off and I build a subframe underneath it
because<00:01:58.119> this<00:01:58.299> head<00:01:58.509> he<00:01:58.990> can<00:01:59.170> kind<00:01:59.469> of<00:01:59.560> see<00:01:59.740> it

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
because this head he can kind of see it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.810 
because this head he can kind of see it
right<00:02:01.149> there<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:04.180> it's<00:02:04.390> got<00:02:05.759> these<00:02:06.759> two

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
right there and then it's got these two

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.430 
right there and then it's got these two
have<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.119> couple<00:02:07.390> of<00:02:07.479> pushers<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.990> mounted<00:02:08.320> on

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
have a couple of pushers that mounted on

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.749 
have a couple of pushers that mounted on
the<00:02:08.530> back<00:02:08.680> of<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:08.980> deck<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.430> I'm

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
the back of the deck and I'm

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.369 
the back of the deck and I'm
them<00:02:10.030> there<00:02:10.239> instead<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.899> should<00:02:11.170> be

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
them there instead so I should be

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:13.920 
them there instead so I should be
pushing<00:02:11.650> for<00:02:12.519> more<00:02:12.970> than<00:02:13.120> one<00:02:13.239> you<00:02:13.569> know<00:02:13.629> like

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
pushing for more than one you know like

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.640 
pushing for more than one you know like
three<00:02:14.170> places<00:02:14.409> there<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.989> then<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.439> had<00:02:17.590> to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
three places there and then I had to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.890 
three places there and then I had to
rewire<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:19.379> read<00:02:20.379> RiRi<00:02:22.170> do<00:02:23.170> all<00:02:23.349> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
rewire it and read RiRi do all the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.130 
rewire it and read RiRi do all the
cabling<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.670> linkage<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.150> for<00:02:29.079> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
cabling and linkage and and for the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.649 
cabling and linkage and and for the
brakes<00:02:29.379> and<00:02:29.680> because<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.069> was<00:02:30.159> all<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.659> not

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
brakes and because it was all just not

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.860 
brakes and because it was all just not
worse<00:02:32.370> original<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.579> it<00:02:34.299> was<00:02:34.390> really<00:02:34.629> a<00:02:34.659> pretty

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
worse original so it was really a pretty

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.509 
worse original so it was really a pretty
much<00:02:35.079> makeover<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.680> didn't<00:02:35.980> have<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.220> build<00:02:36.400> the

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
much makeover I didn't have to build the

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.640 
much makeover I didn't have to build the
frame<00:02:36.640> but<00:02:37.000> pretty<00:02:37.750> much<00:02:37.780> everything<00:02:38.230> else<00:02:38.409> I

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
frame but pretty much everything else I

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.460 
frame but pretty much everything else I
had<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:38.890> all<00:02:38.980> apart<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.430> paint<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.319> it<00:02:41.319> was

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
had it all apart to paint it and it was

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.640 
had it all apart to paint it and it was
just<00:02:41.530> about<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.920> total<00:02:42.250> review<00:02:42.519> but<00:02:43.450> anyway<00:02:44.140> it

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
just about a total review but anyway it

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.520 
just about a total review but anyway it
was<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.829> lot<00:02:44.890> cheaper<00:02:45.159> buying<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.840> motor

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
was a lot cheaper buying the the motor

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.699 
was a lot cheaper buying the the motor
with<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.799> bloat<00:02:48.040> engine<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.609> it<00:02:49.000> was<00:02:49.709> buying

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
with a bloat engine and it was buying

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.500 
with a bloat engine and it was buying
the<00:02:50.799> wheel<00:02:50.920> motors<00:02:51.310> themselves<00:02:51.879> one<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.269> bought

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
the wheel motors themselves one I bought

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.319 
the wheel motors themselves one I bought
the<00:02:52.629> whole<00:02:52.810> kit<00:02:53.109> for<00:02:53.920> what<00:02:54.639> one<00:02:54.879> wheel<00:02:55.060> motor

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
the whole kit for what one wheel motor

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.569 
the whole kit for what one wheel motor
would<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.569> cost<00:02:55.810> me<00:02:55.900> in<00:02:56.049> part<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.370> came

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
would have cost me in part so it came

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.099 
would have cost me in part so it came
out<00:02:57.730> pretty<00:02:57.879> good<00:02:58.209> I<00:02:58.420> got<00:02:58.690> about<00:02:58.780> five

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
out pretty good I got about five

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.440 
out pretty good I got about five
thousand<00:02:59.470> minute<00:02:59.680> total<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.700> I've<00:03:00.790> got<00:03:01.000> forty

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
thousand minute total and I've got forty

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.509 
thousand minute total and I've got forty
twenty<00:03:02.049> one<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.290> four<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.769> twenty<00:03:03.040> three<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.459> I

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
twenty one and four to twenty three so I

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.339 
twenty one and four to twenty three so I
got<00:03:03.639> forty<00:03:03.970> four<00:03:04.690> horsepower<00:03:05.819> 23<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.989> it<00:03:08.139> on

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
got forty four horsepower 23 on it on

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.490 
got forty four horsepower 23 on it on
the<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> deck<00:03:09.750> which<00:03:10.750> is<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> water-cooled

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
the on the deck which is a water-cooled

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.009 
the on the deck which is a water-cooled
Kohler<00:03:11.859> engine<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.629> then<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:13.750> smallest

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
Kohler engine and then the smallest

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.110 
Kohler engine and then the smallest
engine<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.560> could<00:03:14.739> buy<00:03:14.889> with<00:03:15.430> an<00:03:15.579> oil<00:03:15.790> filter

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
engine I could buy with an oil filter

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.890 
engine I could buy with an oil filter
which<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.049> something<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.680> want<00:03:17.919> for<00:03:18.900> longevity

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
which is something I want for longevity

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.069 
which is something I want for longevity
and<00:03:20.280> that's<00:03:21.280> that's<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.419> small<00:03:22.629> engine<00:03:22.959> at

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
and that's that's a small engine at

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.250 
and that's that's a small engine at
vitals<00:03:23.379> of<00:03:23.440> 21<00:03:23.919> so<00:03:24.459> I<00:03:24.730> got<00:03:25.599> that<00:03:25.750> in<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.930> Briggs

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
vitals of 21 so I got that in a Briggs

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.119 
vitals of 21 so I got that in a Briggs
but<00:03:27.269> it's<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.780> should<00:03:29.169> be<00:03:29.260> able<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.440> mow<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.650> was

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
but it's I should be able to mow I was

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.949 
but it's I should be able to mow I was
going<00:03:30.280> to<00:03:30.340> GPS<00:03:30.669> it<00:03:30.940> but<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> GPS<00:03:31.389> mephone

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
going to GPS it but the GPS mephone

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.659 
going to GPS it but the GPS mephone
software<00:03:32.560> changed<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.129> I'm<00:03:33.190> going<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.370> figure

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
software changed and I'm going to figure

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.199 
software changed and I'm going to figure
it<00:03:33.790> out<00:03:33.849> again<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.859> should<00:03:36.669> be<00:03:36.819> able<00:03:36.910> to

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
it out again so but I should be able to

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.920 
it out again so but I should be able to
mow<00:03:37.780> about<00:03:38.079> 10-12<00:03:38.560> Manar<00:03:38.919> I<00:03:38.949> hope<00:03:39.569> with<00:03:40.569> my<00:03:40.720> for

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
mow about 10-12 Manar I hope with my for

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.930 
mow about 10-12 Manar I hope with my for
whether<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.199> could<00:03:41.410> pull<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.709> deck<00:03:41.889> up<00:03:42.639> to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
whether I could pull the deck up to

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.030 
whether I could pull the deck up to
fifteen<00:03:43.389> Manar<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.290> still<00:03:44.799> have<00:03:45.010> enough

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
fifteen Manar and still have enough

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.900 
fifteen Manar and still have enough
power<00:03:45.280> and<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:46.780> do<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.959> nice<00:03:47.230> job<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.500> cutting

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
power and to do a nice job of cutting

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.140 
power and to do a nice job of cutting
I'm<00:03:48.910> spinning<00:03:49.359> that<00:03:49.480> deck<00:03:50.040> about<00:03:51.040> 3,500<00:03:51.760> rpms

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
I'm spinning that deck about 3,500 rpms

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.460 
I'm spinning that deck about 3,500 rpms
33<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.019> 35<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:53.769> Mike<00:03:53.980> that<00:03:54.159> it's<00:03:54.359> so<00:03:55.359> that's<00:03:56.139> why

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
33 to 35 so Mike that it's so that's why

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.849 
33 to 35 so Mike that it's so that's why
we're<00:03:57.510> it's<00:03:58.510> it<00:03:58.780> detonates<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.440> grass<00:03:59.650> just

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
we're it's it detonates the grass just

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.409 
we're it's it detonates the grass just
detonates<00:04:00.370> in<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.549> blaze<00:04:00.760> I<00:04:00.940> don't<00:04:01.120> think

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
detonates in the blaze I don't think

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.500 
detonates in the blaze I don't think
they'd<00:04:01.540> have<00:04:01.659> to<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:01.870> sharp<00:04:02.109> so<00:04:03.269> anyway<00:04:04.269> it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
they'd have to be sharp so anyway it

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.369 
they'd have to be sharp so anyway it
does<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.690> nice<00:04:04.900> job<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:05.349> cutting<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.049> hope

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
does a nice job of cutting and so I hope

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.199 
does a nice job of cutting and so I hope
this<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:08.829> took<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.129> out<00:04:09.190> just<00:04:09.459> for<00:04:09.639> riding<00:04:09.849> see

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
this I took it out just for riding see

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.879 
this I took it out just for riding see
it's<00:04:10.329> kind<00:04:10.780> of<00:04:10.810> wet<00:04:10.959> now<00:04:11.169> I<00:04:11.199> just<00:04:11.319> par<00:04:11.680> washed

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
it's kind of wet now I just par washed

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.949 
it's kind of wet now I just par washed
it<00:04:12.069> off<00:04:12.220> but<00:04:12.579> I<00:04:12.760> took<00:04:13.299> it<00:04:13.540> out<00:04:13.629> here<00:04:13.840> in<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959
