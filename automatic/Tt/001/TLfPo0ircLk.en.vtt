it has that is why i'm here to show you
10<00:00:24.830> 10<00:00:25.830> ways<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.760> eat<00:00:27.689> an<00:00:28.019> Oreo<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:38.000> twist<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
10 10 ways to eat an Oreo you twist it

00:00:39.180 --> 00:01:33.580 
10 10 ways to eat an Oreo you twist it
you<00:00:39.570> pull<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.590> yeah

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:02:35.400 

you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.420 

hmm<00:02:36.410> so<00:02:36.709> if<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.220> radius<00:02:37.760> times<00:02:38.300> pi<00:02:39.190> equals<00:02:40.190> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
hmm so if the radius times pi equals the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.140 
hmm so if the radius times pi equals the
circumference<00:02:42.070> then<00:02:43.070> this<00:02:43.400> should<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.989> about

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
circumference then this should be about

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.580 
circumference then this should be about
1.7<00:02:47.150> 4<00:02:47.450> square<00:02:48.020> inches<00:02:49.270> look<00:02:50.270> at<00:02:50.450> this<00:02:50.630> texture

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
1.7 4 square inches look at this texture

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.140 
1.7 4 square inches look at this texture
a<00:02:51.800> very<00:02:53.260> interesting<00:02:54.260> i<00:02:54.700> will<00:02:55.700> write<00:02:55.880> about

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
a very interesting i will write about

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:04.390 
a very interesting i will write about
this<00:02:56.390> for<00:02:56.660> my<00:02:56.810> science<00:02:57.380> report<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:03.709> you'll

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
this for my science report and you'll

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:18.400 
this for my science report and you'll
need<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:16.299> you're<00:03:17.299> actually<00:03:17.540> supposed<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.290> be

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
need to you're actually supposed to be

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.640 
need to you're actually supposed to be
able<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.680> get<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.070> off<00:03:19.220> of<00:03:19.250> your<00:03:19.549> nose<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.650> I'm

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
able to get it off of your nose but I'm

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:49.559 
able to get it off of your nose but I'm
kind<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.040> really<00:03:22.220> bad<00:03:22.489> at<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:28.360> okay

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
bump bump bump it about my bumper from

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.959 
bump bump bump it about my bumper from
the<00:03:53.590> conclusion<00:03:54.590> you<00:03:55.519> twisted<00:03:56.000> you<00:03:56.450> pull<00:03:56.720> it
