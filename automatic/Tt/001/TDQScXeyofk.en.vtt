00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.860
 the hemi 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.620
 Yes 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:14.380
 It's Uz 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:19.150
 Today, I want to describe sd card 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.510
 It is basic, but it is simple explanation of sp card, and I think that it is not Oma when it is deep 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.340
 but 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.130
 There can read clerk not know said something about the shop Datte you say what you have chosen to pick 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.329
 You Yeah right 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.140
 Doing I'd explanation want to little it 's such Become As can be seen without calling 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.829
 To go 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.630
 Or the first place is what a of the Tteyuu sd card 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.670
 After all it is digital camera of using 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.960
 Card inserted in digital camera 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.960
 Such sd- 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.870
 Oh like this sd card 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.870
 It's a tiny card. 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.890
 Actually, sd card is this which is cheap card, no matter where 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.300
 With the card inserted 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.880
 Memory Stick duo 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.460
 The compact flash card is the first era model 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.200
 Lie to say sd card 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.610
 This little card is used so it's mostly used now in most of the time 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.370
 because cars 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.150
 Choose a corner of this shape 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.470
 Though it is sd card 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 There are several types in it 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.090
 First of all , it will be a good source for people who hit the mi capacity in the small capacity with the speakers right 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.770
 Is sd car 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.960
 The next thing on the right comes next 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.360
 Yonggi 's sd car 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.950
 There is a difference between this and fourth place in mind 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:59.520
 I can use the cards of my brother for almost all models now 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:05.830
 If it becomes other than 4, it becomes a plan called h card by s 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:10.899
 It is subtle if it is model of 4 years ago to say how it is different 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.140
 Some cameras and printers do not recognize it directly 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.620
 So when you buy wintering 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 First of all, the model you are using 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.790
 Do not use only mind up to 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.909
 You can use the sdhc card of Yonggi or more capacity ? 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.909
 You need to check it first 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:44.110
 If yonggi is more than 4 you can leave 8th place or 16 gigs . 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:48.930
 We are selling with 32 giga 64 gigs when it comes to just 16 giga now 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:53.150
 Only 32 compared to 64 and more 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:58.730
 There is a possibility that becomes a card called sdxc card 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:03.980
 As this card can not be used unless it is a model that nails support further 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:07.310
 This also needs some confirmation The child who is riding in advance is compatible with the large capacity 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.370
 It is easier to find out if it is 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.610
 various types of school to go in the sd card 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:20.080
 Even the same fourth place is different in kind 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:24.300
 Sd card which is written 4 points of normal class first 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.300
 sd car that is written I class 6 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.010
 Class 10 is written sd car 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:38.290
 Purely and pretty to say what is the difference 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.120
 Data tape to card sd card is the difference in its speed 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 so 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.610
 Too late or almost become a digital camera because the fact and say, Anne class 4 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:54.480
 There is no such problem even if it is single-shot time 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:58.230
 However, recent digital cameras have a great number of pixels . The fourth floor vision movie shakes. 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:03.200
 When it comes to it, shooting with high pixel and continuous use 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:06.980
 If you intend to use a high-definition movie In setting class 6 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:11.420
 Comfortable imposing Yappa in the class card will be recommended 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.050
 And SanDisk whether Panasonic also divided the v Class 4 60 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.169
 I think that generally are many 4 juice 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.310
 Of course there is the price in the class 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:26.000
 That a high response is good shake 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:30.770
 I wonder if you fast is the data of Toka image 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.910
 You can use it and it works comfortably even if you get a high-definition movie 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:38.009
 If it is a movie or high pixel camera, it is recommended that you are in class 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:42.830
 Among them a little special 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.830
 I just borrowed a positive investment card 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.099
 No charge 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.710
 There is a symbol like that under 1 after the class 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:57.980
 This is Ann 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.950
 It becomes a standard that is often used in high-spec single-lens reflex cameras recently 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.409
 Ne 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:07.460
 It is what is called uhs speed class 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.639
 This grinded new planning 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.810
 Oh 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:17.819
 and it corresponds to the one referred to as uhs speed class 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:19.689
 If it is a single-lens reflex camera , writing speed is faster than normal class stores 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:25.269
 I can do it 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:27.099
 This is a plan because it is a plan to use with a single lens reflex that really needs its high speed and interest 

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.300
 Digital camera 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.770
 later 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:36.360
 There is no need to dare buy those who use them 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:41.810
 And because that sd card looks like the same brother again 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.810
 It is a choker because there is that micro sd card 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.139
 This tiny card 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:56.200
 Most of the small parts are mobile phones 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:06:00.580
 It is used for mobile phones and smartphones 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.650
 It's a really small number, but it's wide and it's 4G or 8G 16th 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:09.100
 There are 30 brothers etc 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:11.750
 In the same as 2 sd card sd card is right side with micro sdhc card 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.780
 The card called 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:18.790
 Yonggi will be on the top 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:20.260
 Of course, it is no good if the corresponding audience does not check it, so check in advance and buy at the store 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.889
 It is better to do 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.099
 It is necessary mid-course If you thinking of buying on the net 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.180
 If you buy it even though you can not use hc card 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:34.160
 You will spend wasted money 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.990
 As I mentioned earlier , there is a compact flash card, but recently 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.409
 It is hardly sold 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.610
 It's getting less 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.610
 Well archive 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:52.810
 It is still used with cards that are commonly used for such single-lens reflex cameras 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.810
 Since the foot cards themselves have been reduced recently 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:07:06.330
 Although it is rising without much appearance like this, the card of Ekko is 22 gigs of 8 gigs, for example 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:06.990
 There is no planned change, so it can be used if it is compatible with single-lens reflex cameras regardless of which one is bought 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:12.820
 I will 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:18.460
 But write speed is I is written various Toka 200 speed or about 300 times faster 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:23.960
 The writing speed changes with double speed, so when you buy it, especially the compact rush is like a clerk 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:28.460
 I think it would be better to buy something that you can play well 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:32.690
 As only one SLR camera sd card itself is already 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:35.020
 I think I'm going here 14 I'm a little lonely I use this type 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.020
 Day
