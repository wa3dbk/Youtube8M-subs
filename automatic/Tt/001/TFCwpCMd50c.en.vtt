 highlight I greet you nice tour 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.660
 have turned back in the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.750
 Today's video will be about the anabolic 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.599
 diet is a resumee of my conclusion 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.799
 page out after watching you one year 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.759
 have done and also successful 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.160
 was like one in one too 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.850
 transformation process could come along 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.710
 this diet pretty positive his 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.510
 body composition change 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.340
 and why I 'm fat on heiko where 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.890
 I prefer in both diets 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.850
 disadvantages see everything in this 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.850
 video stays tuned 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.530
 the 100th 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.379
 the topic is politics and mine 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.350
 experience from it and heiko we catch 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.420
 with that, although now on the anna 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.030
 Pohl advises why you see why 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.040
 something happens how it performs 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.470
 All this you will learn my previous 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.830
 videos because I have everything in detail and 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.479
 very extensively explains my experience 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.530
 one year though diet what was positive what 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.060
 was negative what can you say 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.200
 I'll tell you the beginning of the day 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.530
 a little bit difficult was the beginning 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.350
 difficult you had the right one 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.759
 things find the right food 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 you have to have a little bit of time 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.200
 invest to see what 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.080
 food but less carbohydrates 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.000
 and what can not or what I like 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.220
 rather or something I do not taste so much 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.619
 and you have to know a bit yes 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.380
 invest time to find out 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.100
 which foods are suitable for one 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.090
 are and I found that at the beginning of the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:01.220
 more difficult part of the diet afterwards 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.410
 when you feel rich in fat and why 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.619
 Nourishes itself and thinks the crisis 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.479
 Come on, you should just stop this 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.379
 introduction let me tell you this one 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.060
 conversion takes a few days but if 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.620
 One should start with the anabolic diet 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.989
 the first two to three weeks 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.170
 not load as and then as it does 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.489
 went off with the load yes once the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.170
 week or load 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.560
 at that time twice even the week loaded 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.780
 which was too much for me personally 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 but what I mean by that you want to say it 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.330
 feeds protein for five to six days 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.690
 fat rich and 1 to twice the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.840
 week you can bid yes and I have 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.120
 really ate a lot of shit 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.920
 really eaten a lot and scrap 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.980
 Still, my shape got better and better 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.590
 and at the beginning it was not planned that me 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.660
 one years anabolic by lead 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.030
 but with the time where I have seen 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.620
 hey my form is getting better my 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.480
 Body is getting lower and lower 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.360
 yes and I may even once a week 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.550
 eat so much forbidden things too 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.500
 hey what I want more I do this 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.140
 idea further I think it's stupid and 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.150
 Stop it now and it will always be like that 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.960
 after more and more and more 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.640
 always more 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.520
 of course, I also have it in parallel 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.800
 strength training a lot of strength training 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.450
 operated and also a lot of cadertraining yes 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.490
 sometimes so many mistakes too 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.820
 also made with the shop and there and 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.310
 but the diet itself was always 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.860
 top so I really had none 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.830
 hunger strikes it was not difficult 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.660
 To perform this diet was once 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.970
 well saturated that has nothing 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.580
 missing because at the end of the week loaded 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.190
 in training yes in training I have 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.620
 No loss of strength had no power 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.330
 At some point I lose with that 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.700
 Body fat content was pretty low 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.990
 of course and also a lot of weight 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.430
 Of course he has lost mine 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.630
 automatically with the weight down 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.530
 Of course you also need a bit 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.720
 muscle mass but too normal 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.280
 conventional diets yes where to part 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.290
 I'll say it in quotes 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.120
 hungry and sometimes there are too 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.980
 which then very fast force 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.650
 I find that lose in this diet 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.300
 that was not the case 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.090
 That's why I was able to do this diet a lot 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.940
 just perform I have very little 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.489
 to no power a booster beginning 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.220
 and by that I really could 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.500
 a year to complete this and could 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.890
 really yes I'll tell a close one 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.919
 single-digit body fat content come 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.419
 what is difficult about this diet or what 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.850
 to pay particular attention to that 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.440
 exit there are people who can directly 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.820
 make the exit directly 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.510
 With carbohydrates, they start again 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.300
 namely to 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.100
 or they hardly grow and know about it 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.330
 I also personally with the people 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.130
 has talked about it 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.050
 but there are also people who now for 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.570
 example I got out of this 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.940
 must carefully plan carefully hot 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.700
 gradually the carbohydrate slowly 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.760
 reintroduce and then it's 6 7 8 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.430
 10 weeks that it type of every body 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.440
 otherwise you have to grope and 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.330
 Look how you get the carbohydrates 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.229
 tolerates and how fast you get 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.090
 can install 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.340
 that really is the only one really 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.010
 more difficult part 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.449
 the diet does not do that or that 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.060
 Hold on for a long time 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.190
 but the exit must really 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.820
 very carefully and very well planned 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.160
 become 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.150
 So why am I uploading then 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.070
 come 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:32.220
 he had the thought that 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.590
 trainingspensum you drive a very high 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.310
 intensity trains as well as one 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.889
 Crazy partly in the gym around 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.610
 also to increase some power and also 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:47.460
 build muscle mass even if it 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.010
 try a slow step 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.450
 to carry out now with the construction it 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.850
 is better with carbohydrates 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.500
 try 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.530
 I am now about six years old 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.560
 weeks I train on Heiko fans 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.660
 has been traveling for about three months for three months 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.570
 is training really hard again 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:12.020
 Gym and currently I have to be real 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:15.300
 Saying is my body composition 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:18.479
 improves very very positive 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.400
 i and i could say a lot i say mine 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.720
 Quotes pretty good 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.930
 build up strength 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.150
 in the last five weeks and me 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.440
 would watch that a bit now 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.139
 how this develops 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.090
 how far i am with the carbohydrates 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.340
 can go up and so on and so forth 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.860
 I just want to look and see 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:41.900
 how my body is changing right now 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.430
 can only say that I am very much 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.340
 I have my data from back then 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.410
 Of course, why drive all unfinished 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.900
 times with weighty written down with 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.789
 date and compared to today 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.010
 or how currently the 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:58.830
 development behaves from the high k 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:02.490
 Blofeld is pretty positive so me 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.590
 I am very surprised that that 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:10.280
 really works so well after all 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:12.510
 has all to really now that what 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.849
 meaningful from my side 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.099
 you have to hold my opinion 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.940
 really only five six months that 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:21.640
 drive through all times 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.700
 So make and look like yourself 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.920
 the whole then developed or 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.990
 will develop yes I hope the video 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.430
 I liked you, come I hope 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:35.530
 I could do this one and the other 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:38.380
 tip surfaces info or a seascape 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:42.160
 anabolic diet or my experience the 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:46.380
 I was able to collect from it and me 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.360
 I have the video has failed 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:52.690
 and if there are more such videos 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.090
 if you want such info videos say 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:57.810
 I'm interested in writing it in 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:00.730
 The comments are thumbs up 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.390
 subscribe me and until then I say 

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.800
 times 

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.800
 see you
