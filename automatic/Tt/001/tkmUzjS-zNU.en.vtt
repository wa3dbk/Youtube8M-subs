00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.380

 in the booster neighborhood a wanted 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 as well 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.980
 in which the story is put 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.099
 with this that dancing is coming 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.840
 a dream and that as always the 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.270
 quilombero component must not miss 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.910
 certain tremendous tole tole between 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.430
 verónica ojeda and dalma maradona what 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.619
 it is said a true media outburst 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.940
 the purest strain 'Maradonian Dona 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.790
 palm answers a twitter 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.680
 directly to her clear what they do 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.600
 also many famous is like sometimes 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.600
 he does more he still attacked the quarrel 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.250
 when they spoke ill of dancing , he did not 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 I encouraged the best to put what 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.590
 think what I felt so that it is not so 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.649
 brusque were not all this retweet and 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.630
 ava something that someone else said and in 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.720
 this case said no I said it retweet 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.180
 and see how difficult it is to take charge says 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.699
 and he has robbed giannina maradona and 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.680
 soul I do not know if I'm more embarrassed ojeda 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.130
 inventing or what cameras give him 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.860
 we study in us let's see cameras 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.390
 I do not know that is the strongest, that is, to me 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.770
 I'm ashamed to give the camera 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.020
 people the truth that no 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.149
 in this program you hear all the 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.009
 bells we talk about democracy and in 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.920
 freedom is not that we talk about just one 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.929
 person is given in particular with vero with 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.899
 verónica ojeda because we are talking 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.679
 of dancing for a dream and it always comes out 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:35.060
 the subject of his relationship with Diego has 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.530
 stopped being this girl who stole us 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.950
 we who do not know her I do not know who 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.789
 is 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.530
 but is that they listen and learn one of 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.250
 the pillars of democracy justly 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.250
 is to listen to all the voices 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.140
 When you want to shut someone up, it 's 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.090
 something that at least I do not like 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.490
 that is censorship and a lot of other things 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.900
 If not for me the nicest thing 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.850
 has democracy listen to all 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.320
 voices listen to everyone 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.030
 I would not like to go back to the time 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.520
 where he spoke nothing else we heard a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.070
 only bell nothing else after her 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.380
 he likes his right so much so he's missing 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.670
 of understanding he has is speaking 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.140
 of soul and is saying that there will be 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.520
 with her they talk about me and I want to answer 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.750
 with all the respect that my 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.750
 mom 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.150
 and by private message with this saying 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:28.160
 who does not want to face with a voice 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:30.500
 he wants neither to talk nor tweet 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.350
 know but it entails is that it comes and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.100
 feel or for you 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.900
 I do not want to cross it but if you want 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.540
 harm the baby I do not have a problem and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.900
 If he already wants nothing he does not want to go out 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.290
 air wants that if you do not believe me that 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.290
 he spoke that he will see this meeting for 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.840
 let the cameras come and show that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.209
 encounter is not this is 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.800
 and if we talk about despelote is media 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.019
 you should never miss a barranquero parrot 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.060
 sucks fame that gives the touch of 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.069
 unpresentability that in these cases 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.930
 It is always running because you do not 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.400
 you crossed with dalma maradona and I 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.580
 you answer all this to me I will have 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.580
 fear 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:28.269
 we listen to nobody 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.489
 from all over the world there are people who speak 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.720
 well there are people that do not bother you 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.720
 because I have that thing I'm not hypocrite 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.019
 because if you are so alive you did not cross 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.819
 pondering I will allow you to speak badly 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.430
 from me because he does not know me 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.910
 ok also sing that you speak ill of me 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.410
 and for a little bit this girl's mouth 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.990
 now why is not good what is 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.290
 watching some women 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.290
 please 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.020
 it does not matter we had complicated pregnancies 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.130
 and we all had veronical problems not 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.130
 only death 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.730
 we are talking by mouth and 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.380
 you answered me veronica ojeda 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.150
 because I'm listening to what he was saying 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.370
 Shut up your mouth and let me answer you 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.530
 you're talking because someone told you and 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.100
 I told you badly they passed point and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.100
 old 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.930
 we can not understand 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.870
 guardiola still did not start shaking the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.260
 skeleton on the track of the nefarious 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.260
 dancing the tip 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.339
 I was watching them always filming them 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:53.339
 and with this quilombo 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.600

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.270
 show ass of woman 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.860
 listorti the famous many times 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.600
 they get angry because they interview each other 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.700
 part the case for example here is a 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.160
 maradona got angry with her because she was 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.570
 make a quick note is when you 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.330

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.370
 parts he likes famous do not like me 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:33.080

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:36.490

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.490
