pack<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.100> create<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.760> happy<00:01:03.239> and

pack is to create a happy and
summer-like<00:01:05.150> atmosphere<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.530> think<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> does<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
summer-like atmosphere I think it does a

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.210 
summer-like atmosphere I think it does a
pretty<00:01:08.040> decent<00:01:08.700> job<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.530> complet<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.800> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
pretty decent job at a complet and it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.840 
pretty decent job at a complet and it
adds<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.970> adds<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.390> bright<00:01:12.840> warm<00:01:13.380> feel<00:01:14.369> with

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
adds it adds that bright warm feel with

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.770 
adds it adds that bright warm feel with
the<00:01:15.060> color<00:01:15.600> shading<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> has<00:01:16.830> I

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
the color shading that it has I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
the color shading that it has I
personally<00:01:18.780> like<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> way<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.500> water<00:01:19.680> and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
personally like the way the water and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.260 
personally like the way the water and
the<00:01:20.310> grass<00:01:20.810> flows<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.560> shader<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the grass flows in this shader back the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.290 
the grass flows in this shader back the
shadows<00:01:24.750> aren't<00:01:25.350> too<00:01:25.890> extreme<00:01:26.399> and<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
shadows aren't too extreme and the

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.440 
shadows aren't too extreme and the
lighting<00:01:27.899> is<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> pretty<00:01:29.550> nice<00:01:29.790> level<00:01:30.060> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
lighting is at a pretty nice level and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.960 
lighting is at a pretty nice level and
overall<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> shader<00:01:31.740> pack<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.220> very<00:01:32.520> nicely

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
overall the shader pack is very nicely

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.499 
overall the shader pack is very nicely
made<00:01:35.690> next<00:01:36.690> up<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.100> choco<00:01:38.100> peak<00:01:38.520> shaders

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
made next up I have choco peak shaders

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.780 
made next up I have choco peak shaders
something<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.649> I'm<00:01:41.070> not<00:01:41.520> quite<00:01:41.759> sure

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
something like that I'm not quite sure

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.150 
something like that I'm not quite sure
how<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.539> actually<00:01:42.960> pronounce<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.710> either<00:01:43.830> way

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
how to actually pronounce it either way

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.570 
how to actually pronounce it either way
this<00:01:44.789> pack<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.899> very<00:01:46.320> nice<00:01:46.619> The<00:01:47.039> Sun<00:01:47.550> has

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
this pack is very very nice The Sun has

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.660 
this pack is very very nice The Sun has
a<00:01:47.940> glare<00:01:48.690> but<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.680> not<00:01:49.950> too<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.550> know

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
a glare but it's not too you know

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.990 
a glare but it's not too you know
overbearing<00:01:51.539> I<00:01:51.869> guess<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.080> often<00:01:53.070> times<00:01:53.550> you'll

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
overbearing I guess I often times you'll

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.900 
overbearing I guess I often times you'll
get<00:01:54.300> you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.690> shaders<00:01:55.289> that<00:01:56.100> over<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.640> some

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
get you know shaders that over do some

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.090 
get you know shaders that over do some
like<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.330> glare<00:01:57.660> on<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.929> Sun<00:01:58.319> or<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.009> know

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
like the glare on the Sun or you know

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.279 
like the glare on the Sun or you know
shadow<00:01:59.490> levels<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.929> isn't

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
shadow levels but there really isn't

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.199 
shadow levels but there really isn't
much<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:03.119> pack<00:02:03.420> over<00:02:04.080> does<00:02:04.940> this<00:02:05.940> pack

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
much that this pack over does this pack

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.249 
much that this pack over does this pack
adds<00:02:06.509> in<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:08.190> rain<00:02:08.580> effect<00:02:09.000> which<00:02:09.450> makes<00:02:10.020> your

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
adds in the rain effect which makes your

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
adds in the rain effect which makes your
screen<00:02:10.619> feel<00:02:10.920> like<00:02:11.220> they're<00:02:11.490> our<00:02:11.670> raindrops

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
screen feel like they're our raindrops

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.990 
screen feel like they're our raindrops
are<00:02:12.599> on<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.620> really<00:02:14.099> it's<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.790> pretty

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
are on it and it's really it's a pretty

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.050 
are on it and it's really it's a pretty
awesome<00:02:15.270> effect<00:02:16.520> surprisingly<00:02:17.520> enough<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
awesome effect surprisingly enough I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.080 
awesome effect surprisingly enough I
don't<00:02:18.360> notice<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.560> much<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.099> frame<00:02:20.700> drop

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
don't notice that much of a frame drop

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.630 
don't notice that much of a frame drop
while<00:02:21.900> playing<00:02:22.349> with<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.709> pack<00:02:22.980> either<00:02:23.310> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
while playing with this pack either so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
while playing with this pack either so

flows<00:03:08.290> but<00:03:08.709> there<00:03:09.610> are<00:03:09.790> many<00:03:10.090> people<00:03:10.330> who<00:03:10.870> do

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570

and<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.320> know<00:03:14.440> just<00:03:14.470> have<00:03:14.920> less<00:03:15.190> movement<00:03:15.520> but

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
and you know just have less movement but

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.640 
and you know just have less movement but
I<00:03:16.090> guess<00:03:16.510> that's<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:16.900> my<00:03:17.170> personal

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
I guess that's just my personal

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.100 
I guess that's just my personal
preference<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.370> didn't<00:03:19.300> mention<00:03:19.690> that<00:03:19.720> this

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.180

pack<00:03:20.470> has<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.430> lighter<00:03:21.970> feel<00:03:22.450> to<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.800> well<00:03:23.800> the

light that light in the night is also

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.729

um<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:31.080> personally<00:03:32.080> play<00:03:32.410> on<00:03:32.709> bright<00:03:33.370> but<00:03:34.000> even

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
um I personally play on bright but even

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.250 
um I personally play on bright but even
when<00:03:34.989> i<00:03:35.320> turned<00:03:35.920> my<00:03:36.160> brightness<00:03:36.489> down<00:03:37.000> I<00:03:37.360> can

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
when i turned my brightness down I can

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
when i turned my brightness down I can
still<00:03:38.440> see<00:03:38.980> at<00:03:39.220> night<00:03:39.489> so<00:03:39.930> areas<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.290> are<00:03:41.560> you

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
still see at night so areas that are you

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.479 
still see at night so areas that are you
know<00:03:42.400> lit<00:03:42.730> up<00:03:42.880> are<00:03:43.360> especially<00:03:43.989> bright<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.920> I

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
know lit up are especially bright and I

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.840 
know lit up are especially bright and I
think<00:03:46.180> this<00:03:46.360> pack<00:03:46.660> does<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.280> nice<00:03:48.280> job<00:03:48.340> at

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
think this pack does a nice job at

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.210 
think this pack does a nice job at
differentiating<00:03:49.239> between<00:03:49.840> light<00:03:50.620> during<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
differentiating between light during the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.140 
differentiating between light during the
night<00:03:51.459> even<00:03:52.390> with<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:53.019> night<00:03:53.860> not<00:03:54.340> being<00:03:54.820> too

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
night even with the night not being too

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.259 
night even with the night not being too
dark<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.750> places<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.260> aren't<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:58.000> know<00:03:58.120> it's

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
dark in places that aren't you know it's

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.280 
dark in places that aren't you know it's
so<00:03:58.480> lit<00:03:58.780> up<00:03:59.489> overall<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.730> feel<00:04:01.090> like<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.660> colors

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
so lit up overall I feel like the colors

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.860 
so lit up overall I feel like the colors
and<00:04:02.320> light<00:04:02.709> levels<00:04:03.070> of<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.489> pack<00:04:03.880> are<00:04:04.180> pretty

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
and light levels of this pack are pretty

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.870 
and light levels of this pack are pretty
nice<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.380> I<00:04:05.440> like<00:04:05.650> them<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:06.070> lot

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.240 

next<00:04:11.880> up<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.240> have<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.720> silvers<00:04:13.290> shaders<00:04:14.010> once

next up I have the silvers shaders once

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.980 
next up I have the silvers shaders once
again<00:04:14.550> i<00:04:14.730> hope<00:04:15.030> i<00:04:15.270> pronounced<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:15.840> correctly

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990

pack<00:04:35.580> of<00:04:35.910> which<00:04:36.150> if<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:37.320> were<00:04:37.590> to<00:04:38.070> be<00:04:38.100> using<00:04:38.940> this

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
pack of which if I were to be using this

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.720 
pack of which if I were to be using this
pack<00:04:39.390> for<00:04:39.720> certain<00:04:40.500> things<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:41.100> probably

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
pack for certain things I probably

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.810 
pack for certain things I probably
wouldn't<00:04:42.420> like<00:04:42.480> that<00:04:43.040> but<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.190> light<00:04:44.400> levels

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
wouldn't like that but the light levels

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.510 
wouldn't like that but the light levels
near<00:04:45.330> you<00:04:46.020> know<00:04:46.140> some<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.710> lit<00:04:46.920> up<00:04:47.070> areas

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
near you know some of the lit up areas

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.030 
near you know some of the lit up areas
at<00:04:47.730> night<00:04:47.940> they<00:04:48.870> look<00:04:49.080> pretty<00:04:49.320> awesome<00:04:49.860> and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
at night they look pretty awesome and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.820 
at night they look pretty awesome and
that<00:04:50.610> is<00:04:50.790> definitely<00:04:51.000> a<00:04:51.300> huge<00:04:51.510> plus<00:04:51.900> which

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
that is definitely a huge plus which

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.100 
that is definitely a huge plus which
balances<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.790> fact<00:04:54.180> that<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.510> night<00:04:54.720> is<00:04:54.750> so

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
balances the fact that the night is so

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.940 
balances the fact that the night is so
dark<00:04:56.120> when<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.240> rains<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:57.960> get<00:04:58.200> that<00:04:58.380> our<00:04:58.650> rain

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
dark when it rains you get that our rain

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.010 
dark when it rains you get that our rain
dripping<00:04:59.310> down<00:04:59.790> your<00:04:59.850> screen<00:05:00.420> effects<00:05:00.750> and

dripping down your screen effects and
link<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.470> pack<00:05:01.710> that<00:05:02.070> was<00:05:02.130> at<00:05:02.400> number<00:05:02.700> four

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
link to the pack that was at number four

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.590 
link to the pack that was at number four
and<00:05:03.950> it's<00:05:04.950> just<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.520> cool<00:05:05.910> addition<00:05:06.450> to

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
and it's just the cool addition to

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.780 
and it's just the cool addition to
shader<00:05:06.810> packs<00:05:07.140> in<00:05:07.350> my<00:05:07.470> opinion<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.580> last

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
shader packs in my opinion the last

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.850 
shader packs in my opinion the last
thing<00:05:09.000> I<00:05:09.090> want<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.330> mention<00:05:09.390> is<00:05:09.930> that<00:05:09.960> the

thing I want to mention is that the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.030 
thing I want to mention is that the
sun's<00:05:11.250> glare<00:05:11.640> is<00:05:12.060> pretty<00:05:12.510> bright<00:05:13.050> while<00:05:14.010> i

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040
