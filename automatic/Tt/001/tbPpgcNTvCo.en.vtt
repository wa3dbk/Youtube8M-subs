 night I write was a good steam in this 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.280
 the crew that is doing something good is not 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.110
 something good something creative and good I'll 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.989
 to tell because I'm in steam and because 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.550
 you see operation feel estimated 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.410
 We are putting together some signatures 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.960

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.239
 I will say how to vote they arrived 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.870
 the 300 votes we are going we are going well equal of 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.360
 anyway, the good thing is that it's like that 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.270
 having operation 7 in steam was 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.450
 would lower a little what is the lake 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.460
 also the fluency of chatting within the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.190
 I completely play that now I'm going to 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.470
 show more or less how is also the 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.240
 do something to govern something say 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.720
 concrete what what are people 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.060
 they use crosses the sacrum today who estimated 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.909
 it could be arranged a little maybe good 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.610
 the things is that it would be lowered enough 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.220
 in the as he said is more fluid because 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.020
 you have everything here you have a whole social network 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.090

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.160
 we have many games also like 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.899
 I sometimes leave a little to feel 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.810
 I get an obvious free to play that 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.820
 operation 7 would be in free to play 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.560
 free game without steam but the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.890
 true that what the steam vale knows 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.500
 to say and that would be the great big news 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.179
 which operation 7 was there ok in the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.060
