00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
advantage of a we as a system is that it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.140 
advantage of a we as a system is that it
just<00:01:07.830> gives<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.700> control

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
much more to the ER to the experience of

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.249 
much more to the ER to the experience of

in a very sort of simplistic fashion of

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
in a very sort of simplistic fashion of
how<00:01:18.450> cool<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.049> bowling<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> goal<00:01:19.890> for

how cool the bowling and the goal for
everything<00:01:20.340> else<00:01:20.490> fell<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
everything else fell on that we want to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.570 
everything else fell on that we want to
we<00:01:21.689> want<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.900> take<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> feeling<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.799> sucking

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
we want to take that feeling of sucking

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
we want to take that feeling of sucking
the<00:01:23.670> game<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> experience<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the game more into the experience and a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.560 
the game more into the experience and a
prior<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.979> overlord<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.970> way<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.210> do<00:01:27.390> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
prior to overlord so the way we do that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
prior to overlord so the way we do that
is<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.750> use<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.350> as<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.430> I'm

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
is we use the as you can see as I'm

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.510 
is we use the as you can see as I'm
moving<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.909> pointer<00:01:30.090> around<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.689> screen<00:01:31.020> here

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
moving the pointer around on screen here

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
moving the pointer around on screen here
the<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.909> minions<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.869> hold<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.140> my<00:01:34.259> b

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the the minions if I if I hold down my b

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
the the minions if I if I hold down my b
bun<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.100> minions<00:01:35.400> will<00:01:35.490> chase<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> pointer

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
bun the minions will chase the pointer

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.450 
bun the minions will chase the pointer
around<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> landscape<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.259> it's<00:01:37.409> very<00:01:37.829> direct

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
around the landscape so it's very direct

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.010 
around the landscape so it's very direct
kind<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.759> eye<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> overlord<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:39.720> pointing
