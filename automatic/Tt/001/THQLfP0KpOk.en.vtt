not<00:00:40.890> here<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.070> talk<00:00:41.219> about<00:00:41.280> Frank's<00:00:41.879> now<00:00:42.059> 1c<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
not here to talk about Frank's now 1c is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.940 
not here to talk about Frank's now 1c is
major<00:00:44.070> vessels<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.510> first<00:00:45.960> major<00:00:46.289> branch<00:00:46.680> off

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.889 
thinking about the stomach per minute
the<00:00:59.280> stomach<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.760> kind<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> j-shaped

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the stomach is kind of like a j-shaped

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.250 
the stomach is kind of like a j-shaped

the<00:01:44.770> liver<00:01:44.980> is<00:01:45.250> going<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.640> give<00:01:45.760> off<00:01:45.910> right

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
the liver is going to give off right

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.560 
the liver is going to give off right
gastric<00:01:46.630> artery<00:01:46.900> guess<00:01:47.710> what<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:47.920> does<00:01:48.570> it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
gastric artery guess what that does it

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.180 
gastric artery guess what that does it
comes<00:01:49.810> into<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.290> lesser<00:01:50.590> curvature<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
comes into the lesser curvature of the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.700 
comes into the lesser curvature of the
summit<00:01:51.640> an<00:01:51.850> anastomosis<00:01:52.390> with<00:01:52.990> left<00:01:53.410> gastric

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
summit an anastomosis with left gastric

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.820 
summit an anastomosis with left gastric
artery<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:55.210> if<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.420> stomach's<00:01:55.840> here<00:01:56.140> lesser

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
artery so if the stomach's here lesser

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.040 
artery so if the stomach's here lesser
curvatures<00:01:57.340> here<00:01:57.610> you're<00:01:58.420> going<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.780> an
