00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
forum lately with the recall that Harley

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.359 
forum lately with the recall that Harley
just<00:00:16.509> came<00:00:16.660> out<00:00:16.810> with<00:00:16.990> with<00:00:17.349> bags<00:00:17.890> actually

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
falling off on the highway so I think

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.290 
falling off on the highway so I think
it's<00:00:20.830> important<00:00:21.609> to<00:00:21.699> go<00:00:21.820> ahead<00:00:21.850> and<00:00:22.119> install

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
it's important to go ahead and install

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.840 
it's important to go ahead and install
something<00:00:22.660> like<00:00:22.960> this<00:00:23.170> to<00:00:23.920> keep<00:00:24.220> your<00:00:24.369> bags<00:00:24.580> on

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
the bike so I'll show you how quick it

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.410 
the bike so I'll show you how quick it
is<00:00:27.939> to<00:00:28.119> put<00:00:28.300> them<00:00:28.390> on<00:00:29.490> okay<00:00:30.519> the<00:00:30.789> easiest<00:00:31.150> way

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
is to put them on okay the easiest way

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.299 
is to put them on okay the easiest way
to<00:00:31.449> replace<00:00:32.140> these<00:00:32.349> I've<00:00:32.529> found<00:00:32.830> is<00:00:33.010> to<00:00:33.040> use<00:00:33.280> a

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
to replace these I've found is to use a

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.549 
to replace these I've found is to use a
pick<00:00:33.640> if<00:00:33.820> you<00:00:33.879> have<00:00:34.150> it<00:00:34.330> if<00:00:34.449> not<00:00:35.080> a<00:00:35.110> regular

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
pick if you have it if not a regular

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.039 
pick if you have it if not a regular
screwdriver<00:00:35.830> will<00:00:36.280> work<00:00:36.460> with<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.180> pick<00:00:37.570> you

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:38.049 
screwdriver will work with a pick you

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.810 
screwdriver will work with a pick you
can<00:00:38.080> simply<00:00:38.559> get<00:00:38.710> right<00:00:38.920> in<00:00:39.040> here<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.370> pull

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
can simply get right in here and pull

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.289 
can simply get right in here and pull
this<00:00:39.970> straight<00:00:40.930> down<00:00:41.699> and<00:00:42.699> it<00:00:42.970> falls<00:00:43.210> right

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:43.299 
this straight down and it falls right

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.180 
this straight down and it falls right
off<00:00:43.449> fact<00:00:44.170> so<00:00:44.350> good<00:00:44.530> it<00:00:44.589> falls<00:00:44.799> right<00:00:44.890> on<00:00:45.100> the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
off fact so good it falls right on the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.869 
off fact so good it falls right on the
floor<00:00:45.400> if<00:00:45.839> you<00:00:46.839> don't<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.379> pick<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:51.699> can

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
floor if you don't have a pick you can

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.250 
floor if you don't have a pick you can
just<00:00:52.239> as<00:00:52.390> easily<00:00:54.720> so<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:55.750> putting<00:00:56.110> these<00:00:56.199> back

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
just as easily so I putting these back

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.329 
just as easily so I putting these back
on<00:00:56.440> isn't<00:00:56.979> as<00:00:57.040> easy<00:00:57.220> as<00:00:57.400> taking<00:00:57.519> them<00:00:57.760> off<00:00:59.339> if

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
on isn't as easy as taking them off if

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.070 
on isn't as easy as taking them off if
you<00:01:00.640> don't<00:01:00.790> have<00:01:01.030> a<00:01:01.059> pick<00:01:01.330> pretend<00:01:01.750> this<00:01:01.900> as<00:01:02.049> a

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
you don't have a pick pretend this as a

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.350 
you don't have a pick pretend this as a
screwdriver<00:01:02.650> you<00:01:02.949> just<00:01:03.640> kind<00:01:03.820> of<00:01:03.879> stick<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.180> in
