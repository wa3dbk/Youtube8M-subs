00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
in the pan idea something he'd moved

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.389 
in the pan idea something he'd moved
past<00:01:30.789> as<00:01:30.969> being<00:01:31.000> too<00:01:31.299> impractical<00:01:32.189> but<00:01:33.189> as<00:01:33.280> it

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
past as being too impractical but as it

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.130 
past as being too impractical but as it
turns<00:01:33.579> out<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.999> wasn't<00:01:34.390> long<00:01:34.539> after<00:01:34.780> that<00:01:34.990> that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140
