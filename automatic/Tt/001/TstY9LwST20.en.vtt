lot<00:01:39.289> for<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.500> series<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.069> uh<00:01:40.099> he's<00:01:40.879> come<00:01:41.090> up

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:41.239 
lot for the series and uh he's come up

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:42.760 
lot for the series and uh he's come up
and<00:01:41.390> speed<00:01:41.659> a<00:01:41.689> lot<00:01:41.959> I<00:01:41.989> think<00:01:42.289> he's<00:01:42.379> about<00:01:42.469> twice

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
and speed a lot I think he's about twice

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.649 
and speed a lot I think he's about twice
as<00:01:42.979> fast<00:01:43.189> as<00:01:43.340> he<00:01:43.429> was<00:01:43.610> in<00:01:43.759> the<00:01:43.819> last<00:01:44.000> race<00:01:44.360> and

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
as fast as he was in the last race and

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:46.859 
as fast as he was in the last race and
so<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:44.899> think<00:01:45.229> he's<00:01:45.439> gonna<00:01:45.500> do<00:01:45.739> well

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
so I think he's gonna do well

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.300 
so I think he's gonna do well
Tim's<00:01:47.869> come<00:01:48.110> a<00:01:48.140> long<00:01:48.349> way<00:01:48.560> from<00:01:48.619> when<00:01:49.219> he<00:01:49.280> first

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
Tim's come a long way from when he first

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.889 
Tim's come a long way from when he first
showed<00:01:49.579> up<00:01:49.879> in<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.090> series<00:01:50.299> you<00:01:50.479> know<00:01:50.719> he's

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
showed up in the series you know he's

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.839 
showed up in the series you know he's
obviously<00:01:51.289> got<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:51.860> be<00:01:52.039> pretty<00:01:52.219> timid<00:01:52.549> to

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
obviously got to be pretty timid to

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.219 
obviously got to be pretty timid to
start<00:01:53.090> with<00:01:53.239> because<00:01:53.420> those<00:01:53.750> cars<00:01:53.959> are

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
start with because those cars are

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.889 
start with because those cars are
incredibly<00:01:54.709> powerful<00:01:55.239> so<00:01:56.239> it's<00:01:56.599> got<00:01:56.719> to<00:01:56.840> be

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
incredibly powerful so it's got to be

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:43.600 
incredibly powerful so it's got to be
quite<00:01:57.079> a<00:01:57.110> handful<00:01:57.590> for<00:01:57.619> him

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.670
