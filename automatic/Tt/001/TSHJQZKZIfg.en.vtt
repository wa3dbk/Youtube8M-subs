 good to see if we can say 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.600
 in the end of October more basic 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.710
 starting with the most basic that is 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.320
 that 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.960
 they will have to do is download your 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:54.719

00:00:46.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 blink-182 beauty took her good cracker 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:07.470

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.180
 Click on download you will download your 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.310
 pen drive on pc clear before you have 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.789
 formatted in xbox 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.640
 so how to format your name appears in the 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:29.880
 screen showing basic basic you 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.759
 and detail can say that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.740
 accurate or non-lethal data in your 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.319
 More pendrive emits gas 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.840
 I was also here that with pen drive 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.410
 I had some songs, I did not go 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.509
 catwalks I could not do is make a 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.060
 xbox control in case I thought 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.429
 who was going to take everything but did not pay anything 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.080
 so this is a lie 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.670
 Once you have done this they will have a 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.410
 location of the song when you 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:03.450

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.500
 Where is your father 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.050
 Good, I recommend that you make a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.790
 folder that we obviously have passed 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.420

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:40.050
 pen drive 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:55.240

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:58.840
 devices in your game sound and 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:03.700
 play it good by pointing out that in some 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.220
 games he does not mind he does not 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.680
 Music works when you play and 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.430
 will not let it roll when you play 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:27.930
