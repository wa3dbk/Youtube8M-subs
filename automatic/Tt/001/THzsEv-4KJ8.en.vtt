advanced one I've done up to date I got

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.330 
advanced one I've done up to date I got
a<00:00:14.519> huge<00:00:14.969> response<00:00:15.450> after<00:00:16.320> putting<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.920> picture

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
a huge response after putting a picture

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.700 
a huge response after putting a picture
of<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:18.300> similar<00:00:18.510> tree<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.140> this<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.560> my

what<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.099> doing<00:00:29.340> anyway<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.949> tree<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.640> really

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
what I'm doing anyway this tree I really

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.600 
what I'm doing anyway this tree I really
want<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.630> get<00:00:33.750> fine<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> nitty-gritty

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
want to get fine in a nitty-gritty

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.979 
want to get fine in a nitty-gritty
detail<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.360> right<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.930> just

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
detail of it so right now I'm just

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.470 
detail of it so right now I'm just
drawing<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.680> basic<00:00:41.430> sketch<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> tree<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
drawing the basic sketch of the tree and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.130 
drawing the basic sketch of the tree and
I<00:00:42.629> usually<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.320> with<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.559> B<00:00:44.550> 2h<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.719> 2b

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I usually do this with a B 2h or 2b

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.869 
I usually do this with a B 2h or 2b
pencil<00:00:46.320> depending<00:00:46.920> upon<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.309> feel<00:00:47.850> like

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
pencil depending upon what I feel like

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.180 
pencil depending upon what I feel like
doing<00:00:48.000> or<00:00:48.719> whatever<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.110> grab<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.559> but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
doing or whatever I grab first but

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
doing or whatever I grab first but
usually<00:00:50.550> within<00:00:50.700> those<00:00:50.940> three<00:00:51.239> pencils<00:00:51.570> just

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
usually within those three pencils just

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.200 
usually within those three pencils just
to<00:00:52.379> keep<00:00:52.559> things<00:00:52.829> light<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> can

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to keep things light and so that you can

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
to keep things light and so that you can
easily<00:00:54.360> erase<00:00:54.719> some<00:00:54.960> up<00:00:55.110> if<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> happen<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
easily erase some up if you happen to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.090 
easily erase some up if you happen to
mess<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.280> them<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.620> start<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
mess up them up but the way I start the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
mess up them up but the way I start the
tree<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.430> usually<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.120> by<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> base<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
tree are usually is by the base of the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.009 
tree are usually is by the base of the
tree<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.559> I'll<00:01:02.460> work<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.180> branch<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
tree and I'll work out and branch the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.710 
tree and I'll work out and branch the
tree<00:01:04.260> way<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.119> what<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.450> me<00:01:06.600> do

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
tree way out and what you see me do

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.500 
tree way out and what you see me do
right<00:01:06.869> now<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.140> with<00:01:07.590> these<00:01:07.770> different<00:01:08.130> tools

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
right now is with these different tools

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.969 
right now is with these different tools
they<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.689> sharp<00:01:09.990> points<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> what

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
they have sharp points on them and what

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100 
they have sharp points on them and what
they<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.610> they<00:01:11.850> scratch<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.659> surface<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
they do is they scratch the surface of

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289 
they do is they scratch the surface of
the<00:01:13.200> paper<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.729> when<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.000> start

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the paper so that way when you start

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.570 
the paper so that way when you start
shading<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.110> those<00:01:16.770> areas<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.340> were

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
shading it in those areas that were

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
shading it in those areas that were
scratched<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.360> remain<00:01:18.750> light<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.860> white

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
scratched will remain light or white

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.109 
scratched will remain light or white
with<00:01:20.549> those<00:01:21.060> marks<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:22.580> what<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> hell<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> do

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
with those marks and what the hell to do

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.630 
with those marks and what the hell to do
is<00:01:24.360> top<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> show<00:01:24.840> realistic<00:01:25.799> texture<00:01:26.189> which

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
is top to show realistic texture which

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.850 
is top to show realistic texture which
is<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.780> wanted<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> show<00:01:28.650> with

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
is what I really wanted to show with

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.890 
is what I really wanted to show with
this<00:01:29.009> tree<00:01:29.310> was<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.700> texture<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.420> help<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
this tree was the texture really help it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.310 
this tree was the texture really help it
pop

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
pop

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.160 
pop
so<00:01:33.320> with<00:01:33.469> the<00:01:33.560> basic<00:01:33.920> sketch<00:01:34.249> done<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:35.569> next

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
so with the basic sketch done the next

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.809 
so with the basic sketch done the next
step<00:01:36.350> is<00:01:36.530> to<00:01:36.679> shading<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.249> that's<00:01:37.399> usually

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
step is to shading and that's usually

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.389 
step is to shading and that's usually
the<00:01:37.850> most<00:01:37.999> difficult<00:01:38.749> or<00:01:39.350> and<00:01:39.649> time-consuming

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
the most difficult or and time-consuming

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.599 
the most difficult or and time-consuming
portion<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.479> drawing<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:43.280> have<00:01:43.310> to

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
portion of the drawing you have to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.020 
portion of the drawing you have to
picture<00:01:44.539> in<00:01:44.840> your<00:01:44.869> mind<00:01:45.140> what<00:01:45.590> a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
picture in your mind what a

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.859 
picture in your mind what a
three-dimensional<00:01:47.030> object<00:01:47.119> would<00:01:47.479> look<00:01:47.689> like

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
three-dimensional object would look like

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.550 
three-dimensional object would look like
when<00:01:48.140> light<00:01:48.439> is<00:01:48.619> added<00:01:49.609> into<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:49.969> factor<00:01:50.560> you

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
when light is added into the factor you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.880 
when light is added into the factor you
have<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.950> try<00:01:52.700> try<00:01:52.969> to<00:01:53.030> imagine<00:01:53.270> what<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
have to try try to imagine what the

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.859 
have to try try to imagine what the
light<00:01:55.130> would<00:01:55.280> be<00:01:55.399> doing<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.359> if<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.599> light<00:01:56.750> is

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
light would be doing so if the light is

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.120 
light would be doing so if the light is
hitting<00:01:57.020> one<00:01:57.380> part<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.770> branch<00:01:58.009> that

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
hitting one part of the branch that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.010 
hitting one part of the branch that
opposite<00:01:58.880> side<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.240> branch<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.630> obviously

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
opposite side of the branch is obviously

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.240 
opposite side of the branch is obviously
going<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.289> be<00:02:00.409> in<00:02:00.530> some<00:02:00.740> sort<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:00.979> shadow

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
going to be in some sort of shadow

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.459 
going to be in some sort of shadow
unless<00:02:01.880> there's<00:02:02.390> two<00:02:02.599> light<00:02:02.840> sources<00:02:03.020> which

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
unless there's two light sources which

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.539 
unless there's two light sources which
in<00:02:04.360> most<00:02:05.360> situations<00:02:06.229> there<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.069> an<00:02:07.250> except

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
in most situations there is an except

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.059 
in most situations there is an except
for<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.390> minor<00:02:08.720> case<00:02:08.959> of<00:02:09.170> reflected<00:02:09.649> light

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
for the minor case of reflected light

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.580 
for the minor case of reflected light
but<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.450> this<00:02:11.629> case<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.989> don't<00:02:12.049> really<00:02:12.260> have<00:02:12.440> too

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
but in this case I don't really have too

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.509 
but in this case I don't really have too
much<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.799> it<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.769> mainly<00:02:15.769> just<00:02:16.099> one<00:02:16.310> light

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
much of it so it's mainly just one light

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.819 
much of it so it's mainly just one light
source<00:02:16.730> and<00:02:17.150> with<00:02:18.079> that<00:02:18.230> one<00:02:18.379> light<00:02:18.590> source

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
source and with that one light source

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.589 
source and with that one light source
you're<00:02:19.129> gonna<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.370> one<00:02:19.640> spot<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.360> tree

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
you're gonna have one spot of the tree

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.630 
you're gonna have one spot of the tree
that's<00:02:20.780> or<00:02:21.349> one<00:02:21.680> side<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.220> tree<00:02:22.459> that's

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
that's or one side of the tree that's

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.160 
that's or one side of the tree that's
highlighted<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> other<00:02:23.660> side<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:24.079> going

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
highlighted and the other side is going

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.259 
highlighted and the other side is going
to<00:02:24.230> be<00:02:24.290> shadowed<00:02:24.769> but<00:02:25.519> then<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.790> also<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
to be shadowed but then you also have to

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.080 
to be shadowed but then you also have to
figure<00:02:26.629> in<00:02:26.840> with<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.739> branches<00:02:28.190> twisting<00:02:28.970> and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
figure in with the branches twisting and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.819 
figure in with the branches twisting and
turning<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.359> different<00:02:29.569> directions<00:02:29.810> that<00:02:30.709> are

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
turning in different directions that are

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.170 
turning in different directions that are
also<00:02:30.920> going<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.340> casting<00:02:31.790> light<00:02:32.000> and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
also going to be casting light and

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.020 
also going to be casting light and
shadow<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.780> different<00:02:33.379> areas<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:34.010> tree<00:02:34.280> so

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
shadow on different areas of the tree so

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.670 
shadow on different areas of the tree so
you<00:02:35.390> got<00:02:35.540> to<00:02:35.660> keep<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.870> lot<00:02:36.049> of<00:02:36.079> things<00:02:36.260> in<00:02:36.500> mind

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you got to keep a lot of things in mind

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.199 
you got to keep a lot of things in mind
and<00:02:37.010> you<00:02:37.579> know<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.819> little<00:02:38.060> bit<00:02:38.150> of

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
and you know with a little bit of

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.300 
and you know with a little bit of
practice<00:02:38.660> you'll<00:02:38.900> sort<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.560> start<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.130> figure

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
practice you'll sort of start to figure

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.129 
practice you'll sort of start to figure
out<00:02:40.609> what<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.090> going<00:02:41.329> on<00:02:41.450> and<00:02:41.690> you'll<00:02:41.780> get<00:02:41.989> you

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
out what is going on and you'll get you

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.280 
out what is going on and you'll get you
get<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.349> hang<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:42.680> now<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.840> shading

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
get the hang of it now that the shading

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.880 
get the hang of it now that the shading
is<00:02:45.410> generally<00:02:46.250> finished<00:02:46.849> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
is generally finished the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.309 
is generally finished the
the<00:02:47.980> most<00:02:48.340> time-consuming<00:02:49.300> portion<00:02:50.140> of<00:02:50.230> the

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
the most time-consuming portion of the

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.140 
the most time-consuming portion of the
drawing<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.800> drawing<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.190> leaves<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.790> takes<00:02:52.030> a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
drawing is drawing the leaves it takes a

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.750 
drawing is drawing the leaves it takes a
lot<00:02:52.330> longer<00:02:52.540> than<00:02:52.750> shading<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.470> tree<00:02:53.760> but

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
lot longer than shading the tree but

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.050 
lot longer than shading the tree but
what's<00:02:54.940> funny<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.860> don't<00:02:56.860> draw<00:02:57.280> all<00:02:57.850> the

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
what's funny is I don't draw all the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.199 
what's funny is I don't draw all the
leaves<00:02:58.240> I<00:02:58.569> just<00:02:58.810> draw<00:02:59.110> what<00:03:00.010> leaves<00:03:00.370> or<00:03:00.850> like

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
leaves I just draw what leaves or like

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.000 
leaves I just draw what leaves or like
the<00:03:01.360> texture<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.870> leaves<00:03:02.230> look<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.770> and

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
the texture of leaves look like and

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.670 
the texture of leaves look like and
basically<00:03:03.819> what<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.080> just<00:03:05.140> little

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
basically what that is it's just little

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.760 
basically what that is it's just little
small<00:03:06.160> circular<00:03:06.880> scribbles<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:08.530> just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
small circular scribbles and you just

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.940 
small circular scribbles and you just
line<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.280> up<00:03:09.430> in<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.700> way<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.890> end

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
line it up in a way that and the end

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.790 
line it up in a way that and the end
result<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.459> makes<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.209> general<00:03:13.540> shape<00:03:14.020> of<00:03:14.230> a

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
result it makes the general shape of a

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.059 
result it makes the general shape of a
bunch<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.910> leaves<00:03:16.270> clustered<00:03:16.930> together<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:17.950> to

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
bunch of leaves clustered together so to

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.680 
bunch of leaves clustered together so to
clever<00:03:18.430> little<00:03:18.670> trick<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.750> make<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.739> realistic

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
clever little trick to make a realistic

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.479 
clever little trick to make a realistic
tree<00:03:22.690> leaves<00:03:22.989> without<00:03:23.440> actually<00:03:23.860> drawing<00:03:24.190> any

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
tree leaves without actually drawing any

tree leaves without actually drawing any
leaves<00:03:24.940> whatsoever<00:03:26.580> so<00:03:27.580> actually<00:03:28.390> kind<00:03:28.630> of

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
leaves whatsoever so actually kind of

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.540 
leaves whatsoever so actually kind of
what<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:29.560> really<00:03:30.040> negative

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
what this is it's really negative

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.310 
what this is it's really negative
drawing<00:03:30.940> because<00:03:31.239> you're<00:03:31.390> not<00:03:31.540> drawing<00:03:31.989> any

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
drawing because you're not drawing any

of<00:03:32.410> the<00:03:32.470> leaves<00:03:32.650> at<00:03:32.830> all<00:03:32.920> you're<00:03:33.160> just<00:03:33.190> pretty

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
of the leaves at all you're just pretty

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.250 
of the leaves at all you're just pretty
much<00:03:33.790> drawing<00:03:34.239> all<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.630> space<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.200> between

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
much drawing all the space in between

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.430 
much drawing all the space in between
and<00:03:35.920> around<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.430> leaves<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:37.290> create<00:03:38.290> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
and around the leaves to create the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.320 
and around the leaves to create the
leaves<00:03:38.680> it's<00:03:39.489> kind<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.700> confusing<00:03:40.180> and

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
leaves it's kind of confusing and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.720 
leaves it's kind of confusing and
thought<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:41.230> your<00:03:41.560> your<00:03:41.980> pre-much<00:03:42.459> drawing

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
thought but your your pre-much drawing

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.990 
thought but your your pre-much drawing
everything<00:03:43.209> but<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.959> leaves

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
everything but the leaves

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.760 
everything but the leaves
hard<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.180> hopefully<00:03:47.540> you're<00:03:47.780> not<00:03:48.020> completely

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
hard so hopefully you're not completely

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.900 
hard so hopefully you're not completely
lost<00:03:49.130> at<00:03:49.370> this<00:03:49.490> point

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
lost at this point

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.360 
lost at this point
um<00:03:50.060> if<00:03:50.990> you<00:03:51.170> are<00:03:51.350> I'm<00:03:51.770> sorry<00:03:52.010> but<00:03:52.430> um<00:03:53.920> III<00:03:54.920> I

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
um if you are I'm sorry but um III I

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.070 
um if you are I'm sorry but um III I
kind<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.670> build<00:03:55.880> my<00:03:55.970> own<00:03:56.000> methods<00:03:56.510> as<00:03:56.690> I<00:03:56.720> draw

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
kind of build my own methods as I draw

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.550 
kind of build my own methods as I draw
and<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.560> kind<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:57.800> stick<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.100> them<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:59.380> if<00:04:00.380> you

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
and I kind of stick to them so if you

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.870 
and I kind of stick to them so if you
are<00:04:00.710> completely<00:04:00.980> lost

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
are completely lost

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.200 
are completely lost
just<00:04:02.530> maybe<00:04:03.530> backtrack<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.280> bit<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.730> just

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210 
just maybe backtrack a bit and just

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.040 
just maybe backtrack a bit and just
really<00:04:05.810> pay<00:04:06.170> close<00:04:06.650> attention<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:08.570> method

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
really pay close attention to the method

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.720 
really pay close attention to the method
of<00:04:09.200> how<00:04:09.410> I'm<00:04:09.590> really<00:04:10.160> doing<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.460> because

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
of how I'm really doing this because

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.980 
of how I'm really doing this because
it's<00:04:11.800> it's<00:04:12.800> a<00:04:12.950> really<00:04:13.880> what<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.180> is<00:04:14.240> it's<00:04:14.480> very

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
it's it's a really what it is it's very

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.490 
it's it's a really what it is it's very
simple<00:04:15.650> concepts<00:04:16.630> builds<00:04:17.630> up<00:04:17.780> into<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.230> very

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
simple concepts builds up into a very

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.620 
simple concepts builds up into a very
complicated<00:04:20.290> mass<00:04:21.290> scheme<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.340> drawing<00:04:23.270> so

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
complicated mass scheme of drawing so

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.500 
complicated mass scheme of drawing so
it's<00:04:23.840> very<00:04:24.470> simple<00:04:25.010> steps<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:25.520> when<00:04:26.060> all

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
it's very simple steps that when all

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.420 
it's very simple steps that when all
together<00:04:26.930> create<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.470> very<00:04:27.680> complicated<00:04:28.070> and

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
together create a very complicated and

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.330 
together create a very complicated and
dynamic<00:04:28.610> drawing<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.800> it's<00:04:30.950> kind<00:04:31.130> of<00:04:31.160> like

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
dynamic drawing so it's kind of like

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.460 
dynamic drawing so it's kind of like
taking<00:04:31.880> steps<00:04:32.350> into<00:04:33.350> having<00:04:33.980> a<00:04:34.100> final<00:04:34.340> piece

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
taking steps into having a final piece

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.790 
taking steps into having a final piece
but<00:04:36.580> when<00:04:37.580> drawing<00:04:37.910> this<00:04:38.620> start<00:04:39.620> out<00:04:39.710> with

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
but when drawing this start out with

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.580 
but when drawing this start out with
about<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:40.130> 2h<00:04:40.910> or<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.270> B<00:04:41.600> pencil<00:04:42.110> just<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.440> get

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
about a 2h or a B pencil just to get

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.250 
about a 2h or a B pencil just to get
your<00:04:42.680> light<00:04:43.360> areas<00:04:44.360> going<00:04:44.600> you<00:04:44.810> want<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.020> build

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
your light areas going you want to build

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.040 
your light areas going you want to build
up<00:04:45.470> depth<00:04:45.940> so<00:04:46.940> start<00:04:47.210> with<00:04:47.330> your<00:04:47.390> light<00:04:47.690> areas

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
up depth so start with your light areas

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.070 
up depth so start with your light areas
and<00:04:48.430> then<00:04:49.430> go<00:04:49.550> back<00:04:49.730> over<00:04:50.000> it<00:04:50.030> with<00:04:50.150> a<00:04:50.180> B<00:04:50.450> to<00:04:50.870> B

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
and then go back over it with a B to B

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.650 
and then go back over it with a B to B
and<00:04:51.290> eventually<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.770> for<00:04:52.100> B<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:53.360> want<00:04:53.570> to

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
and eventually a for B and you want to

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.600 
and eventually a for B and you want to
build<00:04:53.900> up<00:04:54.170> the<00:04:54.500> depth<00:04:55.100> then<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.370> want<00:04:55.550> to

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
build up the depth then you want to

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.180 
build up the depth then you want to
build<00:04:55.700> up<00:04:55.790> volume<00:04:56.390> within<00:04:56.660> the<00:04:57.380> leaves<00:04:57.890> to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
build up volume within the leaves to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.950 
build up volume within the leaves to
show<00:04:58.430> really<00:04:58.940> good<00:04:59.180> depth

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
show really good depth

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.360 
show really good depth
and<00:05:01.960> here's<00:05:02.260> a<00:05:02.320> really<00:05:02.530> good<00:05:02.650> tip<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:03.160> make

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
and here's a really good tip to make

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.820 
and here's a really good tip to make
your<00:05:03.580> tree<00:05:03.820> look<00:05:03.970> very<00:05:04.240> realistic<00:05:04.600> as<00:05:05.530> you're

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
your tree look very realistic as you're

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.300 
your tree look very realistic as you're
drawing<00:05:06.100> in<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.520> bushels<00:05:06.970> of<00:05:07.060> leaves<00:05:08.310> erase

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
drawing in the bushels of leaves erase

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.629 
drawing in the bushels of leaves erase
out<00:05:09.669> parts<00:05:10.210> of<00:05:10.389> them<00:05:10.800> branches<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:11.979> stump<00:05:12.370> of

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
out parts of them branches and stump of

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.390 
out parts of them branches and stump of
the<00:05:12.669> tree<00:05:12.850> and<00:05:13.360> then<00:05:13.690> replace<00:05:14.199> it<00:05:14.229> with<00:05:14.710> with

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
the tree and then replace it with with

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.180 
the tree and then replace it with with
the<00:05:15.520> leaves<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:16.380> what<00:05:17.380> that<00:05:17.530> will<00:05:17.650> help<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:18.010> do

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
the leaves and what that will help to do

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.460 
the leaves and what that will help to do
is<00:05:18.400> show<00:05:18.910> that<00:05:19.300> you<00:05:19.660> know<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.960> leaves<00:05:20.169> are

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
is show that you know the leaves are

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.560 
is show that you know the leaves are
overlapping<00:05:20.949> certain<00:05:21.490> areas<00:05:21.790> of<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.270> tree

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
overlapping certain areas of the tree

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.140 
overlapping certain areas of the tree
that<00:05:23.350> way<00:05:23.530> it<00:05:23.830> doesn't<00:05:24.100> look<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:24.370> static<00:05:24.940> that

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
that way it doesn't look so static that

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.150 
that way it doesn't look so static that
you<00:05:25.300> know<00:05:25.389> that<00:05:25.600> way<00:05:25.690> looks<00:05:25.930> like<00:05:26.139> leaves<00:05:26.889> and

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
you know that way looks like leaves and

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.439 
you know that way looks like leaves and
branches<00:05:27.340> are<00:05:27.639> growing<00:05:28.060> out<00:05:28.180> in<00:05:28.330> different

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
branches are growing out in different

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.750 
branches are growing out in different
directions<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:29.290> it<00:05:30.010> really<00:05:30.250> helps<00:05:30.490> to<00:05:30.520> make

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
directions and it really helps to make

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.340 
directions and it really helps to make
the<00:05:30.940> tree<00:05:31.240> look<00:05:31.270> three-dimensional<00:05:31.720> rather

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
the tree look three-dimensional rather

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.879 
the tree look three-dimensional rather
than<00:05:32.560> flat<00:05:32.919> so<00:05:33.820> that'll<00:05:34.060> really<00:05:34.270> help<00:05:34.570> to

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
than flat so that'll really help to

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.930 
than flat so that'll really help to
really<00:05:35.889> bring<00:05:36.100> your<00:05:36.190> tree<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.520> life<00:05:36.700> and<00:05:36.850> give

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
really bring your tree to life and give

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.540 
really bring your tree to life and give
it<00:05:37.030> a<00:05:37.090> lot<00:05:37.210> of<00:05:37.330> character<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:38.400> you<00:05:39.400> can

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
it a lot of character and you can

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.890 
it a lot of character and you can
actually<00:05:39.700> see<00:05:40.030> me<00:05:40.150> doing<00:05:40.300> that<00:05:40.510> right<00:05:40.660> now<00:05:40.720> I

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
actually see me doing that right now I

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.590 
actually see me doing that right now I
erased<00:05:41.530> part<00:05:41.860> of<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.010> main<00:05:42.250> trunk<00:05:42.639> to<00:05:43.180> add<00:05:43.419> in

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
erased part of the main trunk to add in

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.350 
erased part of the main trunk to add in
some<00:05:43.810> leaves<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.350> it<00:05:45.310> really<00:05:45.760> helps<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.180> bring

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
some leaves and it really helps to bring

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.480 
some leaves and it really helps to bring
in<00:05:46.600> a<00:05:46.780> lot<00:05:47.139> of<00:05:47.320> character<00:05:47.710> and<00:05:47.919> it<00:05:48.130> makes<00:05:48.310> it

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
in a lot of character and it makes it

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.430 
in a lot of character and it makes it
look<00:05:48.520> make<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.210> tree<00:05:49.510> look<00:05:49.540> a<00:05:49.900> lot<00:05:50.229> more

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
look make the tree look a lot more

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.140 
look make the tree look a lot more
lifelike<00:05:52.200> and<00:05:53.200> when<00:05:53.919> you<00:05:54.039> have<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.460> basic

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
lifelike and when you have the basic

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.840 
lifelike and when you have the basic
tree<00:05:55.510> like<00:05:56.020> you<00:05:56.139> have<00:05:56.289> here<00:05:56.560> it's<00:05:57.460> just<00:05:57.580> a

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
tree like you have here it's just a

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.340 
tree like you have here it's just a
matter<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.150> going<00:05:58.360> back<00:05:58.630> in<00:05:58.870> adding<00:05:59.169> a<00:05:59.229> few

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
matter of going back in adding a few

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.900 
matter of going back in adding a few
more<00:05:59.500> highlights<00:05:59.949> and<00:06:00.160> shadows<00:06:00.190> a<00:06:00.610> little

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
more highlights and shadows a little

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.060 
more highlights and shadows a little
more<00:06:01.000> texture<00:06:01.360> few<00:06:02.289> more<00:06:02.500> leaves<00:06:02.680> here<00:06:02.979> and

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
more texture few more leaves here and

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.879 
more texture few more leaves here and
there<00:06:03.220> and<00:06:03.490> you've<00:06:03.940> pretty<00:06:04.090> much<00:06:04.180> got<00:06:04.389> a

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
there and you've pretty much got a

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:09.180 
there and you've pretty much got a
completed<00:06:05.889> drawing<00:06:06.870> it's<00:06:07.870> just<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.889> lot<00:06:09.160> of

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
completed drawing it's just a lot of

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.900 
completed drawing it's just a lot of
patience<00:06:10.090> really<00:06:10.330> what<00:06:10.570> it<00:06:10.660> is

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910

like me I get very impatient sometimes
and<00:06:19.810> I'll<00:06:20.289> draw<00:06:20.590> for<00:06:20.830> maybe<00:06:21.190> 20<00:06:21.789> minutes<00:06:21.910> or

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
and I'll draw for maybe 20 minutes or

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.390 
and I'll draw for maybe 20 minutes or
half<00:06:22.120> hour<00:06:22.510> at<00:06:22.630> a<00:06:22.690> time<00:06:22.720> and<00:06:23.229> I'll<00:06:23.770> just<00:06:24.039> get<00:06:24.220> it

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400
