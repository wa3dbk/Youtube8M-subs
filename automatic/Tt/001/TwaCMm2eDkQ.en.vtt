combining two mods that we have chrome
on<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:22.009> server<00:00:22.660> with<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:23.810> ic2<00:00:24.259> and<00:00:24.829> advanced

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
on the server with the ic2 and advanced

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.769 
on the server with the ic2 and advanced
machines<00:00:26.349> I'll<00:00:27.349> break<00:00:27.890> up<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:28.509> video<00:00:29.509> into

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
machines I'll break up the video into

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.630 
machines I'll break up the video into
two<00:00:29.960> parts<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:30.950> it's<00:00:31.189> not<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:31.939> long<00:00:32.180> and<00:00:32.390> boring

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
two parts so it's not so long and boring

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.010 
two parts so it's not so long and boring
for<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:34.730> first<00:00:34.910> part<00:00:35.120> I'm<00:00:35.420> going<00:00:35.690> to<00:00:35.870> be

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
for the first part I'm going to be

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.870 
for the first part I'm going to be
making<00:00:36.500> a<00:00:36.920> rotary<00:00:37.370> macerator<00:00:37.969> and<00:00:38.360> a

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
making a rotary macerator and a

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.390 
making a rotary macerator and a
induction<00:00:40.880> furnace<00:00:41.860> now<00:00:42.860> you<00:00:42.920> can<00:00:43.190> add

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
induction furnace now you can add

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.140 
induction furnace now you can add
overclockers<00:00:44.390> into<00:00:44.720> your<00:00:44.930> macerator<00:00:45.440> and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
overclockers into your macerator and

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.090 
overclockers into your macerator and
into<00:00:47.150> your<00:00:47.330> electric<00:00:47.720> furnace<00:00:48.170> that's<00:00:48.950> all

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
into your electric furnace that's all

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.770 
into your electric furnace that's all
fine<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:49.430> dandy<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:51.220> after<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.250> while<00:00:52.370> Oh

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
fine and dandy but after a while Oh

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.319 
fine and dandy but after a while Oh
clockers<00:00:53.780> get<00:00:53.960> expensive<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:55.940> have<00:00:56.060> to<00:00:56.180> do

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
clockers get expensive you have to do

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.550 
clockers get expensive you have to do
power<00:00:56.690> upgrades<00:00:57.290> as<00:00:57.560> well<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:59.110> that<00:01:00.110> can<00:01:00.290> just

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
power upgrades as well and that can just

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.329 
power upgrades as well and that can just
be<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:01.280> drag<00:01:01.790> on<00:01:02.000> your<00:01:02.030> resources<00:01:02.950> so<00:01:03.950> if<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.189> go

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
be a drag on your resources so if you go

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.030 
be a drag on your resources so if you go
ahead<00:01:04.460> and<00:01:04.579> upgrade<00:01:04.939> your<00:01:05.299> machines<00:01:06.040> they

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
ahead and upgrade your machines they

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.260 
ahead and upgrade your machines they
will<00:01:07.189> work<00:01:07.399> a<00:01:07.549> lot<00:01:07.759> better<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.329> a<00:01:09.200> lot<00:01:09.380> faster

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
will work a lot better and a lot faster

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.420 
will work a lot better and a lot faster
so<00:01:11.270> what<00:01:11.930> I'm<00:01:12.200> going<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.710> need<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.890> do<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.250> go

two<00:03:03.439> inputs<00:03:03.469> lots<00:03:04.189> and<00:03:04.489> also<00:03:05.180> to<00:03:05.239> output<00:03:05.900> slots

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
two inputs lots and also to output slots

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.050 
two inputs lots and also to output slots
what<00:03:07.819> that's<00:03:08.030> going<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.299> do<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:09.620> it's<00:03:09.819> going<00:03:10.819> to

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
what that's going to do is it's going to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.459 
what that's going to do is it's going to
allow<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.810> cook<00:03:12.079> create<00:03:12.709> more<00:03:13.239> items<00:03:14.469> out

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:15.469 
allow you to cook create more items out

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.860 
allow you to cook create more items out
of<00:03:15.530> less<00:03:16.239> well<00:03:17.239> more<00:03:17.870> atoms<00:03:18.260> at<00:03:18.469> one<00:03:18.709> time<00:03:18.950> so

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
of less well more atoms at one time so

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.189 
of less well more atoms at one time so
let's<00:03:20.870> say<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.620> one<00:03:21.979> out<00:03:22.159> and<00:03:22.400> dug<00:03:22.909> up<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.810> lot<00:03:24.049> of

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
let's say I one out and dug up a lot of

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:31.659 
let's say I one out and dug up a lot of
iron<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:26.709> can<00:03:27.709> put<00:03:29.169> the<00:03:30.169> iron<00:03:30.379> in<00:03:30.650> here<00:03:30.919> and<00:03:31.579> as

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
iron I can put the iron in here and as

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.490 
iron I can put the iron in here and as
you<00:03:31.849> see<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.150> instantly<00:03:32.689> kicked<00:03:32.959> on<00:03:33.109> to<00:03:33.500> wear

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
you see it instantly kicked on to wear

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.890 
you see it instantly kicked on to wear
this<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.400> linked<00:03:37.669> it<00:03:37.819> on<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.419> my<00:03:38.599> speed

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
this it is linked it on and the my speed

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.409 
this it is linked it on and the my speed
is<00:03:39.049> growing<00:03:40.180> now<00:03:41.919> there's<00:03:42.919> a<00:03:43.069> way<00:03:43.359> way<00:03:44.359> to

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
is growing now there's a way way to

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.780 
is growing now there's a way way to
bypass<00:03:44.949> having<00:03:45.949> to<00:03:46.069> wait<00:03:46.220> until<00:03:46.400> you<00:03:46.549> have

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
bypass having to wait until you have

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.749 
bypass having to wait until you have
auras<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.989> your<00:03:48.169> machine<00:03:50.169> and<00:03:51.169> that<00:03:51.409> way<00:03:51.759> is

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:52.759 
auras in your machine and that way is

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.149 
auras in your machine and that way is
going<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.120> be<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:53.569> place<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.139> lever<00:03:54.409> down<00:03:54.979> in

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
going to be you place a lever down in

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.979 
going to be you place a lever down in
front<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.489> these<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:56.500> turn<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.620> lever<00:03:57.769> on<00:03:58.009> and

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
front of these and turn the lever on and

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.649 
front of these and turn the lever on and
it<00:03:59.989> starts<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.500> machine<00:04:00.939> so<00:04:01.939> as<00:04:02.329> you<00:04:02.449> see<00:04:02.629> that

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:02.659 
it starts the machine so as you see that

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.009 
it starts the machine so as you see that
heats<00:04:03.199> starting<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:03.829> rise<00:04:04.040> on<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:05.090> induction

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
heats starting to rise on the induction

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.309 
heats starting to rise on the induction
furnace<00:04:06.409> and<00:04:06.790> if<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:07.970> go<00:04:08.479> ahead<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:08.750> take<00:04:08.900> up<00:04:09.139> my

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
furnace and if I go ahead and take up my

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.379 
furnace and if I go ahead and take up my
iron<00:04:10.310> ore<00:04:11.829> you<00:04:12.829> see<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.340> speed<00:04:13.579> is<00:04:13.699> still

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
iron ore you see that the speed is still

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.800 
iron ore you see that the speed is still
going<00:04:14.629> is<00:04:14.870> still<00:04:15.409> rising<00:04:15.650> as<00:04:16.389> long<00:04:17.389> as<00:04:17.539> it<00:04:17.690> has

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
going is still rising as long as it has

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.319 
going is still rising as long as it has
a<00:04:18.139> redstone<00:04:18.500> signal<00:04:18.799> going<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.639> it<00:04:19.970> will

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
a redstone signal going to it it will

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.250 
a redstone signal going to it it will
remain<00:04:21.199> on<00:04:21.470> and<00:04:21.949> going<00:04:22.719> once<00:04:23.719> you<00:04:23.900> turn<00:04:24.110> the

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
remain on and going once you turn the

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.720 
remain on and going once you turn the
right<00:04:25.099> turn<00:04:25.279> signal<00:04:25.310> off<00:04:25.820> though<00:04:26.409> it<00:04:27.409> will

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
right turn signal off though it will

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.240 
right turn signal off though it will
are<00:04:27.820> losing<00:04:28.330> speed<00:04:30.780> now<00:04:31.830> your<00:04:32.830> induction

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
are losing speed now your induction

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.230 
are losing speed now your induction
furnace<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:35.410> can<00:04:35.560> cook<00:04:35.710> two<00:04:36.130> items<00:04:36.700> at<00:04:36.880> once

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
furnace you can cook two items at once

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.910 
furnace you can cook two items at once
now<00:04:37.570> instead<00:04:38.080> of<00:04:38.140> just<00:04:38.350> one<00:04:38.620> having<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.070> wait

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
now instead of just one having to wait

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.220 
now instead of just one having to wait
as<00:04:41.920> you<00:04:42.130> see<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.520> starts<00:04:43.270> out<00:04:43.390> and<00:04:43.660> then<00:04:44.080> you

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
as you see it starts out and then you

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.830 
as you see it starts out and then you
can<00:04:44.380> also<00:04:45.010> cook<00:04:45.370> two<00:04:45.670> different<00:04:46.270> items<00:04:48.660> like<00:04:49.660> I

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
can also cook two different items like I

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.690 
can also cook two different items like I
just<00:04:49.900> made<00:04:50.200> iron<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.610> then<00:04:51.730> refined<00:04:52.120> iron<00:04:52.510> and

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
just made iron and then refined iron and

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.880 
just made iron and then refined iron and
as<00:04:54.700> the<00:04:55.000> heat<00:04:55.260> grows<00:04:57.270> so<00:04:58.270> will<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.680> speed<00:04:59.680> of

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
as the heat grows so will the speed of

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.950 
as the heat grows so will the speed of
the<00:05:00.750> machines<00:05:02.190> like<00:05:03.190> this<00:05:03.430> is<00:05:03.900> starting<00:05:04.900> to

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
the machines like this is starting to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.460 
the machines like this is starting to
become<00:05:05.080> faster<00:05:05.710> as<00:05:05.860> you<00:05:05.920> see<00:05:06.990> from<00:05:07.990> before<00:05:08.440> and

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
become faster as you see from before and

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.520 
become faster as you see from before and
now<00:05:09.090> it's<00:05:10.090> going<00:05:10.440> faster<00:05:12.000> also<00:05:13.000> what<00:05:13.330> the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
now it's going faster also what the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.180 
now it's going faster also what the
rotary<00:05:14.530> macerator<00:05:15.040> white<00:05:15.340> has<00:05:15.670> to<00:05:16.890> two<00:05:17.890> slides

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
rotary macerator white has to two slides

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.380 
rotary macerator white has to two slides
up<00:05:18.370> there<00:05:18.610> so<00:05:19.390> I'll<00:05:19.510> show<00:05:19.540> you<00:05:21.120> let's<00:05:22.120> go<00:05:22.240> and

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
up there so I'll show you let's go and

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:29.040 
up there so I'll show you let's go and
get<00:05:22.480> yourself<00:05:22.780> some<00:05:23.970> tin<00:05:24.970> ore<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:27.780> then<00:05:28.780> let's

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
get yourself some tin ore and then let's

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.290 
get yourself some tin ore and then let's
get<00:05:29.260> some<00:05:29.470> copper<00:05:29.950> ore<00:05:30.160> also<00:05:32.460> as<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.670> know<00:05:33.790> if

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
get some copper ore also as you know if

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.430 
get some copper ore also as you know if
you<00:05:35.070> combine<00:05:36.070> tin<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.670> copper<00:05:36.810> at<00:05:37.810> one<00:05:38.170> time

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
you combine tin and copper at one time

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.090 
you combine tin and copper at one time
you<00:05:38.800> give<00:05:38.980> bronze<00:05:40.200> this<00:05:41.200> way<00:05:41.410> you<00:05:41.770> can<00:05:41.800> put

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
you give bronze this way you can put

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.330 
you give bronze this way you can put
your<00:05:42.220> tin<00:05:42.460> or<00:05:42.760> right<00:05:43.120> here<00:05:43.450> and<00:05:43.950> your<00:05:44.950> copper

your tin or right here and your copper

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.810 
your tin or right here and your copper
or<00:05:45.490> in<00:05:45.670> the<00:05:45.850> normal<00:05:46.330> place<00:05:47.370> and<00:05:48.370> you<00:05:48.640> get

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
or in the normal place and you get

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.940 
or in the normal place and you get
bronze<00:05:49.180> dust<00:05:51.690> so<00:05:52.690> no<00:05:53.080> longer<00:05:53.410> having<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.800> make

of bronze just right off the bat very

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.970 
of bronze just right off the bat very
helpful<00:06:16.660> if<00:06:16.810> you<00:06:17.050> know<00:06:17.290> you<00:06:17.350> could<00:06:17.560> be<00:06:17.680> using<00:06:17.950> a

helpful if you know you could be using a
lot<00:06:18.040> of<00:06:18.130> it<00:06:18.340> and<00:06:19.240> it's<00:06:19.420> about<00:06:19.720> 110<00:06:20.500> or<00:06:20.710> per<00:06:21.070> for

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
lot of it and it's about 110 or per for

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.280 
lot of it and it's about 110 or per for
copper<00:06:22.270> or<00:06:22.510> so<00:06:22.840> it's<00:06:22.990> pretty<00:06:23.200> good<00:06:23.440> trade-off

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290
