some of you guys who might be a little
bit<00:00:19.920> unfamiliar<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> structure<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
bit unfamiliar with the structure of the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.870 
bit unfamiliar with the structure of the
tournament<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.400> thought<00:00:23.519> I'd<00:00:23.580> talk<00:00:23.820> a

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
tournament I just thought I'd talk a

tournament I just thought I'd talk a
little<00:00:24.060> bit<00:00:24.210> about<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:25.080> basically<00:00:25.410> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
little bit about that so basically this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
little bit about that so basically this
is<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> round<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.070> 32<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.880> 32<00:00:27.869> players

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
to be called the argument duel

to be called the argument duel
tournament<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.860> they've<00:00:35.070> incorporated<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
tournament now they've incorporated it

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
tournament now they've incorporated it
seemingly<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.899> part<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> main<00:00:37.380> star

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

itself the other feature of this round

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.250 
itself the other feature of this round
is<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:42.210> isn't<00:00:42.570> really<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> best-of-three

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
is that it isn't really a best-of-three

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080 
is that it isn't really a best-of-three
or<00:00:43.469> best-of-five<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> traditional<00:00:45.030> sense

to the next round these two guys are the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.029 
to the next round these two guys are the
losers<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> first<00:01:01.079> games<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.890> they're

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
losers of the first games so they're

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.380 
losers of the first games so they're
gonna<00:01:02.129> play<00:01:02.370> each<00:01:02.460> other<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> interests<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gonna play each other and interests in a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.759 
gonna play each other and interests in a
backhoe<00:01:03.600> setting<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> pylon<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> middle

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
backhoe setting up a pylon in the middle

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679 
backhoe setting up a pylon in the middle
of<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> map<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.060> interesting<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of the map so this is interesting this

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.539 
of the map so this is interesting this
this<00:01:07.049> is<00:01:07.200> again<00:01:07.409> Andromeda<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> believe<00:01:08.369> in

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
this is again Andromeda I believe in

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.399 
this is again Andromeda I believe in
backhoe<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:10.020> some<00:01:10.170> sort<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
backhoe going for some sort of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.330 
backhoe going for some sort of
interesting<00:01:10.770> build<00:01:10.920> here<00:01:11.040> because<00:01:11.250> he's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
interesting build here because he's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.469 
interesting build here because he's
built<00:01:11.520> upon<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> middle<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> map<00:01:12.210> looks<00:01:12.390> like

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
built upon the middle the map looks like

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.370 
built upon the middle the map looks like
you<00:01:12.540> might<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.080> some<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you might be going for some kind of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530 
you might be going for some kind of
zealot<00:01:13.619> rush<00:01:14.000> it'll<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.090> interesting<00:01:15.119> whether

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
zealot rush it'll be interesting whether

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.760 
zealot rush it'll be interesting whether
or<00:01:15.689> not<00:01:15.780> that's<00:01:16.110> exactly<00:01:16.290> what<00:01:16.500> he's<00:01:16.619> going

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
or not that's exactly what he's going

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
or not that's exactly what he's going
for<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.009> would<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.369> position<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.659> do

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
for that would be the position to to do

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.330 
for that would be the position to to do
that<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.680> unlikely<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.310> be

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that from because it's unlikely to be

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.700 
that from because it's unlikely to be
scouted<00:01:20.909> first<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.509> an<00:01:21.630> opponent<00:01:21.840> by

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
scouted first of all by an opponent by

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.350 
scouted first of all by an opponent by
his<00:01:22.920> opponent<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.340> second<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.790> it's

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
his opponent and second of all it's

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.780 
his opponent and second of all it's
equidistant<00:01:24.720> from<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:26.070> four<00:01:26.310> bases<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> map

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
equidistant from all four bases the map

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.890 
equidistant from all four bases the map
and<00:01:26.939> that's<00:01:27.060> exactly<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.570> he's<00:01:27.659> doing<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and that's exactly what he's doing is

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.940 
and that's exactly what he's doing is
putting<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.140> gateway<00:01:28.409> down<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.770> looks<00:01:28.920> like

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
putting a gateway down now so looks like

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.289 
putting a gateway down now so looks like
backhoe<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.850> cheese<00:01:30.060> rush

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
backhoe is going to go for a cheese rush

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
that Nexus town and I guess he feels

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.499 
that Nexus town and I guess he feels
that<00:05:45.280> if<00:05:45.400> he<00:05:45.430> can<00:05:45.610> contain<00:05:45.969> Iran<00:05:46.210> for<00:05:46.389> long

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
that if he can contain Iran for long

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:48.659 
that if he can contain Iran for long
enough<00:05:46.719> he<00:05:46.870> can<00:05:46.900> reap<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.710> advantage<00:05:48.039> of<00:05:48.130> a

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
enough he can reap the advantage of a

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:49.830
