00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819 

I<00:00:00.060> have<00:00:00.510> been<00:00:00.690> scoping<00:00:00.930> out<00:00:01.110> my<00:00:01.260> competitors

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
I have been scoping out my competitors

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.690 
I have been scoping out my competitors
even<00:00:02.370> though<00:00:02.460> they're<00:00:02.580> my<00:00:02.700> friends<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:04.700> I'm

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
even though they're my friends and I'm

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.970 
even though they're my friends and I'm
not<00:00:05.910> really<00:00:06.240> i'm<00:00:07.020> not<00:00:07.259> really<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:07.620> beautiful

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
not really i'm not really that beautiful

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.970 
not really i'm not really that beautiful
and<00:00:08.460> i<00:00:09.110> think<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.170> comparator<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.679> year<00:00:10.860> is

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
and i think the comparator this year is

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.129 
and i think the comparator this year is
not<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.700> part<00:00:12.000> like<00:00:12.269> compared<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
not to part like compared to the

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.900 
not to part like compared to the
computer<00:00:13.410> last<00:00:13.650> year<00:00:13.889> that<00:00:14.009> i<00:00:14.099> saw<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.309> like<00:00:14.670> on
