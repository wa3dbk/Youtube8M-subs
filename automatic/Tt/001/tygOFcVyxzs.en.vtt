00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.080
 Volodin 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.080
 to calculate 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.990
 wherein 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.070
 Hello dear friends with you camp 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.680
 today I will show you a very interesting 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.110
 mod which will add to several such 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.840
 blocks more precisely allow for 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.559
 gather in these blocks and add one 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.300
 moba 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.370
 but as the mob is shorter, we will connect 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.010
 we will understand further what is this 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.489
 blocks this block would ordinarily be coal 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.110
 have it appear in newer versions 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.970
 some kind of enderman will appear in more 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.829
 newer versions and this is the usual coal and 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.589
 usually the most that neither is coal and 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.790
 we put inserted and so the world 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.369
 license plates are noticeable 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.140
 we will fight like this is usually coal then 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.479
 there will be new versions but this mod 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 we are already giving such an opportunity 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.509
 so we will get used 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.940
 further goes with us too 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.430
 interesting blog this is a charcoal blog 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.619
 that is, I would not have thought of 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.840
 collect wood charcoal 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.520
 there is no real father in the blog 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.860
 updates in my opinion should not have been 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.110
 but here it is interesting to work 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.940
 goes further this is our block hay block 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.259
 sen will also be in the skinny update this 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.270
 wheat but you can also say hay and 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:39.640
 Here it turns out such a block 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.750
 there is a little bit hasty 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.550
 update ie they will still be in 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.610
 minecraft but now it's like 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.190
 small mod and most importantly probably 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.560
 which adds from here that scared so 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.360
 further see what she does 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.729
 red so that's just like a snowman 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.090
 instead of snow we have everything on her and 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.190
 it turns out we have a scarecrow m what is it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.260
 hey scarecrow stop using x-ray so not 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.540
 cool here such that we scarecrow 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.640
 we see that she even tosses, that is, on 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.500
 service in our direction or not well or 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.560
 slowly turns and looks 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.810
 wants to describe the mod in general is written 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.940
 that he must protect us from someone 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.920
 there is he should scare them i mean let's 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:28.240
 take zombies took zombies did not 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.720
 peaceful and now and if you believe the plan then 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.510
 zombies should be afraid of this miracle, see 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.760
 but instead of being afraid he just 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.690
 will come to something abnormal that is it 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.060
 Does not help 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.209
 Well, I do not know that maybe it can not work 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.740
 and I got it wrong but he must have it 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.630
 has been described even everyone can become 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.400
 absolutely everyone but no one scares and to 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.250
 you can kill him 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.400
 you're trying to him this is wheat taken into account 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.930
 you plan unusually 12 pieces fell out but 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.450
 Basically this 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.430
 the essence of fashion is there more I where else 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.870
 I can not say I can not do more 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.519
 nothing to look for and basically that's all 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.799
 like the device if you like 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.170
 more then sits on a plumb line to the channel 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.170
 and all good and new meetings
