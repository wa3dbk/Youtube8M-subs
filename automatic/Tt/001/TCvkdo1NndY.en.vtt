00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.729 
that but again this one peels right off
as<00:02:57.549> well<00:02:59.790> very<00:03:00.790> nice<00:03:01.060> no<00:03:01.750> residue<00:03:02.230> there<00:03:02.620> is

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
as well very nice no residue there is

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.830 
as well very nice no residue there is
smooth<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.909> think<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.180> cover<00:03:04.359> looks<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.629> lot

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
smooth and I think the cover looks a lot

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.259 
smooth and I think the cover looks a lot
better<00:03:05.079> without<00:03:05.290> those<00:03:05.590> stickers<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:07.150> it's

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
better without those stickers so it's

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.959 
better without those stickers so it's
great<00:03:07.449> that<00:03:07.599> they're<00:03:07.629> so<00:03:07.900> easy<00:03:08.079> to<00:03:08.199> remove<00:03:08.969> but

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:09.969 
great that they're so easy to remove but

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:11.039
