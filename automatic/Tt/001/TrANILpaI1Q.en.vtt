00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.880
 welcome to a new video tutorial of 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.580
 menezes this time we bring you the 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.820
 daylight the first game that has come out 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.590
 of wild and jane 4 therefore should 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.790
 promise excellent graphics 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.110
 but let's proceed to the tutorial 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.110
 [Music] 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.270
 here is the one in this game I'm going to show 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.910
 whoever is 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.870
 alfonsin as you can see being on top of 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.870
 here at 15 dollars 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.700
 good has a record of 56 they said a 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.710
 point that they have to take into account 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.630
 and the games and this one player no more 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.130
 so what we will be downloading 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.240
 offers exactly the same experience 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:58.340
 that you can get in steam and how can 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.020
 see does not have multiplayer itself so 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.570
 in our region they will not have achievements of 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.950
 sting just in case and from what I've seen 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.650
 the game is in English with subtitles 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.440
 in Spanish 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.330
 It also supports a controller 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.190
 from xbox I know they have one 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.260
 and well here are some comments from 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.640
 people that players say there are people 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.130
 that recommends it as you can see and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.720
 others that do not appear 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.530
 there are people called it recommends that what 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.540
 disapprove 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.250
 now let's proceed to the installation 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.450
 of game 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.659
 and I'll leave a link in the description 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.640
 is this file so they download it and 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.719
 when not also download this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.719
 file will give you right click 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:45.130
 extract here will ask for a password 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.130
 which I will leave in the description 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.290
 well here you have finished 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.520
 unzip I know 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.670
 and we will have the Guyanese folder 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.159
 if we open it by the way you see 4 21 days 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.610
 and then we open we're going to have another 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.320
 call daylight open the game 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.540
 you can open from here 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.930
 but I recommend that you go to lima game 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:15.610
 of 32 and this game 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.440
 executable 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.680
 they can do a shortcut thing that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.680
 I would do now 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.820
 and it still works perfectly 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.920
 it is possible that there is an error that 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.970
 is where l 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.970
 If I'm not mistaken, it's him 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.690
 it's called be 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.690
 sb m 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.290
 cp 110 point of l 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.690
 so he did not stretch an error like that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.490
 jump is this this part 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.630
 and well here I will leave this link in the 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.670
 description also in case they need it 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.670
 they will give you to download the zip file 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.359
 in April 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.069
 this file 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.069
 they are going to copy it 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.909
 in this folder it is not in 32 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.849
 and well it's perfect there should not be 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.319
 no problem if you throw them a mistake 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.319
 like you can not probably go 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.209
 is the dist bcb then when they are 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.400
 here in the white folder open as 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.440
 magazine 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.160
 from that dist 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.810
 2012 install in either of the two 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.120
