 Today we sincerely sincerely 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.680
 I thought I thought at one point I thought 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.449
 to be able to win because I was driving 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.510
 well i was going strong i had a good one 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.490
 step and I thought and there were points where 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.170
 unfortunately, however, they had to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.180
 last mountain friends 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.270
 the wave was able to go a little better 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.530
 in acceleration but is thinking of of 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.940
 yesterday attacks mar 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 and at that moment that if I have 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.309
 trustworthy cavani and I think a little lost a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.780
 little and life I lent is not 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.800
 it was difficult however great 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.899
 satisfaction 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.420
 always better because in short, you are racing 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.030
 after a sitting session we go to the holland where 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 He won the last time last 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.860
 yes I think this was the date 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.510
 best race of my year because not 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.059
 I did win but it was it 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.489
 it was nice step and I was able to 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.870
 go where it will go strong and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.760
 next week there is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.729
 last year, however, won this year 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.170
 however it is risk to be necessary 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.240
 being able to be like that, you see like all the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.000
 Sundays is all legal because then a 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.549
 meaningful and words of greeting better but in the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.430
 but that's okay and so we have to try to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.020
 do the maximum to find today we have 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 had once again the demonstration that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.810

 he always remains very strong in front of him 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.760
 very polished during the last 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.890
 turn like the one that difficulties then 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.630
 two quick questions from the study too 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.850
 because besides them they are also 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.890

 Exciting singer explains big house 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.140

 first then we finish a beautiful one 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.430
 study and podium progression 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.560
 like start deciding when 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.060
 here we take away what it took to be 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.280
 a positive I have to say thanks to everything 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.260
 today it was nice to see driving there 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.270
 front on the head and the craftsman like 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.220
 go to the cinema of the Colosseum put back 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.770
 a new one 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.090
 I wanted to ask you if technically everything 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.980
 the weekend and problems in the last 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.299
 sector where a couple of tenths has them 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.799
 always left 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.390
 then suddenly disappeared in the race 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.299
 problems if you ever even head 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.920
 conducted for half is the last solution 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.590
 which is always found at the last minute 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.720
 with the race animal pilot's switch 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.870
 that comes out is steps over the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.690
 problem but the alarm of a race me 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 like it even if I would do more and more 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.370
 I can give that little something extra 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.870
 fortunately in the race it costs him was 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.150
 always so though also a question 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.920
 technique yesterday I was very much in trouble is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.380
 entrance I didn't have the feeling on the front 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.090
 and when I find myself in front of me, the 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.220
 too much I could not get bent 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.150
 to bend over and go group lario is 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.380
 instead for the team and with sylvan 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.120
 we made a small change 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.500
 we checked with the part 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.820
 front of the bike and this morning in 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.040
 warm up going much better 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.810
 unfortunately I slipped because I did 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.430
 a mistake but they saw that I could 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.620
 being competitive in fact I started 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.930
 for the race very convinced 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.430
 well good good good and then if the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.320
 war is going to be done by fourteen 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.860
 in the experience of Sunday we go 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:39.400
 well but what a wonderful question it is 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:42.760
 see if the question is missing 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.800
 we asked the press prophet for it 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.690
 then telling everyone that your problem 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.310
 remains this year the qualification and installment is 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.350
 so since this system is meanwhile 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.489
 of qualifications you think you can fix it 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.100
 shortly what you are missing so you are them 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.320
 sincerely true in the dry circle in the 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.940
 dry ride where you really need to turn 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.120
 in he suffered to do around death 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.650
 and I suffer a little more but this is me 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.050
 success throughout the career even when 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.940
 I was young, it happened to me like that though 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.650
 however the important facts in the first 5 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.780
 because in any case I leave well they are fast 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.370
 and the first laps so I can 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.470
 I can make up for sure that I leave in 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.260
 first row would be easier 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.340
 but in my opinion more than the qualification e 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:28.120
 so my problems 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:30.930
 marco ciao ciao is a problem a little 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.930
 those who are
