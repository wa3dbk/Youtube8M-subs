00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.680
 solve equations problems of 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.330
 primark tied 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.950
 and if you have all doubts in the 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.750
 first- degree equations and above all 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.610
 the problems so we propose you 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.200
 four different problems that you can 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.510
 find in the diary description 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.650
 let's start with the first 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.650
 remember that you can 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.770
 in the description and you are stopping the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.529
 video 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.200
 the problem is already if a pass has 35 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.050
 years 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.050
 the father 35 years 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.840
 a son 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.840
 has five children this father 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:52.150
 and the question is after how many years 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.940
 will be the father's age three times higher 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.550
 that the one of the son our incognito that 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.890
 called x although we could put any 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.380
 another letter 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.380
 the years that will pass 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.740
 then let's see today 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.780
 the father of 35 years and the son has 5 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:24.220
 years 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.220
 x years 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.359
 how much should you stay in the father 35 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.359
 years 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.090
 more x and I choose 5 more 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.410
 x we understand it true pulsar we are going to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.660
 apply to the problem 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.780
 the news question after how many 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.780
 years in the father's age three times 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.780
 greater than the son's or it will be 3x 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.250
 let's understand a little explained 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.060
 the problem when it will be three times 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 higher 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.520
 at what time in what year 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.250
 let's match the in the father 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:19.410
 with the emblem of my father in X years 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:25.100
 it was 35 plus x 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:29.820
 and the age of the child in x years will be 5 + x 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:32.680
 but he says that right at this moment the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.790
 the child's age will be three times 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.329
 to the father 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.799
 we put now golden of the father and will be 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.799
 equal to three times 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.989
 the d 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.060
 the son's but my son's band I 'm going 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.280
 there is an error 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.970
 will be equal to three times that of the child is 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 say 35 plus x will be the same as 5x that 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.750
 it will be the child's age at that time 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.310
 for three we understand it we are going to 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.560
 solve the other loves about them 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.469
 very simple xa the left numbers 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.689
 to the right how to do it 35 plus x 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.710
 we leave the same and operate parentheses 3 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:16.780
 for 5 15 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.980
 3 xx 3 x 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.620
 the two numbers 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.709
 to the right 2 x to the left x 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.440
 the number goes to the left minus 3 x 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.840
 we see it true negative sign that I do not know 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.840
 Remember it is very important matches 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.490
 15 - 35 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.850
 the two negatives are going to come out 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.400
 we really achieved 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.080
 because one is less than three and fifteen 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.820
 less than 35 but nothing happens because 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.590
 after naming the two 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.790
 the result will be positive what 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.470
 we have to take this into account in this 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.700
 problem is that the result on only 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.760
 a few years could not we about the 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.260
 negative did not make sense then you're 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.710
 are little things that thinking about the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.430
 problems worth this is going to be less 2x 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.430
 and this is going to be less 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.430
 twenty 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.820
 fewer customers and 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.260
 then x will be equal to minus 20 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.380
 matches minus 2 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.150
 the negative sign with the negative sign 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.810
 and there are 20 games left that are 10 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.190
 that is to say that in 10 years and we put it 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.150
 years 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.220
 and in ten years the father's age will be 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.310
 three times nothing you have said in that 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.110
 moment it's worth we could check it as 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.540
 applying in an equation that we have 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.260
 we 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:49.710
 35 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:52.640
 10 will be equal to 3 by 5 + 10 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.320
 ok let's see if this is equal to this 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:00.160
 35 10 45 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.190
 3 x we operate inflation as 10 15 15 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.390
 for 345 the exercise is perfect and 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.020
 we can see it clearly 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.919
 and the next problem says well 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:16.509
 if double a number if double the 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:20.180
 forgiveness number is subtracted its half will be 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:22.669
 54 what is the number number x 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.600
 number in our incognito if to double 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.600
 of that number if 2 x is subtracted 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:36.930
 its half x match 2 x between 2 which is the 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.330
 half this will be equal to 54 we have 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.960
 seen that it is simple to raise this 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.160
 problem 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.070
 this is a model problem that usually 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.420
 Exit on all exams 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.860
 both the first of that and the 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.590
 second in the very important society 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.380
 classic country and how we solve we can 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.660
 we are going to remove 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.940
 the denominator that bothers us everything 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.969
 others we have it they are omar they are always 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.880
 divided then this is not 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:06.720
 equal 2x stays the same minus 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:10.130
 and how do we do this because we multiply 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.130
 and this will be the same 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.460
 sorry 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.160
 you have to multiply in everything 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.110
 4x 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:28.710
 because we multiply up and down 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.710
 and 2 x equals 

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:35.780
 and X would be the x matches that 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:37.990
 there is one equal to 54 products that are 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.129
 I feel so much 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:43.610
 4 - 1 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:47.849
 equal to 108 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:49.800
 is equal to 108 match 3 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:51.300
 If we have a calculator, we can do it 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.479
 if we do not have a calculator, we can not 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.479
 think 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:00.130
 but this one 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.130
 you see 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.650
 and good practice practice with this 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.270
 practice the model barÃ§a with the previous one 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.610
 and in the next class we will see the 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.360
 Models 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.360
 luck
