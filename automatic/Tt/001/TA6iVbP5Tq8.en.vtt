and we are going to be checking out the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.040 
and we are going to be checking out the
system<00:00:23.640> information<00:00:25.880> so<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.689> see<00:00:27.930> we

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
system information so you can see we

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.230 
system information so you can see we
have<00:00:28.080> android<00:00:28.650> version<00:00:29.010> 4.4<00:00:29.519> point<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
have android version 4.4 point to the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
have android version 4.4 point to the
Indian<00:00:30.630> version<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:31.109> come<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.769> an<00:00:31.920> updated

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
Indian version will come with an updated

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.760 
Indian version will come with an updated
Android<00:00:32.969> variant<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.500> four

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
Android variant so you will get four

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.580 
Android variant so you will get four
point<00:00:34.950> four<00:00:35.040> point<00:00:35.100> two<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.880> box<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
point four point two out of the box you

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.560 
point four point two out of the box you
can<00:00:37.590> see<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.070> me<00:00:38.280> 3w<00:00:39.030> which<00:00:39.239> probably

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
can see is the me 3w which probably

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.529 
can see is the me 3w which probably
means<00:00:39.809> word<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.969> then<00:00:43.219> we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:45.120> arm<00:00:45.300> v7

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
means word and then we have the arm v7

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.440 
means word and then we have the arm v7
processor<00:00:46.230> which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.530> 2.2<00:00:47.070> gigahertz<00:00:47.450> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
processor which is a 2.2 gigahertz we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.380 
processor which is a 2.2 gigahertz we
have<00:00:48.600> focus<00:00:49.610> this<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.940> qualcomm

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
have focus this is the qualcomm

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.330 
have focus this is the qualcomm
snapdragon<00:00:51.539> 800<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> guys<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
snapdragon 800 as you guys can see and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.220 
snapdragon 800 as you guys can see and
then<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.180> slightly<00:00:54.809> less

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
then you can see we have slightly less

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.600 
then you can see we have slightly less
than<00:00:55.469> two<00:00:55.620> gigabyte<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.160> ram<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.520> about

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
than two gigabyte of ram so it's about

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.439 
than two gigabyte of ram so it's about
1.89<00:00:57.390> gigabyte<00:00:58.489> not<00:00:59.489> exactly<00:00:59.910> two<00:01:00.090> gigabyte

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
1.89 gigabyte not exactly two gigabyte

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.340 
1.89 gigabyte not exactly two gigabyte
it<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> resolution<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.199> 1920<00:01:01.859> x<00:01:01.980> 1080<00:01:02.190> p

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
it to the resolution is 1920 x 1080 p

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.000 
it to the resolution is 1920 x 1080 p
and<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> Adreno<00:01:05.070> 330<00:01:05.369> GPU<00:01:06.860> if<00:01:07.860> you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and we have the Adreno 330 GPU if you

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.160 
and we have the Adreno 330 GPU if you
look<00:01:08.130> at<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> sensors<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.630> will<00:01:09.720> spend<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.020> lot

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
look at the sensors you will spend a lot

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
look at the sensors you will spend a lot
of<00:01:10.200> time<00:01:10.320> doing<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.130> there<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of time doing that because there is a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.289 
of time doing that because there is a
crazy<00:01:12.630> amount<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.110> senses<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.890> guy

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
crazy amount of senses in this guy

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.170 
crazy amount of senses in this guy
facing<00:01:15.299> tilt<00:01:15.540> pedometer<00:01:16.080> pedestrian<00:01:16.770> sensor

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
just pay for the sensors so let's run a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.120 
just pay for the sensors so let's run a
full<00:01:33.659> benchmark<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.320> see<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> result

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
full benchmark and see what the result

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.520 
full benchmark and see what the result
is<00:01:35.220> like

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.560 

ok<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:42.590> the<00:01:42.829> scores<00:01:43.280> are<00:01:43.610> in<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.390> is

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
ok so the scores are in and this is

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.719 
ok so the scores are in and this is
phenomenal<00:01:44.840> guy<00:01:45.439> as<00:01:45.500> you<00:01:45.680> can<00:01:45.830> see<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.040> score<00:01:46.549> of

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
phenomenal guy as you can see a score of

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.620 
phenomenal guy as you can see a score of
approximately<00:01:47.390> twenty<00:01:47.810> thousand<00:01:48.439> and<00:01:49.630> four

which<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.990> absolutely<00:01:54.740> phenomenal<00:01:54.860> for<00:01:55.610> the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
which is absolutely phenomenal for the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.889 
which is absolutely phenomenal for the
cost<00:01:56.420> of<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> phone<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:58.240> four<00:01:59.240> quadrant<00:01:59.659> even

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
cost of the phone and four quadrant even

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.210 
cost of the phone and four quadrant even
so<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.860> was<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.009> look<00:02:01.460> at<00:02:02.920> quadrant<00:02:03.920> i'm<00:02:04.039> just

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
so that was a look at quadrant i'm just

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.429 
so that was a look at quadrant i'm just
going<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.369> quit<00:02:05.000> all<00:02:05.210> these<00:02:05.390> applications<00:02:06.020> so

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
going to quit all these applications so

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.270 
going to quit all these applications so
we<00:02:06.560> have<00:02:06.649> nothing<00:02:06.770> running<00:02:07.100> in<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
we have nothing running in the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.370 
we have nothing running in the
background<00:02:07.369> now<00:02:08.269> i'm<00:02:08.509> going<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.690> go<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.899> nina

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
background now i'm going to go to nina

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.110 
background now i'm going to go to nina
mark<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.860> see<00:02:10.489> what<00:02:10.880> my<00:02:12.580> FPS<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:13.940> so
