00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 dimitri szarzewski the hooker luc 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.609
 ducalcon the right pillar or even 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.410
 maxime knee the scrum half alone 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.519
 benjamin fall not retained for ireland 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.200
 is replacing tonight 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.480
 in this capital match an early match 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.400
 largely to the advantage of racing metro 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.410
 business that on penalty opens the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.730
 mark in the 5th minute the game then 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.160
 set up here we find 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 maxime machenaud he will alert matadi go 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.550
 the third center comes back to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.060
 the interior creates a new point of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.859
 fixation 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.300
 the roots are well installed we are going 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.980
 put a little bit of speed with van 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.199
 der merwe and if jonathan wisnieski who 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.399
 serves perfectly juan imhoff the three 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.380
 wing quarters of this racing team 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.770
 clears the last defender and well 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.440
 flattened 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.719
 this first try the first since more 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.950
 of 180 minutes the roots n did not have 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.079
 scored the least test since two 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.520
 matches they recover at the beginning of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.230
 meeting with this very good job 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.480
 guess what's going on besides 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.430
 transformed himself this test the racing 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.289
 then leads 10 to 0 and looses another one 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.789
 little more with this series of passes on 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.500
 one step this class gesture smells 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.910
 days the cross of younes who good 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.129
 also and allow bobo 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.109
 to accelerate an action that will not bring 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.390
 nothing but the best team racing 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.549
 from this beginning of 2013 confirms here 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.750
 all its potential 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.880
 the human roots we find them there 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 then leads 13 to 0 after a quarter of an hour 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.970
 of the game when juan imhoff sinks into 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.710
 the defense iseroise and extends to the foot 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.030
 quickly to flatten at shell bash 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.950
 imhoff hours it's finally the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.630
 Grenoble who seems to arrive on May 1st 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.509
 this confused action forces the referee has 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.369
 asked the video in slow motion juan imhoff 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.330
 does not seem to flatten the ball the test 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.930
 can not be granted 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.250
 reference to 22 meters for Grenoble 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.290
 no success in the hand so we 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.400
 sees but realism at the foot the one in 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.189
 the occurrence of jonathan wisniewski 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 author of a 100% tonight he adds three 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.720
 new points and allows racing to 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.009
 lead 16 to 0 at half time 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.750
 fabrice landreau the Grenoble manager 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.759
 prefers to smile but not to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 a long time because the racing metro back 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.790
 cloakrooms resumes its march forward in 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.979
 relying on a very good conquest 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.450
 in particular touch tonight maxim 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.649
 machenaud continues to advance in the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.680
 opposing half 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.210
 the guy chalco udc relay for 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.400
 nor a few precious centimeters 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 matadi boma put a little layer 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 we are on the 40 meter line on 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.200
 look to the right of maxime machenaud 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.580
 to finally and well reverse the game 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.290
 on jonathan wisnieski in the closed 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.119
 perfect interior return for henry 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.070
 chavancy doing all the defense 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.440
 Grenoble before serving juan imhoff 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.720
 for the second try of the Argentine 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.060
 embody his run between the poles a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.280
 well built test with his return 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.800
 jonathan wisnieski interior for 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.160
 chavancy which offers a double to juan 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.290
 imhoff 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.480
 it offers mostly impossible bonus 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.470
 offensive in case of third try of the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.050
 share of racing 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.880
 for its part grenoble price on speed 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.500
 and on the intensity seems to the point of 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.959
 break just like dimitri szarzewski 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.520
 affected on this action the hooker the 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.590
 number two that you see here at soc 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.840
 and rightly remains on the ground the action 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.489
 will be interrupted we will come back on 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.709
 dimitri szarzewski that seems pretty 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.170
 seriously hit in slow motion we're going to 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.150
 see it's very neat right shoulder here 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.440
 is involved on this dimitri action 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.750
 szarzewski who still feels a 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.820
 acromioclavicular pain and then 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.830
 also a crutch nothing that does not 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.390
 could normally to sin and well 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.340
 dimitri szarzewski to join the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.200
 fifteen of France more fear than harm 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.760
 so for the skies the output of the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.989
 hooker coincides with the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.030
 start of a good period for grenoble 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.049
 symbolized here by this race of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.850
 florian ninard 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.470
 a domination that will not be 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.060
 concretised on this action but which 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.220
 will be concretized by one and only 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.350
 penalty she is the work of blair 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.720
 stewart in the absence of current slowness 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.220
 23 to 3 is the final score 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.269
 seventh win in a row for the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.459
 racing that still leaves the bonus 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.930
 offensive the breakaway dimitri szarzewski 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.860
 he was smiling again at the same time 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.690
 that the taste of victory 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.040
 he will cure tonight his little sores 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.910
 before joining tomorrow 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.340
 the fifteenth of france i have two small 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.269
 acromioclavicular sprain I think 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.540
 not that it is very serious 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.209
 it's a little painful so I 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.780
 do not know will make a little point tomorrow at 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.500
 marcoussis 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.930
 aulas I already saw with the doc the goodbye 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.370
 racing that reassured me of this 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.250
 side there but for april will have to 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.710
 review at 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.900
 with doctor of the team of France I 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.790
 think no we can wish and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.910
 can be an infiltration and that should 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.910
 go
