00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.609
 in Quebec 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.429
 I explain how to do 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.019
 bring back your channel so here I already have 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.610
 squeeze it normally when udc to the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.289
 wheel to be able to make your tension of 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.270
 chain must loosen a little 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.490
 side course but not too much like 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.869
 taraude moves like that just a word to the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.220
 mouth like that when you loosen me 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 Here 's the opinion here is the side braunhie 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.789
 in all directions so you have to 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.710
 just a little bit of 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.660
 the other side so that when you 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.610
 will loosen here it can roll back 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.870
 without it can come 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.800
 master of the game more than a cog is 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.110
 spent then what to do well 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.379
 heard loosened costs of us 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.559
 high schools elbows say look 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.260
 here at the same benchmarks of 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.100
 the other side you pay attention so 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.420
 that taro is well centered is very 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.920
 important it is absolutely necessary that you are 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.710
 here or here a space needed it's up to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.360
 to say that usually on a cross motocross 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.950
 we say that at that time we have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.070
 near an arrow 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.240
 we can put almost three fingers 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:27.560
 okay big that's about 50 mm of 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.880
 beat up and down 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.729
 me on mine I have another father 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.400
 it's here only paying attention to that the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.670
 chain just come when I was going in 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.350
 pressure and flora and the skate with the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.729
 do not like to touch him 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.780
 usually the arrow a motorcycle that I 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.460
 tell you and 45 50 55 minutes 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.990
 so after what I wanted and 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:57.450
 explained here is that when you go 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.189
 thrashing the tarots must be sure all those 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.329
 come in tension and impressions on 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.719
 tv that kills key point you put it there and 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.750
 there you do she to do that it's okay 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.050
 the chain that puts us art in goals and 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:17.120
 you take your key 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:19.040
 and there serve me and have for tightening 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.780
 if you are an amateur 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.100
 did you serve strong and if you are already good 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:33.440
 practicing heap like indeed 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:38.390
 torque and the chip and there crh 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.340
 to the couple you remove that and you check 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.590
 such chain tension matches well 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.120
 to what you wanted to put it 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.520
 So here we have a little for her 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.860
 two and a half fingers there the tension 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.860
 she is perfect here in quebec
