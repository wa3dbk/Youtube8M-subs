future of potential conflicts in the
Middle<00:02:25.190> East<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.239> these<00:02:26.780> guys<00:02:26.959> really<00:02:27.019> put<00:02:27.440> a

Middle East so these guys really put a

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.080 
Middle East so these guys really put a
maximum<00:02:27.890> effort<00:02:27.950> out<00:02:28.250> here<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.910> they<00:02:29.060> are

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
maximum effort out here and they are

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.240 
maximum effort out here and they are
definitely<00:02:29.510> training<00:02:29.959> like<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.140> fight<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.769> all

the<00:02:31.370> credit<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.819> effectiveness<00:02:32.209> is

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
the credit to the effectiveness is

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.319 
the credit to the effectiveness is
