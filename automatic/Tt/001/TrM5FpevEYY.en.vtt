water<00:00:04.700> is<00:00:04.940> a<00:00:04.970> fundamental<00:00:05.630> part<00:00:05.779> of<00:00:05.930> our<00:00:06.109> lives

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
water is a fundamental part of our lives

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.230 
water is a fundamental part of our lives
because<00:00:07.160> of<00:00:07.279> that<00:00:07.430> we<00:00:07.580> use<00:00:07.700> a<00:00:07.729> lot<00:00:07.819> of<00:00:08.000> water

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
because of that we use a lot of water

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.150 
because of that we use a lot of water
and<00:00:08.570> in<00:00:08.690> many<00:00:08.840> cases<00:00:08.929> we<00:00:09.320> visit<00:00:09.650> faster<00:00:10.010> than

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
and in many cases we visit faster than

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.520

this<00:00:14.480> problem<00:00:14.870> is<00:00:15.019> becoming<00:00:15.289> ever<00:00:15.559> and<00:00:15.860> ever

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
this problem is becoming ever and ever

to increase this awareness our initial

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.150 
to increase this awareness our initial
concept<00:00:36.079> was<00:00:36.200> a<00:00:36.230> system<00:00:36.620> meant<00:00:36.829> to<00:00:37.010> give

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
concept was a system meant to give

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.740 
concept was a system meant to give
people<00:00:37.489> a<00:00:37.520> sense<00:00:37.730> of<00:00:37.910> where<00:00:38.120> they<00:00:38.270> used<00:00:38.420> water

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
people a sense of where they used water

people a sense of where they used water
in<00:00:39.050> their<00:00:39.260> homes<00:00:39.410> we<00:00:40.280> did<00:00:40.460> this<00:00:40.579> by<00:00:40.760> having<00:00:40.910> a

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
in their homes we did this by having a

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.700 
in their homes we did this by having a

design on apartment renters we feel

design on apartment renters we feel
there<00:01:05.269> are<00:01:05.300> an<00:01:05.600> important<00:01:06.020> demographic

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
there are an important demographic

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.810 
there are an important demographic
because<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.130> percentage<00:01:07.549> of<00:01:07.670> renter's

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
because the percentage of renter's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.630 
because the percentage of renter's
compared<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.509> homeowners<00:01:08.960> is<00:01:09.140> rising<00:01:09.640> also
