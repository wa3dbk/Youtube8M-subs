and keeping the ball in and control so I
have<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.570> grid<00:00:24.779> setup<00:00:24.990> here<00:00:25.260> it's

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
have a little grid setup here it's

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.029 
have a little grid setup here it's
almost<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.210> four<00:00:27.449> points<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.230> no

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
almost like a I have four points and no

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.950 
almost like a I have four points and no
a<00:00:29.070> shoe<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.000> middle<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.539> center<00:00:30.779> point

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
a shoe in the middle is my center point

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.479 
a shoe in the middle is my center point
so<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> core<00:00:31.980> points<00:00:32.219> coming<00:00:32.430> off

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
so I have the core points coming off

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.209 
so I have the core points coming off
that<00:00:32.640> center<00:00:32.880> point<00:00:33.059> basically<00:00:33.950> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.190> a

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that center point basically you can do a

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.380 
that center point basically you can do a
bunch<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.520> different<00:00:35.820> moves<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.270> can

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
bunch of different moves here you can

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.420 
bunch of different moves here you can
have<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.840> kids<00:00:37.079> dribble<00:00:37.440> touching<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.280> ball

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
have have kids dribble touching the ball

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
have have kids dribble touching the ball
like<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.670> pendulum<00:00:38.940> style<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> middle

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
like a pendulum style go to the middle

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
like a pendulum style go to the middle
then<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:40.980> come<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> side<00:00:41.780> then

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
then they can come out to the side then

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.720 
then they can come out to the side then
they're<00:00:42.899> gonna<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.140> back<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> middle<00:00:43.739> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
they're gonna go back to the middle and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.610 
they're gonna go back to the middle and
then<00:00:44.820> they're<00:00:44.940> gonna<00:00:45.000> go<00:00:45.180> forward<00:00:45.590> every<00:00:46.590> time

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
then they're gonna go forward every time

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.200 
then they're gonna go forward every time
they<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> point<00:00:47.399> they're<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> come

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
they go to a point they're going to come

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.729 
they go to a point they're going to come
back<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> middle<00:00:48.629> ok<00:00:49.140> backwards<00:00:49.590> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
back to the middle ok backwards and

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.779 
back to the middle ok backwards and
they're<00:00:49.829> always<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> face<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> same

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
they're always going to face the same

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.130 
they're always going to face the same
direction<00:00:51.030> alright<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.660> notice<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.020> always

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
direction alright so notice I'm always

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.689 
direction alright so notice I'm always
facing<00:00:52.530> forward<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:52.890> I'm<00:00:53.460> gonna<00:00:53.579> go

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
facing forward here I'm gonna go

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.959 
facing forward here I'm gonna go
sideways<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.390> I'm<00:00:55.320> gonna<00:00:55.469> come<00:00:55.649> back<00:00:55.940> get<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sideways here I'm gonna come back get a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
sideways here I'm gonna come back get a
lot<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> touches<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:58.109> I've<00:00:58.230> hit<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> center

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
lot of touches now I've hit the center

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.479 
lot of touches now I've hit the center
I'm<00:00:58.829> going<00:00:58.859> backwards<00:00:59.840> okay<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I'm going backwards okay now that's the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.399 
I'm going backwards okay now that's the
pendulum<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.930> also<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
pendulum you can do this also with the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.859 
pendulum you can do this also with the
with<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> bottom<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.549> your<00:01:05.640> foot<00:01:05.880> okay<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
with the bottom of your foot okay you

with the bottom of your foot okay you
can<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> kids<00:01:07.470> tap<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> ball<00:01:08.549> they're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
can have the kids tap the ball they're

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.850 
can have the kids tap the ball they're
gonna<00:01:08.790> come<00:01:09.060> face<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.570> forward<00:01:09.869> boom

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
gonna come face them forward boom

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.670 
gonna come face them forward boom
they're<00:01:11.340> gonna<00:01:11.460> come<00:01:11.670> sideways<00:01:12.680> sideways

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
they're gonna come sideways sideways

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
they're gonna come sideways sideways
again<00:01:14.159> now<00:01:14.820> they're<00:01:14.970> gonna<00:01:15.060> come<00:01:15.240> forward

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
again now they're gonna come forward

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.210 
again now they're gonna come forward
every<00:01:16.170> single<00:01:16.200> touches<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.860> bottom<00:01:17.130> on

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
every single touches with the bottom on

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.800 
every single touches with the bottom on
my<00:01:17.310> foot<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:17.729> right<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.540> gonna<00:01:18.659> keep

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
my foot here all right so I'm gonna keep

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
my foot here all right so I'm gonna keep
going<00:01:18.869> through<00:01:19.290> back<00:01:19.590> sideways<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
going through back sideways and to the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.050 
going through back sideways and to the
finish<00:01:21.450> okay<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.549> showed<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
finish okay so I just showed you the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.580 
finish okay so I just showed you the
pendulum<00:01:24.479> touch<00:01:24.659> all<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> way<00:01:25.140> through<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
pendulum touch all the way through and

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.980 
pendulum touch all the way through and
the<00:01:26.159> toe<00:01:26.310> tap<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> way<00:01:27.000> through<00:01:27.210> let's

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the toe tap all the way through let's

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.969 
the toe tap all the way through let's
take<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> little<00:01:28.350> bit<00:01:28.470> closer<00:01:28.619> look<00:01:28.799> at<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
take a little bit closer look at the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
take a little bit closer look at the
footwork<00:01:29.189> there<00:01:29.520> basically<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.450> pendulum

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
footwork there basically the pendulum

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.690 
footwork there basically the pendulum
