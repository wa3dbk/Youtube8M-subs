00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:06.609 
so here is the new lunar ender

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.980 
so here is the new lunar ender
quick-strike<00:00:07.500> boot<00:00:09.360> highly<00:00:10.360> limited<00:00:10.510> I

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
quick-strike boot highly limited I

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.170 
quick-strike boot highly limited I
believe<00:00:11.889> is<00:00:12.040> only<00:00:12.250> 30<00:00:12.580> pairs<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:14.440> the<00:00:14.590> UK<00:00:15.180> so

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
believe is only 30 pairs in the UK so

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.380 
believe is only 30 pairs in the UK so
they're<00:00:16.330> going<00:00:16.420> to<00:00:16.480> go<00:00:16.599> pretty<00:00:17.140> quick<00:00:18.360> have<00:00:19.360> a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
they're going to go pretty quick have a

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.339 
they're going to go pretty quick have a
few<00:00:19.660> pairs<00:00:19.810> here<00:00:21.899> I'm<00:00:22.899> going<00:00:23.020> to<00:00:23.079> start<00:00:23.290> with

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
few pairs here I'm going to start with

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.080 
few pairs here I'm going to start with
it<00:00:23.500> uk9<00:00:24.660> gonna<00:00:25.660> render<00:00:25.810> qsort<00:00:26.649> quick-strike

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it uk9 gonna render qsort quick-strike

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.940 
it uk9 gonna render qsort quick-strike
and<00:00:28.090> this<00:00:28.239> is<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.509> LED<00:00:28.840> boot<00:00:29.230> that<00:00:29.410> everyone's

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
and this is the LED boot that everyone's

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.880 
and this is the LED boot that everyone's
talking<00:00:30.309> about<00:00:30.340> right<00:00:30.640> now

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
talking about right now

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.450 
talking about right now
so<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:34.780> box<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:36.070> have<00:00:36.100> a<00:00:38.250> manual<00:00:39.250> here

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
so in the box you have a manual here

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.990 
so in the box you have a manual here
with<00:00:40.179> your<00:00:40.269> instructions<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:42.070> I'm<00:00:42.789> pretty

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
with your instructions but I'm pretty

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.479 
with your instructions but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:43.210> it's<00:00:43.359> quite<00:00:43.839> easy<00:00:43.929> to<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.559> work<00:00:44.739> out<00:00:44.949> so

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
sure it's quite easy to to work out so

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.040 
sure it's quite easy to to work out so
here<00:00:45.640> in<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.789> boots<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.890> look<00:00:48.190> like<00:00:48.489> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
here in the boots they look like a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.810 
here in the boots they look like a
pretty<00:00:50.050> standard<00:00:50.940> lunar<00:00:51.940> ender<00:00:53.670> until<00:00:54.670> you

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
pretty standard lunar ender until you

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.239 
pretty standard lunar ender until you
turn<00:00:55.149> them<00:00:55.329> around<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.879> then<00:00:58.089> you<00:00:58.239> have<00:00:58.480> a<00:00:59.249> LED

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:00.249 
turn them around and then you have a LED

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.970 
turn them around and then you have a LED
session<00:01:00.820> on<00:01:00.940> here<00:01:02.159> which<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:04.180> a<00:01:04.980> light-up

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
session on here which is a light-up

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.399 
session on here which is a light-up
swoosh<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.570> first<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:07.899> all<00:01:07.960> you<00:01:08.110> need<00:01:08.259> to

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
swoosh but first of all you need to

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.670 
swoosh but first of all you need to
obviously<00:01:09.070> power<00:01:09.610> it<00:01:09.759> up<00:01:09.880> so<00:01:10.780> let's<00:01:10.960> try<00:01:11.649> doing

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
obviously power it up so let's try doing

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.399 
obviously power it up so let's try doing
that<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.159> inside<00:01:15.909> the<00:01:16.030> box<00:01:16.210> you<00:01:16.420> get<00:01:16.600> power

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
that so inside the box you get power

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.800 
that so inside the box you get power
adapters<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.659> some<00:01:20.049> leads<00:01:21.240> USB<00:01:22.240> charger

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
adapters and some leads USB charger

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.830 
adapters and some leads USB charger
leads<00:01:23.049> here<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.600> some<00:01:26.110> batteries<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.750> a

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
leads here and some batteries and a

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.630 
leads here and some batteries and a
charging<00:01:29.320> unit<00:01:29.619> so<00:01:29.860> here's<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.219> charging

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
charging unit so here's the charging

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.600 
charging unit so here's the charging
leads<00:01:30.899> this<00:01:31.899> will<00:01:32.079> go<00:01:32.170> straight<00:01:32.439> into<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:33.159> USB

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
leads this will go straight into a USB

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.569 
leads this will go straight into a USB

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
computer anyway this is the boot with

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.430 
computer anyway this is the boot with
the<00:02:44.790> LEDs<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.030> switch<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:47.230> power

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the LEDs in the switch and the power

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the LEDs in the switch and the power
button<00:02:48.690> obviously<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.950> put<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.220> batteries

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
button obviously you put the batteries

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.500 
button obviously you put the batteries
in<00:02:51.550> first<00:02:52.260> pretty<00:02:53.260> straightforward<00:02:53.830> just

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
in first pretty straightforward just

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.800 
in first pretty straightforward just
open<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:55.840> side<00:02:56.530> pouch<00:02:56.830> here<00:03:00.720> pull<00:03:01.720> out

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
open up this side pouch here pull out

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.540 
open up this side pouch here pull out
the<00:03:01.930> sections<00:03:02.350> here<00:03:02.680> so<00:03:03.220> you've<00:03:03.340> got<00:03:03.459> the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
the sections here so you've got the

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.820 
the sections here so you've got the
first<00:03:03.730> cable<00:03:04.300> here<00:03:04.540> which<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.870> for<00:03:05.709> your

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
first cable here which is for your

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.780 
first cable here which is for your
charger<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.620> marry<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.250> up<00:03:09.430> there

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
charger so you just marry that up there

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.870
