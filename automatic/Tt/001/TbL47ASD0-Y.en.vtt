00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.040
 this packet yes that is a couple 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.440
 which has surprised me very much 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.720
 because it is from nintendo and i thought 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.759
 then so hay I have something else in that 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.789
 ordered a club or something like that 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.989
 now just more and have expected 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.179
 then I have a short time now 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:25.669
 to done and you look so risked 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.039
 I know what it's all about and 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.949
 it is really cool yes I do 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.710
 open the room again and become that 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.940
 Getting the whole thing out feels very much 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.269
 very cool to 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.679
 yes yes with here our note 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.420
 the junk different and so on, the 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:45.230
 can go to the side just like the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.609
 carton and yes what is it 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.710
 this is a white box 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.710
 so with golden writing on it from here 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.070
 nintendo and normal club nintendo victories 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.559
 really cool and how to fix 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.160
 it can work in it something works 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.960
 we want to get this out of here 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.650
 and then actually have one here 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.950
 right soft box that yes this is the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.540
 material no idea including something and 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.580
 So that's a black box you 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.910
 apparently can open it up if 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.090
 I then find where here and I look 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.090
 purely 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.719
 yes, unfortunately my coins just here 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.189
 a bit loose, I'll take a moment 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.649
 grab it and then I'll show you guys 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.479
 See you soon and I have it now 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.770
 The coins are taken out of their pockets 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.920
 to show you more exactly 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.409
 We once got the coin from 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.929
 Pandora's tower looks like this 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.369
 beautiful gold on the back we have 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.229
 such a symbol here probably 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.640
 I'm just out of the game 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.740
 a little uncertain but I'll go away 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.770
 and I have to say that are not yet 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.530
 not so easy so yes is up to everyone 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.119
 case more than a two euro piece and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.970
 I find it really really cool but 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.149
 I really like it 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.500
 really that's the first one 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.149
 second we have here from last story and 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.649
 i will tell them we at all 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.890
 So turn on, there was such a thing 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.560
 period and if you play there all three 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.150
 so last story xeno blade chronicles and 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.790

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.849

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.650
 free this coin set which yes so 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.290
 But I do not think so 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.150
 For a long time I believe and 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.250
 yes I had all three registered 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.440

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.420

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.700

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.060

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:48.150
