bjbj Mike Chang: Hey, Mike Chang at Six Pack
Shortcuts back with another workout for the

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.790
day for you. Today we are going to be working
on lower body. I am getting a lot of demands

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.370
on how to bring up your legs, how to build
muscle in your lower body. So I am going to

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.227
bring you core exercises that you can do at
home with no weight at all. Let s do it! Alright,

00:00:18.227 --> 00:03:02.330
so that s one cycle. Go ahead and do the cycle
five times in a row, rest 60 seconds every

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.370
cycle. You are bound to go ahead and make
your leg really strong, give you a lot of

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.720
good endurance and burn a whole bunch of calories.
