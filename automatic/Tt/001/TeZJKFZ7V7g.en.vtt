00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
thought about it for a while you know I

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.840 
thought about it for a while you know I
was<00:01:24.520> basically<00:01:25.329> I<00:01:25.689> thought<00:01:26.259> I<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:27.490> there's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
was basically I thought I think there's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.069 
was basically I thought I think there's
a<00:01:27.880> pretty<00:01:28.030> good<00:01:28.119> chance<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.539> had<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.840> original

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
a pretty good chance I had the original

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:33.090 
a pretty good chance I had the original
original<00:01:29.859> RAZR<00:01:30.249> beat<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:32.619> know<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:32.979> it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
original RAZR beat and you know and it

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.739 
original RAZR beat and you know and it
was<00:01:33.219> a<00:01:33.249> debatable<00:01:34.060> spot<00:01:34.270> for<00:01:34.389> me<00:01:34.479> versus<00:01:34.719> the

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
was a debatable spot for me versus the

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.209 
was a debatable spot for me versus the
big<00:01:34.899> blind<00:01:35.109> but<00:01:35.380> I<00:01:35.619> thought<00:01:35.829> there<00:01:35.920> was<00:01:36.009> a<00:01:36.039> good

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
big blind but I thought there was a good

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:37.529 
big blind but I thought there was a good
shot<00:01:36.369> that<00:01:36.639> you<00:01:36.759> know<00:01:36.850> he<00:01:36.939> might<00:01:37.060> be<00:01:37.210> squeezing

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
shot that you know he might be squeezing

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.109 
shot that you know he might be squeezing
light<00:01:38.079> or<00:01:38.289> even<00:01:39.189> a<00:01:39.340> lot<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.579> his<00:01:39.670> value<00:01:39.969> hands

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
light or even a lot of his value hands

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.399 
light or even a lot of his value hands
i'm<00:01:40.270> currently<00:01:40.420> beating<00:01:40.719> with<00:01:40.929> nines<00:01:41.139> and

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
i'm currently beating with nines and

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.440 
i'm currently beating with nines and
being<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.039> put<00:01:42.219> in<00:01:42.310> position<00:01:42.700> i<00:01:42.819> think<00:01:42.999> it's

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
being on put in position i think it's

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.239 
being on put in position i think it's
totally<00:01:43.840> fine<00:01:44.109> for<00:01:44.289> me<00:01:44.350> to<00:01:44.439> take<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.590> flop<00:01:44.829> are

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
totally fine for me to take a flop are

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:46.949 
totally fine for me to take a flop are
you<00:01:45.340> thinking<00:01:45.639> about<00:01:45.759> for<00:01:46.509> bedding<00:01:46.689> there<00:01:46.869> at

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
you thinking about for bedding there at

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.539 
you thinking about for bedding there at
any<00:01:47.049> point<00:01:47.319> is<00:01:47.530> there<00:01:47.649> is<00:01:47.799> also<00:01:48.039> much<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.490> the

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
any point is there is also much in the

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.160 
any point is there is also much in the
part<00:01:48.819> that's<00:01:48.939> ever<00:01:49.209> worth<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.659> or<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.929> it<00:01:49.959> so

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
part that's ever worth it or is it so

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.359 
part that's ever worth it or is it so
much<00:01:50.319> better<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.679> take<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.859> flop<00:01:51.069> with<00:01:51.189> mines

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
much better to take a flop with mines

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.849 
much better to take a flop with mines
them<00:01:51.549> um<00:01:52.359> I<00:01:52.450> mean<00:01:52.990> sometimes<00:01:53.409> I<00:01:53.530> guess<00:01:53.709> you

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
them um I mean sometimes I guess you

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:57.120 
them um I mean sometimes I guess you
could<00:01:53.889> but<00:01:54.069> I<00:01:54.249> prefer<00:01:54.939> just<00:01:55.149> take<00:01:55.859> to<00:01:56.859> use<00:01:56.979> my

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
could but I prefer just take to use my

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.870 
could but I prefer just take to use my
position<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.549> my<00:01:57.729> advantage

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
position to my advantage

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.819 
position to my advantage
you<00:01:59.180> know<00:01:59.270> post-flop<00:01:59.719> and<00:01:59.990> see<00:02:00.409> what<00:02:00.530> happens

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
you know post-flop and see what happens

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.399 
you know post-flop and see what happens
you<00:02:01.579> know<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.000> with<00:02:02.539> a<00:02:02.570> hand<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:02.899> strong<00:02:03.079> it's

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
you know so with a hand is strong it's

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.350 
you know so with a hand is strong it's
kind<00:02:03.649> of<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.909> weird<00:02:04.909> hand<00:02:05.030> because<00:02:05.240> it's

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
kind of like a weird hand because it's

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.240 
kind of like a weird hand because it's
strong<00:02:05.719> but<00:02:05.750> not<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.320> strong<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.950> just

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
strong but not that strong I just

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.650 
strong but not that strong I just
Brevard<00:02:07.610> prefer<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:07.970> take<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.149> flop<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:08.569> take

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
Brevard prefer to take a flop and take

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.059 
Brevard prefer to take a flop and take
it<00:02:08.780> from<00:02:08.840> there<00:02:08.929> but<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.530> think<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:09.920> have<00:02:10.039> a

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
it from there but I think I have a

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.009 
it from there but I think I have a
pretty<00:02:10.580> good<00:02:10.700> understanding<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.840> their

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
pretty good understanding of their

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.449 
pretty good understanding of their
ranges<00:02:12.349> at<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.680> point<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.099> think<00:02:13.190> there's

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
ranges at that point so I think there's

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.740 
ranges at that point so I think there's
a<00:02:13.519> pretty<00:02:13.760> decent<00:02:14.060> chance<00:02:14.180> at<00:02:14.330> best<00:02:14.569> hand

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
a pretty decent chance at best hand

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.110 
a pretty decent chance at best hand
Sonny<00:02:15.380> was<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.890> call<00:02:16.340> as<00:02:16.489> well<00:02:16.640> but<00:02:16.970> you

Sonny was like I call as well but you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.759 
Sonny was like I call as well but you

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
would don't get to see a flop yeah I

would don't get to see a flop yeah I
call<00:02:19.099> I<00:02:19.400> call<00:02:19.819> fully<00:02:20.420> expecting<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.959> small

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
call I call fully expecting a small

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.770 
call I call fully expecting a small
blind<00:02:21.319> either<00:02:21.530> call<00:02:22.280> or<00:02:22.310> fold<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:22.970> now<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
blind either call or fold and now the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.140 
blind either call or fold and now the
small<00:02:24.080> blind<00:02:24.230> shoves<00:02:24.530> for<00:02:25.400> twenty<00:02:26.030> two

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
small blind shoves for twenty two

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.800 
small blind shoves for twenty two
thousand<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:29.030> big<00:02:29.209> blind<00:02:29.420> starts

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
thousand and the big blind starts

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.390 
thousand and the big blind starts
thinking<00:02:30.200> thinking<00:02:30.830> thinking<00:02:30.890> and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
thinking thinking thinking and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.449 
thinking thinking thinking and
eventually<00:02:32.060> shoves<00:02:32.269> himself<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.739> now<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
eventually shoves himself and now and

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.240 
eventually shoves himself and now and
now<00:02:34.849> there's<00:02:35.269> like<00:02:35.450> there's<00:02:35.950> 70,000<00:02:36.950> the<00:02:37.069> pot

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
now there's like there's 70,000 the pot

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.520 
now there's like there's 70,000 the pot
the<00:02:37.430> original<00:02:37.849> RAZR<00:02:38.080> thinks<00:02:39.080> about<00:02:39.230> it<00:02:39.349> for<00:02:39.500> a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
the original RAZR thinks about it for a

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.559 
the original RAZR thinks about it for a
while<00:02:39.739> too<00:02:40.069> now<00:02:40.760> if<00:02:40.849> he<00:02:40.970> enters<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.269> pot<00:02:41.540> I

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
while too now if he enters the pot I

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.539 
while too now if he enters the pot I
think<00:02:41.840> I'm<00:02:41.959> probably<00:02:42.260> just<00:02:42.500> gonna<00:02:42.650> fold<00:02:42.950> but

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
think I'm probably just gonna fold but

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.600 
think I'm probably just gonna fold but
he<00:02:43.760> folds<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:45.019> now<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.799> me<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.190> I<00:02:46.250> have<00:02:46.459> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
he folds so now it's to me and I have to

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.690 
he folds so now it's to me and I have to
call<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:47.180> I<00:02:47.739> guess<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.860> was<00:02:48.950> 38<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.400> had<00:02:49.610> to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
call like I guess it was 38 I had to

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.289 
call like I guess it was 38 I had to
call<00:02:49.880> like<00:02:50.170> 32,000<00:02:51.170> or<00:02:51.260> something<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.790> there

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
call like 32,000 or something in there

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.789 
call like 32,000 or something in there
was<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.540> 70<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.079> middle<00:02:54.319> so<00:02:54.590> now<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:54.739> just

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
was like 70 in the middle so now I just

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.140 
was like 70 in the middle so now I just
have<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.099> think<00:02:55.280> about<00:02:55.459> what<00:02:55.730> their<00:02:55.880> ranges

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
have to think about what their ranges

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.690 
have to think about what their ranges
are<00:02:56.299> I<00:02:56.450> thought<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.840> small<00:02:57.079> blind<00:02:57.700> he's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
are I thought the small blind he's

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.920 
are I thought the small blind he's
probably<00:02:58.849> lose<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.360> weakest<00:02:59.630> probably

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
probably lose the weakest probably

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.750 
probably lose the weakest probably
almost<00:03:00.290> died<00:03:00.530> I<00:03:00.560> thought<00:03:00.799> he<00:03:01.099> never<00:03:01.430> has<00:03:01.610> me

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
almost died I thought he never has me

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.460 
almost died I thought he never has me
beat<00:03:01.880> just<00:03:02.239> because<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.750> don't<00:03:03.230> think<00:03:03.260> he's

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
beat just because I don't think he's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.110 
beat just because I don't think he's
ever<00:03:03.590> slow<00:03:03.799> playing<00:03:04.040> preflop<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.000> know

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
ever slow playing preflop and you know

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.300 
ever slow playing preflop and you know
raise<00:03:05.540> call<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.140> just<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.680> don't<00:03:07.010> think<00:03:07.160> he

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
raise call and just I don't think he

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.280 
raise call and just I don't think he
would<00:03:07.400> ever<00:03:07.489> call<00:03:07.760> like<00:03:07.970> tens<00:03:08.180> plus<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.660> that

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
would ever call like tens plus in that

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.020 
would ever call like tens plus in that
spot<00:03:09.560> or<00:03:09.709> H<00:03:09.859> King<00:03:10.130> plus<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.790> actually

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
spot or H King plus so I actually

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.030 
spot or H King plus so I actually
thought<00:03:11.299> he<00:03:11.359> had<00:03:11.510> like<00:03:11.630> 27<00:03:11.840> s<00:03:12.170> or<00:03:12.260> two<00:03:12.410> sixes<00:03:12.769> so

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
thought he had like 27 s or two sixes so

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.559 
thought he had like 27 s or two sixes so
which<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.280> had<00:03:13.400> crushed<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:14.209> not<00:03:14.299> my<00:03:14.420> only

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
which I had crushed it's not my only

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.910 
which I had crushed it's not my only
warrior<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.049> big<00:03:15.200> blind<00:03:15.380> but<00:03:15.590> I'm<00:03:15.709> getting

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
warrior is the big blind but I'm getting

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.039 
warrior is the big blind but I'm getting
such<00:03:16.069> a<00:03:16.100> good<00:03:16.310> price<00:03:16.579> that<00:03:17.329> I<00:03:17.359> think<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.930> know

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
such a good price that I think you know

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.680 
such a good price that I think you know
I<00:03:18.799> think<00:03:19.160> he<00:03:19.489> saw<00:03:19.700> often<00:03:19.970> has<00:03:20.090> like<00:03:20.299> two<00:03:20.540> big

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
I think he saw often has like two big

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.569 
I think he saw often has like two big
cards<00:03:20.989> like<00:03:21.139> a<00:03:21.170> skiing<00:03:21.500> or<00:03:21.590> ace<00:03:21.680> Queen<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.519> I

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
kind of painful lead ran out I think

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.059 
kind of painful lead ran out I think
and<00:03:56.379> no<00:03:56.909> it<00:03:57.909> ran<00:03:58.060> out<00:03:58.180> ten<00:03:58.480> eight<00:03:59.230> seven<00:03:59.799> deuce

ten-four<00:04:00.909> so<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:01.900> actually<00:04:02.319> got<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.650> little<00:04:02.859> bit

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
ten-four so I actually got a little bit

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.830 
ten-four so I actually got a little bit
of<00:04:03.099> money<00:04:03.129> back<00:04:03.430> from<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.090> big<00:04:04.209> blind<00:04:04.359> I<00:04:04.629> still

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
of money back from the big blind I still

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.349 
of money back from the big blind I still
lost<00:04:05.019> like<00:04:05.349> maybe<00:04:05.709> 20,000<00:04:06.489> on<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.909> pot<00:04:07.060> but

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
lost like maybe 20,000 on the pot but

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.580 
lost like maybe 20,000 on the pot but
you<00:04:07.750> know<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.900> could<00:04:07.959> have<00:04:08.079> been<00:04:08.140> worse<00:04:08.290> if<00:04:08.469> I

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
you know it could have been worse if I

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.619 
you know it could have been worse if I
lost<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.950> ACE<00:04:09.040> Queen<00:04:09.390> from<00:04:10.390> from<00:04:10.540> the

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
lost the ACE Queen from from the

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.880 
lost the ACE Queen from from the
perspective<00:04:11.079> of<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.200> small<00:04:11.469> blind<00:04:11.590> who<00:04:11.709> ended

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
perspective of the small blind who ended

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.619 
perspective of the small blind who ended
up<00:04:11.980> going<00:04:12.159> on<00:04:12.310> in<00:04:12.400> with<00:04:12.489> force<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.359> a<00:04:13.390> move

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:13.629 
up going on in with force is that a move

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.390 
up going on in with force is that a move
you<00:04:13.810> would<00:04:13.959> try<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.319> avoid<00:04:14.680> just<00:04:14.980> because<00:04:15.250> your

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
you would try to avoid just because your

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.259 
you would try to avoid just because your
range<00:04:15.609> is<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:15.879> face<00:04:16.060> up<00:04:16.269> um<00:04:16.859> well<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.130> i<00:04:19.060> would

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
range is so face up um well I i would

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.180 
range is so face up um well I i would
first<00:04:19.509> consider<00:04:19.930> who<00:04:20.139> my<00:04:20.350> opponents<00:04:20.769> are<00:04:20.889> and

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
first consider who my opponents are and

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.610 
first consider who my opponents are and
what<00:04:21.699> I<00:04:21.729> think<00:04:21.970> their<00:04:22.120> ranges<00:04:22.449> are<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:22.870> I<00:04:22.900> think

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
what I think their ranges are so I think

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.219 
what I think their ranges are so I think
his<00:04:23.740> move<00:04:23.889> is<00:04:24.009> fine<00:04:24.310> because<00:04:24.720> basically<00:04:25.720> what

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
his move is fine because basically what

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.469 
his move is fine because basically what
what<00:04:26.979> I<00:04:27.009> think<00:04:27.370> he's<00:04:27.520> hoping<00:04:27.789> for<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.150> that<00:04:28.180> the

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
what I think he's hoping for is that the

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.300 
what I think he's hoping for is that the
big<00:04:28.630> blind<00:04:28.780> has<00:04:29.080> like<00:04:29.349> eight<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.889> either

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
big blind has like eight it either

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.070 
big blind has like eight it either
squeezing<00:04:30.940> or<00:04:31.030> has<00:04:31.150> like<00:04:31.330> Ace<00:04:31.479> King<00:04:31.660> ace<00:04:31.810> Queen

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
squeezing or has like Ace King ace Queen

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.080 
squeezing or has like Ace King ace Queen
it's<00:04:32.560> just<00:04:32.710> gonna<00:04:32.800> move<00:04:33.070> on<00:04:33.190> all<00:04:33.460> in<00:04:33.669> over<00:04:33.970> the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
it's just gonna move on all in over the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.210 
it's just gonna move on all in over the
top<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.479> you<00:04:35.349> know<00:04:35.440> he's<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.860> essentially

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
top and you know he's just essentially

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.100 
top and you know he's just essentially
flipping<00:04:36.669> with<00:04:37.150> dead<00:04:37.419> money<00:04:37.630> in<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.900> pot

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
flipping with dead money in the pot

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.409 
flipping with dead money in the pot
because<00:04:38.410> he<00:04:38.620> hopes<00:04:38.800> we<00:04:38.949> fold<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:39.729> if<00:04:39.970> he<00:04:40.120> thinks

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
because he hopes we fold so if he thinks

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.580 
because he hopes we fold so if he thinks
there's<00:04:40.539> a<00:04:40.630> good<00:04:40.750> chance<00:04:40.930> of<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.410> think

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
there's a good chance of that I think

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.439 
there's a good chance of that I think
it's<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.800> good<00:04:41.889> move<00:04:41.970> with<00:04:42.970> a<00:04:43.000> small<00:04:43.270> pocket

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
it's a good move with a small pocket

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.420 
it's a good move with a small pocket
pair<00:04:43.750> because<00:04:44.050> you<00:04:44.349> know<00:04:44.470> it's<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:45.310> know<00:04:45.400> it's

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
pair because you know it's you know it's

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.640 
pair because you know it's you know it's
a<00:04:45.630> more<00:04:46.630> often<00:04:46.900> than<00:04:47.020> not<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.259> big<00:04:47.380> blind<00:04:47.500> is

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
a more often than not the big blind is

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.730 
a more often than not the big blind is
like<00:04:48.220> asking<00:04:48.370> or<00:04:48.699> whatever<00:04:49.289> so<00:04:50.289> I<00:04:50.320> think<00:04:50.470> it's

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
like asking or whatever so I think it's

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.080 
like asking or whatever so I think it's
a<00:04:50.830> fine<00:04:50.979> move<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.430> think<00:04:51.639> it's<00:04:51.970> just

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
a fine move I think it's just

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.909 
a fine move I think it's just
unfortunate<00:04:52.810> for<00:04:53.139> him<00:04:53.229> that<00:04:53.440> I<00:04:53.470> had<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> big

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
unfortunate for him that I had a big

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.990 
unfortunate for him that I had a big
hand<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:55.930> nines<00:04:56.199> and<00:04:56.530> that<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.669> know<00:04:57.789> I

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
hand like nines and that you know I

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.629 
hand like nines and that you know I
guess<00:04:58.630> I<00:04:58.780> could<00:04:58.990> I<00:04:59.259> could<00:04:59.830> kind<00:05:00.220> of<00:05:00.280> put<00:05:00.520> this

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
guess I could I could kind of put this

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.100 
guess I could I could kind of put this
all<00:05:00.789> together<00:05:00.909> and<00:05:01.389> make<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.720> call<00:05:01.900> in<00:05:02.020> the

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
all together and make the call in the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.469 
all together and make the call in the
end<00:05:02.260> even<00:05:02.889> though<00:05:03.610> it's<00:05:03.789> kind<00:05:03.849> of<00:05:03.940> strange<00:05:04.150> so

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
end even though it's kind of strange so

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.149 
end even though it's kind of strange so
you<00:05:05.020> know<00:05:05.110> but<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:05.289> think<00:05:05.320> it's<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.830> fine<00:05:05.949> move

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
you know but I think it's a fine move

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.950 
you know but I think it's a fine move
sometimes<00:05:06.520> do<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.090> think<00:05:07.300> nines<00:05:07.539> are<00:05:07.720> at<00:05:07.870> the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
sometimes do you think nines are at the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.300 
sometimes do you think nines are at the
bottom<00:05:08.139> of<00:05:08.320> your<00:05:08.349> calling<00:05:08.680> you<00:05:08.740> register<00:05:09.060> um<00:05:10.060> I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
bottom of your calling you register um I

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.260 
bottom of your calling you register um I
mean<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.370> probably<00:05:12.550> do<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:12.880> same<00:05:12.909> thing<00:05:13.150> with

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
mean I probably do the same thing with

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.469 
mean I probably do the same thing with
eights<00:05:14.159> you<00:05:15.159> mean<00:05:15.310> like<00:05:15.430> like<00:05:15.760> pocket<00:05:16.120> pairs<00:05:16.330> i

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
eights you mean like like pocket pairs i

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:17.969 
eights you mean like like pocket pairs i
would<00:05:16.599> probably<00:05:16.960> i<00:05:17.199> would<00:05:17.470> probably<00:05:17.800> call

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
would probably i would probably call

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.089 
would probably i would probably call
with<00:05:18.130> aids<00:05:18.280> as<00:05:18.460> well<00:05:18.810> 7s<00:05:19.810> is<00:05:19.960> closed<00:05:20.320> i<00:05:20.650> think<00:05:21.010> i

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
with aids as well 7s is closed i think i

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:22.320 
with aids as well 7s is closed i think i
might<00:05:21.250> call<00:05:21.490> with<00:05:21.639> sevens<00:05:21.940> as<00:05:22.030> well<00:05:22.180> i<00:05:22.210> think

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
might call with sevens as well i think

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.420 
might call with sevens as well i think
it's<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.690> very<00:05:22.780> similar<00:05:23.169> situation<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:23.860> don't

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
it's a very similar situation I don't

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.649 
it's a very similar situation I don't
know<00:05:24.490> if<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.669> big<00:05:24.849> line<00:05:25.030> is<00:05:25.150> squeezing<00:05:25.449> with

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
know if the big line is squeezing with

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.379 
know if the big line is squeezing with
aids<00:05:25.870> necessarily<00:05:26.440> 57<00:05:27.310> s<00:05:27.370> so<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:27.970> think<00:05:28.240> it's

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:28.389 
aids necessarily 57 s so I think it's

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:30.120 
aids necessarily 57 s so I think it's
kind<00:05:28.539> of<00:05:28.690> all<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.870> same<00:05:28.990> hand<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.560> I<00:05:29.979> don't

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
kind of all the same hand and I don't

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.830 
kind of all the same hand and I don't
again<00:05:30.490> I<00:05:30.520> don't<00:05:30.729> think<00:05:30.909> the<00:05:31.000> small<00:05:31.210> one<00:05:31.419> if<00:05:31.659> I

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
again I don't think the small one if I

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.469 
again I don't think the small one if I
have<00:05:31.960> seven<00:05:32.260> other<00:05:32.380> things<00:05:32.560> mobile<00:05:32.860> never<00:05:33.039> has

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
have seven other things mobile never has

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.310 
have seven other things mobile never has
unusually<00:05:34.479> for<00:05:34.599> him<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:34.840> have<00:05:34.960> eight<00:05:35.080> I<00:05:35.110> mean

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
unusually for him to have eight I mean

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.050 
unusually for him to have eight I mean
he<00:05:35.409> might<00:05:35.620> but<00:05:36.159> I<00:05:36.250> think<00:05:36.430> he<00:05:36.490> just<00:05:36.520> squeezes<00:05:37.030> a

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
he might but I think he just squeezes a

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.300 
he might but I think he just squeezes a
pre<00:05:37.240> flop<00:05:37.389> himself<00:05:37.750> being<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.320> short<00:05:38.500> I<00:05:38.800> will

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
pre flop himself being so short I will

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.740 
pre flop himself being so short I will
