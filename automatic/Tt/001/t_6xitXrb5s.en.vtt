00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.270
 let's go where it says 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.050
 now we are leaving exactly where is 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.050
 the folder fs 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.550
 well do not go where we have the folder 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.990
 of fs as you can see here 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.950
 and we only give you copy here 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.960
 This message appears 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.210

 elements and we give replace 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 we hope it will replace all 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.300
 existing files once 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.479
 replaced everything we can see that now 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.250
 yes we get the code this and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.840
 we just have to turn off what 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.840
 we keep pressing the button 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.200
 until the terminal goes off the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.090
 button power ready already doing this then 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.920
 we have already restored what the folder is 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.629
 of fs and we have recovered again the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.360

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:39.989
 salt seaweed video tutorials is something that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.940
 it serves them a lot and that's why I make them 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.989
 emphasis always on what is the backup 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.590
 of this folder is very important because 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.329
 imagine that we do not have that folder 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.660
 backed is that we're going to have a mess 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.660
 but good model good 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.660

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:11.580
