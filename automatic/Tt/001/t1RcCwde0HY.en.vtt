to color it Orange

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.479

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
but whatever color that you want to do

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.170 
but whatever color that you want to do
is<00:00:35.670> fine<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.950> what<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.820> do<00:00:39.000> is

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
is fine so what then you can do is

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.970 
is fine so what then you can do is
either<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.750> cut<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.440> spout<00:00:40.680> cuts

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.549 
either you cut it out of your spout cuts
it<00:00:41.129> out<00:00:41.219> usually<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.149> some<00:00:42.989> children<00:00:43.410> at

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
it out usually like some children at

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.740 
it out usually like some children at
three<00:00:43.950> are<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.520> good<00:00:44.670> at<00:00:44.820> cutting<00:00:45.059> but

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
three are really good at cutting but

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.840 
three are really good at cutting but
four-year-olds<00:00:46.649> that's<00:00:47.160> when<00:00:47.399> we<00:00:47.579> really

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
four-year-olds that's when we really

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
four-year-olds that's when we really
start<00:00:48.180> working<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.660> cutting<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.140> everything

start working on cutting and everything

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.189 
start working on cutting and everything
so<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.579> just<00:00:51.000> go<00:00:51.270> ahead<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.780> put<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> down

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
so then just go ahead and put it down

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
so then just go ahead and put it down
and<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.739> color<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.430> course<00:00:53.730> whatever

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
some are other colors as well but if

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
some are other colors as well but if
it's<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.030> purple<00:01:06.360> pumpkin<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.930> want<00:01:07.110> color
