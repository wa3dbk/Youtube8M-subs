while you know that never happens
anymore<00:00:51.150> so<00:00:52.150> I<00:00:52.180> had<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.540> switch<00:00:52.750> to<00:00:52.780> mixed<00:00:53.680> grip

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
anymore so I had to switch to mixed grip

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:03.859 
anymore so I had to switch to mixed grip
for<00:00:54.910> 3<00:00:55.180> reps<00:00:55.420> of<00:00:55.600> 3:45<00:00:56.200> this<00:00:56.770> was<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:02.230> first

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
for 3 reps of 3:45 this was the first

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.240 
for 3 reps of 3:45 this was the first
cycle<00:01:04.869> my<00:01:05.770> 1<00:01:05.950> plus<00:01:06.159> set<00:01:06.400> 3<00:01:06.729> reps<00:01:06.939> of<00:01:07.090> 3:45<00:01:08.250> now

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
cycle my 1 plus set 3 reps of 3:45 now

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.020 
cycle my 1 plus set 3 reps of 3:45 now
here's<00:01:10.049> cycle<00:01:11.049> 2<00:01:11.229> week<00:01:11.470> 3<00:01:13.740> at<00:01:14.740> 3:55<00:01:16.200> 10<00:01:17.200> pounds

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
here's cycle 2 week 3 at 3:55 10 pounds

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.830 
here's cycle 2 week 3 at 3:55 10 pounds
heavier<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.500> we<00:01:23.680> see<00:01:23.860> double<00:01:24.310> overhand<00:01:24.610> grip

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
heavier and we see double overhand grip

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.660 
heavier and we see double overhand grip
for<00:01:25.840> 1<00:01:26.020> rep

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.370 

two<00:01:30.670> reps<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.210> started<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.810> give<00:01:31.960> out<00:01:32.079> there

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
two reps it started to give out there

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.889 
two reps it started to give out there
that's<00:01:33.130> why<00:01:33.399> I<00:01:33.430> switched<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.630> mixed

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
that's why I switched to the mixed

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:42.870 
that's why I switched to the mixed
script<00:01:35.170> here<00:01:35.530> for<00:01:36.159> my<00:01:36.369> third<00:01:36.700> rep<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.479> 355<00:01:41.880> so

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
script here for my third rep of 355 so

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.420 
script here for my third rep of 355 so
that<00:01:43.030> was<00:01:43.210> after<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.869> think<00:01:44.799> I'd<00:01:44.890> go<00:01:45.039> for<00:01:45.070> one

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
that was after I think I'd go for one

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.200 
that was after I think I'd go for one
more<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.350> bailed<00:01:47.350> on<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.759> was<00:01:51.880> at<00:01:52.030> the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
more and bailed on it so that was at the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.070 
more and bailed on it so that was at the
end<00:01:52.330> of<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:52.479> second<00:01:52.840> month<00:01:53.700> here's<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.320> final

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
end of the second month here's the final

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.419 
end of the second month here's the final

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
deadlifts one plus set for the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:10.330

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.940 

to<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.720> double<00:02:12.019> overhand<00:02:12.319> grip<00:02:12.440> is<00:02:12.709> still

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
to the double overhand grip is still

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.809 
to the double overhand grip is still
strong<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.340> notice<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:18.610> three

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.179 

I<00:02:21.909> started<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> go<00:02:22.989> for<00:02:23.230> one<00:02:23.349> more<00:02:23.379> and<00:02:23.829> then

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:24.189 
I started to go for one more and then

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.170 
I started to go for one more and then
bailed<00:02:25.150> on<00:02:25.299> it<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:26.489> think<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.760> could<00:02:27.939> have<00:02:28.030> gotten

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
bailed on it I think I could have gotten

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.849 
bailed on it I think I could have gotten
it<00:02:28.329> up<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.719> here's<00:02:29.349> why

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
it up and here's why

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.530 
it up and here's why
immediately<00:02:30.609> after<00:02:30.999> that<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.560> big<00:02:32.769> lift<00:02:33.010> app

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
said my max based on history reps of 365

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.119 
said my max based on history reps of 365
should<00:02:39.280> be<00:02:39.459> 401<00:02:40.209> so<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:40.900> put<00:02:41.170> 400<00:02:41.680> pounds<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.040> the
