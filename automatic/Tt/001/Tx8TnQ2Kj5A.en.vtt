have this cartridge knows that sometimes

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.760 
have this cartridge knows that sometimes
it's<00:02:00.939> really<00:02:01.119> hard<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.630> get<00:02:01.719> the<00:02:01.869> words<00:02:02.109> to<00:02:02.530> cut

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
it's really hard to get the words to cut

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.219 
it's really hard to get the words to cut
well<00:02:03.100> especially<00:02:03.520> if<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:03.909> do<00:02:04.060> them<00:02:04.240> at<00:02:05.200> a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
well especially if you do them at a

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.109 
well especially if you do them at a
smaller<00:02:05.740> size<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.399> I'm<00:02:06.459> going<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.670> try<00:02:06.819> to<00:02:06.850> two

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
smaller size so I'm going to try to two

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.330 
smaller size so I'm going to try to two
inches<00:02:07.569> and<00:02:07.929> we're<00:02:08.799> going<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:08.979> hope<00:02:09.099> for<00:02:09.129> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
inches and we're going to hope for the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.449 
inches and we're going to hope for the
best<00:02:09.519> so<00:02:10.119> while<00:02:10.629> that<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.049> cutting<00:02:11.319> chick<00:02:12.310> is

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
best so while that is cutting chick is
