interesting<00:01:12.759> for<00:01:12.790> me<00:01:13.090> was<00:01:13.299> to<00:01:14.049> read<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.860> the

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
interesting for me was to read that the

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:17.300 
interesting for me was to read that the
program<00:01:15.610> was<00:01:15.760> completely<00:01:16.360> dedicated<00:01:16.570> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
program was completely dedicated to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.820 
program was completely dedicated to
Italian<00:01:18.310> composer's<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:21.100> was<00:01:22.090> only<00:01:22.600> one<00:01:23.350> non

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
Italian composer's and was only one non

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.080 
Italian composer's and was only one non
Italian<00:01:24.520> composer<00:01:24.990> Mendelssohn<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.880> he

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
Italian composer Mendelssohn but the he

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.230 
Italian composer Mendelssohn but the he
performed<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.630> Italian<00:01:29.140> symphony<00:01:29.890> of

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
performed the Italian symphony of

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.600 
performed the Italian symphony of
Medicine<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.510> why<00:01:31.960> I<00:01:32.409> thought<00:01:33.120> Malheur<00:01:35.610> showed

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
Medicine so why I thought Malheur showed

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.340 
Medicine so why I thought Malheur showed
so<00:01:36.940> much<00:01:37.120> interest<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:39.060> composers<00:01:40.060> that<00:01:40.420> some

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
so much interest for composers that some

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.200 
so much interest for composers that some
of<00:01:41.530> them<00:01:41.740> are<00:01:41.950> completely<00:01:42.750> forgotten<00:01:44.100> today

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
of them are completely forgotten today

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.789 
of them are completely forgotten today

for example sinigalia marco enrico basi
busoni<00:01:50.799> we<00:01:51.640> know<00:01:51.820> but<00:01:52.090> we<00:01:52.960> cannot<00:01:53.320> say<00:01:53.530> that<00:01:53.560> is

busoni we know but we cannot say that is
a<00:01:54.090> popular<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.420> I<00:01:55.570> think<00:01:55.900> that<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.830> bring<00:01:57.130> to

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
a popular and I think that to bring to

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.030 
a popular and I think that to bring to
the<00:01:57.820> public<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.600> Chicago<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:02.290> music<00:02:02.770> that
