00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hello,everybody. This is Asahi.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.213
Today,I'm gonna show you how to make a costume of "TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES" which I dressed up for Halloween.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.579
I made a bodysuit and a turtle shell by myself, so please watch this video to the end.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.041
Let's make a bodysuit!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.505
What you need are only 2 green color tights and 2 yellow color tights.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.930
Cut it under 15cm from waist

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.575
Cut it as even intervals in the same way.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.940
A cut gets short as you cut.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.049
It will be done as you can see.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.321
If you cut it narrowly, it gets fine.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.180
And if you cut it widely, it gets bold.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.045
What the point is cut it in small because if you cut it widely, it tears easily.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.383
I wanted designs near the waist, so I cut it when I was wearing the tight.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.640
The tights will get impact because I wore a mustard color under green color tight.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.917
And then, let's make a top.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.840
Cut the inside leg and make a hole for a head.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.030
Cut parts of ankles for arms, it fits me very well like a bodysuit.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.122
Wear a mustard color tight after cut it in the same way.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.222
Next, I wanna make a design for the arms.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.436
Cut the inner thighs in the same way as the first.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.120
You should cut it as you did before.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.149
It will be done just like before.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.485
And then, I wanna knit it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.353
How to knit is very easy.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.818
1,Take the second string is under the first one.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.069
2.The third one is under the next one.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.287
Repeat knitting it.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.497
When you finished doing it, cut it with a scissor and tie it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.860
You can make a design like a NINJA after that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.713
At last,Cut it on the breast like TURTLES.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.187
What the last point is that you cover a red tight on the ankles, the wrists and the arms.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.400
The bodysuit will be done like a "TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES"

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.520
Next, let's make TMNT turtle shell costume!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.660
At first, what you need are a bamboo basket, newspaper and a packing tape.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.320
If you don't have a bamboo basket, don't worry. 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.320
At least you need a newspaper and a packing tape.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.520
Crumple newspapers into a ball as you can see and put it on the bamboo basket.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.160
Then, tape it with a packing tape.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.200
Fix it like a carapace.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.520
If you wanna make a real carapace, make the top part  bigger.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.500
Make it like a half size of avocado. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.546
Wrap it with a packaging tape to cover newspapers.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.179
Add some newspaper if you need more bulge.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.436
Add some newspaper to the inside and cover it in the same way.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I recommend you to use not a paper packing tape, but a cloth packing tape.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.280
And then, put two strings to carry it on my back.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.129
It doesn't necessary to use the same string as me.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.560
The last thing to do is paint.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.940
I use oily markers which color are brown, ocher, green and black.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
First of all, Draw a design of carapace with brown color.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.661
Next, color the edge of the designs in deep with ocher.

00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:26.000
and color the inside of the designs in light and blend them.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.288
You should blend them quickly if you use a oily marker.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.897
I recommend you to blend them soon after you draw the design and repeat it.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.133
Then, Color them with brown in the same way.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.400
It looks like a real carapace because of the texture of the packing tape and newspapers.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
To show color in deep, add black color and green color.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Follow the design with black color to emphasize and add green on the black color.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.975
Back the brown color and repeat drawing.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.749
It looks like TMNT turtle shell eventually.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.649
Even if it's poorly made, it looks real. If you make it with boldness, it will be done like this.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.240
How was this?

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.140
It depends on the color how to use it.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.180
Let's try it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.389
Thank you for watching to the end. See you in next video!
