00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.210 
all right I'm gonna start with the
mistreatment<00:03:11.760> first<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.450> molasses<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:14.040> I'm

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
mistreatment first the molasses and I'm

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:24.170 
mistreatment first the molasses and I'm
going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.579> use<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.790> mix<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.450> here<00:03:23.180> what

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
going to use and mix it in here what

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.130 
going to use and mix it in here what
I'll<00:03:24.299> do<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.689> I'll<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:25.170> use<00:03:25.459> about<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:29.870> think<00:03:30.870> I

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
I'll do is I'll just use about I think I

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.610 
I'll do is I'll just use about I think I
need<00:03:31.319> about<00:03:31.909> because<00:03:32.909> it's<00:03:33.030> quite<00:03:33.239> thick<00:03:33.620> so

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
need about because it's quite thick so

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.069 
need about because it's quite thick so
I'm<00:03:34.680> gonna<00:03:34.859> have<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.299> make<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.480> a<00:03:36.540> bit<00:03:36.720> thinner

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
I'm gonna have to make it a bit thinner

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.410 
I'm gonna have to make it a bit thinner
it's<00:03:37.560> harsh<00:03:37.829> percent<00:03:38.310> molasses<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.239> very

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
it's harsh percent molasses so it's very

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.509 
it's harsh percent molasses so it's very
good<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.930> bed's<00:03:40.260> it's<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.769> very<00:03:40.980> thick

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
good the bed's it's a very thick

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.199 
good the bed's it's a very thick
consistency<00:03:42.359> isn't<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:43.159> very<00:03:44.159> very<00:03:44.700> very<00:03:44.879> very

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
consistency isn't it very very very very

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.770 
consistency isn't it very very very very
thick<00:03:46.370> so<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.670> don't<00:03:48.030> think<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.420> need<00:03:49.049> much

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
thick so I don't think I need much

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:58.429 
thick so I don't think I need much
dilute<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:52.019> bit<00:03:52.170> with<00:03:52.349> water<00:03:54.829> yeah<00:03:57.319> just<00:03:58.319> a

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
dilute it a bit with water yeah just a

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.699 
dilute it a bit with water yeah just a
few<00:03:58.620> drops<00:03:58.829> of<00:03:59.159> water<00:03:59.340> and<00:04:00.230> I'll<00:04:01.230> give<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.500> a

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
few drops of water and I'll give that a

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:02.740 
few drops of water and I'll give that a
stir

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
stir

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.110 
stir
because<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:03.959> very<00:04:04.139> strong<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:05.099> this<00:04:05.310> that

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
because it's very strong like this that

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.420 
because it's very strong like this that
it's<00:04:06.389> just<00:04:06.659> not<00:04:06.840> gonna<00:04:07.049> go<00:04:07.230> down<00:04:07.470> on<00:04:08.010> my<00:04:08.220> hair

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
it's just not gonna go down on my hair

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:16.789 
it's just not gonna go down on my hair
so<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:09.530> really<00:04:10.530> meet<00:04:10.680> them<00:04:11.480> bring<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.629> down<00:04:15.799> so

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
also done it and it is I have added some

and<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.330> did<00:05:22.510> that<00:05:22.720> basically<00:05:23.020> because<00:05:23.170> I<00:05:23.380> love

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
and I did that basically because I love

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.000 
and I did that basically because I love
the<00:05:24.610> way<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:25.450> peppermint<00:05:26.050> makes<00:05:26.320> my<00:05:26.530> scalp

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
the way the peppermint makes my scalp

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.980 
the way the peppermint makes my scalp
feel<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:27.610> think<00:05:28.030> that's<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.270> very<00:05:28.510> good<00:05:28.750> deep

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
feel I think that's a very good deep

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.430 
feel I think that's a very good deep
conditioning<00:05:29.590> relaxing<00:05:30.370> deep<00:05:30.550> conditioning

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
conditioning relaxing deep conditioning

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.280 
conditioning relaxing deep conditioning
treatment<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:32.950> is<00:05:33.070> my<00:05:33.250> own<00:05:33.430> idea<00:05:34.240> of<00:05:34.690> deep

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
treatment so this is my own idea of deep

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.550 
treatment so this is my own idea of deep
conditioning<00:05:35.770> so<00:05:36.520> first<00:05:37.300> I<00:05:37.630> am<00:05:37.660> going<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:38.260> wash

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
conditioning so first I am going to wash

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.600 
conditioning so first I am going to wash
my<00:05:38.770> hair<00:05:38.980> and<00:05:40.410> then<00:05:41.410> well<00:05:41.890> not<00:05:42.130> wash<00:05:42.340> my<00:05:42.460> hair
