not that much at all which stinks cuz

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.680 
not that much at all which stinks cuz
she<00:04:10.709> flies<00:04:10.979> she<00:04:11.760> looks<00:04:11.909> down<00:04:12.150> a<00:04:12.209> little<00:04:12.540> bit

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
she flies she looks down a little bit

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.099 
she flies she looks down a little bit
more<00:04:13.069> for<00:04:14.069> her<00:04:14.220> head<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.579> can<00:04:14.729> kind<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.109> make

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.750 
take you it off the joint a little bit
and<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.209> put<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.599> tiny<00:04:19.500> bit<00:04:19.739> like<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:19.859> she

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
and I put it tiny bit like that she

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.860 
and I put it tiny bit like that she
looks<00:04:20.940> up<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.180> little<00:04:21.359> tiny<00:04:21.690> bit<00:04:21.989> more

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
looks up a little tiny bit more

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.820 
looks up a little tiny bit more
but<00:04:23.650> not<00:04:23.949> much<00:04:24.160> at<00:04:24.550> all<00:04:24.639> her<00:04:25.540> elbow<00:04:25.960> or<00:04:26.290> your

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
but not much at all her elbow or your

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.090 
but not much at all her elbow or your
shoulders<00:04:27.580> move<00:04:28.180> up<00:04:28.510> and<00:04:28.840> down<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.010> out

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
shoulders move up and down in and out

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.140 
shoulders move up and down in and out
like<00:04:30.310> that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
like that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.570 
like that
she's<00:04:31.720> got<00:04:31.930> single<00:04:32.410> drainage<00:04:32.680> elbows<00:04:33.100> like

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
she's got single drainage elbows like

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.520 
she's got single drainage elbows like
that<00:04:33.850> but<00:04:34.570> if<00:04:34.660> you<00:04:34.750> move<00:04:34.870> forgotten<00:04:35.320> light<00:04:35.410> up

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
that but if you move forgotten light up

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.980 
that but if you move forgotten light up
a<00:04:35.620> tiny<00:04:35.830> bit<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.100> get<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> little<00:04:36.970> bit<00:04:37.090> more<00:04:37.270> so

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
a tiny bit you get a little bit more so

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.920 
a tiny bit you get a little bit more so
that's<00:04:38.169> cool<00:04:38.440> but<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.580> thing<00:04:39.790> is<00:04:39.820> if<00:04:40.630> you<00:04:40.810> move

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
that's cool but the thing is if you move

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.540 
that's cool but the thing is if you move
without<00:04:41.199> my<00:04:41.350> back<00:04:41.560> down<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.889> little<00:04:42.040> bit<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.430> get

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
without my back down a little bit to get

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.030 
without my back down a little bit to get
a<00:04:42.610> wrist<00:04:43.030> rotation<00:04:43.320> which<00:04:44.320> goes<00:04:44.530> down<00:04:44.800> like

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
a wrist rotation which goes down like

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.370 
a wrist rotation which goes down like
that<00:04:45.220> and<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.520> moves<00:04:45.699> up<00:04:46.020> not<00:04:47.020> that<00:04:47.169> much

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
that and it moves up not that much

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.140 
that and it moves up not that much
because<00:04:47.710> of<00:04:47.830> this<00:04:47.919> better<00:04:48.160> develop<00:04:48.580> which

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
because of this better develop which

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.670 
because of this better develop which
stinks<00:04:49.750> um<00:04:50.169> then<00:04:50.979> she's<00:04:51.760> got<00:04:51.880> a<00:04:52.680> diaphragm

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
stinks um then she's got a diaphragm

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.390 
stinks um then she's got a diaphragm
joint<00:04:53.949> I<00:04:54.040> guess<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.400> moves<00:04:54.550> side<00:04:55.449> to<00:04:55.479> side

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
joint I guess it moves side to side

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.439 
joint I guess it moves side to side
doesn't<00:04:57.400> really<00:04:57.520> move<00:04:57.729> forward<00:04:57.760> or<00:04:58.150> back<00:04:58.300> at

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
doesn't really move forward or back at

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:01.170 
doesn't really move forward or back at
all<00:04:58.600> which<00:04:59.169> stinks<00:04:59.680> but<00:04:59.889> oh<00:05:00.010> well<00:05:00.250> then<00:05:00.970> she's

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
move up and down like a bat rotation you

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.290 
move up and down like a bat rotation you
can<00:05:10.570> move<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.900> up<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.260> down<00:05:11.320> but<00:05:11.710> it's<00:05:11.830> on<00:05:12.039> a

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
can move it up and down but it's on a
