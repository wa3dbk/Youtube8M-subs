00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.240
 see statistics and that's mostly 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.420

 yes, you already have it with youtube 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.899
 But that's definitely not the reason 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.899

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.560

 do you have your profession do you have something 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.050

 social sciences ok and you and me 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:51.730
 I am self-employed but for example 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.650
 that means you have to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.110
 how much to deliver a week 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.849
 to remain so to speak, in conversation he is 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.819
 Doing a video every week is everyone 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:05.549

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.549
 month or how it works have nothing at all 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.530
 For example, twice a week a video 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.910
 high on solid days that the spectators 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.130
 get used to it 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.410
 and then the topics are not 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:21.030
 At some point you have not done anything 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.030
 everything tells 5 times 1 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.400

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.140
 something new one 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.220
 somehow you get inspired 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.470

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.910
