00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.330 
water so I know last year that the event
was<00:01:41.970> able<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> raise<00:01:43.130> $25,000<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:46.009> I<00:01:47.009> think

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
was able to raise $25,000 and I think

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
was able to raise $25,000 and I think
this<00:01:47.490> year<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.880> goal<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> hundred<00:01:48.659> thousand

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
this year the goal is a hundred thousand

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
this year the goal is a hundred thousand
dollars<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.770> point<00:01:49.829> we've<00:01:50.310> only

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
dollars but to this point we've only

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.960 
dollars but to this point we've only
raised<00:01:50.850> two<00:01:51.090> thousand<00:01:51.509> dollars<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.670> this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
raised two thousand dollars so if this

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
good blend of teammates i think that our

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.360 
good blend of teammates i think that our
teams<00:05:46.050> pretty<00:05:46.289> strong<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:46.889> i<00:05:46.919> think<00:05:47.099> we<00:05:47.220> got<00:05:47.340> a

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
teams pretty strong and i think we got a

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.250 
teams pretty strong and i think we got a
good<00:05:47.430> shot<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.970> win<00:05:48.090> and<00:05:48.389> there's<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.050> lot<00:05:49.229> of

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
good shot to win and there's a lot of

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.490 
good shot to win and there's a lot of
all<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.560> really<00:05:49.800> strong<00:05:50.130> teams<00:05:50.430> out<00:05:50.699> there<00:05:50.729> I

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
all the really strong teams out there I

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.890 
all the really strong teams out there I
think<00:05:52.500> optic<00:05:53.370> diesel<00:05:53.820> or<00:05:54.000> optic<00:05:54.419> hex<00:05:54.659> was<00:05:54.870> a

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
think optic diesel or optic hex was a

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.719 
think optic diesel or optic hex was a
captain<00:05:55.169> another<00:05:55.740> pro<00:05:56.009> player<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.520> he<00:05:56.580> was

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
captain another pro player and he was

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.610 
captain another pro player and he was
able<00:05:56.849> to<00:05:57.030> grab<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.300> lot<00:05:57.630> of<00:05:57.810> professional

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
able to grab a lot of professional

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.110 
able to grab a lot of professional
players<00:05:58.830> for<00:05:59.070> his<00:05:59.159> team<00:05:59.370> so<00:05:59.970> they're<00:06:00.090> probably

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
players for his team so they're probably

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.159 
players for his team so they're probably
the<00:06:00.509> favorite<00:06:01.020> to<00:06:01.320> win<00:06:01.349> in<00:06:01.770> my<00:06:02.370> opinion<00:06:03.169> and

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
the favorite to win in my opinion and

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.029 
the favorite to win in my opinion and
then<00:06:04.620> T<00:06:05.099> Martin's<00:06:05.490> team<00:06:05.669> was<00:06:05.849> able<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.180> get<00:06:06.300> a

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
then T Martin's team was able to get a
