dashboard here you just pick a drill

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.450 
dashboard here you just pick a drill
there<00:01:52.409> they've<00:01:52.619> got<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> bunch<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> girls<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
games in the different screen so i'm

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.670 
games in the different screen so i'm
just<00:01:56.640> doing<00:01:57.060> one<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> basic<00:01:58.350> target

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
just doing one of the basic target

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.700 
just doing one of the basic target
drills<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.570> to<00:02:00.570> start<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.899> drill<00:02:01.079> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
drills here and to start the drill you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.679 
drills here and to start the drill you
can<00:02:01.829> see<00:02:01.979> i'm<00:02:02.100> moving<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.909> ball<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
can see i'm moving the ball and you to

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.889 
can see i'm moving the ball and you to
the<00:02:03.780> puck<00:02:03.960> moving<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.380> screen<00:02:04.880> so<00:02:05.880> Jax<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the puck moving on the screen so Jax it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.139 
the puck moving on the screen so Jax it
pretty<00:02:07.079> well<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.190> low<00:02:08.310> light<00:02:08.520> situation

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
pretty well that's a low light situation

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 
pretty well that's a low light situation
right<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.830> no<00:02:10.830> big<00:02:11.160> windows<00:02:11.459> or<00:02:11.610> anything

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
right there no big windows or anything

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.360 
right there no big windows or anything
so

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
so

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.640 
so
that<00:02:12.909> ball<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.330> moving<00:02:13.750> fairly<00:02:14.170> quickly<00:02:14.290> and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
that ball is moving fairly quickly and

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.690 
that ball is moving fairly quickly and
then<00:02:14.709> start<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.040> drill<00:02:15.220> we<00:02:15.280> put<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.519> ball<00:02:15.670> on

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
then start to drill we put the ball on

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.440 
then start to drill we put the ball on
the<00:02:15.879> start<00:02:16.150> drill<00:02:16.330> button<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:19.180> let's<00:02:19.330> show

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
the start drill button so let's show

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.380 
the start drill button so let's show
this<00:02:19.569> one<00:02:19.720> really<00:02:19.840> quickly<00:02:20.790> in<00:02:21.790> stickhandle

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
this one really quickly in stickhandle

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.759 
this one really quickly in stickhandle
to<00:02:22.780> where<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.989> targets<00:02:23.349> are<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.560> tides

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
to where the targets are the tides

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.630 
to where the targets are the tides
targets<00:02:24.459> explode<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.629> cool<00:02:25.900> noise<00:02:26.640> I'll

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
targets explode like a cool noise I'll

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.309 
targets explode like a cool noise I'll
show<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:27.849> another<00:02:27.970> drill<00:02:28.269> now<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:29.049> just<00:02:29.200> a

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319

show you another drill now it's just a
soft<00:02:29.560> touch<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:30.069> just<00:02:30.220> have<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.340> move<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
soft touch you just have to move the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.910 
soft touch you just have to move the
ball<00:02:31.480> quickly<00:02:32.049> back<00:02:32.379> and<00:02:32.560> forth<00:02:32.709> back<00:02:32.890> and

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
ball quickly back and forth back and

ball quickly back and forth back and
forth<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.459> see<00:02:34.269> how<00:02:34.329> many<00:02:34.480> times<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:34.810> cross

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
forth and see how many times and cross

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.140 
forth and see how many times and cross
line<00:02:35.260> pretty<00:02:35.620> simple<00:02:35.980> but<00:02:36.129> it<00:02:36.760> teaches<00:02:36.909> your

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
line pretty simple but it teaches your

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.130 
line pretty simple but it teaches your
top<00:02:37.390> hand<00:02:37.799> to<00:02:38.799> move<00:02:38.980> quickly<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.790> got<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.959> use

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
top hand to move quickly and got to use

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.280 
top hand to move quickly and got to use
your<00:02:41.170> bottom<00:02:41.620> hand<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.810> get<00:02:43.930> our<00:02:44.019> soft

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
your bottom hand so you get our soft

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.259 
your bottom hand so you get our soft
hands<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:47.040> that's<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.190> pretty<00:02:48.579> simple<00:02:48.819> as<00:02:49.060> well

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
hands and that's a pretty simple as well

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:55.619 
hands and that's a pretty simple as well
but<00:02:49.480> still<00:02:49.959> it's<00:02:50.349> good<00:02:50.470> learn<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.940> up<00:02:54.269> not<00:02:55.269> step

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
but still it's good learn it up not step

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.830 
but still it's good learn it up not step
up<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.829> here's<00:02:57.159> another<00:02:57.489> drill<00:02:57.970> here<00:02:58.150> it's

views of the quick sticks now first
going<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.359> talk<00:03:28.480> about<00:03:28.599> what<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.810> didn't<00:03:29.079> like

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
going to talk about what I didn't like

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.080 
going to talk about what I didn't like
the<00:03:29.200> person<00:03:29.530> won't<00:03:29.709> be<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:29.919> price<00:03:30.129> $200<00:03:30.849> it's

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
the person won't be the price $200 it's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.849 
the person won't be the price $200 it's
a<00:03:31.150> bit<00:03:31.329> expensive<00:03:31.500> that's<00:03:32.500> kind<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.769> a

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
a bit expensive that's kind of a

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.800 
a bit expensive that's kind of a
high-tech<00:03:33.250> toy<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:33.879> guess<00:03:34.120> I'd<00:03:34.389> sort<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
high-tech toy so I guess I'd sort of

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.869 
high-tech toy so I guess I'd sort of
what<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.019> would<00:03:35.109> expect<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.680> pay<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.519> I<00:03:36.549> still

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
what you would expect to pay but I still

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.099 
what you would expect to pay but I still
think<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.180> come<00:03:37.329> down<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.569> price<00:03:37.599> and<00:03:37.780> be<00:03:37.989> kind

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
think it come down in price and be kind

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.080 
think it come down in price and be kind
of<00:03:38.200> nice<00:03:38.319> if<00:03:38.379> it<00:03:38.530> did<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.980> second<00:03:39.730> one<00:03:39.819> would<00:03:40.030> be

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
of nice if it did a second one would be

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.240 
of nice if it did a second one would be
the<00:03:40.780> system<00:03:41.560> that<00:03:41.680> they<00:03:41.709> use<00:03:41.949> they<00:03:42.129> use

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
the system that they use they use

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.490 
the system that they use they use
infrared<00:03:42.639> light<00:03:43.199> unfortunately<00:03:44.199> the<00:03:44.260> Sun

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
infrared light unfortunately the Sun

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.250 
infrared light unfortunately the Sun
also<00:03:44.980> produces<00:03:45.609> infrared<00:03:46.000> light<00:03:46.239> so<00:03:46.780> if<00:03:47.109> you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
also produces infrared light so if you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.140 
also produces infrared light so if you
have<00:03:47.470> any<00:03:47.709> open<00:03:48.069> windows<00:03:48.459> or<00:03:48.790> anything<00:03:48.849> like

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
have any open windows or anything like

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.610 
have any open windows or anything like
that<00:03:49.269> in<00:03:49.629> your<00:03:49.690> house<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.199> will<00:03:50.260> interfere

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
that in your house it will interfere

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.460 
that in your house it will interfere
with<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.129> a<00:03:51.160> bit<00:03:51.629> if<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:53.049> have<00:03:53.199> a<00:03:53.230> lot<00:03:53.440> of

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
with this a bit if you have a lot of

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.559 
with this a bit if you have a lot of
light<00:03:53.709> you<00:03:54.069> basically<00:03:54.639> can't<00:03:55.030> even<00:03:55.239> use<00:03:55.329> this

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
light you basically can't even use this

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.659 
light you basically can't even use this
so<00:03:56.139> if<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.680> want<00:03:56.859> to<00:03:56.889> use<00:03:57.099> the<00:03:57.310> stick<00:03:57.519> healing

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
so if you want to use the stick healing

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.580 
so if you want to use the stick healing
ball<00:03:57.970> in<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> system<00:03:58.629> you<00:03:59.079> have<00:03:59.349> to<00:03:59.440> have<00:03:59.560> a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
ball in the system you have to have a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.830 
ball in the system you have to have a
low<00:03:59.799> light<00:04:00.010> area<00:04:00.400> otherwise<00:04:01.060> it'll<00:04:01.449> be<00:04:01.569> kind

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
low light area otherwise it'll be kind

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.390 
low light area otherwise it'll be kind
of<00:04:01.930> buggy<00:04:02.139> and<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.650> puck<00:04:02.829> on<00:04:02.949> the<00:04:03.069> screen<00:04:03.280> will

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
of buggy and the puck on the screen will

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.339 
of buggy and the puck on the screen will
jump<00:04:03.579> around<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:03.910> bit<00:04:04.060> so<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.540> was<00:04:04.840> a<00:04:04.870> bit<00:04:05.139> of<00:04:05.290> a

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
jump around a bit so that was a bit of a

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.080 
jump around a bit so that was a bit of a
downfall<00:04:05.829> that<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.040> found<00:04:06.370> Gibby<00:04:06.669> nice<00:04:06.910> earth

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
downfall that I found Gibby nice earth

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.449 
downfall that I found Gibby nice earth
they<00:04:07.209> had<00:04:07.329> a<00:04:07.359> better<00:04:07.870> tracking<00:04:08.139> system<00:04:08.650> does

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
they had a better tracking system does

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.129 
they had a better tracking system does
work<00:04:09.489> well<00:04:09.669> though<00:04:10.150> if<00:04:10.389> you<00:04:10.540> have<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.690> low<00:04:10.930> light

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
work well though if you have a low light

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:13.650 
work well though if you have a low light
area<00:04:11.549> third<00:04:12.549> one<00:04:12.819> would<00:04:13.030> be<00:04:13.090> there<00:04:13.389> was<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.540> bit

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
area third one would be there was a bit

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.839 
area third one would be there was a bit
of<00:04:13.720> lag<00:04:13.870> when<00:04:14.109> I<00:04:14.139> used<00:04:14.379> it<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:15.010> wasn't<00:04:15.400> that<00:04:15.459> bad

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
of lag when I used it it wasn't that bad

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.189 
of lag when I used it it wasn't that bad
that<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.150> couldn't<00:04:16.209> use<00:04:16.599> it<00:04:16.630> but<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:16.989> just

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
that I couldn't use it but I just

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.660 
that I couldn't use it but I just
noticed<00:04:17.500> there's<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:17.680> bit<00:04:17.919> of<00:04:18.099> a<00:04:18.220> delay

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
noticed there's a bit of a delay

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.340 
noticed there's a bit of a delay
is<00:04:18.730> a<00:04:18.790> tiny<00:04:18.970> one<00:04:19.270> when<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:19.840> was<00:04:19.990> doing<00:04:20.080> quick

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
is a tiny one when I was doing quick

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.410 
is a tiny one when I was doing quick
movements<00:04:20.830> if<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.250> stick<00:04:21.520> healing<00:04:21.640> slowly<00:04:22.090> I

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
movements if I stick healing slowly I

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.060 
movements if I stick healing slowly I
didn't<00:04:22.870> really<00:04:22.960> notice<00:04:23.170> it<00:04:23.440> if<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.740> did<00:04:23.920> really

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
didn't really notice it if I did really

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.490 
didn't really notice it if I did really
quick<00:04:24.340> moods<00:04:24.580> then<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.910> noticed<00:04:25.060> a<00:04:25.300> bit<00:04:25.510> but<00:04:26.320> it

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
quick moods then I noticed a bit but it

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.050 
quick moods then I noticed a bit but it
still<00:04:26.740> did<00:04:26.980> track<00:04:27.370> where<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:27.790> ball<00:04:27.970> was

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
still did track where the ball was

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.240 
still did track where the ball was
moving<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.870> was<00:04:28.990> just<00:04:29.170> a<00:04:29.590> bit<00:04:29.860> slow<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.070> catch

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
moving it was just a bit slow to catch

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.370 
moving it was just a bit slow to catch
up<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.030> silly<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.510> drill<00:04:31.690> is<00:04:31.840> all<00:04:31.960> right<00:04:32.140> and

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
up so I silly the drill is all right and

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.170 
up so I silly the drill is all right and
I<00:04:32.860> guess<00:04:32.980> if<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.190> have<00:04:33.310> slow<00:04:33.550> hands<00:04:33.790> and<00:04:34.090> it

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
I guess if you have slow hands and it

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
use the system so I thought that was a

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.640 
use the system so I thought that was a
great<00:05:03.520> idea<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.960> other<00:05:05.080> thing<00:05:05.260> that<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:05.440> really

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
great idea the other thing that I really

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.170 
great idea the other thing that I really

to be looking at the screen and
stickhandling<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.600> can't<00:05:10.810> be<00:05:10.870> looking<00:05:11.110> down

to do a recommendation I would recommend

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.470 
to do a recommendation I would recommend
it<00:05:16.120> to<00:05:16.300> kids<00:05:16.960> I<00:05:17.770> think<00:05:18.340> adults<00:05:18.520> might<00:05:18.820> grow<00:05:19.030> old

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
it to kids I think adults might grow old

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.600 
it to kids I think adults might grow old
of<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.870> sort<00:05:20.350> of<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.620> novelty<00:05:21.010> of<00:05:21.040> it<00:05:21.220> after<00:05:21.580> a

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
of the sort of the novelty of it after a

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.370 
of the sort of the novelty of it after a
while<00:05:21.670> but<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.090> think<00:05:22.300> kids<00:05:22.540> will<00:05:22.750> continue<00:05:23.290> to

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
while but I think kids will continue to

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.020 
while but I think kids will continue to
use<00:05:23.560> it<00:05:23.740> over<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.040> over<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.310> over<00:05:24.400> so<00:05:24.940> if
