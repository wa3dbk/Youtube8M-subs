fighting<00:02:34.920> minigame<00:02:35.810> kind<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.930> boring<00:02:37.110> um<00:02:37.560> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
fighting minigame kind of boring um and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.760 
fighting minigame kind of boring um and
a<00:02:38.970> racing<00:02:39.360> mode<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.840> was<00:02:39.930> interesting<00:02:40.740> but

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
a racing mode that was interesting but

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.850 
a racing mode that was interesting but
it<00:02:41.460> was<00:02:41.580> really<00:02:41.910> convoluted<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:43.470> actual

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
it was really convoluted and the actual

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.250 
it was really convoluted and the actual
level<00:02:44.220> design<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.820> was<00:02:44.940> super<00:02:45.390> easy<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.900> if

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
level design it was super easy so if

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.870 
level design it was super easy so if
you've<00:02:46.440> played<00:02:46.680> Classic<00:02:47.220> Monkey<00:02:47.490> Ball<00:02:47.610> games

afterthought but Pokemon X&amp;Y really did

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.850 
afterthought but Pokemon X&amp;Y really did
steal<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.110> show<00:03:16.260> when<00:03:16.380> they<00:03:16.500> came<00:03:16.650> out<00:03:16.710> they

steal the show when they came out they

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.090 
steal the show when they came out they
were<00:03:17.070> amazing<00:03:17.970> releases<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.920> was

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
probably better than Pokemon black and

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.590 
probably better than Pokemon black and

was and yeah the online sucked though
and<00:04:18.660> I'm<00:04:18.840> not<00:04:18.870> even<00:04:19.200> sure<00:04:19.350> if<00:04:19.470> you<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.680> still

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890

and I'm not even sure if you can still
play<00:04:20.070> online<00:04:20.220> or<00:04:20.489> not<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.760> probably<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.419> but

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
play online or not you probably can but

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110
