00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.049 

I<00:00:05.630> always<00:00:06.620> remember<00:00:06.950> when<00:00:07.130> super<00:00:07.640> mario<00:00:07.910> 64

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
I always remember when super mario 64

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.539 
I always remember when super mario 64
came<00:00:08.510> out<00:00:08.660> on<00:00:08.780> the<00:00:08.870> n64<00:00:09.170> and<00:00:09.740> it<00:00:10.160> was<00:00:10.250> the<00:00:10.340> first

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:10.549 
came out on the n64 and it was the first

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.549 
came out on the n64 and it was the first
time<00:00:10.760> I<00:00:11.180> really<00:00:11.690> felt<00:00:11.840> like<00:00:12.020> I<00:00:12.110> was<00:00:12.230> freely

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
time I really felt like I was freely

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.950 
time I really felt like I was freely
exploring<00:00:13.129> a<00:00:13.219> 3d<00:00:13.700> space<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:14.240> I<00:00:14.809> wasn't

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
exploring a 3d space and I wasn't

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.420 
exploring a 3d space and I wasn't
thinking<00:00:15.290> about<00:00:15.349> the<00:00:15.530> technology<00:00:16.040> the<00:00:16.070> three

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
thinking about the technology the three

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.950 
thinking about the technology the three
deenis<00:00:16.759> of<00:00:16.910> it<00:00:17.029> but<00:00:17.180> mostly<00:00:17.420> about<00:00:17.660> the<00:00:17.779> fact

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
deenis of it but mostly about the fact

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960 
deenis of it but mostly about the fact
that<00:00:18.020> it<00:00:18.170> felt<00:00:18.349> like<00:00:18.470> a<00:00:18.529> real<00:00:18.740> place<00:00:18.980> which<00:00:19.820> was

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
that it felt like a real place which was

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.760 
that it felt like a real place which was
always<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.270> dream<00:00:20.509> to<00:00:20.750> go<00:00:20.869> into<00:00:21.290> an<00:00:21.560> imaginary

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
always the dream to go into an imaginary

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.450 
always the dream to go into an imaginary
virtual<00:00:22.430> place<00:00:22.610> inside<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.480> machine<00:00:23.779> I<00:00:24.460> think

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
virtual place inside the machine I think

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.100 
virtual place inside the machine I think
in<00:00:25.579> some<00:00:25.700> ways<00:00:25.849> it's<00:00:26.000> fun<00:00:26.180> for<00:00:26.480> someone<00:00:26.869> who's

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
in some ways it's fun for someone who's

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.290 
in some ways it's fun for someone who's
like<00:00:27.410> a<00:00:27.500> young<00:00:27.770> child<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:28.399> like<00:00:28.550> do<00:00:29.059> something

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
like a young child to like do something

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.889 
like a young child to like do something
really<00:00:29.390> powerful<00:00:29.599> on<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.020> screen<00:00:31.509> and<00:00:32.509> I

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
really powerful on the screen and I

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:33.790 
really powerful on the screen and I
think<00:00:33.050> that's<00:00:33.170> one<00:00:33.290> of<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.440> strongest

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
think that's one of the strongest

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.319 
think that's one of the strongest
feelings<00:00:34.309> you<00:00:34.550> get<00:00:34.850> when<00:00:34.910> you're<00:00:35.149> playing

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
feelings you get when you're playing

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.819 
feelings you get when you're playing
video<00:00:35.600> games<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:36.020> that<00:00:36.050> feeling<00:00:36.559> of

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
video games is that feeling of

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:38.620 
video games is that feeling of
I<00:00:36.860> missed<00:00:37.460> that<00:00:37.550> world<00:00:38.060> that<00:00:38.210> I<00:00:38.270> want<00:00:38.450> to<00:00:38.540> go

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
I missed that world that I want to go

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.760 
I missed that world that I want to go
back<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.930> it<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:39.230> that's<00:00:39.410> what<00:00:39.470> you<00:00:39.590> try<00:00:39.740> to

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
back to it and that's what you try to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.110 
back to it and that's what you try to
achieve<00:00:39.890> with<00:00:40.190> every<00:00:40.370> game<00:00:40.490> you<00:00:40.610> make<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:40.970> to

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
achieve with every game you make is to

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.580 
achieve with every game you make is to
create<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.390> world<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:41.780> real<00:00:41.990> that<00:00:42.170> people<00:00:42.200> miss

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
create a world so real that people miss

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.290 
create a world so real that people miss
it<00:00:42.740> when<00:00:42.800> they're<00:00:42.920> not<00:00:43.040> playing<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.340> game<00:00:43.490> for

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
it when they're not playing the game for

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.270 
it when they're not playing the game for

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
sure that world made a lot of sense

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.899 
sure that world made a lot of sense
without<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.370> doubt<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.780> single<00:01:24.260> largest

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
without a doubt the the single largest

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
video games is the presence of network

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.160 
video games is the presence of network
connectivity<00:01:33.610> as<00:01:34.610> soon<00:01:35.030> as<00:01:35.270> games<00:01:35.840> will<00:01:36.080> be

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
connectivity as soon as games will be

connectivity as soon as games will be
able<00:01:36.320> to<00:01:36.440> network<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.070> then

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
able to network and then

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.730 
able to network and then
the<00:01:38.740> Internet<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:40.030> created<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:41.110> ability<00:01:41.530> to

the Internet it created this ability to

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.640 
the Internet it created this ability to
create<00:01:42.580> imaginary<00:01:43.390> worlds<00:01:44.229> with<00:01:44.950> real<00:01:45.369> people

create imaginary worlds with real people

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.350 
create imaginary worlds with real people
this<00:01:47.650> is<00:01:47.860> not<00:01:47.890> about<00:01:48.220> something<00:01:49.119> that<00:01:49.240> could

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
this is not about something that could

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.960 
this is not about something that could
change<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.750> history<00:01:50.110> of<00:01:50.200> video<00:01:50.409> games<00:01:50.970> this

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
change the history of video games this

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.440 
change the history of video games this
is<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.659> biggest<00:01:52.900> change<00:01:53.470> in<00:01:54.000> humanity<00:01:55.000> that

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
is the biggest change in humanity that

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.080 
is the biggest change in humanity that
we've<00:01:55.659> probably<00:01:55.900> had<00:01:56.700> since<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.820> development

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
we've probably had since the development

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:05.580 
we've probably had since the development
of<00:01:58.360> fire<00:02:02.399> no<00:02:03.399> time<00:02:03.880> ever<00:02:04.330> in<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.080> history<00:02:05.290> of
