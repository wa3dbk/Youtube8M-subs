00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.880 
just about having tomatoes in this sort
of<00:00:23.970> format<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.750> actually<00:00:25.050> about<00:00:25.170> creating<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
of format it's actually about creating a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.580

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
so while it's still simple it's not

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.049 
so while it's still simple it's not
quite<00:00:31.350> a<00:00:31.380> spaghetti<00:00:31.920> sauce<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.579> simple

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
quite a spaghetti sauce it's simple

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.819 
quite a spaghetti sauce it's simple
there's<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.870> little<00:00:34.140> bit<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.350> herbs<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.739> there

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829

there's a little bit of herbs and there
is<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> trick<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> highlighting<00:00:36.329> those

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
is a trick to kind of highlighting those

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.819 
is a trick to kind of highlighting those
Tomatoes<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.409> what<00:00:37.530> we're<00:00:37.679> going<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
Tomatoes and that's what we're going to

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.069 
Tomatoes and that's what we're going to
do<00:00:38.010> we're<00:00:38.339> going<00:00:38.429> to<00:00:38.519> start<00:00:38.760> by<00:00:38.909> mincing<00:00:39.629> our

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
do we're going to start by mincing our

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:51.639 
do we're going to start by mincing our
onion<00:00:43.879> all<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.920> peel<00:00:47.449> let's<00:00:48.449> go<00:00:48.569> ahead<00:00:49.819> now

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
onion all the peel let's go ahead now

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
onion all the peel let's go ahead now
we're<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.059> chop<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.239> our<00:00:54.359> celery<00:00:54.629> now<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
we're going to chop up our celery now I

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.809 
we're going to chop up our celery now I
mentioned<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.479> tomato<00:00:57.479> sauce<00:00:57.659> is<00:00:57.780> all<00:00:57.989> about

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
mentioned that tomato sauce is all about

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:02.029 
mentioned that tomato sauce is all about
highlighting<00:00:59.819> the<00:00:59.969> tomatoes<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.229> so<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.829> key

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
highlighting the tomatoes and so the key

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.649 
highlighting the tomatoes and so the key
here<00:01:02.069> the<00:01:02.699> reason<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.030> some<00:01:03.329> people<00:01:03.359> use

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
here the reason that some people use

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.710 
here the reason that some people use
carrot<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.140> use<00:01:04.379> celery<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:04.979> celery<00:01:05.720> adds

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
carrot I use celery because celery adds

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.440 
carrot I use celery because celery adds
a<00:01:07.049> salt<00:01:07.380> component<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> sauce<00:01:08.460> but

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
a salt component to the sauce but

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.130 
a salt component to the sauce but
carrots<00:01:10.050> add<00:01:10.200> salt<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.710> sugar<00:01:10.980> so<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.570> you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
carrots add salt and sugar so I just you

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
carrots add salt and sugar so I just you
can<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.590> carrots<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:14.190> that<00:01:14.580> would<00:01:14.700> be

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
can do it with carrots but that would be

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.700 
can do it with carrots but that would be
wrong<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.480> don't<00:01:15.630> want<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.960> right<00:01:16.290> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
wrong and we don't want that right so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.500 
wrong and we don't want that right so
we're<00:01:17.220> going<00:01:17.370> to<00:01:17.490> mince<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.970> up<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.420> as

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
we're going to mince this up here as

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.200 
we're going to mince this up here as
nicely<00:01:18.900> as<00:01:19.140> we<00:01:19.290> possibly<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.160> then<00:01:20.790> I'll

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
nicely as we possibly can and then I'll

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
nicely as we possibly can and then I'll
put<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:21.630> onion<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> celery<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:22.980> going

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.720 
bring out the moisture and kind of cook
them<00:02:00.090> down<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.570> should<00:02:00.750> take<00:02:00.930> about<00:02:01.550> 10<00:02:02.550> to

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
them down this should take about 10 to

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.520 
them down this should take about 10 to
15<00:02:03.150> minutes<00:02:03.480> if<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.780> do<00:02:03.870> it<00:02:03.960> properly

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
15 minutes if you do it properly

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.100 
15 minutes if you do it properly
like<00:02:05.370> I<00:02:05.460> said<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:06.300> low<00:02:06.480> he<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:07.020> you

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
like I said really low he is what you

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.380 
like I said really low he is what you
want<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:08.340> are<00:02:08.550> cooking<00:02:08.729> down<00:02:08.909> nicely

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
want here these are cooking down nicely

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.380 
want here these are cooking down nicely
so<00:02:09.690> as<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.500> might<00:02:10.739> expect<00:02:10.979> with<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.209> term

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
so as one might expect with the term

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.390 
so as one might expect with the term
sweating<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:12.989> you<00:02:13.740> just<00:02:13.920> point<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
sweating is you just point all the

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.680 
sweating is you just point all the
moisture<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:14.819> so<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.210> can<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.630> they

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
moisture out so you can see that they

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.430 
moisture out so you can see that they
become<00:02:16.050> really<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.100> wet<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.610> look

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
become really really wet they look

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.290 
become really really wet they look
and<00:02:18.740> so<00:02:18.890> we're<00:02:19.040> just<00:02:19.070> going<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> keep<00:02:19.520> cooking

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
and so we're just going to keep cooking

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.760 
and so we're just going to keep cooking
this<00:02:20.420> down<00:02:20.630> cutting<00:02:20.960> this<00:02:21.020> down<00:02:21.230> this<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:21.650> just

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
this down cutting this down this is just

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.890 
this down cutting this down this is just

actually what roma tomatoes are based on

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.950 
actually what roma tomatoes are based on
but<00:04:42.830> some<00:04:43.640> Marzano<00:04:44.000> tomatoes<00:04:44.420> they're<00:04:44.660> like

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
but some Marzano tomatoes they're like

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.140 
but some Marzano tomatoes they're like
they<00:04:45.110> have<00:04:45.260> a<00:04:45.290> thicker<00:04:45.620> flesh<00:04:46.430> they<00:04:46.730> have<00:04:46.910> less

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.730 
they have a thicker flesh they have less
seeds<00:04:47.450> and<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.720> have<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> more<00:04:48.200> intense<00:04:48.530> flavor

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
seeds and I have a more intense flavor

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.770 
seeds and I have a more intense flavor
