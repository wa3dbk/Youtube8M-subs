conventional<00:00:15.750> medicine<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.289> great<00:00:16.560> but<00:00:16.980> it

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
conventional medicine is great but it

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.410 
conventional medicine is great but it
doesn't<00:00:17.460> change<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.820> fact<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
doesn't change the fact that on a

so<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> question<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:35.760> did<00:00:36.300> mammals<00:00:36.660> simply

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so a question was did mammals simply

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.630 
so a question was did mammals simply
lose<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> capability<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.309> extreme

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
lose the capability for extreme
regeneration<00:00:39.239> or<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.559> dormant

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
regeneration or was it just a dormant

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
regeneration or was it just a dormant
somewhere<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.520> our<00:00:41.670> genetics<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:42.809> hope

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
somewhere in our genetics there's hope
