that's a high perspective back up camera

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.920 
that's a high perspective back up camera
when<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.270> put<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> system<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.260> reverse<00:02:17.930> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
when you put the system in a reverse it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.830 
when you put the system in a reverse it
changes<00:02:19.470> over<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.670> low<00:02:20.970> perspective<00:02:21.600> camera

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
changes over to a low perspective camera

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.020 
changes over to a low perspective camera
so<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.770> see<00:02:23.100> right<00:02:23.130> behind<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:26.030> your

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
so you can see right behind you and your

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.550 
so you can see right behind you and your
regular<00:02:27.480> perspective<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.230> can<00:02:28.350> see<00:02:28.530> right

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
regular perspective you can see right

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.650 
regular perspective you can see right
out<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.100> back<00:02:29.280> because<00:02:29.550> this<00:02:29.730> kit<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.390> car

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
out the back because this kit this car

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.620 
out the back because this kit this car
has<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:31.200> rear<00:02:31.890> spare<00:02:32.190> tire<00:02:32.490> when<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.450> look

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
has a rear spare tire when you look

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.240 
has a rear spare tire when you look
through<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> normal<00:02:34.140> mirror<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.740> difficult

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
through the normal mirror it's difficult

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.040 
through the normal mirror it's difficult
to<00:02:35.550> see<00:02:35.820> out<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.360> map<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:36.990> a

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to see out of the map so we have a

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.500 
to see out of the map so we have a
camera<00:02:37.700> simulating<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.850> rearview<00:02:39.090> mirror

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
camera simulating what a rearview mirror

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.890 
camera simulating what a rearview mirror
would<00:02:39.660> show<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:42.240> can<00:02:42.360> look<00:02:42.450> at<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> back

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
would show you you can look at the back

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.740 
would show you you can look at the back
now<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.740> the<00:02:44.130> custom<00:02:44.640> cover<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.570> covers

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
now we have the custom cover that covers

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.900 
now we have the custom cover that covers
up<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.170> amplifier<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.070> subwoofer<00:02:47.670> so

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
up the amplifier in the subwoofer so

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.560 
up the amplifier in the subwoofer so
it's<00:02:48.060> completely<00:02:48.300> hidden<00:02:48.900> from<00:02:49.019> view<00:02:50.450> some<00:02:51.450> of

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
it's completely hidden from view some of

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.270 
it's completely hidden from view some of
the<00:02:51.660> other<00:02:51.840> features<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.440> we've<00:02:52.830> done<00:02:53.070> on

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
the other features that we've done on
