we take an f-sharp major bar chord and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.580 
we take an f-sharp major bar chord and
then<00:01:03.940> let's<00:01:04.390> just<00:01:04.449> let<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.869> first<00:01:05.409> two

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
then let's just let the first two

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.469 
then let's just let the first two
strings<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.130> E<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.399> B<00:01:06.579> string<00:01:06.880> ring<00:01:07.270> out

to be careful you want to if you're

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.840 
to be careful you want to if you're
going<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> use<00:02:02.289> distortion<00:02:03.070> like<00:02:03.310> i'm<00:02:03.460> using

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
going to use distortion like i'm using

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.779 
going to use distortion like i'm using
um<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:05.229> should<00:02:05.320> just<00:02:05.560> have<00:02:05.740> some<00:02:06.160> that<00:02:06.550> will

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
um you should just have some that will

below so now I have a nice full sounding
chord<00:02:46.640> and<00:02:47.640> then<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> can<00:02:48.239> adjust<00:02:48.330> certain

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
chord and then you can adjust certain

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.960 
chord and then you can adjust certain
notes<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.530> will<00:02:49.650> completely<00:02:50.280> change<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
notes that will completely change the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.330 
notes that will completely change the

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
landscape of the sound I'm going to take

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.650 
landscape of the sound I'm going to take
this<00:02:53.519> active<00:02:53.879> right<00:02:53.970> here<00:02:54.180> and<00:02:54.299> lower<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.599> a

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
this active right here and lower it a

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.820 
this active right here and lower it a
half<00:02:54.780> step<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> vamp<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.739> at

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
half step you can do a vamp just at

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:08.270 
half step you can do a vamp just at
those<00:02:58.980> two<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.290> complete<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.890> bar<00:03:08.069> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
those two you can complete the bar and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.920 
those two you can complete the bar and
add<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.549> f-sharp<00:03:08.670> on<00:03:09.120> top<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.599> now<00:03:09.660> i<00:03:09.690> have<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
add the f-sharp on top so now i have a

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:19.400 
add the f-sharp on top so now i have a
ninth<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.349> top<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.930> here's<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.170> little
