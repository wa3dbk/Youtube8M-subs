00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.080
I'm Lindsey from SmartPak, and today we'll
be going over how to assemble our Harwich

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:15.770
Padded Fancy Stitch Bridle.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.620
When you receive your bridle, it's going to
be in a few different pieces in order for

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.620
you to put it together.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.180
First, it will be easiest if you take your
crown piece.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.050
And, in order to tell which way it sits on
your horse's head, you will go ahead and have

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.590
your throat latch be at the back portion so
it will be able to come through underneath

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.020
and buckle on the other side.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.450
And you will go ahead and take your brow band,
and you're going to feed it through the side

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.760
of the crown piece, then taking your throat
latch through the other side of your brow

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.760
band.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.580
It's a snug fit, but it does go through with
the keepers.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.851
In order to check your work after you put
your brow band on your crown piece, you're

00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:02.079
going to want to make sure your brow band
is facing forward, and your throat latch is

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.420
facing back towards your horse's shoulder.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.760
And with this bridle, your next component
will be your nose band, also know as a caveson.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.710
Specifically with the Harwich, the nose band
is going to feed over the top of your crown

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.120
piece to alleviate any pressure across your
horse's pole.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.300
So this will allow more of an ergonomic fit
for your horse.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.409
You'll go through the other side and pull
through.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:44.000
You'll also want to take the other side of
the nose band and attach it together.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.210
You do not need to put it through the keepers
at this time, as you will need to adjust for

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.439
your horse's individual fit.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.780
And with the Plymouth bridle, it has more
of a traditional crown piece where your nose

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:10.690
band will feed underneath and through your
brow band and lay flush underneath the crown.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:23.139
You still will go ahead and attach it the
same way through the buckle on this side.

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:27.870
When taking your cheek pieces to put on your
bridle, I always start on the right side.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.279
This way, you know which piece goes with which.

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:37.620
I always take the cheek piece and put it in
the middle of the holes, so that I have the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.550
choice for adjustability.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:49.469
When going to the left side of the bridle,
you have your throat latch, and then the component

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:50.930
for your cheek piece.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.450
The cheek piece will be the thicker portion
of leather.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.120
And then I always make sure to do it in the
same hole as the other side.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.540
Now as we continue to put together our bridle,
the next piece will be our bit.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.489
Each bit will be different for every horse's
need.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.540
This one is a D-ring snaffle.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.980
A common mistake when putting a bit on a bridle
is to put it on backwards.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.879
Luckily, it is easy to tell which way the
bit faces.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.489
When checking your bit, the bend should be
facing outward.

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.829
You can double check your bit by folding it
together.

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.329
And if it lays flush, its correctly facing.

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.680
Otherwise, it will bend the wrong way and
not come together.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.209
Once you've checked your bit and are ready
to add it to your bridle, you'll take your

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:57.579
cheek piece and make sure that your bridle
is not twisted and put it right on the D-ring

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:04.239
so that the stitching is facing outward.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:16.900
You then feed the bottom of the cheek piece
through its keepers and through the hook.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:27.130
Also, you want to make sure that your bit
is not twisted and does maintain the same

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.910
bend.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.200
You're just going to do the same thing on
this side that you did on the other.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:49.160
And next, you'll take your reins and attach
them to your bit.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.190
You also want to make sure that your stitching
will be facing outward matching the rest of

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.300
your bridle.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:09.820
You go ahead and feed it through your keepers
and then through your hook closure.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.230
You also want to make sure that your reins
are not twisted before you attach your second

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:21.390
side.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.050
And now you're ready to try your bridle on
your horse.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.400
I hope this was helpful today.
