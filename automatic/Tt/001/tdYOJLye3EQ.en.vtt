that<00:00:21.990> you'll<00:00:22.140> hear<00:00:22.289> from<00:00:22.320> today<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> new

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
that you'll hear from today a new

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
that you'll hear from today a new
generation<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.850> gaming<00:00:24.300> experiences<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
generation of gaming experiences and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.599 
generation of gaming experiences and
it's<00:00:26.070> our<00:00:26.220> plan<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.880> create<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.570> unified<00:00:28.609> Radeon

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it's our plan to create a unified Radeon

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.110 
it's our plan to create a unified Radeon
gaming<00:00:30.420> experience<00:00:31.160> across<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.279> platforms

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
gaming experience across all platforms

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.100 
gaming experience across all platforms
and<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.380> we're<00:00:34.500> able<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.370> create

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
and so what we're able to do is create

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.750 
and so what we're able to do is create
cross-platform<00:00:37.110> development<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.550> easy

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
cross-platform development that is easy

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.440 
cross-platform development that is easy
reporting<00:00:39.540> from<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.930> platform<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.100> another

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
reporting from one platform to another

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.139 
reporting from one platform to another
4k<00:00:42.450> displays<00:00:43.079> versus<00:00:43.469> 1080p<00:00:44.070> four<00:00:44.489> times<00:00:44.969> more

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
4k displays versus 1080p four times more

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.740 
4k displays versus 1080p four times more
pixels<00:00:46.550> more<00:00:47.550> pixels<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.719> more<00:00:48.899> ground

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
pixels more pixels you need more ground

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
pixels more pixels you need more ground
so<00:00:51.750> looking<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> pc<00:00:52.620> gaming<00:00:52.890> hardware

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
so looking at the pc gaming hardware

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.000 
so looking at the pc gaming hardware
market<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.820> healthy<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.420> growing<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.110> so

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
market it's healthy and growing and so

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
market it's healthy and growing and so
