00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
down where I can get to it without

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.740 
down where I can get to it without
putting<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.800> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.010> ground<00:01:17.330> because<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.510> want

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
putting it on the ground because I want

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.800 

okay<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:49.470> log<00:03:50.159> lay<00:03:50.400> down<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.480> stump

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
okay so the log lay down on this stump

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.630 
okay so the log lay down on this stump
here<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:54.030> now<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.180> can<00:03:54.450> get<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:54.780> everything

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
here and so now I can get to everything

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.320 
here and so now I can get to everything
this<00:03:56.640> tree<00:03:57.180> just<00:03:57.540> barely<00:03:57.810> missed<00:03:58.140> this<00:03:58.349> gazebo

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
this tree just barely missed this gazebo

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.259 
this tree just barely missed this gazebo
it<00:04:00.330> kind<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:01.640> pushed<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.760> out<00:04:02.849> a<00:04:02.910> plum<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.440> I

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
it kind of pushed it out a plum and I

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.309 
it kind of pushed it out a plum and I
used<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.330> come<00:04:06.540> along<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.900> get<00:04:07.019> it<00:04:07.140> squared

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
used to come along to get it squared

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.460 
used to come along to get it squared
back<00:04:07.620> up<00:04:07.860> but<00:04:08.129> I<00:04:08.599> mean<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.840> missed<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.140> by<00:04:10.260> inches

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
back up but I mean I missed it by inches

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.080 
back up but I mean I missed it by inches
and<00:04:12.920> so<00:04:13.920> now<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.129> can<00:04:14.310> see<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.670> I<00:04:14.730> got<00:04:14.879> it<00:04:15.000> at

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
and so now you can see that I got it at

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.990 
and so now you can see that I got it at
a<00:04:15.120> good<00:04:15.299> working<00:04:15.690> height<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.789> I'll<00:04:17.789> have<00:04:17.910> to

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
a good working height so I'll have to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.430 
a good working height so I'll have to
reach<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.150> over<00:04:18.419> my<00:04:18.539> head<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:19.049> dip<00:04:19.260> these

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
reach up over my head like I dip these

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.099 
reach up over my head like I dip these
other<00:04:19.650> limbs<00:04:19.919> so<00:04:20.519> it's<00:04:21.419> kind<00:04:21.600> of<00:04:21.630> dodging

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
other limbs so it's kind of dodging

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.430 
other limbs so it's kind of dodging
bombs<00:04:22.800> as<00:04:23.280> I<00:04:23.400> was<00:04:23.580> cutting<00:04:23.789> these<00:04:24.139> blocks<00:04:25.139> off

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
bombs as I was cutting these blocks off

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.110 
bombs as I was cutting these blocks off
but<00:04:26.039> uh<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.990> now<00:04:28.110> I'm<00:04:28.199> just<00:04:28.350> gonna<00:04:29.030> start<00:04:30.030> it

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
but uh so now I'm just gonna start it

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.529 
but uh so now I'm just gonna start it
start<00:04:30.780> at<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.020> back<00:04:31.440> end<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.360> work<00:04:33.360> my<00:04:33.510> way

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
start at this back end and work my way

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.029 
start at this back end and work my way

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
ground now so I'll get the log splitter

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.959 
ground now so I'll get the log splitter
out<00:06:29.389> and<00:06:31.060> make<00:06:32.060> make<00:06:32.990> kindling<00:06:33.409> out<00:06:33.530> of<00:06:33.680> this

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:33.969
