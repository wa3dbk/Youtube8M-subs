00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.090
 there it is 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 imagine the gypsies the fighter 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 from mma eight years ago then 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.820
 being able to play the fc personal trainer was 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.039
 well cool it's like a training - it goes 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 learn the scams he is going through 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.449
 the name of the blows and how it is done 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.699
 really are a single blow that real not 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.760
 is that we really train people 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.760
 enough 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.840
 if you know how to make the punches already 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.760
 help understood that the games that 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.440
 He's a bad catcher but they're not easy. 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:51.510
 I know what I can do better 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 I can not do one anyway 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.410
 I miss the hand he captures that was love 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 wrong I have to do is asking 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.789
 a direct has to make a direct 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 common behind the right hand in case 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.170
 My love to someone who's with 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 is beginning to middle and not 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.070
 in the martial arts and even well 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.390
 interesting to see interesting goes 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 learn a lot as I said go 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 learn the blows and get tired understand 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.479
 playing in or is important even for 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.570
 Our children and everything else is not alone. 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 Static sitting there playing part 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.150
 a little more than the action that is 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.100
 happening in the video game I think it's cool 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.840
 It's a spirit, I think you na na 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.360
 The graph question ends up 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.460
 get a thousand to get into that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.650
 atmosphere of struggle even the people 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.299
 screaming you focused on your opponent 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.900
 understood trying to make your 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.640
 better still in pursuit of victory 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.770
 characters come very close to the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.470
 reality of how athletes actually 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.320
 and in my time I'm a little 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.970
 best hurting the punches there then until 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.729
 I tried a free fall but one thing 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.770
 is that in the video game it happens a lot 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.469
 I usually do not in my fights is 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.229
 normally I know athletes right of aac 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.060
 its a little of the weaknesses and 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.710
 their strengths and be able to use 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.329
 This a bit of that, right? 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.220
 cain velasquez now in the case of the canillas 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.370
 I know the grabbing fight he likes 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.159
 understood I have to look for a avoid 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.849
 with him in the video game, maybe I 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:21.510
 can do better than in real life 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.220
 my techniques of fighting the sport in 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.830
 Truth, I think it did not help me much. 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.620
 here not because actually the more 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.110
 if you know the commands you can 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.980
 use the game ends up giving a 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.980
 very big advantage
