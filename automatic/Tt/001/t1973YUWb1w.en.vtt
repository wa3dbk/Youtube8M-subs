00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.540
 hello cinema maniacs how are we going 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.129
 tell you about the movie of the week ' 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.510
 that maybe it's also the movie of 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.630
 month maybe the summer movie 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.430
 even the movie of the year the gentleman 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.380
 dark the legend reborn is the return 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.240
 from christopher nolan to his character that 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.520
 she did in batman begins and the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.350
 dark knight and we were all the 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.390
 really very aware of this premiere 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.130
 as the savior not so much from the box office 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.649
 but as the savior even of the cinema 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.660
 of quality hollywood mix with 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.010
 the most box office hollywood I have to 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.930
 say that maybe we had created the 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.300
 monster with the previous movie of 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.100
 batman by christopher nolan even with 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.420
 origin that for me is a movie that 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.409
 Well, it 's very good but it's not 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.109
 resists too many previous glances in 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:53.469
 this case I think Batman shows his 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.350
 more real face I think we had 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.479
 disproportionate in the eulogy with the previous 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.969
 movie that was a great movie but 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:02.949
 which in this case gives the real measure of what 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.299
 that may be do not forget that this is 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.100
 a superhero movie that this is 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.659
 a movie based on a comic that 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.490
 can bring what this can bring us 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.610
 it's not between new the godfather is not the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.370
 new be the godfather 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.680
 they have many values ​​and one of them that 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.490
 also in which there is also your error 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.870
 maybe its virtue and its inconvenience is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.180
 the excess is a very movie 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.660
 disproportionate from his music to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.060
 action scenes to the whole question 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.740
 in philosophical commas that derives from 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.300
 confrontation between good and evil the 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.130
 morality and all those issues that 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.650
 they were already under the previous delivery 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.720
 christian bale is again well in his 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.660
 thinner paper every time and marion 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.910
 Cotillard already in Jagüey give so good 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.520
 level what happens is that the gentleman 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.960
 dark I had a had a villain that was 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.270
 the joker that I think was unmatched 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.070
 that villain I think I gave him a 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.080
 letter of special nature to the 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.320
 movie that in this case having a 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.390
 villain quite powerful as you see them not 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.200
 is at the same height and 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.820
 expectations that may not be the 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.649
 do not fulfill as much as we expected 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.880
 after seeing the dark knight without 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.860
 However, I think that you should not have 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.450
 so high expectations and that this 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 movie is a great movie of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.019
 entertainment a very good movie 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.970
 to have a great time 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.270
 trepidante in which you pass the two 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.680
 hours 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.120
 I brought him 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.760
 I've always told myself that what a 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.760
 car with a stranger when a car
