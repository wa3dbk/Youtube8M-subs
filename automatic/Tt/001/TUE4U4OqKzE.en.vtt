00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hi guys, how are you? Everything? 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.089
 today is to show the books that I 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.480
 I chose to participate in the marathon 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.070
 carnival and before I go 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.750
 tell a story just to explain 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.910
 Why am I going to participate and why? 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.830
 I choose books, I'll 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.670
 talk about whether or not to do a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.710
 24 hour marathon and I and we escaped 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.800
 It's because it's not very good. 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.180
 with readings with deadlines in and commented 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 with us because I'm already 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 participating in other challenges and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.850
 reading projects for this year 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.219
 I got too overcharged here in 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.940
 participate in a literary marathon 24 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.129
 hours 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 two days later the mark with the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.140
 people on the blog post of the fertilizer that 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.390
 addict on facebook where the band 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 her idea explains why she 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.950
 will do a marathon 24 hours because 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.140
 she wants to go through this experience and 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.320
 I started getting very tempted because 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.879
 I've never done a reading marathon. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.149
 be it from one day I already participated in 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.520
 literary marathons that encompassed a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.769
 time, for example a week and up to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.470
 It was nice experience although not 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.689
 achieved and none of the times 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.909
 all the reading goals I proposed 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.790
 but I began to be tempted to do 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.580
 experience and I decided to participate 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.490
 literary marathon 24 hours on the 15th 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.040
 So it starts at midnight, I'm leaving. 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.720
 the bukit help blog link here 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.869
 underneath and also the facebook page 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.750
 where you can find this post that 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.759
 she told of her willingness to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.770
 participate in the marathon and invite 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.119
 all of us to attend too 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.040
 well then as I am with these 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.229
 other reading projects in progress 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.750
 and decided to reconcile readings of those 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.360
 projects or some of these projects 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.820
 like the 24-hour literary marathon 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.470
 I chose four books of course that I 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.649
 I will not be able to complete the four 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.689
 books for 24 hours because I 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.509
 I need sleep, I can not stay one day. 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.509
 Whole agreed agreed guess since 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.840
 My 18 or 19 year olds have been through a lot. 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.000
 this phase of tepic then my idea 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 is to get a good number of pages of 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.119
 each one of them 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.819
 books within this marathon period 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.650
 and then I quote that the project does 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.450
 part of each and I leave the links 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.120
 here below and I will also leave the link 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.040
 the other projects or challenges that I 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.440
 I am participating but I do not include 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.660
 a read here just so you know and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.129
 suddenly if you like 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.349
 participate too so let's go there 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.620
 My first choice then is the 50 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.780
 shades of gray and it's james the movie already 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.819
 It's debuting. I've changed some rules. 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.480
 of challenge books on your expression sign 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.160
 this year 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.709
 I'll leave the post link down here. 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.579
 so this is my first choice 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.510
 for the 24-hour literary marathon 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.480
 carnival 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.760
 I would like to read between science of 50 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.940
 pages of this book everyone is 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.410
 recommends that it is a reading that went well 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.180
 but let's see if they reflect well 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.099
 because I do not know very well yet what 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.379
 Expect from him I do not know how I'm going 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.739
 to react to this plot I've read several 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.170
 snippets of that free stuff on 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.420
 internet but this is the first time then 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.519
 that I'll get to read for real and 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.889
 I'm going to record a video for the 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.620
 challenge and I'm going to watch the movie for 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.620
 record the video too my second 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.109
 choice is the glass room ms throne 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.760
 This book came out in the last draw of TV. 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.280
 air air if you did not watch the video 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.620
 I'll leave the link somewhere on the screen. 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.139
 in this air tv video I did not even show it 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.870
 a book because we are the biggest 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.489
 causes the situation as an instant I 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.280
 I bought thinking that I would arrive at a 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.620
 and after the approval of 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.380
 they did not even issue invoices 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.690
 still since 31 January 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.940
 So I already sent you a message. 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.260
 twitter and it's a little difficult 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.630
 the situation unfold 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.400
 but finally I can redeem 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.160
 him from the pile of books where he was 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.160
 so I intend to read between 50 and 100 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.139
 pages is from the glass throne during the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.299
 literary marathon my third 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.849
 choose the city from the ashes of the song 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.669
 The clash I chose this book to be 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.590
 reading the month than a lot of 2015 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.049
 I will also leave the post of buc the motorcycle 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.780
 underneath yesterday I even posted the 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.090
 review 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.250
 the first book of this challenge that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.320
 admitted of a clamorous my first 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.360
 I recommend this year's favorite 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.120
 leave the review link down here 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.160
 3 good if you like fantasy adventure 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.530
 and action is worth reading this book 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.440
 then for the month of February that the theme 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.690
 angels or demons I chose the city 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.750
 Ashes would also like to read between 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.490
 100 and 150 pages of this book and is the 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.410
 my last choice this is a read 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.980
 which I would like to conclude within the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:47.169
 Marathon period is the gones is the 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.760
 adaptation does not quite adapt to what 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.669
 I've seen some comments but it's a 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.070
 book version of steven's movie 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:56.050
 spielberg is he short having a 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.820
 very good acclamation, there are some 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.950
 then I even think it would be 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.280
 you can complete this reading within the 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.110
 marathon and this is a choice that 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.680
 book is that I proposed to this proposed 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.360
 book in the 12 books for 2015 I'm going too 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.490
 leave the post link here below if 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.290
 You have not watched my video yet? 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.389
 still did not see what my two 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.890
 reading choices growing in 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.229
 from this tag 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.930
 so this is what I would very much like to conclude 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.940
 this reading let's see if it gives good gent 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.470
 This I left out thinks 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.690
 choose a fifth reading for 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.700
 match the 1001 project books are 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.570
 you also never saw my post on the 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.520
 project 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.650
 I'll leave the link down here already 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.630
 I'll start recording the video this week. 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.880
 of the books I already write for you 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.770
 design a thousand books so you will see 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.750
 here on the channel soon 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.860
 but I thought five might be 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.870
 too much 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.940
 and I was going to start charging too much for 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.350
 take the pages of this book and 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.250
 I do not think books work too much. 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.919
 good 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.220
 so I decided to pick these four here 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.680
 I do not know how the spines are 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.680
 spines removing the gones here 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.560
 the spines are to focus're more or 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.330
 less here but face these are the 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.160
 my four choices is mine 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.890
 first experience I hope it is 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:14.440
 even if you can not read this 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.810
 tantã of pages and people I intend 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.840
 make an equal mt honey video 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.880
 muricy a meo made a marathon of these 11 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.010
 In the video she bet on her. 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.020
 updating within a few hours as 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.330
 Is this the marathon period? 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:32.050
 so I intend to make a video during 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.970
