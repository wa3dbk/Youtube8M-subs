00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:10.020
 what was that just like a shot we're going to 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.020
 see let's see what's here 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.850
 Let's see 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.809
 what do I hear 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.369
 we go for the loops 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.820
 Mr. 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.980
 and we keep talking a little bit more in 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.289
 depth of my first impressions 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.680
 of downloadable content for fallout 3 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:50.019
 called in game for all you are equal and 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.399
 we are playing on this map that still 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.199
 I do not remember his name 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.239
 the truth I do not remember what it's called 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.280
 none of the maps and here we are 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.260
 flying the soap with a great the one that 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.729
 He was throwing flowers for me 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.920
 flight capabilities and I felt very 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.299
 proud of myself 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.690
 for a little while, actually 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.369
 because interesting how is this day 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.840
 I was playing talking for a while with 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.810
 Marie and Sophie just went to sleep 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.520
 then the usual thing happens that I can not 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.569
 play with high volume and how I want 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.310
 talk to my wife I can not get 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.960
 the reds exempt of final nor listened 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.210
 when I do what I do this is a little while 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.830
 playing brass more than anything I have not tried 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.569
 really a lot of conquest or capture 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.280
 the flag captures the flag we are going to 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.850
 talk in more detail in another video 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.380
 I probably do not know if tomorrow or the past 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.490
 they open up some video talking a 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.080
 little bit of catch the flag because 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.729
 I'm really not very impressed with 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.539
 the way they did it as it is 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.610
 very short I do not know that bothers me a little 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.040
 I remember when I had left him 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.320
 map package also clouds waters 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.930
 they had also done something similar 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.420
 public the tours and that was called the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.650
 domain game that was also 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.930
 put practically the same as how 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.280
 do with tours and I think that what 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.540
 achieve a little better than the caption 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.610
 the flag and we're going to talk a little bit 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.110
 tomorrow I know it has been a little 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.729
 controversial of the topic because some 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.990
 people think it's great and the thing 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.060
 most incredible that has been put in a 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.090
 game and others like me think that such 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.340
 time it could have been better and over 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.930
 all because of the issue of spots and 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.730
 I do not know but good today we are going to talk a 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.320
 little bit of how they play on maps 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.790
 the different game modes that 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.860
 they are more conventional than it is conquest 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.140
 and brass here more serious is already talking 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.790
 of errors because it is the game mode 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.780
 that I was playing yesterday all the time and 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.080
 that's where they're coming from 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.320
 all these videos your clips on in the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.670
 different maps using the class of 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.790
 He told him that it is really the one that most 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.170
 like and playing a big role of 64 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.050
 players and on this map 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.340
 from the good jungle of the forest and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.450
 we talked about the forest map because of 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.770
 right now I do not remember that 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.300
 you are going to start putting the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.970
 description is called yes or yes 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.170
 you call already by of promptly equal them 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.590
 I'm going to learn the names so why 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.850
 now let's call it bad for the forest 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.650
 predominantly played on three maps 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.900
 I think there are four in total but played 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.850
 more than anything in three maps east of 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.069
 forest one of snow and one of desert 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.569
 it's a desert map do not take any clip 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.060
 the bleachers I was testing it and they were 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.860
 the first games and also iphone 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.920
 of I played with bad luck the capture the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.330
 flag and aside is rescuing bunch 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.250
 of people as you see here that is also 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.720
 using very strongly more than 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.269
 killing people is all the time 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.530
 rescuing those who died cost 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.730
 very much that the enemies will achieve 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.370
 get to our flags but about 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.930
 all because we did not have covered too 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.049
 and yet there are many places where 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.330
 can you try to mobilize and treat 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.400
 to flank the enemy and attack the most 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.319
 by the way not lie there is a map more 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.400
 I was playing too 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.959
 which is also kind of forest but 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.340
 that has as a little road burned in the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.349
 mountains is very nice that map 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.280
 also that neither serious anything I will see 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.049
 if you recorded a little bit later and in 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.269
 these maps are well made to 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.159
 exception of the desert that I do not 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.510
 liked the problem since the desert is 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.299
 that has absolutely no point 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.069
 covered and it is very easy for 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.299
 sniper are catching themselves from the 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.299
 ponys maybe that's why I also 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.969
 it bothered a little play in the catch 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.409
 the flag they put the game is not that 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.259
 be different especially when you play 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:18.329
 bros is almost always the same as the attacker 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.919
 has an independent base has a 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.130
 base but you have to protect two points 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.840
 of the air so that the enemies do not achieve 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.280
 plant bombs make them explode and in the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.440
 if they managed to exploit them 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.940
 then disappear those points and you 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.070
 advance a little bit later in the 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.130
 map to two other points and so on 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.530
 go ahead until the one who is attacking 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.509
 they see this and both or that the one who is 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.820
 defending I managed to make them run out 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.039
 the lost and people of the opposing team 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.070
 percent just unlock the Coupe 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.780
 and comment coupe 88 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.340
 It is night loans that is what I 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.000
 I call the one that looks like a gun 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.830
 paintball 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.180
 I love especially with 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.220
 some muffler have seen my 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.010
 videos with this weapon using everything 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.290
 kind of looks especially the plate I use it 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.210
 with the muffler on maps sometimes of 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.070
 close water if it does a lot of damage 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.450
 people do not see you coming and you need so 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.160
 general nothing more like two shots for 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.740
 kill them even with the silencer that you 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.270
 It makes the dance fall faster than 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.250
 have more bullet loss but 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.330
 it really does not matter due 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.170
 hundred if they see me I'm trying to 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:22.920
 aim too much is because the 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.380
 assignment to achieve take out in the 96's 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.330
 which for me is one of my favorites 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.350
 snyders in the game needs a lot 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.930
 of headshot yes how am I using 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.820
 this sniper that really not only 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.500
 a workshop I want is a good shot in the 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.530
 head then why I take so much 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.650
 precision do it here fall the 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.150
 paratroopers this guy fell 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.620
 unfortunately the wrong place 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.440
 this mountain that I am dominating myself that 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.780
 I'm really working and how can 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.520
 see is nice the map has very nice 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.750
 colors the truth is that someone out there 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.830
 I think there is some video coming 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.420
 compared with 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.610
 the maps a bit like you see in the 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.760
 colors and the shape of the bad 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.500
 company 2 if it has a certain resemblance to 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.880
 I think it's accompanied in 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.040
 many things for much better achieved 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.080
 that baron field 3 but does not mean 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.450
 that this game is bad for nothing in 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.730
 game in general I'm enjoying it 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.170
 I played a little bit of conquest 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.880
 almost always I play more domain because 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.610
 conquest is too much speech crash 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.900
 tanks and everything but I do not know amused me 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.890
 also very much use conquest me 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.020
 it seems that for the uars and for 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.520
 conquer both the these maps of 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.520
 this content this load them long is 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.980
 very very well I do not like at all the 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.750
 desert map and it was because I was 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.130
 saying that it's basically the wrong thing 

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.360
 fact of exposes and that there is no 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.920
 absolutely no position where 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.840
 cover yourself and maybe that's where I 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.970
 annoyed there are like a couple of pebbles 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.500
 but really when you play with 64 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.750
 including play I'm sure to be 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.790
 wrong your 12 players can not really 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.440
 get behind everyone hiding behind 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:48.150
 of the stone and then there's no way to 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.680
 move forward to reach the points of 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.230
 done I did not play like three games in that 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.140
 map and nobody managed to get past the first 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:57.390
 base in conquest what personality 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.880
 for me there is forgiveness I said conquest here 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.430
 it is followed by errors 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.230
 that people did not manage to pass and which 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.270
 does for me then really a map 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.340
 What is missing is not missing a little 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.810
 of love in the design part is very 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.880
 nice the desert and everything you want 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.650
 tell him but actually to play then 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.060
 it becomes detestable especially when 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.710
 It's your turn to attack and the frustration of 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.570
 try to go for the goal not achieve it 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.250
 Well, that's what I've been 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.960
 seemed like the maps I'll see later on 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.400
 the new big catch game the 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.050
 version of viola by removes one more
