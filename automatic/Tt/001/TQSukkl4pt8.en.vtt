entries points of entries to walk your
horse<00:01:39.450> into<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:41.220> know<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.079> heart<00:01:43.380> or<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
horse into you know the the heart or the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.469 
horse into you know the the heart or the
nerve-racking<00:01:44.430> part<00:01:44.610> for<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> horse<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
nerve-racking part for a horse is the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.200 
nerve-racking part for a horse is the
moment<00:01:45.990> he<00:01:46.110> goes<00:01:46.290> from<00:01:46.530> dry<00:01:46.890> ground<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.579> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
moment he goes from dry ground and and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
moment he goes from dry ground and and
puts<00:01:48.570> his<00:01:48.720> put<00:01:48.960> into<00:01:49.200> water<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.740> when<00:01:49.950> he

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
puts his put into water that's when he

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.950 
puts his put into water that's when he
gets<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.399> bit<00:01:50.610> nervous<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.270> tight<00:01:51.540> so

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
gets a little bit nervous and tight so

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.830 
gets a little bit nervous and tight so
I'm<00:01:52.200> trying<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.009> find<00:01:53.250> different<00:01:53.600> parts<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
I'm trying to find different parts of a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.499 
I'm trying to find different parts of a
water<00:01:55.049> jump<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.710> walk<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.509> and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
water jump you can walk in and out and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.389 
water jump you can walk in and out and
then<00:01:57.600> basically<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.680> progression<00:01:59.100> from

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
then basically it's a progression from

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.819 
then basically it's a progression from
that<00:01:59.610> then<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.000> trot<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that then you can trot in and then and

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.850 
that then you can trot in and then and
then<00:02:01.979> slowly<00:02:02.340> counter<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.409> when<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
then slowly counter in when you get to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340 
then slowly counter in when you get to
jumping<00:02:05.340> off<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> step<00:02:06.090> or<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> bank<00:02:06.780> into<00:02:07.140> water

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
jumping off a step or a bank into water

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
jumping off a step or a bank into water
you<00:02:07.560> want<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.920> encourage<00:02:08.310> your<00:02:08.550> horse<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
you want to encourage your horse not to

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.300 
you want to encourage your horse not to

want a nice quiet dribbling

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.700 
want a nice quiet dribbling
to<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> water<00:02:14.450> if<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> big<00:02:16.020> leap<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.650> a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
jump they often sort of land on all four

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.320 
jump they often sort of land on all four
feet<00:02:19.320> which<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.800> terrible<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.610> you've<00:02:21.090> got<00:02:21.120> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
feet which is terrible if you've got a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.010 
feet which is terrible if you've got a
jump<00:02:21.780> or<00:02:22.080> another<00:02:22.890> obstacle<00:02:23.630> ahead<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.930> you

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
jump or another obstacle ahead of you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.050 
jump or another obstacle ahead of you
you've<00:02:25.230> got<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.500> have<00:02:25.650> them<00:02:25.860> just<00:02:26.430> dribbling

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
you've got to have them just dribbling

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.000 
you've got to have them just dribbling
in<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:27.930> land<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.740> nice

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
in so that you can land in a nice

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.600 
in so that you can land in a nice
forward<00:02:29.550> controlled<00:02:30.270> cancer<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:32.400> so

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
forward controlled cancer and then so

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.490 
forward controlled cancer and then so
you're<00:02:32.790> basically<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.540> just<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.140> know<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
you're basically can just you know that

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.320 
you're basically can just you know that
the<00:02:34.680> next<00:02:34.980> name<00:02:35.160> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.370> game<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.700> progression

off with the water jump starting small

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.160 
off with the water jump starting small
tiny<00:02:40.950> stuff<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.640> then<00:02:42.240> as<00:02:42.360> time<00:02:42.600> goes<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.110> you

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
tiny stuff and then as time goes on you

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.080 
tiny stuff and then as time goes on you
want<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.500> build<00:02:43.680> up<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:44.100> slightly<00:02:44.430> bigger<00:02:44.850> and

bigger I would never trained or school

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.230 
bigger I would never trained or school
massive<00:02:49.380> jumps<00:02:49.770> into<00:02:49.920> water<00:02:50.220> I'd<00:02:50.490> leave<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
massive jumps into water I'd leave that

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.060 
massive jumps into water I'd leave that
to<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.480> competition's<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.560> basically

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
show with with you know masses amount of

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.600 
show with with you know masses amount of
confidence<00:03:06.470> then<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.620> next<00:03:07.770> thing<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.130> your

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
confidence then the next thing is your

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.130 
confidence then the next thing is your
position<00:03:10.610> one<00:03:11.610> thing<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:11.940> found<00:03:12.210> all<00:03:12.570> horses

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.910 
got to think about is the footing on how
deep<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.390> water<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:25.050> horses<00:03:25.350> will<00:03:25.590> trip

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
deep the water is some horses will trip
