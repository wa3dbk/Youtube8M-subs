00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
are a four-quarter be meaning you have

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.560 
are a four-quarter be meaning you have
four<00:01:06.690> beats<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.050> a<00:01:07.440> bar<00:01:07.650> one<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:08.730> three<00:01:09.000> four

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
in walls it's slightly different there's

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.320 
in walls it's slightly different there's

only three the relay in theory walls

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
only three the relay in theory walls
should<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:15.960> easier<00:01:16.440> because<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.070> only<00:01:17.280> have

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
should be easier because you only have

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.140 
should be easier because you only have
to<00:01:17.670> count<00:01:18.240> till<00:01:18.450> three<00:01:19.130> so<00:01:20.130> how<00:01:20.850> we're<00:01:21.030> going
