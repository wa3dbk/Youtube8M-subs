the<00:00:28.920> problem<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> see<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.330> them<00:00:30.449> a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the problem is what I see with them a

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.350 
the problem is what I see with them a
lot<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.750> martial<00:00:30.990> arts<00:00:31.230> training<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:32.360> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
lot of martial arts training is the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.240 
lot of martial arts training is the
concept<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.230> street<00:00:34.500> violence<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.100> not

addressed<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:36.000> edged<00:00:36.600> weapon<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.140> how

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
addressed with edged weapon and how

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.630

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
they're teaching to defend against it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
they're teaching to defend against it
just<00:00:39.120> doesn't<00:00:39.390> apply<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> street<00:00:40.230> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
just doesn't apply on the street so
