00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone again from the channel 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.309
 Chinese girls will go and we'll see how to make a 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.559
 experiment with water electrolysis 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:15.360
 well this is a reaction that happens 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.020
 when electricity goes through 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.210
 of two cables or two irons to the water with 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.119
 come out then to do this we need 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.820
 a 9 volt battery two pieces of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.920
 wire can be shorter than these 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 I do the more I long events but it does not happen 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.629
 nothing and a glass of water in which 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.899
 we will have dissolved about 10 tablespoons 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.699
 small salt to dissolve all this 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.739
 salt we put it a minute and a half to 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.559
 microwave and it dissolves much more 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.410
 quickly you just have to shake the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:50.570
 well then what we do is put 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.570
 a piece of wire in the glass 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.629
 and the other one does not have to touch the 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.040
 pieces of wire can pass by 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.670
 but you do not have to touch 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.670
 A) Yes 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.240
 very good now what we will have to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.540
 do will be put in contact 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.200
 each wire end with terminal 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.399
 the pile and we'll see what happens 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.399
 I'm going to give you a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.259
 As you can see bubbles are coming out 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.890
 put the image closer to the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.890
 best session 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.470
 As you can see, the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.080
 bubbles and these bubbles are 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.060
 mainly hydrogen but also 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.750
 has other gases like for example the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.750
 oxygen 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.840
 so you can see that what comes out is 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.319
 hydrogen, let's put a lighter 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.319
 over 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.300
 a lighter over the glass and then we go 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.340
 to move out as you will see when the 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.590
 lighter is on top of the glass the flame 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.120
 will come out bigger here has the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.640
 potent good regulator does not look but 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.860
 Well you can piraios that I'm not going to 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.080
 move is in the middle then when 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.599
 put the flame on top of the glass will come out 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.010
 a bigger flame than when I put it 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.110
 outside this is because hydrogen is 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.810
 flammable then when it leaves the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.599
 irons and rise by bubbles 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.150
 and it goes on the air I got in touch with the 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.349
 Flame and light up so good to see 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.349
 let's make more bubbles 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.370
 As you can see, the water is gradually 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.280
 fouling this is possible for 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.610
 the oxide of him 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:07.330
 the first time he calls comes out here 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.500
 small as big and it is created as a 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.500
 wake around the flame 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.380
 a more orange wake the sack and 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.940
 disappears inside and enters so good 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.780
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.780
 this has been all for today
