for<00:02:26.320> us<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.710> difficult<00:02:27.130> thing<00:02:27.310> is<00:02:27.460> that<00:02:27.670> we

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
for us the difficult thing is that we

actually referring to the audience and

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.950 
actually referring to the audience and
it<00:02:33.460> has<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.760> communicate<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.690> audience

at<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.200> same<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:40.800> think<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:42.340> we<00:02:43.090> have<00:02:43.360> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
at the same I think that we have a

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.700 
at the same I think that we have a
creation<00:02:44.680> now<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.790> new<00:02:46.000> cell<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.560> new

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710 
creation now of a new cell of a new

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
between those countries and I think that

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.400 
between those countries and I think that
something<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.630> moving<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:57.010> area
