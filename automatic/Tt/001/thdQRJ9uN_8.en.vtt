just really developing that team
chemistry<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.360> everybody<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.350> an<00:01:07.470> ego<00:01:10.190> go

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
chemistry and everybody have an ego go

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.700 
chemistry and everybody have an ego go
out<00:01:11.310> there<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.930> be<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.960> guy<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.470> given

out there and be the guy on a given

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
out there and be the guy on a given
night<00:01:13.860> yeah<00:01:14.220> there's<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.869> really<00:01:15.869> well-rounded
