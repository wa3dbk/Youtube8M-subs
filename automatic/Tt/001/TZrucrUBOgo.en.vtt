 -When are you a happy owner of a miracle hedge? 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:13.000
 - At the end of 2008, about November I bought a hedge from the company, small germs, such a small, half-meter, thin something. 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:25.000
 I planted them according to the instructions, and to my greatest surprise in the manual was that in the spring of the next year they need to be trimmed to 10-15 centimeters, 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.000
 the knife looked good, as if the plot was fenced with toothpicks. 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.000
 -Did you have to grow like this? 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.000
 - So the ones I saw on the Internet in the prospectus, there were nice big ones. 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 I was hoping this one would also grow from, say, 10 centimeters to this height, but it was hard to imagine, but as you can see, the hedge works just as it advertises. 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 -Did you have problems with planting? 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.000
 -No, there was no problem, there is a very detailed guide on the website 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.000
 So about 30cm zigzag, resulting in this almost impenetrable hedge. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.000
 Of course, where it has a function other than separating the area from the neighborhood, it borders the yard within one plot, 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:24.000
 there, I planted them side by side more sparsely, so the function is different, but as it is written, it is very good, the hedge grows pretty densely, as can be seen in the shot. 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:30.000
 So, in truth, all the care was trimming and circumcising, 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:43.000
 as it grew like a wild mushroom, but the hedge is not a mushroom, but it is absolutely unpretentious and, in my experience, is resistant to all sorts of diseases. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.000
 Of course, it must be known that it is deciduous, but in winter, its dense branches serve as protection against wind and snow, 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.000
 but it doesn't need any extra care. 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.000
 He didn't get a nutrient solution, no extra soil, nothing. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:07.000
 Sometimes he got water, most often from heaven, but I can say that it is the most undemanding and fast growing, grateful plant. 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:15.000
 - Can we say that you are the lucky owner of a miraculous hedge? 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 -Maximum, maximum. Very many of my friends have already admired the miraculous hedge, 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.000
 that since it has been growing, that for at least 10 years, but for 10 years we have not lived here yet, we moved here in 2008. 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.000
 I have already recommended more people because this rate of growth speaks for themselves, 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.000
 So I don't believe there is one more hedge that is 2.5 years old today, and if you let it grow freely, I think it should be about 6 meters. 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.000
 Now I'm trying to hold him about 3.5 meters, but I think he's not paired.
