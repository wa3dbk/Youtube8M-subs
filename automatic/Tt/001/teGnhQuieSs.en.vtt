00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.230
 Now we are all here with another 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.240
 video and today we are going to see a cube that is 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.160
 very handsome is not all the chords no longer 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.980
 dye angles have been for quite some time 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.140
 windows that is good is like a cube of 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.050
 rubik not that but I would not be here inside 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.700
 it's like a Rubik's cube already has 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.100
 many pieces much outgoing many 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.260
 wheels not here we can see it is very 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.060
 handsome and I did not have any video of this 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.920
 cube I think I think I teach it in 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.990
 some video in some top that I made top 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.539
 10 or 25 of these cubes I think this one 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.579
 I already showed it some time but I did not have it 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.319
 no video made and good and this is a 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.340
 good cube that I like quite tour very 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:40.100
 ok let's talk a little bit about 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.410
 that this well the truth that I do not have 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.600
 fucking idea because this we will see 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.570
 we can see it is simple really 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.330
 It has the 48 corners of the rubik's cube 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.309
 not that we can see them inwardly and 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.220
 then how was it without having as if 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.140
 we catch a Rubik's cube 3 x 3 and 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.480
 faces it is for example in these 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.070
 faces to pull out 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.590
 circle out good and if we do 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.619
 a lot of cuts because let's see 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.380
 How many cuts does the whole wheel have? 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.660
 normal 90 degree turn 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.670
 not a 90 degree 90 degree turn 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.399
 we can always cut through here and have 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.460
 70 degree turns I think that that 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:23.270
 it would be light beige every 70 degrees the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.230
 70 short wheel 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.440
 77 70 175 those who are now I do not know anymore 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.600
 good how it is solved because the truth is 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.240
 that I am cubed I have one more method or 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.250
 less good I did not buy it and well no 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.900
 look at any tutorial or look at anything and the 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
 truth that I learned to solve it because 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.120
 it's easy because I count all these 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.010
 interior pieces that you only have one 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.020
 sticker the ones that you have two 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.910
 not tickets but those that only have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.860
 a sticker the accounts as if they were 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.410
 the centers of a 7 by 7 for example 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.200
 then basically software like 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.360
 performing the centers of a 7 by 7 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 except for these pieces that have 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.650
 like two ships that have two stickers 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.970
 and they're stuck to the corner all this the 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.740
 corner when when we rotate a 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.410
 rotary corner to all this if by 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.300
 example we disassembled it like this with these 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.460
 turns like that normal would be like a three for 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.710
 three would be exactly you see here 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.470
 we would have a piece another piece but 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.810
 well no it's not the case we're going to take 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.790
 this site 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.900
 I have to do a tutorial on this but 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.610
 well I have to do a tutorial 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.660
 so many cubes that this is a bit of a 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.400
 madness 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.140
 I suppose there's a lot you'll know 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.330
 good when I solve the one of the centers 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.550
 as if they were doing 7 for 7 ago the 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.010
 corner to blaine like it was for not 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.030
 break anything from the center I do the corners 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.230
 as if it were the cube with the eyes 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.760
 closed what is only with 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.670
 algorithms that only move corners 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.160
 to not break anything and when I have the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.540
 ordered corner and already all this as if 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.180
 were the centers made I start to 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.800
 Color the wheels to make to order 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.080
 these pieces that really very simple 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.760
 with vertex orientation realizing 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.520
 explained reactions of the wheels 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.500
 get to solve it is worth as we can 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.780
 close here in the red face I'm missing and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.420
 a sticker because as it has stickers 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.120
 so small they fall or are sometimes good 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.270
 ones that fall are well stuck 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.560
 but if it has fallen and it falls out 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.270
 this is in this skeleton in a 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.150
 stick version in the obituary we go back 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.710
 uequÃ­n that already practically does not even 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.290
 I remembered this game and I would return it 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.760
 I say this one was very handsome and good background 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.230
 instead of bringing a black background so 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.790
 we go back electrical for that with the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.040
 ticas problem and so does not fall 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.090
 ok let's take it apart to see how 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.440
 would be dismantled the truth that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.300
 unmounted 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.170
 impress a little you see we start 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.690
 make normal turns 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.209
 of 3 by 3 you have already spent a little 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.890
 wheels we move wheel we move wheel 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.390
 resolution time of this cube is 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.370
 took a good time is this has 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.440
 entertaining the truth is that this one of 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.540
 the most entertaining puzzles I have and 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.120
 well, it is already complicated to break all 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.680
 we have to go around here breaking all 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.569
 the all these blocks all these 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.970
 pieces that are all together to see 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.920
 if you want but good but the truth 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.630
 is very entertaining tour very well to 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.519
 Sometimes, it does sometimes, but it is because 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.709
 that's because it has so many pieces and so 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.660
 small that sometimes good we do 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.239
 we try faster turns than what 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.739
 should and can engage but 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.709
 Well we are seeing here how it is 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.180
 dismantled here over here you see 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.459
 it is very cool dismantling also 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.229
 it looks very nice you see here 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.510
 for example, all this is done, not me 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.780
 I'm doing now if for example 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:30.100
 I could take out I'm here to see 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.120
 it's not so easily because I what 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:37.419
 I wanted to get this way 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.919
 if you want like to every time every time 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.600
 worked this as I did not result 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.970
 not many times but according to 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.250
 I was spinning it still doing this to 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.080
 mode as a center of a 7 by 7 or of 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.400
 some cuban that these stickers are 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.260
 pieces that have only one sticker 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.150
 I tell them as if they were centers and 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.650
 then you are already giving these already good with 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.199
 the corner orientation I'm going 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.080
 correcting and I go very coloring rada 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:02.000
 day a very cool workshop puzzle 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.819
 There is not much more to say about this either 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.229
 because what you are seeing is rolling 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.210
 they spin very well they have many twists 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.099
 they have many pieces is entertaining is 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.020
 mostly entertaining even for 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.909
 put on quietly and good and 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.520
 solve it not as a three by three that 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.680
 we take it and go to death as if not 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.800
 there was a tomorrow is worth this is already 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.240
 Super disassembled still do not see yet 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.590
 is that there are so many twists 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.229
 because they would still be left 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.969
 structures out there together but 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.789
 good you see everything you know all the pieces 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:33.349
 can be separated from all sides and 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.409
 It is very good because there we have the 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.349
 diane 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:40.149
 the Chinese fucking and nothing a very village 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.189
 interesting is something expensive the seen this 

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:44.019
 I do not know how much he does not remember us very well 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:46.089
 it counted worth but it is around the 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:50.379
 40 euros but of course it also has a 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:51.879
 complexity would be to know how to design a 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:53.259
 puzzle of this style with so many twists 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.239
 on the wheels with the pieces so 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.089
 small this has to take a 

00:05:55.239 --> 00:05:59.860
 design process for many hours and 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.509
 costs then good clear why that's the 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.819
 product price at the end is a bit 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.099
 highest has very good quality in 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.619
 red to ians the button with weight with body 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.969
 very good and nothing and I wanted to show it 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:12.249
 because I did not have any video of 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:13.749
 this cube and it deserves it that way 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:15.819
 that nothing with this we have already seen 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:18.300
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.300
 in other
