 here to bring a different video 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
 about fifa 15 staff basically mec 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.099
 a little tutorial 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.470
 The people have been charging me for some time. 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.960
 especially Mr. Eduardo Fernandes 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.170
 I'm finally bringing a video here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.420
 very fast very well 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 explaining how I put the goal net 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 in the way you see in my 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
 career mode generally everybody plays 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 mode with the default network mode that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.840
 that box network i call box network 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.610
 that the European network it is is not 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.750
 far away she is short on her in one of the village 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.120
 belmiro 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.579
 she is square is on the court is not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.399
 rectangular and it is short it is not 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:11.969
 that loose net in the background 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.459
 morumbi for example is the most used network 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:16.740
 in all parts of the world I believe and 

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:19.469
 fifa is the default network that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.060
 I do not like it or I decide to change it I did 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.819
 some tests here at the time I changed 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.069
 I honestly do not remember which one anymore. 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.079
 is every type of network right 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.229
 So I 'm going to advise you to do 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.979
 tests then you change the network enter the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.249
 free game mode a game is fast o 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.759
 friendly game and look how it's going to 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.609
 network 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.630
 Look here, I'm just going to come up with options 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:45.869
 game 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.939
 here of course has to do not here 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.929
 Gives that in the game at the time . 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.060
 these options 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.279
 even if you have game options in the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.289
 do not have it here, you 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:58.889
 has to come in the main menu and enter 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:02.989
 In this part, the graph has only 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:07.169
 here is the attention of the network, I stand firm 

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:10.050
 shape of triangular mesh network rave 

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:11.550
 square and here this here nothing to see 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.010
 this here scrolling facilities here and if 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.510
 that stop of escalations that appear 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 I'm starting to get 15 for who plays in the new 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.760
 generation right appears the players name 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.250
 down when you start the match I 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.409
 I find a sack that business because he 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.650
 capped radar simply for some time 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.000
 at the beginning of each match then a 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.190
 simply remove then put here 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.349
 not only business is another thing already 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.239
 Buying me for you. 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.250
 learn to do too 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.430
 so I have here another one has the standard that 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.689
 here come there have regular has loose I use 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.030
 firm triangular has rectangular pattern 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.159
 standard is tango home 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.409
 here is a square network area 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.680
 has hexagon standard here 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.670
 basically the following above the network will go 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.049
 to notice that on the network it has a format 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.730
 When it is square it has several 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.680
 network squares 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.560
 when you put this hexagon 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.889
 are several hexagon us in the network is a 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.870
 detail well well underlines thus 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.150
 difficult to see only for whom 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.370
 really looks good for these details 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.160
 to realize but what really changes 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.709
 here is triangular and rectangular 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.639
 rectangular the triangular pattern is what 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.470
 I use it here and firm and loose and irregular 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.540
 I do not remember exactly the difference 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.299
 each have to test and and enter the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.040
 friendly game mode and weave that 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.620
 type of network so that's basically it 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.449
 It's quite simple there for you. 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.129
 on this screen I have shown here options 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.799
 I just played that before I did not come here 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.449
 start screen start play online net 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.870
 of live centers on customize 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:51.269
 settings game options and come here 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.769
 charts and changes these network 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.959
 Okay, so this is it , I hope you guys 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.760
 have covered me more in this 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.620
 business is there the tutorial took a 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.150
 A little bit but I left for you to leave here. 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.010
 to help in the disclosure if you have 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.109
 some friend that I have this kind of 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.879
 doubt give him this video that is 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:10.129
 always important disclosure there of 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:10.129
