00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
back to remembering those first hundred

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.820 
back to remembering those first hundred
episodes<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.269> first<00:00:30.599> movie<00:00:31.050> was<00:00:31.230> called<00:00:31.500> one

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
episodes the first movie was called one

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
piece the movie and it brought me back

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.380 
piece the movie and it brought me back
to<00:00:33.570> remember<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.410> time<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.940> series<00:00:36.180> was

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
to remember a time when the series was

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.450 
to remember a time when the series was
so<00:00:36.600> young<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.870> saji<00:00:37.680> wasn't<00:00:38.010> even<00:00:38.190> part<00:00:38.340> of

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
so young that saji wasn't even part of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.069 
so young that saji wasn't even part of
the<00:00:38.610> crew<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.300> movie<00:00:39.540> itself<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:40.050> pretty

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the crew the movie itself was pretty

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.610 
the crew the movie itself was pretty
mediocre<00:00:40.610> like<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.760> decent<00:00:42.059> filler<00:00:42.570> arc<00:00:42.899> but<00:00:43.559> I

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
mediocre like a decent filler arc but I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
mediocre like a decent filler arc but I
could<00:00:43.829> tell<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.430> effort<00:00:44.730> went<00:00:44.940> into<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
could tell that some effort went into it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
could tell that some effort went into it
maybe<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.140> only<00:00:46.320> made<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.950> order<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> see

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
maybe it was only made in order to see

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.709 
maybe it was only made in order to see
if<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.610> series<00:00:47.879> would<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.270> any<00:00:48.450> money

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
if the series would make any money

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.170 
if the series would make any money
because<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.500> i<00:00:49.649> remember<00:00:49.860> correctly<00:00:50.309> luffy

getting chopper in a way I feel like the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.109 
getting chopper in a way I feel like the
movie<00:01:26.880> was<00:01:27.090> almost<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:28.200> welcome<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:29.280> sanji<00:01:29.850> on

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
movie he came off as something almost

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.469 
movie he came off as something almost
like<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.950> main<00:01:35.130> character<00:01:35.369> if<00:01:35.759> not<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.150> Luffy

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
