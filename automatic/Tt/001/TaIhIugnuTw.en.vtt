00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.960
 welcome to the last episode of 2008 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.440
 the ball the winners meanwhile is one of the first half of the competition 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.339
 svm 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.109
 that can go among the winners I think it should be on me occasionally 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 watch the 28 year old it no longer gave away hands without a doubt 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.849
 in the meantime 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.239
 yes it is going to go between az and ajax the championship 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.779
 see through a latin filming beautiful football and he terrace that is gouis 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.939
 of course also the big winner sure deposed in a previous season of course 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.400
 absolutely 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.890
 then also immediately see that the players themselves could also 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 fink is decisive from between louis van gaal now such a different trainer than 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 than last year went completely wrong but I think van Gaal in the Netherlands 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.350
 in the netherlands the trainers do have a bit different 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.390
 the event is not the best 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.120
 and that now appears at az yes not the nicest most beautiful football plays one 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.729
 champion we are going to become 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.030
 twente does it run yes yes at least like that one 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.549
 yes it's going to say ajax owns ajax has of course 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.019
 both vehicles we are more goals jaap walk around there only in the back 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.220
 are not so good at ajax and then there are center defenders at the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.190
 The transmitter's sides on Friday enabled a teacher who was already after half an hour 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.280
 changed later on sometimes different but losers eurostar traffic 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.100
 that is what remains fragile photo epa puts his yes that is clearly ajax yes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 marco van basten is also a winner 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.280
 can win from this 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.680
 He does it pretty hard to act when I say that you sit that defense 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.509
 still points 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.270
 quite some time 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.160
 then they can sometimes lose out this season, which states that this is already the case 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.800
 and once won with Johan Cruijff of course 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.730
 before the season actually started some kind of weird weird thing at the time 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.270
 but good for that matter you would get 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.179
 among the losers this season can be the assistant of van basts 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.860
 a at ajax has been running for years i dont like hiring one 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.789
 the hague called the comoros just like all other animals in front of the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.969
 inciting years always hope doubts about these players but those are 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.430
 the two flavorings 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.860
 turned out from 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.140
 they know the offensive sense of the first half of the competition clearly yes 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.290
 the acquisition yes losers there was always more than winning even though a recommended oath 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.349
 what I only stand at the top and 17 in the pursuit yes 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.249
 the very big losses state a little yes among others 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.530
 that must be there anyway 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.010
 clubs if you go to vitesse and modena among scissors hans westerhof bit 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.649
 pathetic race it is not surprising that that man actually 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.529
 it is not going well 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.729
 the man now probably gets his 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.799
 congÃ© this week 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.319
 but well it is waited blown sean mackin van gelder were arrested 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.539
 actually and not very successful at ajax 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.459
 a soft expressed in people living at the caravan camp in his neighborhood 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.569
 fired yes always been and if yes then he is fired include it 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.110
 dismissal of thousands of people 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.999
 the header of people in recent years 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:51.419
 that comes in short, well I think that yellow works well with 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.029
 co adrian let himself be 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.389
 because he also performed well with co, but were actually coming 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.869
 never really happy they have to have always fired one 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.209
 strangers the belgian dutchman 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.759
 harm van Veldhoven who doesn't know who doesn't know and we will be attracted 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.310
 and that typed 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.649
 the game of his team last weekend as our pathetic 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:15.569
 liander that naturally also says something about what happened with the necessary yes and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.249
 then you are not allowed to read anything about gilda 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.039
 rossi went silent 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.979
 We're losing 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.030
 yes he also thinks 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.209
 also you can not really call a winner every year no that goes 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.780
 of course not good at all, the 8 score is now eleven points believe that 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:30.410
 is 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.279
 unworthy of the champion team 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.989
 and as it looks now thousands in the winter break also a delicious 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.489
 want to strengthen dibi again 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.049
 a name of mark van bommel ground always a circle of bommel for open 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:45.139
 pulling the breaker says that even openly the other is bommel from 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.299
 today then tomorrow 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.029
 and now I have just spoken of bommel Sunday evening that says yes 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.979
 PSV does not have them at the first choice, he has a one-year contract 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.689
 got offered from bayern munich he wants to sign somewhere for two years 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.749
 so that would be possible with psv 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.889
 but he says that I actually only do if they really have no other major European 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.079
 more clubs are coming yes and yes you can also assume that they are a big european 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.799
 clubs are coming for the captain of bayern munich there are much bigger ones 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.519
 clubs big new psp also indeed no relief within four weeks 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.739
 broke loose from diegem 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.500
 at feyenoord there is also a losing coach 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.420
 the eu and euro at the last minute still beating from the Alkmaar we must 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.120
 don't nag the sadness 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 but my feyenoord the chest on 9 by the competition 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.450
 yes, because there is only a few people to kill and there was more to it 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.370
 yes that is because players who are not in the a juniors appear on the field 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.790
 yes for the time being that is not yet the case a laundry list of injuries 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.930
 and that two years in a buggy whatever you strong van verbeek that you must feel 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.979
 of course attract yes yes there comes black ice there must be done at feyenoord 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.410
 especially if your unhappy faces face a big lose, you are also running around 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.970
 in the in defense of ajax the in nl does a bit pathetic to it 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.620
 game of van 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.330
 for such marriages and whatever the man may be called we are numerous 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.190
 that is a bit the vulnerable point of ajax that defense year d 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.150
 from the wheel and the ruud of the moon are actually center defenders 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.970
 on the sides 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.680
 when it was shot about, none of it is tangled, the whole profession is revelation 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.210
 the season in the center year but that one day remains hopeless 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.110
 obsolete and stressed, he says marco van basten 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.330
 so crazy not yet come from barcelona 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.599
 the one that has circles in the squatters is not going wrong, maybe far too little 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.699
 Tension actually turns around in 2000 profit in an arena put in this 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.330
 spanish crunches that make him stress-free 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.000
 that doesn't seem to have the only explanation for his lesser game 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.690
 put 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.980
 but also the 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.700
 the question of quality of that I think yes there are not for nothing on the 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:42.100
 Bank 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.590
 he was mainly on the couch at barcelona yes as with k3 you can 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.370
 They say they are boys from Barcelona 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.730
 yes but they were sitting there on the bench seat of barcelona was in 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.460
 newspaper land united states yes that finally the biggest fish anyway 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.860
 Willem van Hanegem I think 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.619
 it seems the big winner from the oven and 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:02.579
 if assistants were fired there he seemed to go rich under his own course 

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:06.020
 but two months later it completely collapsed one 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.090
 year city and unemployed at home waiting for his first year alone I am scared 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.069
 that the man will not see again as a trainer at least I think so 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:13.669
 not worse 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.449
 I think this moment of great relief from investors silent for a while 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:18.139
 been 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.479
 but who no longer plays football 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.199
 then what 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.849
 sports week
