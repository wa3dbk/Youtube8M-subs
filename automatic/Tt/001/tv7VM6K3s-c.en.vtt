00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.120

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.109
 price of monaco 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.720
 renault presents a new concept the 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.580
 twin run as long as a twingo he is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.039
 however more than ten 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.019
 centimeters tubular frame from 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 the universe of competition and motor in 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.669
 central rear position are from the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 part derived from the megan trophy the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.920
 v6 block 3 liters 5 develops a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 power of 320 horsepower and a couple of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.510
 380 newton meters thanks to the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.510
 composite bodyweight does not 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.030
 does not exceed 9 150 kg which allows the 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.710
 little bomb to accelerate very hard with 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 a 0 to 100 km time announced in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.600
 only four seconds 5 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.960
 a question arises should there be a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.690
 tribute to the legendary r5 turbo and to the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.640
 clio v6 or more concretely a future 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 city at renault elements of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.049
 answer with florian chopin reporters 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.409

 one thing is sure this twin run gives 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.350
 urge solicited for the development of 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 the ground connection jean ragnotti is 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.670
 conquered we immediately feel that it is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.020
 a race car the box of 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.210
