before<00:00:06.450> we<00:00:06.569> really<00:00:06.899> talk<00:00:07.140> about<00:00:07.170> modes<00:00:07.710> we're

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
before we really talk about modes we're

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.290 
before we really talk about modes we're
going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> need<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.490> spend<00:00:08.700> time<00:00:09.000> talking

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
going to need to spend time talking

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.600 
going to need to spend time talking
about<00:00:09.510> intervals<00:00:10.170> because<00:00:10.650> those<00:00:11.219> intervals

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
about intervals because those intervals

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.180 
about intervals because those intervals
are<00:00:11.820> gonna<00:00:11.969> help<00:00:12.240> us<00:00:12.420> understand<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.710> theory

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
are gonna help us understand the theory

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.609 
are gonna help us understand the theory
behind<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.940> modes<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.780> how<00:00:16.049> we<00:00:16.379> can

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
behind the modes and and how we can

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.279 
behind the modes and and how we can
apply<00:00:16.890> these<00:00:17.010> modes<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.789> different<00:00:18.090> chords<00:00:18.420> so

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
apply these modes to different chords so

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.200 
apply these modes to different chords so
first<00:00:19.529> first<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.730> an<00:00:20.880> interval

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
first first of all what is an interval

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.840 
first first of all what is an interval
an<00:00:21.750> interval<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.470> unit<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> measure<00:00:23.490> we're

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
an interval is the unit of measure we're

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.300 
an interval is the unit of measure we're
gonna<00:00:23.939> use<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:25.230> measure<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.859> distance

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
gonna use to measure the distance

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.490 
gonna use to measure the distance
between<00:00:26.519> two<00:00:26.849> different<00:00:27.210> notes<00:00:27.410> there<00:00:28.410> are

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
between two different notes there are

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.759 
between two different notes there are
eight<00:00:28.619> types<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.099> intervals<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.090> second

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
eight types of intervals the second

eighth<00:00:35.730> also<00:00:36.300> known<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> octave<00:00:37.200> let's

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
eighth also known as the octave let's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.380 
eighth also known as the octave let's
talk<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> bit<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> little<00:00:38.820> bit<00:00:39.030> about<00:00:39.180> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
talk a bit a little bit about that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.270 
talk a bit a little bit about that
octave<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.379> octave<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> very

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
octave because that octave is very

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
octave because that octave is very
special<00:00:41.850> interval<00:00:42.860> if<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.070> play<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.520> an<00:00:45.360> open

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
special interval if I play up an open

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.889 
special interval if I play up an open

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the same notes we've got an e on the low

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
distance between these two e's although

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
distance between these two e's although
they're<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.900> same<00:01:10.110> notes<00:01:10.470> they're<00:01:10.920> saying

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
they're the same notes they're saying

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.460 
they're the same notes they're saying
ease<00:01:11.520> they<00:01:11.880> sound<00:01:12.180> different<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:13.080> distance

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
ease they sound different the distance

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.810 
ease they sound different the distance
between<00:01:13.650> these<00:01:13.920> two<00:01:14.159> notes<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> be

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
between these two notes is going to be

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.820 
between these two notes is going to be
an<00:01:14.939> octave<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> octave<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.439> gonna<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
an octave so the octave is gonna be the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
an octave so the octave is gonna be the
reference<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.580> octave<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.000> gonna<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
reference the octave is gonna be the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.770 
reference the octave is gonna be the
highest<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:20.729> highest<00:01:20.759> interval<00:01:21.540> we're<00:01:21.689> gonna

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
highest the highest interval we're gonna

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.240 
highest the highest interval we're gonna
find<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.470> biggest<00:01:22.710> interval<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> widest<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
find the biggest interval the widest and

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.830 
find the biggest interval the widest and
that<00:01:26.250> means<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.640> between<00:01:27.119> these<00:01:27.330> two<00:01:27.540> e's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that means that between these two e's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
that means that between these two e's
we've<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> lot<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.710> different<00:01:29.159> intervals

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
we've got a lot of different intervals

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.179 
we've got a lot of different intervals
and<00:01:30.320> we're<00:01:31.320> gonna<00:01:31.409> find<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.310> 2nd<00:01:32.790> 3rd<00:01:33.479> 4th<00:01:33.750> 5th

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
and we're gonna find the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
and we're gonna find the 2nd 3rd 4th 5th
6th<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.280> 7th<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> all<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> way<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
6th and 7th and all the way up to the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.560 
6th and 7th and all the way up to the
octave<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:38.159> if<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.490> take<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> closer<00:01:39.000> look<00:01:39.299> here

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
octave now if we take a closer look here

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
octave now if we take a closer look here
between<00:01:39.780> these<00:01:40.470> two<00:01:40.530> notes<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.130> played<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
between these two notes that I played I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
between these two notes that I played I
play<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.939> first<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> open<00:01:42.840> string

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
play the first one on the open string

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.800 
play the first one on the open string
fret<00:01:43.470> zero<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.850> other<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.299> on<00:01:45.329> fret

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
fret zero and the other one was on fret

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.670 
fret zero and the other one was on fret
number<00:01:46.079> 12

number 12

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
number 12
we've<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.640> 12<00:01:47.909> different<00:01:48.119> frets<00:01:48.509> between

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
we've got 12 different frets between

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.109 
we've got 12 different frets between
these<00:01:49.020> two<00:01:49.200> notes<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.399> said<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.790> we

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
these two notes and we just said that we

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.710 
these two notes and we just said that we
have<00:01:51.420> only<00:01:51.720> 8<00:01:52.430> intervals<00:01:53.430> eight<00:01:54.180> types<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
have only 8 intervals eight types of

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
have only 8 intervals eight types of
intervals<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.619> opposed<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> 12<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.270> reason<00:01:57.630> is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
intervals as opposed to 12 the reason is

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.410 
intervals as opposed to 12 the reason is
some<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> these<00:01:58.560> intervals<00:01:58.950> are<00:01:59.149> gonna<00:02:00.149> have

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
some of these intervals are gonna have

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.050 
some of these intervals are gonna have
different<00:02:01.310> classifications<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
different classifications like the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.749 
different classifications like the
second<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.659> example<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.829> don't<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
second for example we don't just have a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
second for example we don't just have a
straight<00:02:06.060> second<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.869> either<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.469> minor

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
straight second we have either a minor

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.400 
straight second we have either a minor
second<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.640> major<00:02:08.940> second<00:02:09.569> same<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
second or a major second same for the

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.510 
second or a major second same for the
third<00:02:10.470> we've<00:02:10.890> got<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> minor

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
third we've got a minor

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.300 
third we've got a minor
or<00:02:11.790> major<00:02:12.030> third<00:02:12.660> now<00:02:13.320> some<00:02:13.620> intervals<00:02:14.070> such

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
or major third now some intervals such

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.290 
or major third now some intervals such
as<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.790> fourth<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:16.830> don't<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.250> minor<00:02:17.940> or

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
as the fourth we don't have minor or

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.870 
as the fourth we don't have minor or
major<00:02:18.330> fourths<00:02:19.140> we've<00:02:19.950> got<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.160> natural<00:02:20.640> fourth

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
major fourths we've got a natural fourth

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.180 
major fourths we've got a natural fourth
also<00:02:21.570> known<00:02:21.960> as<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.320> perfect<00:02:22.680> fourth<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
also known as the perfect fourth and

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.340 
also known as the perfect fourth and
then<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.060> can<00:02:24.210> have<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> diminished<00:02:25.020> fourth

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
then we can have a diminished fourth

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.530 
then we can have a diminished fourth
which<00:02:25.770> means<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.400> interval<00:02:26.820> that<00:02:27.330> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
which means that the interval that the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.430 
which means that the interval that the
perfect<00:02:27.930> fourth<00:02:28.200> interval<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:29.010> diminished<00:02:29.760> by

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
perfect fourth interval is diminished by

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
perfect fourth interval is diminished by
by<00:02:31.440> by<00:02:31.770> one<00:02:32.040> half<00:02:32.430> step<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.330> that<00:02:33.510> everybody

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
by by one half step so that everybody

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.820 
by by one half step so that everybody
interval<00:02:34.080> is<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.350> be<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.650> bit

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
interval is going to be a little bit

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.370 
interval is going to be a little bit
smaller<00:02:35.190> than<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.360> natural<00:02:36.510> fourth<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.230> an

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
smaller than the natural fourth or an

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.650 
smaller than the natural fourth or an
invented<00:02:37.920> fourth<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.340> little<00:02:38.610> bit<00:02:38.730> bigger<00:02:38.940> so

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
invented fourth a little bit bigger so

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.500 
invented fourth a little bit bigger so
the<00:02:39.840> different<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.830> difference<00:02:41.250> between<00:02:41.550> two

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
the different the difference between two

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.040 
the different the difference between two
notes<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.990> gonna<00:02:43.170> be<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.500> wider<00:02:45.050> same

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
notes is gonna be a little wider same

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.600 
notes is gonna be a little wider same
for<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> fifth<00:02:46.560> we're<00:02:46.740> gonna<00:02:46.830> have<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.070> perfect

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
for the fifth we're gonna have a perfect

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.170 
for the fifth we're gonna have a perfect
fifth<00:02:48.350> or<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.410> natural<00:02:49.860> fifth<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.340> then<00:02:50.790> we<00:02:50.940> can

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
fifth or a natural fifth and then we can

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.660 
fifth or a natural fifth and then we can
have<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.810> diminished<00:02:52.110> fifth<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.220> interval

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
have a diminished fifth so that interval

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.000 
have a diminished fifth so that interval
is<00:02:53.730> gonna<00:02:53.970> be<00:02:54.060> diminished<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.680> distance

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
is gonna be diminished the distance

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.230 
is gonna be diminished the distance
between<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.430> two<00:02:56.580> notes<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.970> going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.180> be

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
between the two notes is going to be

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.560 
between the two notes is going to be
smaller<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.200> you'll<00:02:58.350> have<00:02:58.500> less<00:02:58.740> frets<00:02:59.130> or

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
smaller so you'll have less frets or

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.500 
smaller so you'll have less frets or
augmented<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.400> augmented<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.670> distance

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
augmented and augmented the distance

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.670 
augmented and augmented the distance
between<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.900> two<00:03:04.050> notes<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.380> going<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> be

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
between the two notes is going to be

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.850 
between the two notes is going to be
augmented<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.610> have<00:03:05.790> more<00:03:05.970> frets<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:07.470> sixth

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
augmented you have more frets the sixth

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.550 
augmented you have more frets the sixth
we've<00:03:08.820> got<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.030> minor<00:03:09.300> sixth<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.870> major<00:03:10.140> sixth

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
we've got a minor sixth a major sixth

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.130 
we've got a minor sixth a major sixth
and<00:03:10.740> same<00:03:11.130> for<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.400> 7th<00:03:11.820> minor<00:03:12.150> 7th<00:03:12.630> and<00:03:12.870> major

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
and same for the 7th minor 7th and major

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.320 
and same for the 7th minor 7th and major
seventh<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.310> if<00:03:14.460> we<00:03:14.580> take<00:03:14.760> all<00:03:15.030> these

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
seventh so if we take all these

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.940 
seventh so if we take all these
different<00:03:15.840> types<00:03:16.140> of<00:03:16.380> intervals

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
different types of intervals

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.970 
different types of intervals
-<00:03:17.610> second<00:03:18.000> major<00:03:18.270> second<00:03:19.020> minor<00:03:19.350> third<00:03:19.680> major

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
- second major second minor third major

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.330 
- second major second minor third major
third<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.640> forth<00:03:21.320> we<00:03:22.320> will<00:03:22.350> have<00:03:22.860> covered

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
third and so forth we will have covered

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.370 
third and so forth we will have covered
the<00:03:23.430> whole<00:03:23.610> spectrum<00:03:23.970> of<00:03:24.420> these<00:03:24.630> twelve

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
the whole spectrum of these twelve

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.350 
the whole spectrum of these twelve
different<00:03:25.740> frets<00:03:25.950> from<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.400> low<00:03:26.610> E<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
different frets from this low E to the

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.320 
different frets from this low E to the
high<00:03:27.900> E<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.350> twelfth<00:03:28.680> fret<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:30.120> these

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
high E and the twelfth fret so these

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.440 
high E and the twelfth fret so these
intervals<00:03:30.720> are<00:03:31.050> very<00:03:31.500> important<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.450> you

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
intervals are very important and you you

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:34.640 
intervals are very important and you you
need<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.750> make<00:03:33.900> sure<00:03:34.050> that<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:34.320> know<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
need to make sure that you know the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.010 
need to make sure that you know the
names<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:36.180> different<00:03:36.510> types<00:03:36.750> of

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
names and the different types of

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.650 
names and the different types of
intervals<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:37.680> have<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:39.209> do<00:03:39.360> so

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
intervals that we have and to do so

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.650 
intervals that we have and to do so
instead<00:03:39.990> of<00:03:40.260> just<00:03:40.620> having<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.520> sheet<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.450> learn

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
instead of just having a sheet to learn

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.350 
instead of just having a sheet to learn
with<00:03:43.020> with<00:03:44.010> all<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.310> intervals<00:03:44.700> and<00:03:44.910> really

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
with with all the intervals and really

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.000 
with with all the intervals and really
memorize<00:03:45.690> how<00:03:45.930> many<00:03:46.110> frets<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:46.620> have<00:03:46.830> between

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
memorize how many frets we have between

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.830 
memorize how many frets we have between
these<00:03:47.280> intervals<00:03:47.670> that's<00:03:48.150> gonna<00:03:48.300> take<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.570> lot

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
these intervals that's gonna take a lot

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.720 
these intervals that's gonna take a lot
of<00:03:48.870> time<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.560> that's<00:03:50.010> time<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.490> can

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
of time and that's time that you can

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.550 
of time and that's time that you can
afford<00:03:51.090> Internet<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.780> situation<00:03:52.380> where

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
afford Internet and a situation where

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.730 
afford Internet and a situation where
you<00:03:52.650> need<00:03:52.740> to<00:03:52.890> come<00:03:53.670> up<00:03:53.850> with<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> fast<00:03:54.740> creative

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
you need to come up with a fast creative

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.190 
you need to come up with a fast creative
idea<00:03:56.100> on<00:03:56.250> your<00:03:56.400> instrument<00:03:56.910> so<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.600> came<00:03:57.810> up

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
idea on your instrument so I came up

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.610 
idea on your instrument so I came up
with<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.830> simple<00:03:59.130> way<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.790> few<00:04:00.420> diagrams<00:04:00.690> here

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
with a simple way a few diagrams here

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.420 
with a simple way a few diagrams here
that<00:04:01.890> you're<00:04:01.980> gonna<00:04:02.070> have<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.370> memorize<00:04:02.930> now

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
that you're gonna have to memorize now

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.680 
that you're gonna have to memorize now
these<00:04:05.430> diagrams<00:04:05.940> there<00:04:06.240> are<00:04:06.300> four<00:04:06.510> different

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
these diagrams there are four different

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.810 
these diagrams there are four different
types<00:04:06.870> different<00:04:07.350> diagrams<00:04:08.100> that<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.370> came<00:04:08.610> up

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
types different diagrams that I came up

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.620 
types different diagrams that I came up
with<00:04:09.060> one<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.170> gonna<00:04:10.650> start<00:04:11.070> with<00:04:11.850> all<00:04:12.420> the

these<00:04:37.520> four<00:04:38.520> diagrams<00:04:38.900> memorized<00:04:39.900> you'll<00:04:40.290> be

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
these four diagrams memorized you'll be

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.170 
these four diagrams memorized you'll be
able<00:04:40.560> to<00:04:40.800> find<00:04:41.070> any<00:04:41.310> type<00:04:41.610> of<00:04:41.820> interval

able to find any type of interval

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.540 
able to find any type of interval
interval<00:04:42.480> right<00:04:43.200> away<00:04:43.530> because<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.980> have<00:04:44.130> you

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
interval right away because you have you

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.760 
interval right away because you have you
would<00:04:44.670> have<00:04:44.820> fat<00:04:45.120> spent<00:04:45.600> time<00:04:45.870> memorizing

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
would have fat spent time memorizing

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.170 
would have fat spent time memorizing
this<00:04:47.280> these<00:04:47.700> four<00:04:48.090> different<00:04:48.210> diagrams<00:04:49.040> now

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
this these four different diagrams now

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.020 
this these four different diagrams now
to<00:04:51.180> simplify<00:04:52.170> a<00:04:52.200> little<00:04:52.380> bit<00:04:52.760> visually<00:04:53.760> these

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
to simplify a little bit visually these

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.540 
to simplify a little bit visually these
diagrams<00:04:54.570> I<00:04:54.840> didn't<00:04:55.470> put<00:04:55.620> all<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.220> intervals

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
diagrams I didn't put all the intervals

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.150 
diagrams I didn't put all the intervals
on<00:04:56.790> there<00:04:57.080> what<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.110> did<00:04:58.380> is<00:04:58.560> just<00:04:58.890> write<00:04:59.130> down

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
on there what I did is just write down

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.750 
on there what I did is just write down
the<00:04:59.670> major<00:05:00.000> intervals<00:05:00.990> and<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:02.370> natural

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
the major intervals and the natural

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.320 
the major intervals and the natural
intervals<00:05:03.210> so<00:05:04.010> we<00:05:05.010> have<00:05:05.340> here<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.120> major

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
intervals so we have here the the major

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.070 
intervals so we have here the the major
second

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
second

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.350 
second
the<00:05:07.770> major<00:05:07.980> third<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.700> natural<00:05:09.060> fourth

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
the major third the natural fourth

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.850 
the major third the natural fourth
because<00:05:09.690> once<00:05:09.990> again<00:05:10.140> there<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.470> no<00:05:10.620> such

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
because once again there is no such

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.950 
because once again there is no such
thing<00:05:11.100> as<00:05:11.130> major<00:05:11.520> fourth<00:05:12.270> there's<00:05:12.690> just<00:05:12.900> a

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
thing as major fourth there's just a

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.130 
thing as major fourth there's just a
natural<00:05:13.080> fourth<00:05:13.500> natural<00:05:14.490> fifth<00:05:14.850> major<00:05:15.510> sixth

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
natural fourth natural fifth major sixth

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.120 
natural fourth natural fifth major sixth
and<00:05:16.430> major<00:05:17.430> seven<00:05:17.940> if<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:19.350> have<00:05:19.590> memorized

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
and major seven if you have memorized

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.490 
and major seven if you have memorized
these<00:05:20.460> intervals<00:05:21.450> there<00:05:21.840> you<00:05:22.140> can<00:05:22.320> just

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
these intervals there you can just

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.680 
these intervals there you can just
deduct<00:05:22.890> if<00:05:23.310> someone<00:05:23.820> asks<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.360> play<00:05:24.480> the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
deduct if someone asks you to play the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.340 
deduct if someone asks you to play the
minor<00:05:24.870> seventh<00:05:26.060> minor<00:05:27.060> is<00:05:27.450> a<00:05:27.840> smaller

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
minor seventh minor is a smaller

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.010 
minor seventh minor is a smaller
interval<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> major<00:05:29.610> interval<00:05:30.240> always

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
interval that the major interval always

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.340 
interval that the major interval always
you<00:05:31.950> just<00:05:32.220> go<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.610> your<00:05:32.790> major<00:05:33.150> seventh<00:05:34.080> for

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
you just go to your major seventh for

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.520 
you just go to your major seventh for
example<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:34.950> just<00:05:35.840> diminish<00:05:36.840> that<00:05:37.020> interval

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
example and just diminish that interval

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.530 
example and just diminish that interval
so<00:05:37.680> you're<00:05:37.800> gonna<00:05:37.890> reduce<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:39.090> distance

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
so you're gonna reduce the distance

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.890 
so you're gonna reduce the distance
between<00:05:39.750> these<00:05:40.020> two<00:05:40.290> notes<00:05:40.530> by<00:05:40.890> one<00:05:41.220> half-step

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
between these two notes by one half-step

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.890 
between these two notes by one half-step
in<00:05:42.900> order<00:05:43.230> to<00:05:43.350> get<00:05:43.500> that<00:05:43.650> minor<00:05:44.010> interval<00:05:45.000> same

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
in order to get that minor interval same

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.400 
in order to get that minor interval same
for<00:05:46.370> for<00:05:47.370> the<00:05:48.300> diminished<00:05:48.810> intervals<00:05:49.230> if

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
for for the diminished intervals if

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.680 
for for the diminished intervals if
someone<00:05:49.710> asks<00:05:50.100> you<00:05:50.280> to<00:05:50.460> play<00:05:50.700> a<00:05:50.940> diminished

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
someone asks you to play a diminished

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.610 
someone asks you to play a diminished
fourth<00:05:52.370> just<00:05:53.370> go<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.580> your<00:05:54.230> perfect<00:05:55.230> fourth

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
fourth just go to your perfect fourth

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.480 
fourth just go to your perfect fourth
and<00:05:56.540> reduce<00:05:57.540> diminish<00:05:58.410> that<00:05:58.590> interval<00:05:59.010> by<00:05:59.220> a

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
and reduce diminish that interval by a

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.290 
and reduce diminish that interval by a
half<00:05:59.760> step<00:06:00.170> which<00:06:01.170> is<00:06:01.200> one<00:06:01.470> fret<00:06:01.740> lower<00:06:02.300> if

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
half step which is one fret lower if

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.540 
half step which is one fret lower if
someone<00:06:03.630> asks<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.170> for<00:06:04.200> an<00:06:04.800> Augmented<00:06:05.340> fifth

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
someone asks you for an Augmented fifth

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.810
