00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.539 
motor side here so I started off I took
off<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.700> little<00:01:42.700> retainer<00:01:43.439> pin<00:01:44.439> thing<00:01:44.799> and<00:01:45.100> I

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
off the little retainer pin thing and I

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.190 
off the little retainer pin thing and I
was<00:01:45.700> able<00:01:45.969> to<00:01:45.999> get<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.329> belt<00:01:46.509> off<00:01:46.659> from<00:01:47.049> the

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
was able to get the belt off from the

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.560 
was able to get the belt off from the
motor<00:01:47.469> side<00:01:47.799> for<00:01:48.070> some<00:01:48.189> reason<00:01:48.549> it<00:01:48.880> came<00:01:49.390> off

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
motor side for some reason it came off

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.999 
motor side for some reason it came off
this<00:01:49.749> side<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> lot<00:01:50.200> easier

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.069 

so<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.850> get<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.060> the<00:01:59.240> pulleys<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.630> be<00:01:59.869> able<00:01:59.960> to

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
so to get to the pulleys to be able to

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.990 
so to get to the pulleys to be able to
put<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.320> new<00:02:00.500> belt<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:01.009> this<00:02:01.430> deck

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
put the new belt on this deck

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.760 
put the new belt on this deck
we<00:02:02.210> had<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.479> remove<00:02:02.630> some<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.170> these<00:02:03.320> control

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
we had to remove some of these control

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.649 
we had to remove some of these control
arms<00:02:03.799> that<00:02:04.189> are<00:02:04.219> in<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.490> way<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:05.270> come<00:02:05.450> that

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
arms that are in the way that come that

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.330 
arms that are in the way that come that
hold<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:05.990> deck<00:02:06.170> on<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.679> then<00:02:07.039> there's<00:02:07.189> also

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
hold the deck on and then there's also

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.790 
hold the deck on and then there's also
this<00:02:07.670> big<00:02:08.509> one<00:02:08.750> here<00:02:08.989> with<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.259> pin<00:02:09.500> through

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
this big one here with this pin through

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.790 
this big one here with this pin through
it<00:02:10.510> it<00:02:11.510> has<00:02:11.660> to<00:02:11.810> get<00:02:11.959> removed<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.530> don't<00:02:12.680> know

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
it it has to get removed I don't know

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.440 
it it has to get removed I don't know
exactly<00:02:13.099> what<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.340> call<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.760> but<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.090> can<00:02:14.239> see

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
exactly what you call it but you can see

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.449 
exactly what you call it but you can see
it<00:02:14.569> there<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:15.080> see<00:02:15.590> me<00:02:15.739> trying<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:16.130> remove

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
it there you see me trying to remove

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.540 
it there you see me trying to remove
that<00:02:17.269> big<00:02:17.599> basically<00:02:18.560> bushing<00:02:19.040> pin<00:02:19.310> that<00:02:19.519> goes

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
that big basically bushing pin that goes

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.390 
that big basically bushing pin that goes
through<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:21.349> these<00:02:21.470> all<00:02:21.860> come<00:02:22.099> off<00:02:22.130> pretty

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
through it and these all come off pretty

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.210 
through it and these all come off pretty
easy<00:02:22.730> except<00:02:23.150> for<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.450> one<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:24.500> would<00:02:24.680> some

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
easy except for that one that would some

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.030 
easy except for that one that would some
trickery<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:27.319> it<00:02:27.410> eventually<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:27.860> got

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
trickery to it but it eventually I got

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.520 
trickery to it but it eventually I got
it<00:02:28.220> off<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.840> once<00:02:29.989> you<00:02:30.049> get<00:02:30.170> all<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.410> stuff

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
it off so once you get all this stuff

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.720 
it off so once you get all this stuff
out<00:02:30.739> of<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.890> way<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.220> have<00:02:31.280> full<00:02:31.580> access

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
out of the way and you have full access

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.400 
out of the way and you have full access
to<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.090> pulleys<00:02:32.569> to<00:02:32.599> be<00:02:32.870> able<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.080> put<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.290> new

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
to the pulleys to be able to put the new

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.979 
to the pulleys to be able to put the new
belt<00:02:33.590> on<00:02:34.150> basically<00:02:35.150> got<00:02:35.390> to<00:02:35.510> find<00:02:35.720> out<00:02:35.870> the

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
belt on basically got to find out the

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.949 
belt on basically got to find out the
routing<00:02:36.470> that<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.549> belt<00:02:37.760> goes<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.329> if<00:02:38.810> you're

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
routing that the belt goes and if you're

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.509 
routing that the belt goes and if you're
all<00:02:39.079> about<00:02:39.170> broke<00:02:39.590> it's<00:02:39.920> not<00:02:40.099> going<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.400> too

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
all about broke it's not going to be too

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.400 
all about broke it's not going to be too
obvious<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.030> what<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> had<00:02:41.569> to<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:41.810> at<00:02:41.989> googled

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
obvious so what I had to do at googled

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.670 
obvious so what I had to do at googled
the<00:02:43.370> schematic<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.900> model<00:02:45.200> number<00:02:45.500> of

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the schematic for it the model number of

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.800 
the schematic for it the model number of
this<00:02:45.860> mower<00:02:46.099> just<00:02:46.519> Google<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.970> usually<00:02:47.720> will

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
this mower just Google that usually will

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.030 
this mower just Google that usually will
come<00:02:47.840> up<00:02:48.110> with<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.440> picture<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:48.860> might<00:02:48.920> have

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
come up with the picture you might have

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.660 
come up with the picture you might have
to<00:02:49.160> look<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.489> little<00:02:49.579> bit<00:02:50.110> I<00:02:51.110> did<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:52.040> will<00:02:52.549> admit

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
to look a little bit I did I will admit

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.250 
to look a little bit I did I will admit
I<00:02:52.849> did<00:02:53.120> kind<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.599> try<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.840> do<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.140> at<00:02:54.230> first

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
I did kind of just try to do it at first

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.020 
I did kind of just try to do it at first
before<00:02:54.829> looking<00:02:55.010> at<00:02:55.099> that<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.579> I<00:02:55.670> got<00:02:55.849> pretty

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
before looking at that and I got pretty

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.270 
before looking at that and I got pretty
close<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.810> eventually<00:02:57.019> got<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.380> right<00:02:57.590> but

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
close and I eventually got it right but

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.220 
close and I eventually got it right but
the<00:02:58.400> belt<00:02:58.579> I<00:02:58.700> got<00:02:58.970> originally<00:02:59.569> was<00:02:59.750> like<00:02:59.959> two

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
the belt I got originally was like two

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.170 
the belt I got originally was like two
inches<00:03:00.560> too<00:03:00.769> short<00:03:00.799> so<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.310> had<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.489> return<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.819> I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
inches too short so I had to return it I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.300 
inches too short so I had to return it I
did<00:03:02.780> get<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.930> hundred<00:03:03.139> inch<00:03:03.470> belt<00:03:03.680> instead<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.280> a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
did get a hundred inch belt instead of a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.090 
did get a hundred inch belt instead of a
98<00:03:04.730> inch<00:03:04.970> one<00:03:05.359> and<00:03:05.840> believing<00:03:06.829> about<00:03:06.889> the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
98 inch one and believing about the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.590 
98 inch one and believing about the
belts<00:03:07.340> when<00:03:07.430> tractor<00:03:07.730> supply<00:03:07.850> there<00:03:08.329> like<00:03:08.450> an

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
belts when tractor supply there like an

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.960 
belts when tractor supply there like an
inch<00:03:08.810> under<00:03:09.230> what<00:03:09.380> they<00:03:09.500> say<00:03:09.709> they<00:03:09.889> are<00:03:09.970> but

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
inch under what they say they are but

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.460 
inch under what they say they are but
either<00:03:11.120> way<00:03:11.299> the<00:03:11.450> hundred<00:03:11.720> inch<00:03:11.870> belt<00:03:12.139> worked

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
either way the hundred inch belt worked

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.680 
either way the hundred inch belt worked
on<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:13.670> one<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:16.549> worked<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:16.850> fine<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.510> so<00:03:17.569> I

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
on this one it worked just fine and so I

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.090 
on this one it worked just fine and so I
didn't<00:03:17.959> think<00:03:18.139> these<00:03:18.290> had<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.560> tensioner

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
didn't think these had a tensioner

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.860 
didn't think these had a tensioner
pulley<00:03:19.370> but<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.790> one<00:03:19.970> idle<00:03:20.359> pulley<00:03:20.600> is<00:03:20.840> a

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
pulley but the one idle pulley is a

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.479 
pulley but the one idle pulley is a
tensioner<00:03:21.380> pulley<00:03:21.620> what<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:21.980> had<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.160> do<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.400> get

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
tensioner pulley what I had to do to get

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.090 
tensioner pulley what I had to do to get
about<00:03:22.730> on<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:22.910> did<00:03:23.239> take<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:24.170> one<00:03:24.440> basically

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
about on I did take the one basically

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.150 
about on I did take the one basically
idle<00:03:25.910> pulley<00:03:26.120> off<00:03:26.359> and<00:03:26.930> force<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.739> belt<00:03:27.950> on

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
idle pulley off and force the belt on

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.849 
idle pulley off and force the belt on
there<00:03:28.489> however<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.359> will<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.569> on<00:03:29.600> there<00:03:30.019> but

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
there however it will go on there but

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.470 
there however it will go on there but
basically<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.370> one<00:03:31.519> pulley<00:03:31.819> is<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.060> tension

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
basically the one pulley is a tension

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.480 
basically the one pulley is a tension
our<00:03:32.720> pulley<00:03:32.900> so<00:03:33.139> look<00:03:33.290> up<00:03:33.410> for<00:03:33.590> that

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:51.650
