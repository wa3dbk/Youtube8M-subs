00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
if you could compare a line of Corvettes

if you could compare a line of Corvettes
driving<00:00:12.030> up<00:00:12.300> highway<00:00:12.660> 1<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.500> they're<00:00:14.130> all

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.120 

getting<00:00:17.940> their<00:00:18.120> engine<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.780> then<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.890> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
getting their engine and then you see a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.190 
getting their engine and then you see a
line<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.550> Tesla's<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.720> still<00:00:22.020> hear

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
line of Tesla's and you can still hear

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.830 
line of Tesla's and you can still hear
the<00:00:22.350> birds<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.830> ocean<00:00:23.370> and<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.690> the

the birds in the ocean and you see the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.430 
the birds in the ocean and you see the
cars<00:00:25.050> moving<00:00:25.440> but<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.860> don't<00:00:26.070> hear<00:00:26.340> anything

I<00:00:27.500> think<00:00:28.130> that's<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:28.430> big<00:00:28.640> statement<00:00:28.940> right

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720

eyes my auditory sense with the Tesla I

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.230 
eyes my auditory sense with the Tesla I
almost<00:01:09.720> feel<00:01:10.050> like<00:01:10.230> it<00:01:10.590> becomes<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.430> living

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240

kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.320> extension<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.100> myself<00:01:14.340> which<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.880> a

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
kind of extension of myself which is a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.880 
kind of extension of myself which is a
very<00:01:15.330> hard<00:01:15.900> thing<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.290> into<00:01:16.410> words<00:01:16.680> but

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
very hard thing to put into words but

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
very hard thing to put into words but
it's<00:01:17.280> something<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.730> you<00:01:17.790> really<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.090> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's something that you really have to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.620 
it's something that you really have to
feel<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:19.710> common<00:01:20.130> experience<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:20.760> all<00:01:21.510> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
feel the common experience for all the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.370 
feel the common experience for all the
passengers<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.350> car<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.860> holy<00:01:23.190> crap

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.340 

it's<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.490> how<00:01:32.820> fast<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.659> car<00:01:33.869> goes<00:01:34.110> because

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it's not how fast the car goes because

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
it's not how fast the car goes because
every<00:01:34.650> car<00:01:34.860> goes<00:01:35.070> fast<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
every car goes fast you just have to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.660 
every car goes fast you just have to
step<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> accelerator<00:01:37.009> it's<00:01:38.009> how<00:01:38.220> fast

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
step on the accelerator it's how fast

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.170 
step on the accelerator it's how fast
you<00:01:39.630> get<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.080> go<00:01:40.200> fast<00:01:40.560> every<00:01:41.549> time<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.940> step

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you get it to go fast every time I step

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.320 
you get it to go fast every time I step
on<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.600> paddle<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.650> not<00:01:43.890> sheer<00:01:44.159> joy<00:01:44.369> it's

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
on it or paddle it not sheer joy it's

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.420 
on it or paddle it not sheer joy it's
more<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.750> pushing<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:46.229> elevator<00:01:46.560> button<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
more like pushing an elevator button and

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.880 
more like pushing an elevator button and
Africa<00:01:47.820> lies<00:01:48.000> before<00:01:48.479> almost<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.350> gene<00:01:49.680> of

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
Africa lies before almost a gene of

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.539 
Africa lies before almost a gene of
acceleration<00:01:50.640> off<00:01:50.789> a<00:01:50.820> stoplight<00:01:51.440> it's

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
acceleration off a stoplight it's

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.490 
acceleration off a stoplight it's
impossible<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.729> describe<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.360> anyone<00:01:54.810> what

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
impossible to describe to anyone what

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.399 
impossible to describe to anyone what
maximum<00:01:56.070> torque<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.850> zero<00:01:57.330> rpm<00:01:57.630> feels<00:01:58.170> like

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
maximum torque and zero rpm feels like

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:09.350 
maximum torque and zero rpm feels like
it's<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.220> roller<00:01:59.430> coaster<00:01:59.520> without<00:02:00.210> rails

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.730 

it's<00:02:09.540> a<00:02:09.660> feeling<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.960> have<00:02:10.020> inside<00:02:10.260> that<00:02:10.440> you

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
it's a feeling you have inside that you

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.610 
it's a feeling you have inside that you
know<00:02:10.860> you're<00:02:11.010> doing<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.430> might<00:02:12.060> happen<00:02:12.270> but

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
know you're doing to it might happen but

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.320 
know you're doing to it might happen but
most<00:02:13.620> electric<00:02:14.100> cars<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.670> lane

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
most electric cars just lane

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.790 
most electric cars just lane
like<00:02:15.510> they<00:02:15.660> wouldn't<00:02:15.900> leave<00:02:15.990> three<00:02:16.560> wheel

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
like they wouldn't leave three wheel

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.740 
like they wouldn't leave three wheel
bubble<00:02:17.430> things<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.000> were<00:02:18.120> slow<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.690> just

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
bubble things that were slow and just

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.600 
bubble things that were slow and just
kind<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.050> silly<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.980> nothing<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.430> whatever

one<00:02:20.910> five<00:02:21.210> what<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.690> love<00:02:21.870> about<00:02:22.020> Tesla<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:23.100> that

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
one five what I love about Tesla is that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.680 
one five what I love about Tesla is that
they<00:02:23.340> turn<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.850> perception<00:02:24.300> up<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.570> that

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
they turn that perception up like that

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230 
they turn that perception up like that
and<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:25.200> electric<00:02:25.560> cars<00:02:25.830> are<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.790> fastest

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
and that electric cars are the fastest

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.870 
and that electric cars are the fastest
and<00:02:27.480> most<00:02:27.510> desirable
