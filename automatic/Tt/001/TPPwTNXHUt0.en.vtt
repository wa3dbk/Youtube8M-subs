vinegar apple vinegar from France very
good<00:02:28.140> quality<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.830> should<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.250> unclear<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.209> it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
good quality it should be unclear and it

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.840 
good quality it should be unclear and it
should<00:02:30.690> have<00:02:30.959> some<00:02:31.200> like<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.160> neck<00:02:32.520> here

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
should have some like a like a neck here

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.570 
should have some like a like a neck here
so<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.630> means<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.020> it's<00:02:34.560> real<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.459> not

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
so it means that it's real it's not

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.570 
so it means that it's real it's not

artificial it's not chemically made so

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.180 
artificial it's not chemically made so

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
cause of vinegar is making his quinoa

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.240 
cause of vinegar is making his quinoa
dry<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.820> we<00:03:48.060> put<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.420> oil<00:03:48.660> because<00:03:49.290> oil<00:03:49.500> make

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
dry so we put the oil because oil make

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.509 
dry so we put the oil because oil make
the<00:03:50.489> skin<00:03:50.730> moisture<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.570> then<00:03:52.200> vinegar<00:03:53.190> make

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
the skin moisture and then vinegar make

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.300 
the skin moisture and then vinegar make
this<00:03:53.700> kid<00:03:54.000> more<00:03:54.299> clear<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.850> 20<00:03:56.850> 25<00:03:57.450> so<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.500> we

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
this kid more clear and 20 25 so and we

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.580 
this kid more clear and 20 25 so and we
can<00:03:59.519> use<00:03:59.790> for<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.209> whole<00:04:00.540> body<00:04:00.989> very
