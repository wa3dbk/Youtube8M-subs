00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
reboot into safe mode with networking to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.150 
reboot into safe mode with networking to
see<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.460> remove<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.789> from<00:00:26.910> there<00:00:28.160> okay

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
see if we can remove it from there okay

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.009 
see if we can remove it from there okay
so<00:00:29.220> I've<00:00:29.400> been<00:00:29.519> tapping<00:00:29.760> FA<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.599> keyboard

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
so I've been tapping FA on the keyboard

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.639 
so I've been tapping FA on the keyboard
to<00:00:31.679> enter<00:00:31.830> safe<00:00:32.250> mode<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.550> networking<00:00:32.730> and

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
to enter safe mode with networking and

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.229 
to enter safe mode with networking and
this<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:34.860> give<00:00:35.040> us<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> options<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this will give us the options for the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
this will give us the options for the
Advanced<00:00:36.600> Boot<00:00:36.780> Options<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.160> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
Advanced Boot Options here so what I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.770 
Advanced Boot Options here so what I
want<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.210> safe<00:00:39.480> mode<00:00:39.750> with

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
want to do is go safe mode with

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.869 
want to do is go safe mode with
networking<00:00:42.739> let<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.860> boot<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:46.820> okay<00:00:47.820> so

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
networking let this boot up okay so

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.060 
networking let this boot up okay so
let's<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.480> booting<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.680> somebody's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
let's now booting in now somebody's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
let's now booting in now somebody's
around<00:00:50.160> somewheres<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.969> pretty<00:00:51.270> tricky

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
around somewheres can be pretty tricky

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.229 
around somewheres can be pretty tricky
to<00:00:51.870> remove<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.770> some<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> them<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:53.789> easy

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
to remove and some of them are very easy

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.000 
to remove and some of them are very easy
to<00:00:54.360> remove<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:56.730> easier<00:00:57.090> ones<00:00:57.300> obviously<00:00:58.010> as

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
to remove that easier ones obviously as

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.709 
to remove that easier ones obviously as
you<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.550> one<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.090> booting<00:01:00.420> into

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you can see this one is now booting into

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.260 
you can see this one is now booting into
safe<00:01:01.649> mobile<00:01:02.010> networking<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.760> stop<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.120> from

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
safe mobile networking to stop you from

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.920 
safe mobile networking to stop you from
getting<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.790> case<00:01:06.090> you've

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
getting in there so in this case you've

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
getting in there so in this case you've
got<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> couple<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.530> options<00:01:07.650> open<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.310> can

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
got a couple of options open to you can

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.359 
got a couple of options open to you can
try<00:01:08.790> command<00:01:09.150> prompt<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.659> will<00:01:09.780> try<00:01:09.960> now

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
try command prompt which I will try now

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.039 
try command prompt which I will try now
but<00:01:11.369> you've<00:01:11.549> also<00:01:11.700> got<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.299> codes<00:01:12.780> here

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
but you've also got these codes here

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.840 
but you've also got these codes here
that<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.470> enter<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.430> trouble<00:01:14.760> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that you can enter in the trouble is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.609 
that you can enter in the trouble is
there's<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.299> many<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.689> these<00:01:15.780> coming<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
there's so many of these coming out a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.100 
there's so many of these coming out a
high<00:01:16.979> rate<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.280> knots<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:18.360> hard<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> keep<00:01:18.869> up

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
high rate of knots it's hard to keep up

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.080 
high rate of knots it's hard to keep up
so<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.860> easiest<00:01:20.400> way<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.850> get

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so I think easiest way is just to get

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.640 
so I think easiest way is just to get
rid<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> them<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.600> delete<00:01:21.840> them<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.380> can

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
rid of them and delete them now you can

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.630 
rid of them and delete them now you can
use<00:01:22.860> Kaspersky's<00:01:23.700> bootable<00:01:24.509> rescue<00:01:24.990> CD<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
use Kaspersky's bootable rescue CD and

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.800 
use Kaspersky's bootable rescue CD and
boot<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.820> there<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.210> they've<00:01:27.330> got<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.570> nice

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
boot in there and they've got a nice

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
boot in there and they've got a nice
little<00:01:28.080> tool<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.409> removes<00:01:28.950> these<00:01:29.670> types<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
little tool that removes these types of

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.569 
little tool that removes these types of
her<00:01:30.450> ransoms<00:01:31.020> okay<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> will<00:01:32.070> make<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> video

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
her ransoms okay and I will make a video

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.109 
her ransoms okay and I will make a video
on<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.939> for<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:33.990> rebooted<00:01:34.470> system

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
on that for you so this rebooted system

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.280 
on that for you so this rebooted system
okay<00:01:36.119> something<00:01:36.450> tapping<00:01:36.780> f8<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
okay something tapping f8 on the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
okay something tapping f8 on the
keyboard<00:01:37.650> again<00:01:37.740> Last<00:01:38.340> Chance<00:01:38.460> Saloon<00:01:38.790> for

keyboard again Last Chance Saloon for
this<00:01:39.210> one<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.659> we're<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.140> safe

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
this one and we're going to go to safe

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.990 
this one and we're going to go to safe
mode<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:40.890> command<00:01:41.100> prompt<00:01:46.610> okay<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.670> that's

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
mode with command prompt okay so that's

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.960 
mode with command prompt okay so that's
just<00:01:48.090> booting<00:01:48.509> into<00:01:49.369> safe<00:01:50.369> mode<00:01:50.399> command

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
just booting into safe mode command

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.289 
just booting into safe mode command
prompt<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:53.070> seen<00:01:53.369> these<00:01:53.579> types<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
prompt now I have seen these types of

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.819 
prompt now I have seen these types of
ransoms<00:01:54.780> running<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.320> safe<00:01:55.560> mode<00:01:55.799> with

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
ransoms running in safe mode with

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
ransoms running in safe mode with
command<00:01:55.979> prompt<00:01:56.520> as<00:01:56.640> well<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:57.630> you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
command prompt as well then you

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.249 
command prompt as well then you
definitely<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.409> live<00:01:58.740> CDs<00:01:59.219> or<00:01:59.520> bootable<00:02:00.259> CD

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
definitely use live CDs or bootable CD

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.889 
definitely use live CDs or bootable CD
environments<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.310> rid<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> them<00:02:02.759> ok<00:02:03.270> but

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
environments to get rid of them ok but

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
environments to get rid of them ok but
some<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.229> them<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.560> just<00:02:05.420> pretty<00:02:06.420> simple<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
start adding files in locations like in

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.190 
start adding files in locations like in
your<00:02:49.440> C<00:02:49.709> Drive<00:02:50.040> in<00:02:50.400> programs<00:02:51.239> that<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.660> places

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
your C Drive in programs that on places

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.949 
your C Drive in programs that on places
like<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.760> Neronian<00:02:54.180> folder<00:02:54.630> but

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
like that in the Neronian folder but

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.800 
like that in the Neronian folder but
this<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:55.320> doesn't<00:02:55.530> seem<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.390> do<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.420> so

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
this one doesn't seem to do that so

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.240 
this one doesn't seem to do that so
we're<00:02:57.989> gonna<00:02:58.110> do<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.440> quickly<00:02:58.709> reboot<00:02:59.160> a

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
and hopefully that will be the end of
