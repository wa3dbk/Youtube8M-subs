I<00:01:36.720> got<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.990> defense<00:01:37.320> drop<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.799> he's<00:01:38.040> gonna

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
I got the defense drop I know he's gonna

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.950 
I got the defense drop I know he's gonna
switch<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.060> gonna<00:01:39.150> proceed<00:01:39.509> trapping<00:01:39.869> him

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
switch so I'm gonna proceed trapping him

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.289 
switch so I'm gonna proceed trapping him
again<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.159> gonna<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.610> an<00:01:41.729> early<00:01:42.030> 6th

he shows me he's a relatively specialty
based<00:01:51.509> set<00:01:52.229> um<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.680> don't<00:01:52.740> know<00:01:53.040> he's<00:01:53.399> mixed<00:01:53.790> or

not<00:01:54.030> or<00:01:54.299> choice<00:01:54.689> specs<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.860> I'm<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.549> gonna

bring<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.210> socket<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.259> can

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
bring in my socket because I know I can

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.190 
bring in my socket because I know I can
take<00:01:58.590> at<00:01:58.710> least<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.070> hit<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.990> gonna

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
take at least one hit and I'm gonna

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.649 
take at least one hit and I'm gonna
actually<00:02:01.469> double<00:02:01.950> switch<00:02:02.189> predicting<00:02:02.759> him<00:02:02.969> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
actually double switch predicting him to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.980 
actually double switch predicting him to
bring<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.649> his<00:02:04.740> tangle<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.280> guess<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.880> did<00:02:06.840> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
bring in his tangle I guess I did that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.169 
bring in his tangle I guess I did that
to<00:02:07.229> bait<00:02:07.439> his<00:02:07.710> tangela<00:02:08.250> but<00:02:08.759> at<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.119> moment

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to bait his tangela but at this moment

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.150 
to bait his tangela but at this moment
in<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> battle<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.200> forgot<00:02:10.619> he<00:02:10.770> had<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> light

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
in the battle I forgot he had the light

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.440 
in the battle I forgot he had the light
screen<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.690> thought

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
screen up so I thought

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.790 
screen up so I thought
this<00:02:13.660> fire<00:02:13.870> blast<00:02:14.110> would<00:02:14.260> take<00:02:14.410> him<00:02:14.590> out<00:02:14.680> in

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
this fire blast would take him out in

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.820 
this fire blast would take him out in
one<00:02:14.830> hit<00:02:14.980> however<00:02:15.490> it<00:02:16.000> doesn't<00:02:16.300> work<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.480> way

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
one hit however it doesn't work that way

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.010 
one hit however it doesn't work that way
it<00:02:17.830> only<00:02:17.950> does<00:02:18.160> half<00:02:18.400> because<00:02:18.819> he<00:02:19.240> did<00:02:19.480> get

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
it only does half because he did get

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.830 
it only does half because he did get
that<00:02:20.170> special<00:02:20.440> defense<00:02:21.370> raise<00:02:22.150> for<00:02:22.480> his<00:02:22.569> team

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
that special defense raise for his team

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.020 
that special defense raise for his team
with<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.230> light<00:02:23.380> screen<00:02:23.650> so<00:02:23.980> he<00:02:24.370> does<00:02:24.550> get<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
with the light screen so he does get the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.480 
with the light screen so he does get the
sleep<00:02:25.690> powder<00:02:25.870> thankfully<00:02:26.800> he<00:02:26.920> didn't<00:02:27.190> go<00:02:27.280> for

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
sleep powder thankfully he didn't go for

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.370 
sleep powder thankfully he didn't go for
the<00:02:27.520> hidden<00:02:27.760> power<00:02:27.910> ice<00:02:28.000> if<00:02:28.390> he<00:02:28.480> has<00:02:28.690> it<00:02:28.900> I'm

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
the hidden power ice if he has it I'm

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.840 
the hidden power ice if he has it I'm
pretty<00:02:29.680> sure<00:02:29.830> he<00:02:29.980> doesn't<00:02:30.010> because<00:02:30.580> he<00:02:30.700> acts

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
pretty sure he doesn't because he acts

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.030 
pretty sure he doesn't because he acts
he<00:02:30.970> switches<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.570> turn<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.620> he<00:02:32.920> actually

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
he switches this turn so he actually

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.310 
he switches this turn so he actually
brings<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.640> Linoone<00:02:34.000> now<00:02:34.570> I<00:02:34.600> make<00:02:35.110> a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
brings in the Linoone now I make a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.730 
brings in the Linoone now I make a
series<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.860> missplay<00:02:36.480> after<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
series of missplay after this like the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.990 
series of missplay after this like the
really<00:02:38.980> good<00:02:39.100> predictions<00:02:39.550> were<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
really good predictions were in the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.610 
really good predictions were in the
beginning<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.540> match<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:40.989> now<00:02:41.200> here

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
beginning of the match and now here

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.650 
beginning of the match and now here
comes<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.920> really<00:02:42.070> bad<00:02:42.250> prediction<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.910> should

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
comes the really bad prediction I should

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.510 
comes the really bad prediction I should
run<00:02:43.810> for<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.020> megahorn<00:02:44.440> here<00:02:44.770> because<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
run for the megahorn here because the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.610 
run for the megahorn here because the
tangle<00:02:45.880> of<00:02:45.970> switch<00:02:46.209> was<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> very<00:02:46.989> very<00:02:47.290> obvious

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
tangle of switch was a very very obvious

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.190 
tangle of switch was a very very obvious
I<00:02:48.239> went<00:02:49.239> for<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.420> waterfall<00:02:49.870> because<00:02:50.080> I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
I went for the waterfall because I

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.290 
I went for the waterfall because I
needed<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.739> hit<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.070> Linoone<00:02:51.519> in<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.150> case

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
needed to hit that Linoone in the case

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.970 
needed to hit that Linoone in the case
that<00:02:52.450> he<00:02:52.600> wanted<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.050> set<00:02:53.260> up<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.500> belly<00:02:53.739> drum

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
that he wanted to set up a belly drum

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.210 
that he wanted to set up a belly drum
and<00:02:54.310> actually<00:02:55.180> waterfall<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.980> megahorn<00:02:56.980> had

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
and actually waterfall and megahorn had

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.570 
and actually waterfall and megahorn had
the<00:02:57.340> same<00:02:57.519> base<00:02:57.790> power<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.810> mega<00:02:59.440> form<00:02:59.769> mecca

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
the same base power so mega form mecca

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.729 
the same base power so mega form mecca
for<00:03:00.670> megahorn<00:03:01.510> would<00:03:01.810> have<00:03:01.900> been<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.290> better

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
for megahorn would have been a better

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.410 
for megahorn would have been a better
choice<00:03:02.860> and<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.760> really<00:03:04.030> should<00:03:04.180> have<00:03:04.209> done

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
choice and I really should have done

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.160 
choice and I really should have done
that<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.870> thought<00:03:05.410> about<00:03:05.530> doing<00:03:05.650> it<00:03:06.130> but<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.519> just

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
that I thought about doing it but I just

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.750 
that I thought about doing it but I just
pressed<00:03:08.170> waterfall<00:03:08.650> instead<00:03:09.070> and<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.400> kind<00:03:09.730> of

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
pressed waterfall instead and I kind of

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.930 
pressed waterfall instead and I kind of
regretted<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.360> immediately<00:03:11.580> after<00:03:12.580> I<00:03:12.610> press

can go for the haze and that would have
been<00:04:21.729> pretty<00:04:21.910> epic<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.390> see<00:04:23.550> but<00:04:24.550> he<00:04:24.760> actually

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
been pretty epic to see but he actually

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.920 
been pretty epic to see but he actually
brings<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.419> his<00:04:25.539> Sam

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
brings in his Sam

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.200 
brings in his Sam
here<00:04:26.110> now<00:04:26.370> he<00:04:27.370> went<00:04:27.490> for<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.669> ice<00:04:27.820> beam<00:04:28.030> that

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
here now he went for the ice beam that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.900 
here now he went for the ice beam that
does<00:04:28.360> a<00:04:28.389> lot<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.720> damage<00:04:29.100> at<00:04:30.100> this<00:04:30.400> moment<00:04:30.639> I

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
does a lot of damage at this moment I

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.510 
does a lot of damage at this moment I
thought<00:04:31.270> he<00:04:31.389> was<00:04:31.509> choice<00:04:31.780> specs<00:04:32.080> but<00:04:32.979> I<00:04:33.039> wasn't

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
thought he was choice specs but I wasn't

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.790 
thought he was choice specs but I wasn't
100%<00:04:33.940> sure<00:04:34.300> because<00:04:34.630> my<00:04:34.810> damage<00:04:35.229> calculator

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
100% sure because my damage calculator

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.560 
100% sure because my damage calculator
was<00:04:36.280> offline<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:37.770> my<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:39.430> guess<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.270> should<00:04:40.449> have

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
was offline so my I guess I should have

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.779 
was offline so my I guess I should have
followed<00:04:40.720> my<00:04:40.960> intuition<00:04:41.280> should<00:04:42.280> have<00:04:42.400> known

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
followed my intuition should have known

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.080 
followed my intuition should have known
he<00:04:42.970> was<00:04:43.000> choice<00:04:43.300> specs<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:43.900> if<00:04:44.259> I<00:04:44.699> was<00:04:45.699> 100%

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
he was choice specs and if I was 100%

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.490 
he was choice specs and if I was 100%
sure<00:04:46.539> I<00:04:46.720> would<00:04:46.900> have<00:04:46.990> went<00:04:47.050> for<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.320> stealth

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
sure I would have went for the stealth

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.529 
sure I would have went for the stealth
rocks<00:04:47.800> here<00:04:48.190> but<00:04:48.639> I<00:04:48.669> actually<00:04:48.880> went<00:04:49.120> for<00:04:49.389> the

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
rocks here but I actually went for the

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.420 
rocks here but I actually went for the
rock<00:04:49.720> blast<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.380> was<00:04:50.470> a<00:04:50.500> very<00:04:50.860> bad<00:04:51.160> play

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
rock blast so that was a very bad play

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.999 
rock blast so that was a very bad play
on<00:04:51.580> my<00:04:51.729> part<00:04:52.030> because<00:04:52.380> he<00:04:53.380> does<00:04:53.620> have<00:04:53.860> that

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
on my part because he does have that

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.189 
on my part because he does have that
sock<00:04:54.400> which<00:04:54.669> I<00:04:54.850> totally<00:04:55.120> forget<00:04:55.630> has<00:04:55.870> dirty

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
sock which I totally forget has dirty

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.080 
sock which I totally forget has dirty
and<00:04:56.580> I<00:04:57.580> actually<00:04:58.479> forget<00:04:58.960> he<00:04:59.349> has<00:04:59.470> 30<00:04:59.740> almost

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
and I actually forget he has 30 almost

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.790 
and I actually forget he has 30 almost
twice<00:05:01.090> in<00:05:01.300> this<00:05:01.389> battle<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.990> forgot<00:05:02.620> he<00:05:02.680> gets

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
talking about he takes me out with the

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:11.040 
talking about he takes me out with the
close<00:05:09.039> combat<00:05:09.340> I'm<00:05:09.669> fine<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.150> do<00:05:10.210> have<00:05:10.479> alt<00:05:10.690> area

and<00:05:11.289> execute<00:05:11.740> or<00:05:11.889> to<00:05:12.009> resist<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.370> hit<00:05:12.669> but

and execute or to resist that hit but
I'm<00:05:13.870> pretty<00:05:14.020> sure<00:05:14.110> they<00:05:14.410> both<00:05:14.620> can't<00:05:14.949> take<00:05:15.190> to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.360 
I'm pretty sure they both can't take to
bandit<00:05:16.000> attacks<00:05:16.449> so<00:05:17.139> I<00:05:17.169> leave<00:05:17.440> my<00:05:17.470> Bastille

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.620 
here that would have been the much
better<00:05:31.870> play<00:05:32.199> but<00:05:32.560> um<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.250> didn't<00:05:33.639> although

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
did a lot of bad I guess predictions at

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.740 
did a lot of bad I guess predictions at
that<00:05:53.320> near<00:05:53.710> end<00:05:53.949> of<00:05:54.099> the<00:05:54.220> battle<00:05:54.520> and<00:05:54.750> that

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
that near end of the battle and that

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.560 
that near end of the battle and that
does<00:05:55.990> cost<00:05:56.320> me<00:05:56.560> the<00:05:56.770> match<00:05:57.070> so<00:05:57.460> yeah<00:05:58.090> he<00:05:58.360> is

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
does cost me the match so yeah he is

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.140 
does cost me the match so yeah he is
gonna<00:05:58.810> pretty<00:05:59.169> much<00:05:59.380> clean<00:05:59.949> up<00:06:00.340> with<00:06:00.909> this

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
gonna pretty much clean up with this

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.960 
gonna pretty much clean up with this
stock<00:06:01.500> as<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.770> last<00:06:03.009> minute<00:06:03.340> desperate<00:06:03.759> move

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
stock as the last minute desperate move

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.390 
stock as the last minute desperate move
I<00:06:04.210> actually<00:06:04.360> go<00:06:04.659> for<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:05.199> rest<00:06:05.650> here<00:06:06.039> I'm

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
I actually go for the rest here I'm

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.339 
I actually go for the rest here I'm
thinking<00:06:07.000> I<00:06:07.180> might<00:06:07.479> be<00:06:07.630> able<00:06:07.720> to<00:06:07.840> stall<00:06:08.110> him

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
thinking I might be able to stall him

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:10.230 
thinking I might be able to stall him
out<00:06:08.560> if<00:06:08.800> close-combat<00:06:09.310> does<00:06:09.610> less<00:06:09.820> than<00:06:09.940> 50%

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
out if close-combat does less than 50%

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.969 
out if close-combat does less than 50%
against<00:06:11.020> my<00:06:11.110> Altaria<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.919> then<00:06:12.669> I<00:06:13.800> may<00:06:14.800> have<00:06:14.830> a

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
against my Altaria and then I may have a

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.290 
against my Altaria and then I may have a
chance<00:06:15.190> of<00:06:15.340> winning<00:06:15.430> but<00:06:15.759> looking<00:06:16.090> at<00:06:16.180> that

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
chance of winning but looking at that

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.180 
chance of winning but looking at that
damage<00:06:16.509> close<00:06:17.020> combat<00:06:17.289> is<00:06:17.560> gonna<00:06:17.710> be<00:06:17.830> a<00:06:17.860> solid
