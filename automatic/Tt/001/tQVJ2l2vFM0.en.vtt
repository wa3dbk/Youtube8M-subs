in<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> game<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.430> think<00:01:41.579> there's<00:01:41.790> any

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
in the game I don't think there's any

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.149 
in the game I don't think there's any
blocks<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> can't<00:01:43.079> do<00:01:43.259> pieces<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
blocks that you can't do pieces of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
blocks that you can't do pieces of
carpet<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.880> also<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.210> pieces<00:01:45.479> of<00:01:45.570> carpet

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
because I have no idea how to do that

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.179 
because I have no idea how to do that
and<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.349> I<00:02:51.379> don't<00:02:51.620> even<00:02:51.799> know<00:02:51.950> where<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.129> get

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
and I I don't even know where to get

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.409 
and I I don't even know where to get
started<00:02:52.310> because<00:02:52.639> these<00:02:52.760> blocks<00:02:53.060> are<00:02:53.239> so

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
started because these blocks are so

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.869 
started because these blocks are so
small<00:02:53.750> like<00:02:54.139> it's<00:02:54.349> crazy<00:02:54.650> like<00:02:55.159> it<00:02:55.639> would<00:02:55.760> take

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
small like it's crazy like it would take

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.369 
small like it's crazy like it would take
me<00:02:56.060> forever<00:02:56.299> to<00:02:56.480> do<00:02:56.629> something<00:02:56.900> like<00:02:57.019> that<00:02:57.200> but

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
me forever to do something like that but

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:58.629 
me forever to do something like that but
I<00:02:57.470> think<00:02:57.530> it<00:02:57.739> would<00:02:57.829> be<00:02:57.919> really<00:02:58.069> awesome<00:02:58.280> if<00:02:58.519> we

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
I think it would be really awesome if we

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.460 
I think it would be really awesome if we
