right<00:00:16.070> this<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.940> quick<00:00:18.390> review<00:00:18.890> this<00:00:19.890> kit

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
right this is a quick review this kit

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.070 
right this is a quick review this kit
this<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.070> very<00:00:23.369> good<00:00:23.580> beginner<00:00:24.000> jet<00:00:24.810> car

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
this is a very good beginner jet car

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.429 
this is a very good beginner jet car
because<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.240> easy<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> assemble<00:00:27.810> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
because it's very easy to assemble and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.189 
because it's very easy to assemble and
there's<00:00:28.830> lots<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.730> different<00:00:30.179> hop-up<00:00:30.480> parts

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
there's lots of different hop-up parts

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.569 
there's lots of different hop-up parts
you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.219> use<00:00:32.600> as<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.840> tell<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.980> few

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
you can use as you can tell I have a few

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.920 
you can use as you can tell I have a few
pop-up<00:00:36.180> parts<00:00:36.660> installed<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:39.690> comes

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
pop-up parts installed out here it comes

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.520 
pop-up parts installed out here it comes
with<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> stock<00:00:40.530> 540<00:00:41.280> Tamiya<00:00:41.730> motor<00:00:42.350> and<00:00:43.350> it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
with a stock 540 Tamiya motor and it's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.389 
with a stock 540 Tamiya motor and it's
chef-driven<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.440> there's<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.710> long<00:00:47.039> shaft

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
chef-driven so there's one long shaft

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.029 
chef-driven so there's one long shaft
through<00:00:47.610> here<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.329> have<00:00:48.899> powers<00:00:49.410> through<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
through here and have powers through the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189 
through here and have powers through the
differentials<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.390> making<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.780> four-wheel

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
differentials so making it four-wheel

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.830 
differentials so making it four-wheel
drive<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.910> used<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.270> stock<00:00:54.510> plastic

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
drive I used to have the stock plastic

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.920 
drive I used to have the stock plastic
drive<00:00:55.320> shaft<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.010> changed<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> CNC

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
drive shaft but I changed it with a CNC

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.610 
drive shaft but I changed it with a CNC
aluminum<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> carbon<00:00:59.609> fiber<00:00:59.989> drive<00:01:00.989> shop<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
aluminum and carbon fiber drive shop to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160 
aluminum and carbon fiber drive shop to
stop<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> wobble<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.550> get<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.239> quick

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
stop the wobble and get that quick

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.240 
stop the wobble and get that quick
torque<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:06.650> since<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.979> drift

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
torque that you need since this is drift

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700 
torque that you need since this is drift
ready<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.729> comes<00:01:09.000> with<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.659> drifting<00:01:10.320> tires

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
ready it comes with the drifting tires

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.719 
ready it comes with the drifting tires
which<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.400> pretty<00:01:11.850> hard<00:01:12.260> plastic<00:01:13.260> material

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
which are pretty hard plastic material

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.240 
which are pretty hard plastic material
it's<00:01:14.729> pretty<00:01:15.060> durable<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it's pretty durable and this is the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's pretty durable and this is the
shocks<00:01:17.549> are<00:01:18.330> very<00:01:18.689> bouncy<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.159> can

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
shocks are very bouncy and you can

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.830 
shocks are very bouncy and you can
adjust<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.729> through<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> spacers<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.659> here

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
adjust it through the spacers right here

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
adjust it through the spacers right here
which<00:01:22.560> you're<00:01:22.680> gonna<00:01:22.799> remove<00:01:23.070> or<00:01:23.400> add<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.850> if

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
which you're gonna remove or add more if

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.359 
which you're gonna remove or add more if
you<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.299> if<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.720> want<00:01:24.750> thicker<00:01:25.369> thicker

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you want if you want thicker thicker

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.620 
you want if you want thicker thicker
thicker<00:01:27.150> shocks<00:01:28.640> to<00:01:29.640> keep<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> motor<00:01:30.119> cool<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
thicker shocks to keep the motor cool I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.270 
thicker shocks to keep the motor cool I
took<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.259> old<00:01:31.290> CNC<00:01:32.180> he<00:01:33.180> sink<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.280> put

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
took out the old CNC he sink and I put

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.130 
took out the old CNC he sink and I put
on<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> new<00:01:35.700> heatsink<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.450> features<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.960> Pat

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
on a new heatsink which features of Pat

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.450 
on a new heatsink which features of Pat
it's<00:01:38.009> very<00:01:38.250> strong<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.860> it<00:01:40.860> keeps<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.250> motor

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it's very strong and it keeps the motor

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.600 
it's very strong and it keeps the motor
cool<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.189> lot<00:01:44.369> you're

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
cool and you can use it for a lot you're

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:58.210 
cool and you can use it for a lot you're
gonna<00:01:44.729> use<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> RC<00:01:45.240> car<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:45.810> longer

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.190 

overall<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.400> is<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.610> very<00:02:00.030> good<00:02:00.240> RC<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.900> start

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
overall this is a very good RC to start

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.690 
overall this is a very good RC to start
with<00:02:01.970> it's<00:02:02.970> very<00:02:03.420> durable<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:05.250> will<00:02:05.460> last

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
with it's very durable and it will last

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
fun with it with this RC car you can

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.130 
fun with it with this RC car you can
learn<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.700> basics<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.180> drifting<00:02:12.600> or<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:12.990> can

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
learn the basics of drifting or you can

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
learn the basics of drifting or you can
even<00:02:13.230> master<00:02:13.740> it<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.280> practice<00:02:14.910> enough

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
even master it if you practice enough
