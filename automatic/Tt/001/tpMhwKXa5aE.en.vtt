00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.509
 hello very good guys as I've already 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.640
 said in the previous video in this video 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.540
 Let's talk about how as the only one 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.999
 with my clients after good when 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.460
 they write to me and they ask me if I'm 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:19.190
 usually always in the first message 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.890
 they ask me first if I'm free to 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.550
 for the date on which they marry 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.550
 OK 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.590
 that's the best thing or this is the most 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.390
 important if I'm free if I'm not 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.099
 free, that is, no, I do not have to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.660
 ask more questions I just can not 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.660
 but if I'm free 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.329
 and we already do as a dialogue tell me 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 more or less like who are where 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.390
 they marry 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.620
 some details not then then what 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.260
 we do is 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 to stay ok we stay in a bar we take 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.399
 something I do not have an office I do not have 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.949
 study work outdoors 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.469
 so then we want in a bar we take 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.560
 something we go to a cocacola or whatever and 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.110
 We speak 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.350
 and I the first thing he asked before 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.360
 say good as long exposure 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.720
 photographer of I do not know how old I am not 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.510
 I know what camera and I do not know that I do not know which one 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.730
 I have experience and good because I do not 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:24.540
 I do this, what I do is ask them 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.540
 how have you met for example or 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.500
 another thing that is related to them 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.690
 because what interests me is 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.850
 know them to know what kind 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.870
 of people are and how to communicate with 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.700
 they are worth before launching me to say I 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.670
 I am this and I am this equal to them not 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.220
 they care as they do not have 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.050
 not the remotest idea of ​​photography but 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.010
 They like my photos so I'm going to 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.710
 speak in a way or equal to the girlfriend 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.860
 or the boyfriend because he is a photographer, photographer 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.680
 not then well what can I talk about with 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.680
 a language a little more let's say 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.750
 specific not for me to understand 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.069
 and always the communication has to be 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.709
 adapted to what they are to the tastes 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.170
 that they have and of course when I already 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.390
 tell more or less who they are to what 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.239
 dedicate what they like because they already 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.319
 I tell them how work and what is it 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:28.780
 I like how I work and which one 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.480
 is he what my goals are with a 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.840
 work is always worth telling them that for 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.050
 me money is not the biggest prize 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.670
 that he received from work but for me 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.760
 as the most important thing is to make the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.430
 I work well because this is for me 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.359
 more than the gender 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.750
 I explain how I work how is the how 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:55.710
 goes the workflow 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.480
 I ask you for a timeline or a schedule 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.310
 with all the things here now going to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.250
 start every thing that now ends in what 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.040
 place is worth because I have many times 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.620
 to be before everyone in a 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.530
 site then I have to be doing 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.530
 photos when when it enters the bride and 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.970
 the boyfriend for example in the restaurant 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.920
 Well practically I cover all day 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.540
 not then I have to be very clear to 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.480
 what time do things start now 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.410
 they finish and such some have asked me 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 If I have an album of example or or 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.770
 computer 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.230
 do not 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.630
 not because if we are in this phase of 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:37.410
 our communication them if they have seen 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:41.250
 my photos and have seen how work is worth 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.350
 and this is enough, I do not have to 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.970
 bring them an album or a laptop with the 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.530
 photos because I'm going to show you the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.450
 new photos that you have seen on my page 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.640
 web is worth 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.739
 if it enters the web it is impossible that it does not 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.110
 see the pictures because this is the first 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.959
 what people fix on is worth then 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.780
 this does not make sense to me if you do not 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.989
 You have a web or whatever as equal 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.450
 you have to bring some kind of example 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.650
 your job but this is not 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.970
 practically what we do in this 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.700
 first time when we want for me what 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.370
 more important is to have fun and 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.070
 create an atmosphere of friendship and 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.090
 Trust is worth it because it is very important 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.760
 have confidence between us because 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.050
 We will work in very intimate moments 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:33.750
 It's worth your wedding because it's a 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.160
 very intimate moment very personal the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.620
 Last thing you want is a photographer 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.680
 unknown that the center of the day 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.580
 so put yourself like this for dad is worth what 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.740
 we want to do it as pleasant as possible 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.720
 and that's my job that's my job 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.110
 because this is one of the most 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.210
 important to me in this first time 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.100
 that we want 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.670
 the other thing we do is talk a 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.670
 little about 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.569
 clear the style of the story because there 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:12.169
 more conservative people who like more 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.750
 the classic there are more different people than 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.020
 they like it more 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.530
 something experimental something more crazy 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.180
 something else you understand me or something on the street 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.750
 for example in one of the bags that I'm going 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.350
 to do inside 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.350
 how cool 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.220
 the moriscos one of the balls that I'm going to 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.530
 do in two months 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.020
 Well, we're probably going to do the 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.930
 report on the streets of the city 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.370
 ok we're not going to probably do what 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.900
 typical of 20 photos in a park of the 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.320
 nature we will probably do two or 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.830
 three yes but what we will do more than anything 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.500
 what is my idea is to be on the street and 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:58.290
 is to be a bit like street photography 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.770
 but the ball is going to be very hard but it 's 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.320
 because it is these people adapt to this 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.770
 kind of me I adapt practically to 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.410
 them because I have certain ideas and to the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.720
 see how they are then I offer them then 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.910
 look I was thinking about this and this and 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.580
 what do you think so look how cool 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.849
 ok and we do it 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.789
 that's pretty much if you have questions 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:26.340
 the heart report downgraded the video 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.110

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.130
 I like it 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.380

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:44.969
 and in the next video we are going to talk 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:47.789
 already from the moment in which 

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:50.069
 and I have to be at the wedding as 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:54.139
 I do as I prepare 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:57.469
 I will probably talk about 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:07:00.590
 the technical parts and also on the 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:03.680
 we would say social parts like web style 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.300
 and this is worth it because this has been for today 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.849
 for this video and see you in the 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.289

 bye
