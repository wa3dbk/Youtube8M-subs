00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.369
 and I'm happy for him and his friend 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.419
 what are low 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:17.960
 Trecker-Trek Rule are the guests left 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.810
 big backpacks big volumes 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.670
 in Berlin 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.980
 a sleeping mat sleeping my reserves clothes 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.029
 coloring 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.580
 various equipment for and multi-day tours place 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.910
 Dare I have a question is pull 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.010
 characterized by the fact that it is particularly easy to return 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.260
 currently doing 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.730
 solve this place dispute 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.400
 and here my school or education 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.310
 The Beatles 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.310
 that would be solid 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.590
 but my backpack 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.710
 Hanisch on my back 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.640
 even very small people can even 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.240
 These let positioning were included in the investigation 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.860
 that I still 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.680
 Block person, for example 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.410
 Unger 1 60 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.390
 can offer the suitable backpack 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.870
 in practice has been shown 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.180
 the 4 60% on the hip 43% on the shoulder that is even Tarmstedt 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.020
 proven 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.980
 Who would be so in the years it could be that no one prefers 70 30 that 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.090
 than 70 percent off 34% on the shoulder 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.700
 but this can also be made possible 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.500
 Well finally a tracking system did not clarify what 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.910
 can relate longer shoulder bruising 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.650
 can be adjusted 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.650
 the other version Helgoland 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.110
 instead of those see the box 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.110
 and l Christ is performing 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.200
 this is only possible 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.720
 while it's going 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 the school leavers 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.120
 the Christof it systems allows customization 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.879
 God is also various gladly occupied 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.359
 Picture Mr. ready to get out of his car 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 finally deleted 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:33.839
 and now you can see very well 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.879
 the school bearer height are adjusted further here operate 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.889
 and the shoulder Trier 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.099
 changed his position 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.680
 Canton of Hochdorf through the burden of the backpack 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.239
 in Dortmund 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.239
 It has proven itself in various terrain forms 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.789
 for example, going downhill in backpacks a lower positions 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:05.219
 Can carry and Bamberg hung in a high position 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:10.869
 if I go uphill then it will not be easy 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 Bring OT position 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.189
 a clear proof 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.619
 the helm in substantial parts 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.229
 the seedlist for St 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:25.249
 with up to approx 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:27.739
 Can not say enough, Kurth said 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.099
 to adapt specifically to my hip 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.949
 by doing this 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.949
 handicapped BK 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:37.449
 and the 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.099
 5 percent thanks to background 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.409
 the air flew 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.769
 To call questions are different have different ways 

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.979
 the highlight must be 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.979
 can adapt to different circumstances 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.349
 that brings this illustrated book Feichtinger I understand I feel the world 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.099
 and have a different angle of attack 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.679
 the desired position
