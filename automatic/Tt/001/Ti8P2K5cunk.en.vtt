00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
in and you kind of leap for the other

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.099 
in and you kind of leap for the other
side<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.039> same<00:02:05.219> time<00:02:05.429> you're<00:02:05.549> falling<00:02:05.849> in

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:12.109 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.500

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
in and out of holes a little different

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.170 
in and out of holes a little different
story<00:02:23.370> here<00:02:24.920> get<00:02:25.920> her<00:02:26.010> up<00:02:26.160> yeah<00:02:26.310> do<00:02:26.819> this<00:02:27.060> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
story here get her up yeah do this I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.360 
story here get her up yeah do this I
thought<00:02:27.389> you<00:02:27.569> on<00:02:27.690> this<00:02:27.840> side<00:02:31.220> okay

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:03:17.160 

the<00:02:36.370> other<00:02:36.580> side<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.910> line<00:03:15.510> well<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.540> think<00:03:16.780> we

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
the other side the line well I think we

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.690 
the other side the line well I think we
a<00:03:17.710> good<00:03:18.400> work<00:03:18.940> out<00:03:19.210> of<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:20.100> we<00:03:21.100> average<00:03:21.250> two

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
a good work out of it and we average two

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.020 
a good work out of it and we average two
craps<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.300> pot<00:03:22.540> which<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:24.030> probably

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
craps to a pot which is probably

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.130 
craps to a pot which is probably
breaking<00:03:25.270> even<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.060> way<00:03:28.210> of<00:03:28.240> life<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.510> we

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
breaking even it's a way of life that we

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.900 
breaking even it's a way of life that we
enjoy<00:03:29.440> doing<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.890> know<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:30.790> we're

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
enjoy doing you know and I think we're

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.250 
enjoy doing you know and I think we're
going<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.090> get<00:03:31.210> a<00:03:31.240> couple<00:03:31.480> good<00:03:31.690> catches<00:03:32.110> here

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
catching them where where there might be

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.430 
catching them where where there might be
more<00:03:44.020> crabs<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:45.850> know<00:03:45.970> it's<00:03:46.150> just<00:03:46.360> it's<00:03:47.350> a
