here<00:01:42.740> around<00:01:43.740> 180<00:01:44.640> grams<00:01:45.030> which<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.270> one<00:01:45.420> with

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
here around 180 grams which is one with

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
here around 180 grams which is one with
37<00:01:46.079> grams<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.470> more<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:47.340> course<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you get the espinosa said so you can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
you get the espinosa said so you can
play<00:01:56.520> around<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.180> actually<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.840> enjoy

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
play around with that actually do enjoy

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.709 
play around with that actually do enjoy
ton<00:01:58.829> times<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.490> especially<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.509> are<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
ton times and especially if you are a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.300 
ton times and especially if you are a
little<00:02:00.840> bit<00:02:00.990> creative<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.829> pretty<00:02:02.130> awesome

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
little bit creative it's pretty awesome

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.080 
little bit creative it's pretty awesome
actually<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.950> TFT<00:02:05.460> display<00:02:05.790> on

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
actually and you get this TFT display on

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.670 
actually and you get this TFT display on
the<00:02:06.270> sony

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
the sony

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.669 
the sony
super<00:02:06.890> z1<00:02:07.400> compact<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.229> we<00:02:09.229> should<00:02:09.470> have<00:02:09.649> a

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
super z1 compact and we should have a

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.970 
super z1 compact and we should have a
luminous<00:02:10.520> display<00:02:10.910> which<00:02:11.150> i<00:02:11.300> think<00:02:11.360> is<00:02:11.980> making

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
luminous display which i think is making

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.680 
luminous display which i think is making
it<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.400> it<00:02:13.550> doesn't<00:02:13.580> have<00:02:14.000> problems<00:02:14.330> with<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
it so it doesn't have problems with the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.180 
it so it doesn't have problems with the
viewing<00:02:14.930> angles<00:02:15.230> but<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:15.710> going<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.920> see<00:02:16.010> that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
viewing angles but I'm going to see that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.670 
viewing angles but I'm going to see that
when<00:02:16.340> i<00:02:16.370> get<00:02:16.460> this<00:02:16.730> device<00:02:17.000> probably<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:18.530> can

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
when i get this device probably you can

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.040 
when i get this device probably you can
see<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.880> keep<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.420> same<00:02:20.720> kind<00:02:20.930> of

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
see that the to keep the same kind of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.290 
see that the to keep the same kind of
