00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
 to weigh less the pier takes a while 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:07.760
 the Scudetto is not immediately visible 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:15.680
 escape 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.680
 I arrive at certain paris from the outside 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.099
 hello to everyone from known 24 hurry up to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.949
 make this video as you can read 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.739
 from the title of the video I'm selling mine 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.270
 geforce gtx 480 of the area that why 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:32.230
 I replaced it with my new card 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:36.600
 video geforce gtx 260 t that already smooth 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.150
 beats a 580 let alone a 4 80 ma 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 this model of the jetstream palit 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.930
 factory overclocked in a way 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.769
 hallucinating that you cannot imagine 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.540
 in fact the gtx 660 takes a 15 for you 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.850
 one hundred margin compared to his 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.820
 older sister a series 70 in this 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.610
 case that factory overclocked already 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.439
 a lot is only 8 percent 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.670
 less than 7 and time so we are 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:03.699
 talking about a band video card 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.430
 really high very powerful though 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.130
 returning to the speech the geforce 480 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.590
 you all know a 480 is very hot 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.619
 and its main problem that the 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.810
 Venetian commenda had 4 80 and it was 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.920
 burned because he left him the 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.020
 stock cooler 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.180
 as you can see the envy lan 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.760
 at the time I thought he was missing 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.250
 really a wheel and created a 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.960
 steel heat sink where when the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.530
 video card reaches temperatures of 90 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.479
 degrees you can roast on it and this one 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.400
 it was the tiny fan that it was 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.409
 had to cool it all you can 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.909
 imagine that it did not cool a little 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.870
 fuck anyway this is just a 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.670
 heatsink removed absolutely the first 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.659
 day another bit I bought from 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.780
 480 and ii place the artic extreme3 ​​which 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.790
 one of the most excellent heatsinks in 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.920
 trade if not the best is constant 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.080
 80 euro only the three-person sink 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.619
 fans and not to mention the point 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.350
 the cooling system that artists 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.330
 let's call them radiators so it cools 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.670
 really a lot of game temperatures 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.150
 they never rise but I never say 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.430
 in addition to 45 46 degrees in summer 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.500
 so we're talking about 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.609
 the all new video card it does not have 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.409
 nothing to do with a normal 480 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.969
 therefore also g for those who wanted it 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.799
 overclocking can to block 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:31.129
 very well etc. and so on 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:34.700
 however, those interested him 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:38.180
 I obviously send the same day in 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.400
 I said the payment is a 480 now 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.549
 it is hard to find it on the market 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.450
 you should search on e bay subito.it 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.799
 etc 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.810
 however, you should also go there 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.000
 well because you have to find a person 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.280
 reliable that you will be selling really not 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.010
 we care about you here we are talking about 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.959
 a public figure you don't know about 24 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.060
 you can also tarnish me at the fanpage 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.459
 we went to do such a thing but 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.060
 you can be sure however I am one 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.650
 really person 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.180
 respectable therefore the day in which 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.420
 receive payment if someone there 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.050
 I 'm interested in sending it just like that 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.050
 as it's nothing the video card I didn't have 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.270
 a problem I had no problem and me 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.980
 I replaced it because I wanted to 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.970
 performance and not spend 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.540
 lot 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.430
 I repeat the 660 issue a 20 percent in 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.920
 more than the 4 and a lot but it costs 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.170
 even a lot I paid 300 euros a 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:39.830
 when I picked it up and 660 beat you yellow 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.840
 shub pose at 580 and let alone the 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.310
 jet stream model that overclocked 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:51.860
 really as much as you can see the 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:54.650
 new video card the palit jet stream 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:59.030
 with the blue LEDs to the fans really the 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.330
 row and nothing I repeat it was 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.280
 affected by 1400 80 the price 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.060
 I sell it together with all the sink 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.130
 let's say that as much as 100 140 euros 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.870
 they should be fine because I can't 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.220
 sell it less because it is 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.580
 a video card that lets you play 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.970
 shogun 2 all at maximum settings for 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:22.580
 Not to mention that even the sink and 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:26.660
 artic extreme3 chikos already has so many euros 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.490
 if he went to buy anything 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.140
 this video card is at a minimum 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.020
 still today on 200 euros 180 but how much 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.580
 I pay, however, obviously with the times 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.680
 that I run 140 I don't need it anymore I believe 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.960
 are more than enough as money 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:48.620
 so nothing if you are interested 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.700
 contact me please to have one 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.770
 480 serves a power supply with 42 amps 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.320
 this 62- year power supply for then 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.860
 I was very quiet with the A4 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.110
 80 and must have precisely a 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.760
 power supply remember with 42 am x 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.010
 how do you see how many amps to the 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.790
 your simple feeder take the 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.940
 your foods 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.780
 now you see without detaching anything there is a 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.450
 adhesive 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.050
 there it says on the 12 volt line 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:22.250
 so 12v is written for example 42 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.730
 50 ampere if over 42 or 42 is fine if 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.920
 the less I can't sell you because 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.340
 he doesn't have it, you can't hold it 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.340
 in conclusion
