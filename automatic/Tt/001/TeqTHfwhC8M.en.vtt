00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.140
 scientists at the Federal University of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.600
 the Great Northern River 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.880
 discovery of yet another star of a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.500
 twin sun mat 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.450
 this study is important because it 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 to help researchers understand 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
 better what can happen to the sun 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.250
 So straight to Christmas, to talk to 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
 amorim grandson reporter who chatted with 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.480
 scientists love what they already know 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.480
 of this star that is twin adoption 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.640
 good afternoon good afternoon good afternoon 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.000
 all this star was named runs 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.920
 what is the same name as the satellite used 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.129
 scientists to do this 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.789
 discovery is approximately 2 billion 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:48.120
 of years older than the sun and the moon 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.640
 of honey scientists because they believe 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.149
 that the result can now come 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.760
 It is very good, for example, to know 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.399
 age of the agreement's sun is that our sun 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.289
 here will only offer morin 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.149
 This is cool because it's more or less like 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.700
 the people for our older brothers 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:13.470
 we know how it will be good the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:15.780
 hardly even take it and if 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.229
 being a twin sister, the result can be 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.509
 more precise is precisely this 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.030
 that scientists now want to know 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.970
 and how this new star has a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.600
 very similar to ours. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 the result of this search can 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.100
 much faster than the results 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.509
 this study can be much faster 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 but the navy is not the first 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.990
 star sister twin of the sun to be 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 discovery 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.840
 no, no, sandra, look at the scientists already 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.720
 discovered several other stars 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.750
 The main difference is that this is a 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.240
 little older than the others . 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.060
 than the sun and also gets much more 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.670
 away from our galaxy now sandra 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.399
 And the important thing is that all these 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.459
 studies of galaxies and stars of 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.069
 universe they try to answer to maybe 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.110
 one of our greatest curiosities knows 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.980
 What does everyone want to know? 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.190
 exactly 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.670
 there is life like ours in others 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.409
 planets to take this requires some sun 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.599
 I do not believe in other Christians anymore 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.720
 needs the twin sister of the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.409
 agency in multinations calls 17 years 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.409
 light years
