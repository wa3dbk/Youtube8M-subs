enjoying<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.520> sound<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.360> it

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
enjoying the sound as you can see it

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.990 
enjoying the sound as you can see it
just<00:00:33.800> digging<00:00:34.800> its<00:00:34.950> nose<00:00:35.219> into<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
just digging its nose into it and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.920 
just digging its nose into it and
looking<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.750> food<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:38.540> I've<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:39.719> been

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
looking for food and I've actually been

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139 
looking for food and I've actually been
trying<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> breathe<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.890> think<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.120> might

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
trying to breathe I think that one might

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.750 
trying to breathe I think that one might
be<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.660> meal<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.890> keeps<00:00:44.190> chasing<00:00:44.489> after

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
be the meal and it keeps chasing after

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.479 
be the meal and it keeps chasing after
the<00:00:45.000> female<00:00:45.590> so<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.770> suggests<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.309> water

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the female so that suggests the water

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.970 
the female so that suggests the water
quality<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.030> quite<00:00:48.149> good<00:00:48.450> I've<00:00:49.140> been<00:00:49.440> testing

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.549 
quality is quite good I've been testing
the<00:00:50.039> water<00:00:50.219> every<00:00:50.579> day<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:52.079> looks<00:00:52.289> quite

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the water every day and it looks quite

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.000 
really want to rush it some people have
been<00:01:07.530> seen<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.460> add<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.000> fish<00:01:09.180> at<00:01:09.360> once

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
been seen I can add all the fish at once

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
been seen I can add all the fish at once
since<00:01:11.010> I've<00:01:11.159> got<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> old<00:01:11.549> filter<00:01:11.880> media<00:01:12.590> but

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
since I've got the old filter media but

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
since I've got the old filter media but
there<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> slight<00:01:14.310> risk<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:15.270> there's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
there is a slight risk because there's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.320 
there is a slight risk because there's
no<00:01:15.840> bacteria<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.280> sand<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.909> there's<00:01:18.210> no

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
no bacteria in the sand and there's no

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.370 
no bacteria in the sand and there's no
bacteria<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> water<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.850> realized<00:01:20.850> that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
bacteria in the water I realized that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.870 
bacteria in the water I realized that
most<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> bacteria<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.400> lives<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
most of the bacteria actually lives in

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
most of the bacteria actually lives in
the<00:01:24.000> filter<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:25.470> really<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.920> wanna

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the filter I just really don't wanna

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.870 
the filter I just really don't wanna
take<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> risk<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.890> would<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.040> sheehan<00:01:29.340> even

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
take the risk and would be sheehan even

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.870 
take the risk and would be sheehan even
if<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.090> lost<00:01:30.240> one<00:01:30.600> Cardinal<00:01:31.079> tetra<00:01:31.729> since<00:01:32.729> I've

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
if I lost one Cardinal tetra since I've

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.830 
if I lost one Cardinal tetra since I've
had<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.450> year<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:35.360> I've<00:01:36.360> had<00:01:36.600> them<00:01:36.720> in

leaves<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.579> quite<00:01:59.759> green<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.170> come

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
leaves are quite green but if you come

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.709 
leaves are quite green but if you come
down<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> past<00:02:02.520> week<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:03.030> sent<00:02:03.390> up<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
down here in the past week it sent up to

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.889 
down here in the past week it sent up to
new<00:02:04.350> leaves<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.790> bright<00:02:06.060> red<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.360> I'd<00:02:06.689> suggest

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
new leaves the bright red so I'd suggest

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.550 
new leaves the bright red so I'd suggest
offend<00:02:07.590> some<00:02:07.740> iron<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> substrate<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
offend some iron in the substrate and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.220 
offend some iron in the substrate and
that<00:02:10.560> will<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.700> form<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.209> root<00:02:12.569> tubs

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that will be in the form of root tubs

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.550 
that will be in the form of root tubs
using<00:02:13.530> C<00:02:13.769> can<00:02:14.010> flourish<00:02:14.400> root<00:02:14.700> tabs<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.560> as

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
using C can flourish root tabs and as

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.899 
using C can flourish root tabs and as
you<00:02:16.680> can<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.250> just<00:02:17.310> producing

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
you can see it's just producing

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.899 
you can see it's just producing
brilliant<00:02:18.330> results<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:20.370> one<00:02:20.549> in<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.760> back

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
brilliant results the one in the back

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.670 
brilliant results the one in the back
there<00:02:21.180> has<00:02:21.299> got<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:21.629> red<00:02:21.810> leaves<00:02:22.049> at<00:02:22.470> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
there has got some red leaves at the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.250 
there has got some red leaves at the
base<00:02:22.860> as<00:02:23.220> well<00:02:23.450> this<00:02:24.450> one<00:02:24.659> doesn't<00:02:24.840> really<00:02:25.080> get

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
base as well this one doesn't really get

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.890 
base as well this one doesn't really get
red<00:02:25.500> leaves<00:02:25.739> but<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.879> one's<00:02:27.090> sent<00:02:27.450> off<00:02:27.569> a<00:02:27.599> run

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
red leaves but that one's sent off a run

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.589 
red leaves but that one's sent off a run
out<00:02:28.049> over<00:02:28.290> there<00:02:29.000> that's<00:02:30.000> actually<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.360> runner

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
out over there that's actually a runner

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.680 
out over there that's actually a runner
off<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:31.170> plant<00:02:31.819> so<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:32.879> shows<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.239> the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
off that plant so that shows that the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.619 
off that plant so that shows that the
roots<00:02:33.870> are<00:02:34.019> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.319> spread<00:02:34.590> now<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.769> bit<00:02:35.099> and

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
roots are kind of spread now a bit and

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.970 
roots are kind of spread now a bit and
nothing<00:02:36.629> much<00:02:36.810> just<00:02:36.840> really<00:02:37.349> happened<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
nothing much just really happened with a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.819 
nothing much just really happened with a
bogus<00:02:38.340> TM<00:02:38.610> inhale<00:02:38.910> fairy<00:02:39.319> but<00:02:40.319> give<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.650> week

bogus TM inhale fairy but give it a week

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.729 
bogus TM inhale fairy but give it a week
or<00:02:41.160> two<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.750> should<00:02:43.079> be<00:02:43.110> spreading<00:02:43.650> out

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
or two and it should be spreading out

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.050 
or two and it should be spreading out
quite<00:02:44.040> nicely<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.690> Richer<00:02:46.290> flu<00:02:46.500> Eaton's<00:02:47.060> I

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
quite nicely the Richer flu Eaton's I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.780 
quite nicely the Richer flu Eaton's I
haven't<00:02:49.019> really<00:02:49.170> had<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.709> long<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.760> I

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
haven't really had it that long so I

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.280 
haven't really had it that long so I
can't<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.180> comment<00:02:51.510> on<00:02:51.750> how<00:02:51.959> well<00:02:52.140> it's

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
can't really comment on how well it's

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.699 
can't really comment on how well it's
grown<00:02:52.910> but<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.000> hasn't<00:02:54.299> melted<00:02:54.450> yet<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.079> it

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
grown but it hasn't melted yet and it

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.479 
grown but it hasn't melted yet and it
looks<00:02:56.069> really<00:02:56.459> bright<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.620> just<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.220> nice

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
looks really bright and just so nice

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.380 
looks really bright and just so nice
it's<00:02:59.819> just<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.209> really<00:03:00.390> nice<00:03:00.660> plant<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:03.150> narrow

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
it's just a really nice plant the narrow

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.150 
it's just a really nice plant the narrow
leaf<00:03:03.569> java<00:03:03.840> fern<00:03:04.140> stayed<00:03:04.530> quite<00:03:04.859> bright<00:03:05.099> and

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
leaf java fern stayed quite bright and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.599 
leaf java fern stayed quite bright and
green<00:03:05.519> sauce<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.150> anubius<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.459> the<00:03:08.459> most

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
green sauce the anubius and the most

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.720 
green sauce the anubius and the most
impressive<00:03:09.000> plant<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:09.720> tank<00:03:10.019> and

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
impressive plant in this tank and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.979 
impressive plant in this tank and
doesn't<00:03:11.730> look<00:03:11.849> like<00:03:12.030> much<00:03:12.180> from<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.540> distance

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
doesn't look like much from a distance

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.289 
doesn't look like much from a distance
but<00:03:13.379> this<00:03:13.560> jungle<00:03:13.950> Val<00:03:14.099> has<00:03:14.910> actually<00:03:15.209> been

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
but this jungle Val has actually been

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.490 
but this jungle Val has actually been
sending<00:03:15.840> off<00:03:15.989> runners<00:03:16.290> all<00:03:16.620> over<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:18.500> that's

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
sending off runners all over and that's

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.190 
sending off runners all over and that's
a<00:03:19.620> runner<00:03:21.169> there's<00:03:22.609> runner<00:03:23.609> there<00:03:23.930> there<00:03:24.930> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
a runner there's runner there there and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.710 
a runner there's runner there there and
there<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.950> it's<00:03:26.849> just<00:03:27.030> send<00:03:27.269> them<00:03:27.389> up<00:03:27.540> all

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
there and it's just send them up all

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.199 
there and it's just send them up all
over<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.590> that's<00:03:28.859> just<00:03:29.010> in<00:03:29.370> a<00:03:29.459> week<00:03:29.639> it<00:03:29.849> sent<00:03:30.090> up

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
over so that's just in a week it sent up

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.500 
over so that's just in a week it sent up
about<00:03:30.480> four<00:03:30.810> or<00:03:30.840> five<00:03:30.930> runners<00:03:32.060> it<00:03:33.060> also

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
about four or five runners it also

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.289 
about four or five runners it also
hasn't<00:03:33.810> melted<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.500> expected<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.579> to<00:03:35.639> milk<00:03:36.000> cuz

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
hasn't melted I expected it to milk cuz

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.500 
hasn't melted I expected it to milk cuz
I'm<00:03:36.480> actually<00:03:36.630> do<00:03:36.989> some<00:03:37.290> liquid<00:03:37.769> carbon<00:03:38.510> but

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
I'm actually do some liquid carbon but

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.110 
I'm actually do some liquid carbon but
stayed<00:03:39.840> green<00:03:40.139> and<00:03:40.410> it's<00:03:40.500> still<00:03:40.769> growing<00:03:41.120> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
stayed green and it's still growing the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.120 
stayed green and it's still growing the
high-growth<00:03:42.540> alia<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.079> kind<00:03:43.650> of<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.739> stayed

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
high-growth alia is kind of just stayed

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.970 
high-growth alia is kind of just stayed
the<00:03:44.310> same<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:45.109> but<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.260> should<00:03:46.470> take<00:03:46.650> off<00:03:46.829> in

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
the same and but that should take off in

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.759 
the same and but that should take off in
a<00:03:47.069> couple<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.340> weeks<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.959> in<00:03:48.959> general<00:03:49.169> tanks
