00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
the light off because I figured it would

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.400 
the light off because I figured it would
be<00:03:30.970> better<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.690> don't<00:03:31.930> know<00:03:32.020> that<00:03:32.170> maybe<00:03:32.290> I

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
be better I don't know that maybe I

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.340 
be better I don't know that maybe I
should<00:03:32.590> just<00:03:32.710> get<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.920> back<00:03:33.040> on<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.870> then<00:03:35.080> when

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
should just get it back on so then when

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.910 
should just get it back on so then when
you<00:03:35.470> put<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.010> there<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.880> see<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.330> is<00:03:37.450> darker

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
you put it on there you see it is darker

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.770 
you put it on there you see it is darker
but<00:03:38.920> make<00:03:39.160> sure<00:03:39.190> because<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.210> still<00:03:40.600> doesn't

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
but make sure because it still doesn't

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.140 
but make sure because it still doesn't
dry<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.110> you<00:03:41.350> have<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.620> let<00:03:41.740> it<00:03:41.950> dry<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:42.760> that

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
dry it you have to let it dry so that

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.090 
dry it you have to let it dry so that
you<00:03:43.270> don't<00:03:43.420> smush<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.840> out<00:03:44.170> because<00:03:44.710> if<00:03:44.980> so

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
you don't smush it out because if so

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.950 
you don't smush it out because if so
it's<00:03:45.250> just<00:03:45.370> gonna<00:03:45.520> smear<00:03:45.880> all<00:03:46.030> over<00:03:46.270> so<00:03:46.750> that

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:46.960 
it's just gonna smear all over so that

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.310 
it's just gonna smear all over so that
is<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.110> good<00:03:47.440> little<00:03:48.390> tip<00:03:49.390> trick<00:03:49.900> whatever<00:03:50.230> you

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
is a good little tip trick whatever you

cool off and then use it and you'll
notice<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.880> it's<00:04:01.810> going<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.170> be<00:04:02.940> darker<00:04:03.940> but

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
notice that it's going to be darker but

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.840
