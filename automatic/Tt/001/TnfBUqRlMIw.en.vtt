back the next day and got a little
hands-on<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> machine<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.230> say

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
hands-on with the machine and I can say

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.919 
hands-on with the machine and I can say
that<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> highly<00:00:29.580> detailed<00:00:29.849> table<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
that this is a highly detailed table the

that this is a highly detailed table the
Marquis<00:00:31.410> definitely<00:00:32.189> catches<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.730> eye<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
Marquis definitely catches my eye and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.600 
Marquis definitely catches my eye and
this<00:00:33.690> table<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.200> looks<00:00:34.649> expensive<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.460> looks

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
this table just looks expensive it looks

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
this table just looks expensive it looks
like<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.239> high<00:00:36.570> quality<00:00:36.899> pinball<00:00:37.590> machine<00:00:37.980> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
like a high quality pinball machine the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.459 
like a high quality pinball machine the
play<00:00:38.460> field<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.940> completely<00:00:39.180> packed<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.350> I'm

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
play field is completely packed and I'm

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
play field is completely packed and I'm
gonna<00:00:40.559> go<00:00:40.770> as<00:00:40.890> far<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.309> saying<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
gonna go as far as saying that this is a

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.450 
gonna go as far as saying that this is a
perfect<00:00:42.719> design<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.559> say<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.950> because<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
perfect design and I say that because I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.369 
perfect design and I say that because I
don't<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.850> any<00:00:45.000> complaints<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.230> don't

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
don't have any complaints I really don't

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.660 
don't have any complaints I really don't
think<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.680> could<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.950> made<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> design

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
think they could have made this design

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.580 
think they could have made this design
any<00:00:47.910> better<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.719> gonna<00:00:48.809> say<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
any better so I'm gonna say that it's a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.529 
any better so I'm gonna say that it's a
perfect<00:00:49.920> design<00:00:50.190> other<00:00:50.610> than<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.270> way<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
perfect design other than the way the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.450 
perfect design other than the way the
pinball<00:00:51.870> machine<00:00:52.170> looks<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.039> next<00:00:53.309> thing

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
pinball machine looks the next thing

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.639 
pinball machine looks the next thing
that<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.640> noticed<00:00:54.030> was<00:00:54.180> how<00:00:54.510> stereophonic<00:00:55.500> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that I noticed was how stereophonic the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
that I noticed was how stereophonic the
sound<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:56.610> sounds<00:00:57.090> great<00:00:57.510> now

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
sound is it just sounds great now

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.319 
sound is it just sounds great now
supposedly<00:00:58.379> there's<00:00:58.710> 12<00:00:59.039> well-known<00:00:59.760> ac/dc

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
supposedly there's 12 well-known ac/dc

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.779 
supposedly there's 12 well-known ac/dc
tracks<00:01:00.870> inside<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> table<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.250> only<00:01:02.460> heard<00:01:02.699> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
tracks inside the table I only heard a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
tracks inside the table I only heard a
few<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.300> they<00:01:03.390> sound<00:01:03.629> really<00:01:03.870> good<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
few but they sound really good what I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
few but they sound really good what I
really<00:01:04.860> liked<00:01:05.100> was<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.640> sample

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
really liked was all the little sample

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.840 
really liked was all the little sample
ac/dc<00:01:07.290> sounds<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.490> table

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
ac/dc sounds that they have in a table

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.880 
ac/dc sounds that they have in a table
for<00:01:09.060> example<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.689> Bell<00:01:10.020> from<00:01:10.409> hells<00:01:10.740> bells

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
for example the Bell from hells bells

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.670 
for example the Bell from hells bells
hey<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.909> think<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.360> heard<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.229> quite<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> bit

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
hey I think I heard that one quite a bit

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.350 
hey I think I heard that one quite a bit
and<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> sounds<00:01:14.400> really<00:01:14.580> cool<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.330> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and it sounds really cool this is a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
and it sounds really cool this is a
faster<00:01:15.930> playing<00:01:16.200> table<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.770> not<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
faster playing table it's not the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
faster playing table it's not the
fastest<00:01:17.549> playing<00:01:17.790> table<00:01:18.150> I've<00:01:18.270> ever<00:01:18.299> come

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
fastest playing table I've ever come

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.719 
fastest playing table I've ever come
across<00:01:18.750> but<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> faster<00:01:20.009> playing<00:01:20.250> table

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
across but it is a faster playing table

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.910 
across but it is a faster playing table
the<00:01:20.939> ramps<00:01:21.360> feel<00:01:21.600> really<00:01:21.930> good<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:22.650> really

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the ramps feel really good and I really

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.950 
the ramps feel really good and I really
enjoyed<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.400> rotating<00:01:23.939> cannon<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.780> can

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
enjoyed the rotating cannon that you can

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.480 
enjoyed the rotating cannon that you can
shoot<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.380> ball<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.040> they<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.310> like

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
shoot the ball out of and they have like

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
shoot the ball out of and they have like
this<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:26.909> button<00:01:27.210> towards<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> top<00:01:27.869> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
this little button towards the top of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170 
this little button towards the top of
the<00:01:28.200> machine<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.159> press<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.430> eject

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
the machine that you can press to eject

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.850 
the machine that you can press to eject
the<00:01:30.360> ball<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.079> thought<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.560> was<00:01:31.680> cool

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the ball out I thought that was cool

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
the ball out I thought that was cool
definitely<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.460> nice<00:01:32.700> touch<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.420> only<00:01:33.630> thing

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
definitely a nice touch the only thing

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.300 
definitely a nice touch the only thing
about<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.229> table<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> wasn't<00:01:35.070> really

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
about the table that I wasn't really

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.149 
about the table that I wasn't really
feeling<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.600> images<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.259> were<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:37.979> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
feeling was the images that were on the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.980 
feeling was the images that were on the
dot<00:01:38.549> matrix<00:01:38.759> display<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.479> thought<00:01:39.840> they're

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
dot matrix display I thought they're

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.109 
dot matrix display I thought they're
kind<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.380> boring<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.310> think<00:01:41.850> they<00:01:41.939> could

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
kind of boring and I think they could

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.819 
kind of boring and I think they could
have<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.720> done<00:01:42.899> better<00:01:43.110> with<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
have really done better with that you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.469 
have really done better with that you
know<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.579> really<00:01:44.939> notice<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.360> when

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
know so you don't really notice it when

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.760 
know so you don't really notice it when
you're<00:01:45.600> playing<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.020> noticed<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.619> because

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
you're playing I noticed it because

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.679 
you're playing I noticed it because
that's<00:01:47.280> me<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:47.790> yeah<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:48.509> could

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
that's me but yeah I think they could

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.030 
that's me but yeah I think they could
have<00:01:48.720> could've<00:01:49.170> done<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.560> better<00:01:49.770> on

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
have could've done a little better on

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.429 
have could've done a little better on
those<00:01:50.280> collectors<00:01:50.970> should<00:01:51.450> probably<00:01:51.840> beware

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
those collectors should probably beware

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.440 
those collectors should probably beware
of<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:52.740> table<00:01:53.159> because<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.790> might<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.420> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
of this table because it might be one of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.120 
of this table because it might be one of
those<00:01:54.630> tables<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.229> has<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> tendency<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
those tables that has a tendency to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.499 
those tables that has a tendency to
break<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> lot<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.000> say<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.360> because

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
break a lot and I say that because

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.359 
break a lot and I say that because
before<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.469> could<00:01:58.530> start<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.040> tournament

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
before they could start the tournament

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.280 
before they could start the tournament
they<00:01:59.670> had<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.969> repair<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> tables<00:02:01.110> it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
they had to repair one of the tables it

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.319 
they had to repair one of the tables it
was<00:02:01.409> broke<00:02:01.740> before<00:02:02.250> they<00:02:02.610> even<00:02:02.909> started<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
was broke before they even started the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.999 
was broke before they even started the
tournament<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.350> postponed<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
tournament and a postponed the

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.649 
tournament and a postponed the
tournament<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.579> think<00:02:05.610> almost<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.299> whole

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
tournament I think almost like a whole

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.139 
tournament I think almost like a whole
hour<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.350> yeah<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.489> one<00:02:08.700> might

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
hour so yeah you know this one might

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.790 
hour so yeah you know this one might
take<00:02:09.179> some<00:02:09.690> maintenance<00:02:09.959> quite<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> bit<00:02:10.709> of

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
take some maintenance quite a bit of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.010 
take some maintenance quite a bit of
maintenance<00:02:11.009> actually<00:02:11.640> I<00:02:11.670> don't<00:02:12.629> know<00:02:12.780> for

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
maintenance actually I don't know for

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.380 
maintenance actually I don't know for
sure

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
sure

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.790 
sure
that<00:02:13.480> wasn't<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> good<00:02:13.930> sign<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.380> me<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:14.530> it

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
that wasn't a good sign to me that it

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.470 
that wasn't a good sign to me that it
was<00:02:14.890> broke<00:02:15.160> before<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.700> tournament<00:02:16.150> as<00:02:16.240> far

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
was broke before the tournament as far

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.050 
was broke before the tournament as far
as<00:02:16.600> comparing<00:02:16.990> this<00:02:17.560> table<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.310> other<00:02:18.700> Stern

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
as comparing this table to other Stern

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.180 
as comparing this table to other Stern
tables<00:02:19.540> this<00:02:19.810> table<00:02:20.200> clearly<00:02:20.620> blows<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
tables this table clearly blows the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.250 
tables this table clearly blows the
Rolling<00:02:21.520> Stones<00:02:21.850> table<00:02:22.360> out<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.720> water<00:02:22.990> I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
Rolling Stones table out of the water I

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.780 
Rolling Stones table out of the water I
didn't<00:02:23.560> like<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.890> table<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.430> thought<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.700> was

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
didn't like that table I thought it was

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.699 
didn't like that table I thought it was
kind<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.000> cheesy<00:02:25.240> this<00:02:25.690> one<00:02:25.870> however<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.530> not

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
kind of cheesy this one however is not

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.350 
kind of cheesy this one however is not
this<00:02:27.069> one<00:02:27.220> play<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.490> better<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.209> better

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
this one play is better is it better

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.480 
this one play is better is it better
than<00:02:28.420> transformers<00:02:29.380> yeah<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.740> think<00:02:29.860> so

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
than transformers yeah I think so

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.370 
than transformers yeah I think so
although<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.820> did<00:02:31.060> think<00:02:31.090> transformers<00:02:31.930> was

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
although I did think transformers was

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.070 
although I did think transformers was
okay<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.100> really<00:02:34.000> enjoyed<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.420> Decepticon

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
okay I really enjoyed the Decepticon

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.560 
okay I really enjoyed the Decepticon
mode<00:02:35.380> on<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.740> table<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.250> whatnot<00:02:36.580> but<00:02:36.610> yeah

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
mode on that table and whatnot but yeah

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.510 
mode on that table and whatnot but yeah
better<00:02:37.870> than<00:02:37.959> transformers<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.100> just<00:02:39.310> has<00:02:39.489> a

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
better than transformers it just has a

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.820 
better than transformers it just has a
better<00:02:39.760> design<00:02:40.180> do<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.600> think<00:02:41.050> this<00:02:41.380> table<00:02:41.590> is

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
better design do I think this table is

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.250 
better design do I think this table is
better<00:02:42.040> than<00:02:42.340> Tron<00:02:42.700> no<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.209> don't<00:02:43.540> because<00:02:43.959> you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
better than Tron no I don't because you

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.560 
better than Tron no I don't because you
know<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.380> like<00:02:44.830> Tron<00:02:45.160> more<00:02:45.550> than<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.850> like<00:02:46.030> ac/dc

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
know I like Tron more than I like ac/dc

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.080 
know I like Tron more than I like ac/dc
yeah<00:02:46.989> I<00:02:47.020> know<00:02:47.200> Tron<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> movie<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.459> ac/dc<00:02:48.730> is

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
yeah I know Tron is a movie and ac/dc is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.240 
yeah I know Tron is a movie and ac/dc is
a<00:02:49.150> band<00:02:49.390> but<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.930> just<00:02:50.110> like<00:02:50.260> Tron<00:02:50.590> more<00:02:50.950> than<00:02:51.130> I

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
a band but I just like Tron more than I

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.690 
a band but I just like Tron more than I
like<00:02:51.400> ac/dc<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.380> think<00:02:53.650> that<00:02:53.860> Stern<00:02:54.340> really

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
like ac/dc and I think that Stern really

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.699 
like ac/dc and I think that Stern really
nailed<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.239> when<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.540> came<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.959> Tron<00:02:56.230> table

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
nailed it when it came to the Tron table

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.500 
nailed it when it came to the Tron table
but<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> also<00:02:57.190> think<00:02:57.550> that<00:02:57.700> overall<00:02:58.269> they

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
but I also think that overall they

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.690 
but I also think that overall they
really<00:02:58.810> nailed<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.650> ac/dc<00:02:59.980> table

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
really nailed it with the ac/dc table

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.640 
really nailed it with the ac/dc table
it's<00:03:00.970> an<00:03:01.090> excellent<00:03:01.510> table<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.290> feel<00:03:02.500> it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
it's an excellent table and I feel it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.650 
it's an excellent table and I feel it
pays<00:03:02.860> homage<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.400> one<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.000> most<00:03:04.330> well

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
pays homage to one of the most well

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.870 
pays homage to one of the most well
known<00:03:04.690> rock<00:03:05.290> bands<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.860> all<00:03:06.010> time<00:03:06.070> if<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.700> like

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
known rock bands of all time if you like

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.150 
known rock bands of all time if you like
ac/dc<00:03:07.450> or<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.050> like<00:03:08.230> pinball<00:03:08.680> or<00:03:08.709> you<00:03:08.980> like

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
ac/dc or you like pinball or you like

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.979 
ac/dc or you like pinball or you like
both<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.850> definitely<00:03:10.000> think<00:03:10.570> this<00:03:10.720> one<00:03:10.959> is

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
both and I definitely think this one is

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.810 
both and I definitely think this one is
worth<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.500> player<00:03:11.739> 10<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.310> know<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.670> it's

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
worth a player 10 I know that it's
