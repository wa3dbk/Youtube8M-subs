00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.679 
doing these like these these sitcoms and
you<00:01:34.770> create<00:01:35.189> these<00:01:35.430> characters<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.150> easy<00:01:36.420> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
you create these characters it's easy to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.240 
you create these characters it's easy to
like<00:01:36.840> sort<00:01:36.990> of<00:01:37.110> gravitate<00:01:37.590> toward<00:01:37.860> only<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
like sort of gravitate toward only the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.670 
like sort of gravitate toward only the
ones<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.970> really<00:01:39.210> make<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.570> laugh<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
ones that really make you laugh but the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
ones that really make you laugh but the
only<00:01:40.829> reason<00:01:40.950> those<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.610> making<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.939> laugh

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
only reason those are making you laugh

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.330 
only reason those are making you laugh
is<00:01:42.390> because<00:01:42.689> they<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:43.110> opposite<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.189> are

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is because they are opposite they are

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.630 
is because they are opposite they are
but<00:01:44.880> they're<00:01:45.320> rebutting<00:01:46.320> whatever<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.009> other

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
but they're rebutting whatever the other

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.219 
but they're rebutting whatever the other
characters<00:01:48.390> thanks<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> other<00:01:48.960> character

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
characters thanks the other character

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
characters thanks the other character
never<00:01:49.409> gets<00:01:49.590> any<00:01:49.770> any<00:01:50.070> attention<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.970> do

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
never gets any any attention so I do

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.380 
never gets any any attention so I do
think<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.579> pierces<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.610> character

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
think that that pierces the character

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
think that that pierces the character
Pierce<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.470> necessity<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> don't<00:01:56.430> know

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
Pierce is a necessity so I don't know

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.469 
Pierce is a necessity so I don't know
what<00:01:56.579> they're<00:01:56.610> going<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:56.969> exact<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.329> don't

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
what they're going to do exact I don't

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
what they're going to do exact I don't
they're<00:01:57.570> gonna<00:01:57.630> replace<00:01:57.840> him<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:59.070> right

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
they're gonna replace him and all right

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.490 
they're gonna replace him and all right
or<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.659> they're<00:02:00.810> gonna<00:02:00.869> just<00:02:01.290> write

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
or you know if they're gonna just write

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.660 
or you know if they're gonna just write
him<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.710> i<00:02:01.770> would<00:02:01.920> imagine<00:02:02.070> they've<00:02:02.520> just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
him out i would imagine they've just

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.609 
him out i would imagine they've just
ride<00:02:02.880> him<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.469> that's

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
ride him out but you know that's

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.620 
ride him out but you know that's
unfortunate<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.520> he<00:02:05.759> was<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.030> very

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
unfortunate because that he was a very

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.540 
unfortunate because that he was a very
important<00:02:07.140> element<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:08.129> opinion<00:02:08.399> so

important element in my opinion so
