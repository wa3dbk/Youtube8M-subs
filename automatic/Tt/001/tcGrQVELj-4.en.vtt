00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.170
 it's up to him everybody today 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.110
 finds himself for a new video to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.200
 training and I'm with man down 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.640
 hi guys then a bit special 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.230
 today we will meet for a 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.670
 video 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.350
 we will inform you about the war of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.029
 clans because for a while we've been there 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.130
 think about it and we start to see who 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.780
 could be part of a pretty 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.980
 good team 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.720
 for the moment she is a small list 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 we are about 9 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.670
 that is to say, there are six missing for 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.560
 to be 15 precisely here and we will have 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.420
 need not to recruit 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.980
 players who would be able to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.210
 to fight in the clan war 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.190
 so how's it going to be 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.180
 it's pretty simple at first we'll do 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.030
 that drives and the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 csars companies for frankly this 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 how to say that synchronize via itself 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.680
 synchronize so that everyone gets 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.450
 include that and bombay already 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.220
 really training it would have to be 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.220
 everyone goes up a branch 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 we'll give you the compo finally 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 I had the idea of â€‹â€‹a good compo 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.270
 for the clan war fired 10 then 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.409
 for going to have people rightly 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.049
 for for the team 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.250
 six people we open the candid ones 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.200
 applications and 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.670
 precisely so we would have to lose 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.380
 the people have to be minimal 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.030
 thousand deficit men also go 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.290
 search the internet to find the 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.910
 way to calculate it is pretty simple 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:43.360
 if you required at least one shot 8 9 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.850
 10 quiet to 8 9 10 or even nine 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.820
 lords and I have my client 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.620
 play the weekend they can 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 to talk on skype it's very important 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.140
 skype yes yes that would have a way of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.650
 communicate already the weekend not the night 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.630
 in the day jams the afternoon we go 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.590
 try on tournament schedules 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.530
 after that we'll see the time comes 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.179
 so already we will give the compo finally 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.940

 have a computer you turn to 5 fps but 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.070
 it's a bit so that in the 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.769
 candidly must do a 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.200
 impeccable thing to say hello

 get into the clan that's it you 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.400
 can drop 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.860
 and here I think we all said for 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.090
 so that sent the candidatures 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.510
 normally when you go to the page 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.680
 4 description you have a tab 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.010
 application or something like that 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.700
 click right me that it will not be great 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.960
 thing since all I have them 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.340
 nominations that I receive or that 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.530
 receives instead that we manage to 2 so that's it 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.080
 you can write and go away yes 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.010
 here 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.600
 Well, here we are, we all have good 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.260
 everything says ah yes a little thing too 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.160
 that I had not spoken about it on the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.980
 2 watt forum 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.350
 there is a page we will say where there is 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.710
 all the latest videos that I 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.400
 put on line 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.830
 so you can either talk to me like that 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.280
 have passed replays arm jerseys to 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.320
 tripe and giving details it's me 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.480
 can the cascades give us some 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.910
 replays can talk to give us 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.140
 advice because I think you 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.230
 would also be on the page you will look 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.970
 I think I'll say yes 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.920
 so here we do not hesitate to see them and 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.770
 review description I do not know if we 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.040
 can subscribe to the page I do not know 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.959
 will see 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.659
 but now I think we all 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.060
 said yes so here if you have a good 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.859
 level of shooting 10 and that you can 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.570
 talk play the weekend do not hesitate 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.699
 an even international of people 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.800
 we forgot a thing the composition of which 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.930
 I had spoken so I had yes I had 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.919
 a little thoughtful what would be good 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.880
 4 5 heavy tank shots including two 7 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:38.409
 200 and after take me 10 years 10 th 5 or 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.080
 or 2 10 in the running for five years 8 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:45.489
 5 medium of baigts with 2 or 3 beats of 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.509
 chÃ¢tillon after the other two of 

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:47.919
 others would have to have already left 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.949
 but good in the plan and I miss a 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.939
 a little bit of the craftsmen after what 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.239
 would be nice yeah so two bad chad 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:57.550
 for thighs costs 3 three mediums 

00:04:55.239 --> 00:05:01.419
 to see you two mediums is better avoided 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.539
 the patton is not super hot and 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.509
 take everything except that privileged either 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.039
 and 70 objects than 140 2 50 m 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.309
 good after all that is in English 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:16.149
 I could have dreamed of him 300 4 023 way 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:18.819
 and then there are three hunters of 

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:20.559
 tanks what would be good it would be good 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.550
 desjardins iad not happy without 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:28.729
 probably marcel foch 155 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.800
 that's for hammer and 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.990
 and yet another maybe a teyssen 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.120
 10th three or four that that 8 buddy 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.909
 could have and two artists yesterday 10 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.770
 or an article it depends on the composition 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.059
 but here it is, well, if you have 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.219
 articles do not hesitate when I 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:45.770
 for the moment it is that which is missing 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.259
 a giant all parties best confused 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.849
 it might be t 92 young people and if 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.849
 you have none it does not matter or who 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.259
 the French also serene French 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.919
 that's what it is to harass it's 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:00.129
 awesome but that's it if you shot 8 9 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:02.210
 10 more inclination towards a9 10 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:05.240
 frankly do not hesitate put your 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.969
 candidacy to have more than 2002 air du 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.979
 movie so be able to speak very important and 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:12.860
 can play the day and not the 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:15.310
 win but and we will say do not do 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.960
 only by the camps 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.540
 we give the instructions we make 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.830
 battles ie the stats in 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.200
 general we will maybe make two teams 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.840
 even three on the map it depends and 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.050
 I had a team and last day at 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.570
 the other one yes it will depend on the mapei 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.940
 of the layout finally it will be a time 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:37.090
 sees the earth strata in general it's 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.330
 I have everything he can probably 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.070
 black bleeding on myself mostly on 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.810
 the eight tank mates how to play 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.700
 etc. 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.320
 and here we had thought to make 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.480
 workouts or for example date where 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:52.300
 they would teach us to the whole team 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:55.090
 of which 15 people is ricochet the 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.430
 shots all the techniques that 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.230
 would better play and 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.270
 probably also to practice shooting 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.470
 in flight we will say when there are scouts 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.890
 that go all the senses it's also 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.720
 important 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.850
 so we'll see 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.590
 So now for the moment 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.840
 drive that's not for all 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.840
 if you do not hesitate to do a 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.850
 good candidacy and that's listening to a 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.350
 well here we managed everything that's a 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:25.030
 few people climb clan eyes 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:25.030
 is not bad go hi guys here
