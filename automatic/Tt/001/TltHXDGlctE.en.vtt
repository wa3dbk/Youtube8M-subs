you<00:02:35.540> know<00:02:35.660> instead<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.230> just<00:02:37.100> sticking<00:02:37.459> with

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
you know instead of just sticking with

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.789 
you know instead of just sticking with

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
the traditional stuff and I think it

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.770 
the traditional stuff and I think it
pays<00:02:40.040> off<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.610> did<00:02:40.820> a<00:02:40.850> lot<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.120> stuff<00:02:41.390> with<00:02:41.510> band

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
pays off I did a lot of stuff with band

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.490 
pays off I did a lot of stuff with band
tension<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.500> lot<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.070> stuff<00:02:43.250> with<00:02:43.400> chains<00:02:44.500> even

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
tension a lot of stuff with chains even

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.009 
tension a lot of stuff with chains even
more<00:02:45.709> than<00:02:45.890> I've<00:02:45.980> ever<00:02:46.010> done<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.299> think<00:02:47.600> you

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
more than I've ever done and I think you

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.170 
more than I've ever done and I think you
know<00:02:48.080> I<00:02:48.170> think<00:02:48.320> that's<00:02:48.680> really<00:02:49.130> carried<00:02:50.030> over

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
know I think that's really carried over

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.870 
know I think that's really carried over
both<00:02:50.480> to<00:02:50.600> my<00:02:50.720> overhead<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.380> my<00:02:51.620> deadlift<00:02:52.010> and

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
both to my overhead and my deadlift and

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.630 
both to my overhead and my deadlift and
I<00:02:53.480> actually<00:02:54.290> squatted<00:02:54.890> more<00:02:55.070> than<00:02:55.250> I<00:02:55.340> ever<00:02:55.370> had

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
I actually squatted more than I ever had
