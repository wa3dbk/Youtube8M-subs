colossal<00:00:27.029> cannons<00:00:28.369> actually<00:00:29.369> try<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.550> once

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
colossal cannons actually try this once

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.790 
colossal cannons actually try this once
before<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.480> capture<00:00:31.080> software<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
before but the capture software is a

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.200 
before but the capture software is a
piece<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> crap<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:34.460> kept<00:00:35.460> locking<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:36.000> for

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
piece of crap so it kept locking up for

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.860 
piece of crap so it kept locking up for
three<00:00:36.930> seconds<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.410> more<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.510> I'm<00:00:39.510> going<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
three seconds or more so I'm going to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.230 
three seconds or more so I'm going to
try<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.140> again

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.130
