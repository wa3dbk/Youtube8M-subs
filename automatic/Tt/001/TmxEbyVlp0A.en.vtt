pretty<00:01:25.290> interesting<00:01:25.710> game<00:01:25.890> looked<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.340> the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
also again thinking of revisiting some

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.800 
also again thinking of revisiting some
of<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.819> games<00:02:50.030> that<00:02:50.150> are<00:02:50.299> currently<00:02:50.569> in<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
of the games that are currently in the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.080 
of the games that are currently in the
betas<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.200> or<00:02:51.680> taking<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.190> look<00:02:52.400> at<00:02:52.549> games<00:02:52.819> that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
betas and or taking a look at games that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.670 
betas and or taking a look at games that
I<00:02:53.120> plan<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.510> take<00:02:53.690> a<00:02:53.840> look<00:02:54.019> at<00:02:54.170> but<00:02:54.380> never<00:02:54.500> get

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
I plan to take a look at but never get

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
I plan to take a look at but never get
around<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.430> then<00:02:56.060> yeah<00:02:56.750> well<00:02:57.019> I<00:02:57.049> guess

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
around to and then yeah well I guess

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.140 
around to and then yeah well I guess
that's<00:02:57.440> basically<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:58.819> it's<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:59.030> pretty

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
that's basically it so it's a pretty

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.930 
that's basically it so it's a pretty
slow<00:02:59.510> weekend<00:02:59.930> in<00:03:00.230> terms<00:03:00.530> of<00:03:00.680> new<00:03:00.860> content<00:03:01.130> but

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
slow weekend in terms of new content but

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.770 
slow weekend in terms of new content but
I<00:03:01.970> think<00:03:02.239> it's<00:03:02.360> going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.540> be<00:03:02.599> good

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
I think it's going to be good

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.479 
I think it's going to be good
opportunity<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.410> catch<00:03:03.590> up<00:03:03.799> on<00:03:03.920> things<00:03:03.980> and

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
opportunity to catch up on things and

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.820 
opportunity to catch up on things and
like<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.180> said<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.510> just<00:03:05.690> sort<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.349> get<00:03:06.470> back<00:03:06.650> into

like I said I just sort of get back into
the<00:03:06.920> swing<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.160> things<00:03:07.280> with<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.700> force<00:03:07.970> feed

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
the swing of things with the force feed

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.059 
the swing of things with the force feed
and<00:03:08.390> all<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.720> regular<00:03:09.140> content<00:03:09.590> here<00:03:09.920> on

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
and all of the regular content here on

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.740 
and all of the regular content here on
the<00:03:10.190> channel<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.790> with<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.330> guess<00:03:11.569> we'll

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
the channel and with that I guess we'll

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.870 
the channel and with that I guess we'll
go<00:03:11.900> ahead<00:03:12.049> and<00:03:12.200> wrap<00:03:12.590> up<00:03:12.620> this<00:03:13.010> update<00:03:13.519> video

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
go ahead and wrap up this update video

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.339 
go ahead and wrap up this update video
pretty<00:03:14.209> brief<00:03:14.450> one<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.780> time<00:03:14.930> around<00:03:15.110> but

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
pretty brief one this time around but

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.289 
pretty brief one this time around but
again<00:03:15.560> it<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.950> very<00:03:16.160> slow<00:03:16.430> week<00:03:16.790> so<00:03:17.090> that's

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
again it is a very slow week so that's

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.780 
again it is a very slow week so that's
pretty<00:03:17.540> much<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:18.079> be<00:03:18.230> expected<00:03:18.920> hopefully

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
pretty much to be expected hopefully

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.280 
pretty much to be expected hopefully
