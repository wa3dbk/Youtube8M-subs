versions so what I chose the horizontal
six<00:00:36.390> by<00:00:36.540> one<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.110> I'm<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> settings

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
six by one so I'm in the settings

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.069 
six by one so I'm in the settings
actually<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.210> did<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.989> actually

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
actually what I did but you can actually

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.750 
actually what I did but you can actually
set<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.410> any<00:00:40.590> way<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> want<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:41.670> how

set this any way you want so that's how

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.700 
set this any way you want so that's how
basically<00:00:42.329> looks<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.570> stop<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.530> don't

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
basically looks like stop but we don't

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.779 
basically looks like stop but we don't
want<00:00:43.860> something<00:00:44.010> like<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.520> I'll<00:00:44.760> show

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
want something like that so I'll show

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.990 
want something like that so I'll show
you<00:00:44.940> what<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> did<00:00:46.219> first<00:00:47.219> thing<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.520> did<00:00:47.730> was

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you what I did first thing I did was

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.350 
you what I did first thing I did was
actually<00:00:49.340> unchecked<00:00:50.340> show<00:00:50.579> background<00:00:51.059> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
actually unchecked show background so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.020 
actually unchecked show background so
it's<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> clear<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
it's actually a clear so that kind of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's actually a clear so that kind of
makes<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.750> transparent<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
makes a transparent and I think that

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
makes a transparent and I think that
looks<00:00:56.129> better<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.550> general<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.270> can<00:00:57.420> do

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
looks better in general but you can do

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.599 
looks better in general but you can do
what<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.530> I've<00:00:59.430> chosen

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
what you like one really and I've chosen

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.520 
what you like one really and I've chosen
the<00:00:59.760> custom<00:01:00.059> layout<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.170> first<00:01:01.410> one

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the custom layout here so the first one

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 
the custom layout here so the first one
I've<00:01:01.649> got<00:01:01.710> an<00:01:01.890> hour<00:01:02.100> text<00:01:02.460> 12<00:01:03.090> hours<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.600> then

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
I've got an hour text 12 hours and then

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
I've got an hour text 12 hours and then
I've<00:01:04.110> got<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.409> minute<00:01:04.710> text<00:01:04.949> part<00:01:05.850> 1<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.210> minute

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
I've got a minute text part 1 a minute

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.260 
I've got a minute text part 1 a minute
text<00:01:06.630> part<00:01:06.930> 2<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.100> first<00:01:08.310> hour<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:09.030> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
text part 2 so the first hour one is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.260 
text part 2 so the first hour one is
just<00:01:09.630> default<00:01:10.619> style<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> first

the<00:01:32.520> third<00:01:32.549> one<00:01:33.320> 59<00:01:34.320> @<00:01:34.680> d<00:01:34.829> IP<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.509> two<00:01:36.509> pixel

the third one 59 @ d IP and two pixel

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
the third one 59 @ d IP and two pixel
radius<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.350> all<00:01:37.470> blissed<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.890> once<00:01:38.100> again<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
radius and all blissed I once again and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.280 
radius and all blissed I once again and
I<00:01:38.939> change<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.270> fill<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.750> black<00:01:40.049> color

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
I change the fill on to a black color

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
I change the fill on to a black color
just<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> make<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.799> look<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.159> bit<00:01:41.310> different<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
just to make it look a bit different so

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.850 
just to make it look a bit different so
what<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> blur<00:01:42.659> radius<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.530> does<00:01:43.710> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
what the blur radius actually does it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
what the blur radius actually does it
kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.070> makes<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.460> softer<00:01:44.820> edge<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
kind of makes it a softer edge so it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
kind of makes it a softer edge so it
looks<00:01:46.490> kind<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> blends<00:01:47.729> into<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> background

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
looks kind of blends into the background

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.270 
looks kind of blends into the background
that<00:01:48.509> one<00:01:48.689> looks<00:01:48.990> better<00:01:49.140> such<00:01:50.070> thing<00:01:50.220> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
that one looks better such thing you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.270 
that one looks better such thing you
want<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.430> do<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.360> custom<00:01:52.320> slider<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
want to do is get a custom slider so you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.300 
want to do is get a custom slider so you
can<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.579> go<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> Google<00:01:54.600> search<00:01:54.960> XDA

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
can just go to Google search XDA

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.499 
can just go to Google search XDA
clustering<00:01:56.310> themes<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.000> then<00:01:57.149> you'll<00:01:57.329> get

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
clustering themes and then you'll get

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.120 
clustering themes and then you'll get
custom<00:01:57.840> sliders<00:01:58.170> pretty<00:01:58.350> much<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.860> what<00:01:59.009> I'm

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
custom sliders pretty much and what I'm

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
custom sliders pretty much and what I'm
using<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.579> called<00:02:01.280> white<00:02:02.280> bar<00:02:02.820> okay<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.659> this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
using is called white bar okay so this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.780 
using is called white bar okay so this
is<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.079> another<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.829> they<00:02:04.979> can<00:02:05.159> build

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
is just another one so they can build

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.280 
is just another one so they can build
looks<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.240> basically<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.810> don't

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
looks like that basically but we don't

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.660 
looks like that basically but we don't
want<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.469> one<00:02:07.680> so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
want that one so

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.889 
want that one so
when<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.819> set<00:02:10.030> up<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.149> white<00:02:10.420> ball<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:10.840> a

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
when you set up the white ball and a

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.720 
when you set up the white ball and a
pretty<00:02:11.050> much<00:02:11.200> knows<00:02:11.380> where<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.620> go<00:02:11.830> so<00:02:12.280> once

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
pretty much knows where to go so once

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.190 
pretty much knows where to go so once
your<00:02:12.880> drag<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.240> drop<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.390> should<00:02:13.750> work<00:02:13.990> out

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
your drag and drop it should work out

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.030 
your drag and drop it should work out
and<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.400> that's<00:02:15.520> what<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:15.730> chose<00:02:16.000> and<00:02:17.040> next

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
and so that's what I chose and next

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.770 
and so that's what I chose and next
thing<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.280> want<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.490> do<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.880> set<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.540> your

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
thing you want to do is set up your

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.490 
thing you want to do is set up your
widget<00:02:20.170> locker<00:02:21.390> grid<00:02:22.390> size<00:02:22.630> I've<00:02:22.930> done<00:02:23.110> six<00:02:23.380> by

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
widget locker grid size I've done six by

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.860 
widget locker grid size I've done six by
seven<00:02:24.390> but<00:02:25.390> actually<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.750> should<00:02:25.840> probably

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
seven but actually you should probably

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.650 
seven but actually you should probably
do<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.170> first<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:26.980> yeah<00:02:27.430> six<00:02:28.270> by<00:02:28.390> seven

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
do this first but yeah six by seven

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.229 
do this first but yeah six by seven
works<00:02:28.810> well<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:30.250> also<00:02:30.280> want<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.180> make

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
works well and you also want to make

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.760 
works well and you also want to make
sure<00:02:31.300> you<00:02:31.660> are<00:02:31.780> alternative<00:02:32.350> wallpaper

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
sure you are alternative wallpaper

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.920 
sure you are alternative wallpaper
setting<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.489> unchecked<00:02:34.060> because<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
setting is unchecked because then the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.479 
setting is unchecked because then the
background<00:02:35.290> comes<00:02:35.530> through<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.220> kind

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
background comes through and it's kind

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.760 
background comes through and it's kind
of<00:02:36.520> transfer<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.510> I've<00:02:37.600> chosen<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.380> zoom

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
of transfer and I've chosen a zoom

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.170 
of transfer and I've chosen a zoom
effect<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.250> when<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.459> unlock<00:02:39.730> everything

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
effect so when you unlock everything

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.240 
effect so when you unlock everything
kind<00:02:40.450> of<00:02:40.540> dreams<00:02:40.750> up<00:02:40.930> in<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.380> I<00:02:41.980> think<00:02:42.160> that

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
kind of dreams up in and I think that

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.060 
kind of dreams up in and I think that
looks<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.519> good<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.660> I'm<00:02:43.950> once<00:02:44.950> you've

kind of has a virtual world that changes
time<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.950> day<00:02:57.130> depending<00:02:57.670> on<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> actual

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
time of day depending on the actual

time of day depending on the actual
real-world<00:02:58.480> time<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:58.989> day<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.310> basically<00:03:00.310> if

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
real-world time of day so basically if

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
day and you see what I'm in a second so

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.020 
day and you see what I'm in a second so
this<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.620> fast<00:03:06.069> day<00:03:06.250> setting<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.730> it's<00:03:06.850> kind

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
this is a fast day setting so it's kind

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.059 
this is a fast day setting so it's kind
of<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.180> test<00:03:07.420> your<00:03:07.540> colors<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.989> see<00:03:08.200> if<00:03:08.530> they

of to test your colors to see if they
look<00:03:09.220> realistic<00:03:09.700> or<00:03:09.760> whatever<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.030> can

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
look realistic or whatever you can

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.210 
look realistic or whatever you can
choose<00:03:10.330> custom<00:03:10.690> cards<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:10.989> they're<00:03:11.110> not<00:03:11.350> so

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
choose custom cards but they're not so

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.009 
choose custom cards but they're not so
I'm<00:03:12.400> yeah<00:03:12.970> it<00:03:13.030> will<00:03:13.209> go<00:03:13.390> through<00:03:13.630> this<00:03:13.780> cycle

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
I'm yeah it will go through this cycle

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.270 
I'm yeah it will go through this cycle
and<00:03:14.320> it's<00:03:14.500> pretty<00:03:14.590> cool<00:03:14.769> because<00:03:15.010> every<00:03:15.250> time

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
and it's pretty cool because every time

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.830 
and it's pretty cool because every time
you<00:03:15.489> look<00:03:15.640> at<00:03:15.700> your<00:03:15.760> phone<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:16.420> kind<00:03:16.660> of<00:03:16.720> like

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
you look at your phone it's kind of like

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.180 
you look at your phone it's kind of like
a<00:03:16.900> massive<00:03:17.380> clock<00:03:17.650> because<00:03:17.829> you<00:03:17.890> can<00:03:18.010> kind<00:03:18.160> of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
a massive clock because you can kind of

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.650 
a massive clock because you can kind of
tell<00:03:18.400> already<00:03:18.610> what<00:03:18.970> roughly<00:03:19.329> what<00:03:19.480> time<00:03:19.510> of

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
tell already what roughly what time of

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.229 
tell already what roughly what time of
day<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:20.200> because<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:21.040> Sun<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:21.940> that's<00:03:22.090> pretty

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
day is because the Sun so that's pretty

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.150 
day is because the Sun so that's pretty
cool<00:03:23.790> expanding<00:03:24.790> on<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.260> another<00:03:26.260> live

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
cool expanding on that another live
