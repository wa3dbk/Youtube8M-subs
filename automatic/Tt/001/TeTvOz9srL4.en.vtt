00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.269
 dream that happened that suddenly something 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.440
 it happened today this morning something summer I 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.319
 It can happen 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.550
 today something big is not going to happen 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.730
 will break in the emotional area 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.769
 spiritual physical in the area maybe 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.630

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.000

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.269
 when I adore it is a spiritual art 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:38.080
 where it breaks that is something where God 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.800
 Sometimes the art of you is the art of worshiping 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.050
 of your spirit 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.020

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.530
 that stillness in that cinema suddenly 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.830
 start to inquire 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.100
 and start thinking start to introduce 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.770
 you start to look deep into 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.950
 God could I say no to think about you 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.170
 but thinking about it is an art where 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.000
 begins the domain where the mind 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.920
 it does not go away on one side and it's already going 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.650
 the other side and it goes away so that the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.069
 problem no no it is not an art to captivate 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.430
 the include introduce the spirit in 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.859

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.810
 birds of prey I will not allow 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.750
