we're<00:01:56.789> going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.329> twice<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.899> it's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
we're going to do this twice and it's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.149 
we're going to do this twice and it's
just<00:01:58.109> going<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.320> create<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.829> bit<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.039> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
just going to create a little bit of a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.300 
just going to create a little bit of a
background<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.149> larger<00:02:00.539> design<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:01.020> top

background for the larger design on top
so<00:02:02.310> just<00:02:02.549> repeat<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.820> design<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.600> can<00:02:03.630> kind

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:04.499 
so just repeat the design you can kind

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.929 
so just repeat the design you can kind
of<00:02:04.560> flip<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.920> around<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.460> cover<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.789> little

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
of flip it around so you cover a little

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.520 
of flip it around so you cover a little
bit<00:02:06.090> more<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.479> your<00:02:06.539> nail<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.259> doesn't

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
bit more of your nail but it doesn't

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
and I think this time I put it right at

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:57.430 
and I think this time I put it right at
the<00:04:47.930> tip<00:04:48.169> of<00:04:48.229> my<00:04:48.379> nail<00:04:48.680> near<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.580> bottom

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.120 

and<00:04:58.400> I<00:04:59.150> think<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.480> looks<00:04:59.780> pretty<00:05:00.320> good<00:05:00.500> I

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.130 
and I think that looks pretty good I

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.890 
and I think that looks pretty good I
think<00:05:01.730> I'm<00:05:01.850> going<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.060> put<00:05:02.240> one<00:05:02.270> more<00:05:02.600> pink

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
think I'm going to put one more pink

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.570 
think I'm going to put one more pink
flower<00:05:03.080> just<00:05:03.380> in<00:05:03.500> the<00:05:03.590> top<00:05:03.830> corner<00:05:04.160> because<00:05:04.430> it

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
flower just in the top corner because it

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:20.120 
flower just in the top corner because it
looks<00:05:04.760> a<00:05:04.880> little<00:05:05.030> lonely<00:05:05.390> there

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.860 

and<00:05:21.130> so<00:05:21.760> I'm<00:05:21.850> just<00:05:21.940> going<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.210> place<00:05:22.420> this<00:05:22.630> pink

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
and so I'm just going to place this pink

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.839 
and so I'm just going to place this pink
one

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:29.849 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.619 

right<00:05:30.809> around<00:05:31.229> there<00:05:31.559> and<00:05:32.459> we've<00:05:32.999> let<00:05:33.209> the<00:05:33.330> dry

layer<00:05:36.360> of<00:05:36.419> top<00:05:36.809> coat<00:05:36.839> to<00:05:37.110> help<00:05:37.889> seal<00:05:38.159> in<00:05:38.309> the

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:38.339 
layer of top coat to help seal in the

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:44.679 
layer of top coat to help seal in the
design<00:05:39.949> today<00:05:40.949> I'm<00:05:41.399> using<00:05:41.429> C<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.389> D<00:05:42.539> air<00:05:42.809> dry

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.869 
design today I'm using C and D air dry
which<00:05:45.689> I<00:05:45.869> really<00:05:46.139> like<00:05:46.379> for<00:05:46.589> stamping<00:05:46.879> because

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879 
which I really like for stamping because

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.760 
which I really like for stamping because
it's<00:05:47.999> got<00:05:48.119> a<00:05:48.149> really<00:05:48.539> nice<00:05:48.809> soft<00:05:49.199> flexible

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
it's got a really nice soft flexible

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.100 
it's got a really nice soft flexible
brush<00:05:50.039> which<00:05:50.939> helps<00:05:51.360> prevent<00:05:52.289> any<00:05:52.729> streaking

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
brush which helps prevent any streaking

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.010 
brush which helps prevent any streaking
of<00:05:55.110> your<00:05:55.830> stamping<00:05:57.649> and<00:05:58.729> that<00:05:59.729> isn't<00:06:00.029> I<00:06:00.270> hope
