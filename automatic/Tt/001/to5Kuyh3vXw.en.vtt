that's what we have over here and it's a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670 
that's what we have over here and it's a
three<00:00:32.160> channel<00:00:32.489> control<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.870> one

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
three channel control so you have one

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
three channel control so you have one
this<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.250> throttle<00:00:35.610> stick<00:00:36.050> spring-loaded

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this is the throttle stick spring-loaded

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.770 
this is the throttle stick spring-loaded
throttle<00:00:37.530> okay<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.700> safety<00:00:39.000> feature<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
throttle okay as a safety feature it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.250 
throttle okay as a safety feature it
returns<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.059> local<00:00:42.059> off<00:00:42.210> position<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.870> if

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
returns to the local off position so if

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889 
returns to the local off position so if
you<00:00:43.440> drop<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.489> transmitter<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.300> somebody

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
you drop the transmitter or somebody

Billy starts fighting with Suzy you drop
the<00:00:48.270> transmitter<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.500> will<00:00:49.710> drop<00:00:50.010> down

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the transmitter then this will drop down

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.639 
the transmitter then this will drop down
to<00:00:50.280> zero<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.420> helicopter<00:00:52.110> will<00:00:52.230> come<00:00:52.440> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
to zero and the helicopter will come to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.180 
to zero and the helicopter will come to
come<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> ground<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.920> our<00:00:56.039> other

come to the ground and this is our other
selector<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.390> lets<00:00:57.660> us<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.989> either<00:00:58.440> forward

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
selector this lets us go either forward

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.729 
selector this lets us go either forward
or<00:00:59.039> backward<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.670> spin<00:01:00.329> left<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:00.989> so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
selector up here this is a little

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380 
selector up here this is a little
misleading<00:01:13.590> because<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> says<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.640> B<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> C<00:01:15.240> up

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
misleading because it says a B and C up

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
misleading because it says a B and C up
here<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.110> there's<00:01:16.259> actually<00:01:16.590> only<00:01:16.680> two

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
here but there's actually only two

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.700 
here but there's actually only two
selectable<00:01:17.520> frequency<00:01:18.060> bands<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.500> turns

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
selectable frequency bands and it turns

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.530 
selectable frequency bands and it turns
out<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.070> case<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.210> one<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
to either in the frequencies okay so

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
to either in the frequencies okay so
what<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.200> oh<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.040> should<00:01:29.460> also<00:01:29.579> say<00:01:29.729> here

and then we turn the toy on there's a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.870 
and then we turn the toy on there's a
switch<00:01:51.180> on<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.420> helicopter<00:01:51.990> there<00:01:52.620> we<00:01:52.710> go

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
switch on the helicopter there we go

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:32.620 
switch on the helicopter there we go
okay<00:01:53.910> thrust

battery maybe maybe you don't have
enough<00:02:54.570> battery<00:02:55.020> power<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.410> really<00:02:55.800> fly<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
enough battery power to really fly the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.010 
enough battery power to really fly the
helicopter<00:02:56.790> in<00:02:57.150> fact<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.540> lights<00:02:57.750> are<00:02:57.930> on

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:05:48.249 

what's<00:04:41.870> wrong<00:04:44.500> here<00:04:45.500> we<00:04:45.620> go

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.719 

well<00:05:49.259> we're<00:05:49.709> waiting<00:05:49.949> for<00:05:49.979> a<00:05:50.129> helicopter<00:05:50.399> to

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
well we're waiting for a helicopter to

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.029 
well we're waiting for a helicopter to
recharge<00:05:51.209> again<00:05:51.389> it's<00:05:52.379> a<00:05:52.439> couple<00:05:52.709> things<00:05:52.799> to

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
recharge again it's a couple things to

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.219 
recharge again it's a couple things to
mention<00:05:53.219> and<00:05:53.939> this<00:05:54.329> really<00:05:54.599> is<00:05:54.719> an<00:05:54.839> infrared

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
mention and this really is an infrared

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.919 
mention and this really is an infrared
transmitter<00:05:55.979> not<00:05:56.729> a<00:05:56.759> not<00:05:57.239> an<00:05:57.360> FM<00:05:57.689> radio

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:57.929 
transmitter not a not an FM radio

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:00.169 
transmitter not a not an FM radio
transmitter<00:05:58.649> so<00:05:59.219> that<00:05:59.249> means<00:05:59.879> that<00:06:00.089> this

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:00.179 
transmitter so that means that this

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:02.419 
transmitter so that means that this
helicopter<00:06:00.659> is<00:06:01.079> really<00:06:01.499> designed<00:06:01.679> to<00:06:02.069> be<00:06:02.189> used

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:02.429 
helicopter is really designed to be used

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:05.959 
helicopter is really designed to be used
inside<00:06:03.089> and<00:06:03.449> not<00:06:03.629> outdoors<00:06:04.289> you<00:06:05.219> can<00:06:05.519> fly<00:06:05.909> it

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
inside and not outdoors you can fly it

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.199 
inside and not outdoors you can fly it
outdoors<00:06:06.409> but<00:06:07.409> sunlight<00:06:08.099> interferes<00:06:08.819> with

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:09.209 
outdoors but sunlight interferes with

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:12.079 
outdoors but sunlight interferes with
the<00:06:09.539> signal<00:06:10.529> so<00:06:11.039> you<00:06:11.459> will<00:06:11.579> tend<00:06:11.789> to<00:06:11.909> lose

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.089 
the signal so you will tend to lose

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.469 
the signal so you will tend to lose
control<00:06:12.629> of<00:06:12.659> it<00:06:12.989> outside<00:06:13.909> even<00:06:14.909> if<00:06:15.149> it's<00:06:15.269> kind

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
control of it outside even if it's kind

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:18.109 
control of it outside even if it's kind
of<00:06:15.539> overcast<00:06:16.049> or<00:06:16.319> cloudy<00:06:16.559> outside<00:06:17.099> you<00:06:17.969> can

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:18.119 
of overcast or cloudy outside you can

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.179 
of overcast or cloudy outside you can
lose<00:06:18.329> control<00:06:18.749> of<00:06:18.779> the<00:06:18.989> helicopter<00:06:19.169> if<00:06:19.769> it

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
lose control of the helicopter if it

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:22.359 
lose control of the helicopter if it
gets<00:06:20.369> more<00:06:20.579> than<00:06:20.639> a<00:06:20.789> few<00:06:21.059> feet<00:06:21.209> away<00:06:21.360> from<00:06:21.719> you

00:06:22.359 --> 00:06:22.369 
gets more than a few feet away from you

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:24.949 
gets more than a few feet away from you
the<00:06:23.369> other<00:06:23.489> thing<00:06:23.699> is<00:06:23.819> of<00:06:23.849> course<00:06:24.029> this<00:06:24.809> is

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:24.959 
the other thing is of course this is

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:26.839 
the other thing is of course this is
very<00:06:25.019> small<00:06:25.529> and<00:06:25.829> lightweight<00:06:26.009> so<00:06:26.669> it's

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
very small and lightweight so it's

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.909 
very small and lightweight so it's
pretty<00:06:27.089> susceptible<00:06:27.419> to<00:06:27.779> winds<00:06:28.169> even<00:06:28.499> very

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
pretty susceptible to winds even very

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:30.589 
pretty susceptible to winds even very
light<00:06:29.189> winds<00:06:29.459> will<00:06:29.699> tend<00:06:29.909> to<00:06:30.029> carry<00:06:30.269> it<00:06:30.449> away

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
light winds will tend to carry it away

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.659 
light winds will tend to carry it away
and<00:06:31.169> you<00:06:31.589> can<00:06:31.709> see<00:06:31.889> that<00:06:32.069> some<00:06:32.309> footage<00:06:32.639> that

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:32.669 
and you can see that some footage that

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.600 
and you can see that some footage that
we<00:06:32.999> have<00:06:33.179> coming<00:06:33.419> up<00:06:33.599> from<00:06:33.779> outside<00:06:34.459> but<00:06:35.459> you

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
we have coming up from outside but you

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.909 
we have coming up from outside but you
can<00:06:35.789> do<00:06:35.969> it<00:06:36.059> outside<00:06:36.209> but<00:06:36.929> if<00:06:37.169> you<00:06:37.319> do<00:06:37.529> it

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
can do it outside but if you do it

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:40.159 
can do it outside but if you do it
really<00:06:38.159> best<00:06:38.459> to<00:06:38.639> stick<00:06:39.179> to<00:06:39.360> flying<00:06:39.569> at<00:06:39.839> dusk

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:40.169 
really best to stick to flying at dusk

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.679 
really best to stick to flying at dusk
and<00:06:40.499> when<00:06:40.769> there's<00:06:40.979> no<00:06:41.369> wind<00:06:41.579> you<00:06:42.509> have<00:06:42.539> a

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
and when there's no wind you have a

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:44.299 
and when there's no wind you have a
better<00:06:42.929> better<00:06:43.319> luck<00:06:43.529> with<00:06:43.649> it<00:06:43.799> that<00:06:43.979> way<00:06:44.129> and

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:44.309 
better better luck with it that way and

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.859 
better better luck with it that way and
of<00:06:44.669> course<00:06:44.819> obviously<00:06:45.239> for<00:06:45.449> the<00:06:45.509> most<00:06:45.659> part

00:06:45.859 --> 00:06:45.869 
of course obviously for the most part

00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:48.199 
of course obviously for the most part
fly<00:06:46.439> it<00:06:46.499> indoors<00:06:46.889> do<00:06:47.610> you<00:06:47.669> want<00:06:47.849> more<00:06:47.939> space

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:48.209 
fly it indoors do you want more space

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:52.129 
fly it indoors do you want more space
see<00:06:48.989> if<00:06:49.050> you<00:06:49.139> can<00:06:49.259> find<00:06:49.379> it<00:06:49.529> gymnasium
