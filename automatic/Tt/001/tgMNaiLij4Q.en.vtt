00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.459 
squirts in it so you just go one one two
oh<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.369> was<00:02:02.520> big<00:02:02.759> but<00:02:03.259> normally<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.350> do

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
oh that was big but normally you do

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.840 
oh that was big but normally you do
smaller<00:02:04.770> ones<00:02:04.979> than<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.640> three

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
smaller ones than that and you do three

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.749 
smaller ones than that and you do three
but<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.600> one<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:06.930> really<00:02:07.140> like<00:02:07.409> three<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
but that one was really like three so I

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.430 
but that one was really like three so I
just<00:02:09.119> did<00:02:09.270> -<00:02:09.390> no<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.989> used

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
just did - no because I used

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.130 
just did - no because I used
much<00:02:10.910> but<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.150> think<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.600> all<00:02:12.630> affected

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
much but I don't think that all affected

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.960 
much but I don't think that all affected
now<00:02:13.710> what<00:02:13.890> you're<00:02:14.070> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> do<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:14.760> fill

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970

now what you're going to do is just fill
the<00:02:15.180> rest<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> way<00:02:16.790> with<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.910> water<00:02:18.740> put

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
the rest of the way with the water put

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.200 
the rest of the way with the water put
the<00:02:19.860> cap<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:22.340> shake<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.490> to<00:02:23.580> dry<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.790> off<00:02:23.940> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
shaken it all up okay so see all those

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.450 
shaken it all up okay so see all those
little<00:02:39.750> floaty<00:02:40.110> thingies<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:40.860> that<00:02:41.310> is

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
little floaty thingies in there that is

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.250 
little floaty thingies in there that is
what<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.790> do<00:02:41.970> not<00:02:42.120> want<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.840> want<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.080> shake

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
what you do not want you want to shake

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.540 
what you do not want you want to shake
it<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.500> point<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.860> there<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.190> none<00:02:44.520> of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
it to the point that there is none of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.630 
it to the point that there is none of
that<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:45.060> there<00:02:45.530> because<00:02:46.530> chunks<00:02:47.190> will<00:02:47.370> clog

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
that in there because chunks will clog

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.310 
that in there because chunks will clog
it<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.060> do<00:02:48.240> not<00:02:48.390> want<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.960> then<00:02:49.080> it

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
it and you do not want that and then it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.940 
it and you do not want that and then it
won't<00:02:49.470> work

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
won't work

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.070 
won't work
so<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.150> want<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.360> get<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.750> point<00:02:51.930> that

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
so you want to get to the point that

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.190 
so you want to get to the point that
it's<00:02:52.410> not<00:02:53.240> it<00:02:54.240> doesn't<00:02:54.660> have<00:02:54.690> any<00:02:54.930> little

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
it's not it doesn't have any little

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.190 
it's not it doesn't have any little
chunks<00:02:55.530> in<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:56.150> okay<00:02:57.150> guys<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.020> can<00:02:58.140> see

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
chunks in it okay guys so as you can see

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.650 
chunks in it okay guys so as you can see
there<00:02:59.070> are<00:02:59.250> not<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.550> many<00:02:59.670> flowy<00:03:00.270> thingies

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
there are not that many flowy thingies

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.220 
there are not that many flowy thingies
in<00:03:00.690> mind<00:03:01.020> now<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:02.450> just<00:03:03.450> keep<00:03:03.660> shaking<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
in mind now so just keep shaking it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.310 
in mind now so just keep shaking it
until<00:03:04.740> there<00:03:05.220> are<00:03:05.400> none<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:06.020> think<00:03:07.020> I<00:03:07.260> don't

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
until there are none I think I don't

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.900 
until there are none I think I don't
need<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.740> shake<00:03:07.890> mine<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> little<00:03:08.250> bit<00:03:08.460> more
