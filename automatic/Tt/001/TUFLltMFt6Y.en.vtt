hitting the bottom and some swells try a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.630 
hitting the bottom and some swells try a
spot<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.920> if<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.070> doesn't<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:08.460> very

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
spot here and if it doesn't go down very

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.660 
spot here and if it doesn't go down very
well<00:01:09.590> just<00:01:10.590> try<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.830> again<00:01:10.920> move<00:01:11.369> over<00:01:11.640> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
well just try it again move over a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.250 
well just try it again move over a
couple<00:01:11.880> feet<00:01:12.180> maybe<00:01:12.659> you'll<00:01:12.810> find<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> good

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
couple feet maybe you'll find a good

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.760 
couple feet maybe you'll find a good
spot

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
spot

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.990 
spot
the<00:01:13.860> other<00:01:13.950> thing<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.490> want<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.790> sure

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the other thing is you want to make sure

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you get the screw going down straight

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.359 
you get the screw going down straight
you<00:01:16.950> don't<00:01:17.070> want<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> going<00:01:18.479> down<00:01:18.630> at<00:01:18.840> an<00:01:18.960> angle

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
you don't want it going down at an angle

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.380 
you don't want it going down at an angle
because<00:01:20.369> you're<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.030> get<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.180> good

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
bite on the bottom of the lake bed so I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.440 
bite on the bottom of the lake bed so I
usually<00:01:24.060> start<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> by<00:01:24.509> hand<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> couple<00:01:25.020> turns

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
usually start it by hand a couple turns
and<00:01:27.450> put<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> handle<00:01:28.970> up<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.240> there<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:32.460> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and put the handle up on there and you

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
and put the handle up on there and you
just<00:01:32.759> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> give<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> good<00:01:33.509> even<00:01:34.490> turn<00:01:36.500> make
