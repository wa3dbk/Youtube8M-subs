00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.849
 I will give on the space and today we will have 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.269
 review on my homemade typesetter myself 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.360
 girl on a set of lego star wars 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.200
 on the game the force unleashed 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.940
 the router will say it honestly probably my 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.250
 favorite spaceship whether one of my 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.740
 favorite spaceships and it belongs 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 Goal Well brand Starkiller then he sits in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.600
 Generally a separate review of the figures we do 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.480
 I wanted to order it myself but it costs 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.960
 there is big money 2000 hryvnia 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.960
 unpacked something 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.400
 and decided why not make everyone everything 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.780
 I got it enough 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.239
 not bad leave thats what it looks like wings 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.579
 moving everything moves functional and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.750
 I think I will not order it 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.690
 something better is better 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.230
 those set that ordered for the new year 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.020
 they have not come yet I do not know where they fly 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 now what are we going to wait for and which sets 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.220
 it will be it will be a surprise for you 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.690
 subscribers by the way I did not say that 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.039
 I was not given anything for the new year I 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 just ordered cb kits 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.530
 but let's get some pretty famous words 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.619
 let's go to my homemade and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.939
 minifigure but traditionally we will start with 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.189
 minifigurka first 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.590
 not a figurine in this set is a dart 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.469
 Vader is ordinary completely Darth Vader and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.719
 Well, as usual 2007 release if I 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.869
 I remember correctly he has a light 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.069
 the sword is such a period on the body basically i'm on 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.359
 he already did a review 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:35.639
 therefore, it is unlikely that there is something new for her though 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.100
 a new dart vader comes out in the summer so 

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:42.329
 until such a mini pepper goes new dart 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.520
 vader in the set with the final duel im there 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.069
 where he fought with the hatch there will still be 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.909
 new hatch new emperor and throne room 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.759
 and pirate 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.939
 I also made such a battle demo 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.819
 that is, the battered version of darth 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.409
 vader but she came out not so that's why i 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.009
 I don't know, maybe I'll order myself both 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.819
 taldom 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.609
 but it costs 600 hryvnia, so in general 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.709
 I do not know dear only in appearance is set 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:11.840
 on my favorite game star wars the force 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.890
 he only parabolas you drum roll and 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.590
 it's our oldies 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.080
 it's my custom if that starkiller 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.630
 this is my favorite Jedi Sith she don't know 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.160
 he was a Jedi or was not a Jedi in 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.410
 principle he was a Sith since 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.940
 I trained by Darth Vader, but later on 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.130
 I became a Jedi because he had 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.010
 blue sword I really don't remember when he did it 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.410
 did well in general not important in my on 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.470
 raxus prime and this planet is called 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.470
 trash where he struck down the Jedi he still 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.090
 there were such mechanical legs in general he 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.090
 and then struck down in my opinion there he did 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.520
 yourself your blue lightsaber general galen 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.709
 Marek Starkiller is in front of you, my 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.080
 homemade torso cole I think she 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.170
 fits him best of all the clouds 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.350
 which I have ever had the same 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.450
 move on to the road show itself and see 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.480
 first navi his wings though they know and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.610
 the wings are just exhibiting 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.500
 here we have such details that 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.130
 smooth so that he can overcome 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.110
 any speed and develop it there are such 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.790
 guns even though these guys are not there 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.820
 that must be why I probably did 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.549
 all the same as a set 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.790
 like that better turbine such a laser 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.100
 gun two more guns and here is a symbol 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.320
 empire we can open it here again 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.160
 us as a set there is a shell which 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.910
 still zapulnut 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.730
 so i hope i don't get myself fine 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.430
 i got right phone in general here 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.090
 such a mechanism as you can see there 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.250
 and sparkles 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.269
 a spring with which you can 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:48.470
 I do not know how to shoot this proton 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.120
 projectile so if you think 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.720
 closes down and down here 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.959
 so here we look heavy 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:02.310
 I weighty him from four o'clock in the morning 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:04.500
 did up to 8 now 10 plan in general 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.780
 We look if everything is beautiful when 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.579
 I hope detailed because the details 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:15.060
 I had a bit of the black 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:19.010
 using such could moving wings 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.260
 the flaps can even be said for the baby 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.639
 turbine to accelerate it is available 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.580
 only one side in the set also 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.310
 behind another pipe which has not been in 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:37.439
 set just did not put here beauty and 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.439
 let's see us blue starkiller here it is 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:48.699
 here are 2 smaller laser guns 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.099
 for the way she was bigger but alone we 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.279
 go up and see what it is too 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:58.810
 opens here with us 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:05:01.210
 get up and this focus this part for 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.819
 creating his laser sword i mean i 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.789
 I just did not throw a vine here 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.129
 smarter I just took a thief who 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.740
 sorted so that you can when you need 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:12.539
 get and pick respect he is going 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.830
 easy enough 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:19.479
 low detail cockpit and 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.050
 big flap too probably didn't close 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.490
 like a wing that moves and here 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.360
 let me show you how is he after all 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.529
 can fly 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.620
 itâ€™s hard to do with one hand 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.029
 what does he look like if he is in your hand so 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.729
 let's not on the carpet here so here is better 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:42.930
 show so here it looks in principle 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.930
 big enough if we compare it with 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.629
 Tai fighter so we see a colossal 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.699
 Darth Vader tie fighter difference much 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.699
 less than rock shadow 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:57.159
 but on this i think everything is by my homemade 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.250
 I hope you enjoyed this review if 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:02.699
 you had food a minute space everyone good luck everyone 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.699
 until
