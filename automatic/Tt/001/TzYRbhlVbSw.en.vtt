where<00:01:56.130> I'm<00:01:56.189> gonna<00:01:56.310> put<00:01:56.520> them<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.729> second<00:01:57.179> hole

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
where I'm gonna put them on second hole

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.279 
where I'm gonna put them on second hole
I'm<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.600> drill<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.990> one<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
I'm going to drill up in one of the

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.809 
I'm going to drill up in one of the
corners<00:02:00.590> right<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.069> that's<00:02:02.369> just<00:02:02.670> for

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
corners right there and that's just for

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.789 
corners right there and that's just for
wire<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> off<00:02:03.360> my<00:02:03.600> brick<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.709> you're

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
wire and off my brick so what you're

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.039 
wire and off my brick so what you're
gonna<00:02:04.890> end<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.509> you're<00:02:06.509> going<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.720> end<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.899> with

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
gonna end up you're going to end up with

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.559 
gonna end up you're going to end up with
a<00:02:07.110> brick<00:02:07.580> with<00:02:08.580> two<00:02:08.789> holes<00:02:09.000> in<00:02:09.239> it

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
a brick with two holes in it

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.710 
a brick with two holes in it
and<00:02:10.850> then<00:02:11.850> all<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.060> got<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.269> do<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.569> take

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and then all you got to do is you take

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.380 
and then all you got to do is you take
your<00:02:14.239> little<00:02:15.239> plastic<00:02:15.750> insert<00:02:16.200> here<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:18.269> you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
your little plastic insert here and you

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.199 
your little plastic insert here and you
start<00:02:19.049> it<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> hole<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.000> got<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
start it in the hole that all you got to

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.280 
start it in the hole that all you got to
do<00:02:21.269> is<00:02:21.390> just<00:02:21.569> slowly<00:02:21.810> tap<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:23.959> once<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.140> in

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
do is just slowly tap it in once it's in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.009 
do is just slowly tap it in once it's in
there<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.590> fits<00:02:25.799> kind<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.250> loose<00:02:26.900> about<00:02:27.900> how

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
there it fits kind of loose about how

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.680 
there it fits kind of loose about how
these<00:02:28.200> things<00:02:28.260> work<00:02:28.739> let<00:02:29.010> me<00:02:29.099> show<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.310> here

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
these things work let me show you here

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.830 
these things work let me show you here
so<00:02:30.690> when<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.900> put<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.200> screw<00:02:31.320> in<00:02:31.650> them<00:02:32.630> as<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
so when you put the screw in them as the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.630 
so when you put the screw in them as the
screw<00:02:34.109> goes<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:35.510> it'll<00:02:36.510> expand<00:02:37.049> this<00:02:37.430> as<00:02:38.430> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
screw goes in it'll expand this as you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.580 
screw goes in it'll expand this as you
can<00:02:38.760> see<00:02:38.910> right<00:02:39.090> there<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.420> expands<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.109> so

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
can see right there it expands that so

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.680 
can see right there it expands that so
that<00:02:40.739> pushes<00:02:41.100> on<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.970> hole<00:02:42.150> in<00:02:42.359> it<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.510> it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
that pushes on on the hole in it and it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.449 
that pushes on on the hole in it and it
keeps<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.079> in<00:02:43.170> there<00:02:43.290> really<00:02:43.410> solid<00:02:43.890> they<00:02:44.010> work

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
keeps it in there really solid they work

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.920 
keeps it in there really solid they work
just<00:02:44.489> they're<00:02:45.450> awesome

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
just they're awesome

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.900 
just they're awesome
so<00:02:46.680> once<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:46.890> get<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.160> insert<00:02:47.579> in<00:02:47.730> there

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
so once you get that insert in there

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.720 
so once you get that insert in there
let's<00:02:48.690> take<00:02:48.930> your<00:02:49.400> mount

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
let's take your mount

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.720 
let's take your mount
start<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.540> screw<00:02:52.130> now<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.190> don't<00:02:53.400> have<00:02:53.549> to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
start your screw now you don't have to

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.970 
start your screw now you don't have to
buy<00:02:53.880> 50<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.480> these<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.810> mean<00:02:54.959> they<00:02:55.470> sell<00:02:55.739> them<00:02:55.890> in

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
buy 50 of these I mean they sell them in

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.370 
buy 50 of these I mean they sell them in
most<00:02:56.310> hardware<00:02:56.519> stores<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.329> I<00:02:57.510> mean<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> small

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
most hardware stores and I mean a small

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.270 
most hardware stores and I mean a small
kit<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:59.160> tan<00:02:59.700> I<00:02:59.730> think<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.709> maybe<00:03:01.709> even<00:03:01.890> fine

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
kit so tan I think so maybe even fine

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.809 
kit so tan I think so maybe even fine
once<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.299> get<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.540> screw<00:03:03.870> started<00:03:04.670> line<00:03:05.670> it

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
once you get that screw started line it

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.729 
once you get that screw started line it
up<00:03:05.880> with<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.060> hole<00:03:06.359> in<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.750> plastic<00:03:07.430> insert

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.020 

and<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:13.950> screwed<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.489> there<00:03:14.670> just<00:03:14.849> like<00:03:14.970> that

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and you screwed in there just like that

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.500 
and you screwed in there just like that
and<00:03:15.480> that's<00:03:16.379> really<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:17.010> whole<00:03:17.239> gist<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.420> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
and that's really the whole gist of the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.410 
and that's really the whole gist of the
system<00:03:19.610> then<00:03:20.610> all<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.849> got<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.150> I

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
system then all you got to do like I

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.050 
system then all you got to do like I
said<00:03:21.659> get<00:03:22.140> your<00:03:22.170> trap<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.890> wire<00:03:23.489> your<00:03:23.519> wire

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
said get your trap you wire your wire

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.770 
said get your trap you wire your wire
your<00:03:24.390> trap<00:03:24.659> to<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.049> hole<00:03:25.799> in<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.069> corner<00:03:26.780> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
your trap to the hole in the corner and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.009 
your trap to the hole in the corner and
assign<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:28.200> oh<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:29.430> works<00:03:29.610> really<00:03:29.849> good<00:03:30.150> with

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
assign it oh it works really good with

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.070 
assign it oh it works really good with
these<00:03:31.170> Cana<00:03:31.470> bears<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:32.250> got<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.640> straight

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
these Cana bears that got the straight

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.390 
these Cana bears that got the straight
corners<00:03:34.080> you<00:03:34.200> know<00:03:34.230> 90-degree<00:03:34.890> corners

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
corners you know 90-degree corners

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.160 
corners you know 90-degree corners
I'm<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.790> ones<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.239> got<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.420> little<00:03:36.780> bend<00:03:37.019> in

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
I'm the ones that got a little bend in

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
you get the 160 mounts the 110 mounts

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.970 
you get the 160 mounts the 110 mounts
are<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.480> little<00:03:45.599> bit<00:03:45.810> narrower<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.440> they<00:03:46.799> only

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
are a little bit narrower and they only

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.520 
are a little bit narrower and they only
work<00:03:47.220> for<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.459> 110<00:03:47.970> if<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.840> get<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.019> 160

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
work for the 110 if you get the 160

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.339 
work for the 110 if you get the 160
months<00:03:49.769> they<00:03:49.859> work<00:03:50.010> for<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.280> 110<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.349> they

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
months they work for the 110 and they
