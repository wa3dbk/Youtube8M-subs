00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello everyone today, December 28 and all 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.220
 the world celebrates cinema day so i'm filming 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.920
 for you the book is a crane for sting which 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.160
 kindly provided for us oli 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160
 Monday 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.190
 only after the film adaptation actually 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.520
 There are a lot of such books because almost 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.040
 every movie I watched in a movie 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.890
 and if it was to remove it for him 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.840
 written book or rather whale cinema is written 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.570
 according to the book, I want to fit 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.670
 actually read these books very 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.489
 a lot because almost every movie 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.070
 which was shot on the book immediately hits 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.690
 I have a reading list in my sleep 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.640
 it seems it makes no sense to list it 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.610
 Harry Potter Cloud Atlas I 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 Now I read this beautiful creature 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.630
 between heaven and earth 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.980
 stardust I can't really 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.640
 yourself to remember some specific 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.060
 films 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.580
 but almost very many books I wanted 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.460
 clean it after watching the book 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.720
 which you have not read yet despite 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:20.020
 the fact that the video again these books 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.330
 a lot of it is thought in order so 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.640
 harry potter last part of the book i'm still 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.069
 did not read for watched all movies 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.440
 it's also a cloud atlas sherlock 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:30.759
 Holmes I hardly read a book I read 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.039
 only one etude in scarlet 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.140
 tones 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.569
 then this beautiful creature 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.630
 i didn't read a lot of jane books 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.490
 Austin wanted many staring in 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.770
 film adaptation on it a lot of films i 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.119
 just when you need to remember very 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.069
 fast and totally can not it 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.649
 recall here and so on such on the very 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:55.780
 There are a lot of books because I 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:59.140
 I watch more films than I read 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 books on this film so I can not 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.679
 recall the most unfortunate adaptation of 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.619
 your opinion 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.110
 in fact the most unfortunate for me 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.170
 film adaptation she is guests because 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.700
 that i thought they were more believable 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.920
 take off the book and there they did such 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.620
 blockbuster a bunch of explosions a bunch of all these 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.750
 still didnâ€™t just like cary in 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.520
 Cairo, they generally twisted half 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.650
 the movie 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.550
 ending in books and movies they are completely 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.230
 remade 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.870
 but I guess I just don't like when 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.370
 me this is a very strong sequence 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.980
 which book followers like in 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.989
 the film therefore will understand the door of the film 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.379
 which I can remember which movie 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.110
 better books definitely better books two 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.319
 the film is star dust because 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.160
 the film is much more adequate than a book in 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.560
 the book 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.720
 Well, as Neil Geyman write it is not easy 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.410
 happy ending he has a happy ending 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.629
 some kind of hoof here and in the movie everything 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.720
 made a happy ending in Hollywood 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:03.160
 happy ending all joyous fly to the sky 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.340
 and live there before the end of ages and 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:11.239
 second film and this is between heaven and earth 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.579
 according to the book brand levi completely separate 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.560
 film separately book separately how many and 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.840
 love the movie it's just my desktop i 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.730
 quote the phrase if desir goes between 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.840
 heaven and earth you can turn off the sound i 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.569
 I can just duplicate 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.129
 completely calm and when i start 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.680
 read the book, I realized that everything is there 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.870
 completely different and I just don't even 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.799
 I read it because it's very creepy 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.370
 upset 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.970
 I decided to hand so you can shoot immediately 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.090
 the movie was my favorite book 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:45.319
 la market is a must see for you 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.239
 screen version if you read the book on 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.669
 I really don't think this is for me 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.560
 as it is very preferable if 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.560
 for example, if I read a book first 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.090
 then I wonder how it was removed if 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.160
 I liked the book 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.260
 and if I watched the seventh movie of me 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.970
 not particularly impressed then maybe i 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.470
 I will not read the book but you know how 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.510
 depends on the mood that is if i 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.130
 straight here very impress the movie there 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.380
 of course and run to read a book 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.030
 This I from Korea faster buy well and not 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.140
 the fact that I will start reading it soon 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.230
 time she 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.870
 I have already answered the image 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.060
 book adaptation would you like to see 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.280
 probably I would like to be removed 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.470
 film adaptation books ken whole and light 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.420
 comedy still to the goddess in the kitchen remember 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.220
 I have reduced it to keep secrets 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.720
 Serve me such films seem 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.240
 everyone would like them easy 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.300
 laid-back legend actresses for and even 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.030
 be such airy lungs 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.860
 just really i cant so here 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.870
 submit what book i would like to 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.520
 It was a film adaptation because I thought 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.890
 over this question looked through all the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.340
 books on the shelves and realized that very 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.930
 many have messed up probably because 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.390
 not every book is still possible 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.790
 film all the same in every book 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.169
 what is the conclusion that the film can 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.740
 absolutely very easy to miss 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.410
 any such trifle is very important and 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.620
 so I do not know my choice fell on books 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.990
 sophie kinsella how do you feel about that 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.080
 when the film is very different from 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.350
 the original source is again a twofold question 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.220
 looking as if I liked the movie 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.830
 it was completely redone and it is more 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.860
 logical example ending I like 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.080
 and if i'm madly in love with a book i 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.550
 I watch movies I understand that everything is simple 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.100
 not so sure I probably upset me 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.290
 it seems this is a normal reaction of any 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.090
 A reader who loves a book can 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.650
 understand the film you understand what the writers 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.840
 just decided to pull out all the most 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.410
 the main points say no there 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.380
 must machine and drink kiss there they are 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.800
 there and 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.450
 Well, I do not know anything in this spirit 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.680
 so 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.020
 normal reaction will get angry either 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.530
 rejoice 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.120
 favorite sherlock holmes indigenization 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:04.240
 nadi probably fly me now 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.630
 sneakers but I did not watch any 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.460
 film version until the end I did not watch our 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.950
 Russian film adaptation I saw them 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.750
 totally snatches on tv when 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.590
 just passing by because I lease 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.500
 don't watch i didn't watch american 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:22.370
 screen version saw only trailers 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.310
 Downey Junior I do not remember which name 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:31.610
 shorter than the iron man who replaced 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:34.260
 his role sherlock I did not look with 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.910
 oh my god what is his last name to me 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:40.200
 bullshit with last names I can't at all 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:42.240
 remember well, in short the English TV series 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.360
 about sherlock where 's the cool sherlock 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.100
 which one with phones with all this 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.740
 the same mountains already flew sneakers i'm nothing 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.919
 I do not remember, and I also remember some 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.410
 series about sherlock holmes and our russian 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.350
 I recently left it, too, I did not look 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.870
 so just saw something in the breaks yet 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:05.970
 There was an American TV series where he played and Lucy 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:07.410
 Lew bang and I remember that 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.669
 I really have no favorite film version 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.660
 gutting is first worth sitting down 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.450
 view all 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.280
 and then choose your favorite one like this 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.050
 The Consul Kai was so disturbed by such a strange 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.570
 The situation of the books did not read and the film did not 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:20.190
 watched the whole world just a fan went 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.070
 Holmes Sasha his not even until the end 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.780
 I read even harry potter to the end 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.669
 I did not read at all some 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.979
 abnormal deviation which only 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:32.340
 buying books and forcing them to buy 

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:32.810
