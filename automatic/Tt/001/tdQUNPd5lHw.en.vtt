00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.779
 my body 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 a good port wine 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 Dublin 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.100
 same year 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 arminda 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 world 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.620
 very 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.760
 in a world 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.020
 in a world 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.020
 amy 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 in which case the change will occur more 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.100

 science and technology is recommended 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.560
 however the problem 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 I have time to prepare the future 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.890
 from the beginning 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.370

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.370
 the new UN report 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.849
 there's no doubt 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.849
 given the great movement of the black tide 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.029
 from January to the date of the damaging event
