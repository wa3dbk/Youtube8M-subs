make much of a difference to be
perfectly<00:00:30.989> honest<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.559> think<00:00:32.070> we've<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.219> got

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
perfectly honest I think we've just got

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.799 
perfectly honest I think we've just got
the<00:00:32.550> same<00:00:32.730> assist<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.480> had<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.719> our

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the same assist on that we had in our

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.799 
the same assist on that we had in our
career<00:00:34.170> ID<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> hold<00:00:35.040> my<00:00:35.219> goodness

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809

get<00:00:40.830> a<00:00:40.890> lap<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.310> near<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:42.230> because<00:00:43.230> they've

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
get a lap be near that because they've

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.140 
get a lap be near that because they've
got<00:00:43.590> traction<00:00:43.860> control<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.970> coat

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
got traction control on like the coat

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.790 
got traction control on like the coat
and<00:00:45.270> keep<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.540> a<00:00:45.630> straight<00:00:45.870> line<00:00:46.050> runs<00:00:46.590> at<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and keep it a straight line runs at the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
and keep it a straight line runs at the
last<00:00:47.010> chance<00:00:47.220> I<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.760> PC<00:00:48.240> using

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
last chance I think I was on PC using

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.160 
last chance I think I was on PC using
the<00:00:48.600> wheel<00:00:48.810> like<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.130> lot<00:00:50.900> it<00:00:51.900> wasn't

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the wheel like it was a lot it wasn't

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.660 
the wheel like it was a lot it wasn't
too<00:00:52.440> bad<00:00:52.680> because<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.130> you<00:00:53.220> pull<00:00:53.370> out<00:00:53.400> you're<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
too bad because if you pull out you're a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.040 
too bad because if you pull out you're a
bit<00:00:53.850> more<00:00:53.880> control<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> use<00:00:54.810> in<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
bit more control when you use in the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.819 
bit more control when you use in the
wheel<00:00:55.230> when<00:00:56.160> using<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.170> controller<00:00:58.170> oh<00:00:58.470> my

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
wheel when using and controller oh my

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.010

than me and when he's wet toys on here I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.249 
than me and when he's wet toys on here I
can<00:01:14.819> keep<00:01:14.999> it<00:01:15.149> in<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> straight<00:01:15.329> line<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.020> now

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
can keep it in a straight line and now

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.690 
can keep it in a straight line and now
we're<00:01:16.380> down<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:16.530> Daleks<00:01:16.829> place<00:01:17.009> Erikson's<00:01:17.490> got

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
we're down to Daleks place Erikson's got

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.569 
we're down to Daleks place Erikson's got
past<00:01:17.969> me<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.479> yeah<00:01:19.079> anyway<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.829> think<00:01:20.219> this

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
past me and yeah anyway I think this

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.069 
past me and yeah anyway I think this
challenge<00:01:20.819> wasn't<00:01:21.329> actually<00:01:21.600> tries<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.899> put

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
challenge wasn't actually tries to put

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.770 
challenge wasn't actually tries to put
it<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.639> 25%<00:01:23.639> race<00:01:23.819> it<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.329> not<00:01:24.479> sure<00:01:24.539> if

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it on a 25% race it but I'm not sure if

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.499 
it on a 25% race it but I'm not sure if
you<00:01:24.899> can<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.469> in<00:01:25.530> 3<00:01:25.829> and<00:01:25.979> 5<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.490> braces<00:01:26.999> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you can do it in 3 and 5 that braces so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.999 
you can do it in 3 and 5 that braces so
don't<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.749> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.990> change<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.409> setup<00:01:28.649> so

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
don't that you can change the setup so

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.489 
don't that you can change the setup so
basically<00:01:29.459> the<00:01:30.090> idea<00:01:30.389> of<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.569> challenge<00:01:30.929> so

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499 
basically the idea of this challenge so

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:33.080 
basically the idea of this challenge so
completely<00:01:32.009> glossed<00:01:32.310> over<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:32.880> anyone

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
probably question side to side down the

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.420 
probably question side to side down the
straight<00:02:33.090> which<00:02:33.360> you're<00:02:33.480> probably<00:02:33.510> gonna<00:02:33.840> see

straight which you're probably gonna see

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.800 
straight which you're probably gonna see
look<00:02:35.430> controller<00:02:35.940> we're<00:02:36.180> controlling<00:02:36.540> it

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
look controller we're controlling it

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.690 
look controller we're controlling it
okay<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.560> know<00:02:37.709> how<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.130> control<00:02:38.490> it<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.670> a

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
okay now I know how to control it in a

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.440 
okay now I know how to control it in a
straight<00:02:38.850> line<00:02:38.880> anyway

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
straight line anyway

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.699 
straight line anyway
well<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:39.840> gonna<00:02:39.930> say<00:02:40.170> there's<00:02:40.410> been<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.560> lot

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
well it's gonna say there's been a lot

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.620 
well it's gonna say there's been a lot
of<00:02:40.740> sliding<00:02:41.070> about<00:02:41.490> but<00:02:41.820> honestly<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.360> lap

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
of sliding about but honestly this lap

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.500 
of sliding about but honestly this lap
hasn't<00:02:42.959> been<00:02:43.080> too<00:02:43.290> bad<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.950> honestly<00:02:44.820> feel<00:02:45.150> and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
hasn't been too bad I honestly feel and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.880 
hasn't been too bad I honestly feel and
that<00:02:45.720> little<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.170> guys<00:02:46.320> agree<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.860> think

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
that little do you guys agree I think

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.100 
that little do you guys agree I think
that<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.370> wet<00:02:47.610> Trotter<00:02:48.000> wet<00:02:48.360> tires<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.900> dried

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
that the wet Trotter wet tires and dried

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.259 
that the wet Trotter wet tires and dried
track<00:02:49.440> change<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.860> actually<00:02:50.220> harder<00:02:50.730> because

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
track change is actually harder because

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.150 
track change is actually harder because
the<00:02:51.510> tires<00:02:51.750> just<00:02:51.870> like<00:02:52.140> burn<00:02:52.410> up<00:02:52.650> straightaway

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
the tires just like burn up straightaway

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.070 
the tires just like burn up straightaway
I<00:02:53.610> actually<00:02:54.090> think<00:02:54.390> this<00:02:54.630> might<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:54.930> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
I actually think this might be the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.780 
I actually think this might be the
easier<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.680> two<00:02:55.769> challenge<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.489> will<00:02:56.700> be

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
easier of the two challenge so I will be

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.430 
easier of the two challenge so I will be
doing<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.150> opposite<00:02:57.989> challenge<00:02:58.320> obviously

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
doing the opposite challenge obviously

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.860 
doing the opposite challenge obviously
wet<00:02:59.280> tires<00:02:59.580> on<00:02:59.820> dry<00:03:00.030> track<00:03:00.300> at<00:03:00.420> some<00:03:00.600> point

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
wet tires on dry track at some point

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.979 
wet tires on dry track at some point
that

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
that

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.619 
that
completely<00:03:02.590> glossed<00:03:02.859> over<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.189> but<00:03:03.629> driving

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 
completely glossed over that but driving

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.420 
completely glossed over that but driving
straight<00:03:04.900> into<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.200> gravel<00:03:05.409> but<00:03:05.739> yeah<00:03:06.250> what

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
straight into the gravel but yeah what

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.619 
straight into the gravel but yeah what
we're<00:03:06.549> doing<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.819> opposite<00:03:07.209> challenge

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
we're doing the opposite challenge

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.630 
we're doing the opposite challenge
obviously<00:03:07.750> worked<00:03:08.469> right<00:03:08.739> we're<00:03:09.159> tires<00:03:09.489> and

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
obviously worked right we're tires and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.000 
obviously worked right we're tires and
driving<00:03:10.030> next<00:03:11.019> up<00:03:11.230> satellites<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.859> done

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010

anyway and you know who'll be doing that

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.380 
anyway and you know who'll be doing that
at<00:03:13.780> some<00:03:13.959> point<00:03:13.989> on<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.189> channel<00:03:15.519> maybe<00:03:16.180> the
