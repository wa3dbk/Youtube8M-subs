00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 you already lost sharing with you and they are 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.230
 children 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.750
 could not reach the last attract because 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.220
 the morning was already and the service of the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.309
 train has stopped working here in 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.699
 tokyo so 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.820
 and not walking to our destination is going to 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:25.369
 touch walking a little over an hour 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.489
 but hey there's no problem japan is a 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.489
 country 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.140
 assured so one can not be 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.510
 walking at this time and there's no problem 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.210
 It is common to see women walking by 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.120
 this time too although you have to be 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.360
 cautious anyway bad things 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.800
 you then it happens everywhere 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.870
 but in general Japan is a country 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.050
 quite safe and quiet 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.800
 today I had one I do not fall with the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.339
 fellow work the company does not 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.390
 you fall when you go out to drink so I walk 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:06.860
 quite taken at this time but not 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.680
 a lot if I took enough 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.440
 but I think I'm fine for those who 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.620
 they come to work in japan they realize 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.290
 that is quite a community I do not like 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.020
 the co-workers to a friend who 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.210
 works for a company a company 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.060
 which is different from what I work 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.940
 I do not fall once a week sometimes 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.440
 twice a week during the week as well 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.510
 that he goes regularly on Wednesdays to 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.110
 take and go out with all the members of 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.910
 the company so if you tend to 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.850
 work japanese touch to work here 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.850
 it's going to be normal for them to come out 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.280
 take with your coworkers but 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.250
 this week and has a week I've been very 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.540
 busy I have many videos that we have 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.610
 finished editing and a few days ago 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.610
 that I asked a question by means of 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.399
 facebook I was wondering about the videos 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.460
 of the channel have motivated us of some 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.070
 way you have to believe visiting japan and 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.700
 I want to thank very much those who 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:17.000
 they answered I received many answers and 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.090
 his answers were very useful 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.190
 this video has it in particular 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:30.200
 it is simply a varied video of a 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.350
 drunk signing and talking to it 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.170
 same time at the same time at one o'clock 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.970
 the morning 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.190
 another thing that I wanted to comment 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.850
 is that it 's about the program 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.250
 television the edge key that I have 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.560
 contacted to do to make a 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.600
 Segment segment I do not know 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.610
 to programs 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.300
 finally mission 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.300
 4 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.930
 I only know part of the segment 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.930
 segment that they are going to do 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.689
 and it is a television program to minor 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.329
 that is transmitted on the nh channel in 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:20.359
 skate all of Japan since it's the 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.730
 national television approved was not a 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.219
 interesting experience to my first 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.120
 experience in Japanese television as well 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:31.879
 how good I have something to comment 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.170
 the segment is programmed to be 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.140
 make raid 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.900
 in the middle of this medium 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.270
 but I make a video about this 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.370
 experience but I can not speak nor 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.620
 show anything until after I 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.110
 the program has gone to the air that 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.200
 were the two terms 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.959
 what else 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.300
 I do not want to do it would be very long is 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.129
 possible that the entire PAN channel 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.040
 japanese have an anime section and 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.069
 manga to a Japanese friend I know 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.530
 for many years she is interested in doing 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.640
 videos about anime to the speaking public 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.550
 Hispanic and he asked me if I could be that 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.430
 could use the channel of all to paris 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.489
 to make a section and I told him that 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.440
 it was fine since the entire channel 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:25.620
 japanese is everything a bit about japan 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:28.919
 I'm still not 100% sure what 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.389
 that this be done since she 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.100
 I would be in charge of this section and I 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.330
 it would only help you with some 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.330
 translations in Spanish 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.740
 but for that one channel or one segment 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.660
 work there has to be consistency 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.389
 so depending on how they are 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.330
 things the answer to the section is 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.330
 possible that you already create your own channel for 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.030
 this segment in the future but so 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.500
 that gave me to understand for the moment 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.580
 she just wants to make a segment 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.510
 pilot 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.000
 and me a week probably 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.660
 the whole channel already panista and see how 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.249
 it works so she would be in charge of 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.889
 that segment not me 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.079
 and finally the channel reached the 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.189
 100,000 subscribers and I want to thank 

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:23.459
 all your comments and interest that 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:26.109
 have shown by japan eastick 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:29.259
 according to the channel has been growing in 

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:32.789
 subscribers and it has been harder for me 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.789
 answer comments 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.640
 physically and physically it is making me 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.710
 almost impossible to answer all 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.030
 comments and questions because they are 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.040
 very many but 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.600
 when I read a question that is very 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.070
 popular 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.370
 and it may be of interest to many 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.340
 neighbors 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:58.100
 to the context in the form of video and its 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:01.310
 questions and comments are the basis for 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:05.880
 many of the topics that I have done in the 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:08.220
 channel videos so thank you 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.370
 I have commented previously there is no 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.750
 nothing better when you are something of heart 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.150
 and goodwill and not compromise 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.630
 to your comments and your interest in 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.910
 want 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.160
 to keep seeing more about japan 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.650
 half of japanese tics is what I 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.130
 motivates to keep creating content in 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:32.310
 this channel to what I do I do in my 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.590
 free time and goodwill 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.830
 make videos consume a lot of 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.750
 my time but I like it and I enjoy it 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.290
 because I feel it is a way of 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.290
 Express myself 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.919
 and above all what is part of the 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.230
 Japanese culture 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:51.300
 I hope to continue creating more content for 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.900
 share with you and that japan 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.180
