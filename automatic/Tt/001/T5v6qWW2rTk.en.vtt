it<00:00:17.190> there<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:18.330> what<00:00:18.510> I've<00:00:18.600> got<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:19.109> a

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
it there so what I've got here is a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.730 
it there so what I've got here is a
workbook<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.119> some<00:00:21.270> product<00:00:21.660> samples<00:00:22.080> say

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
workbook with some product samples say

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.880 
workbook with some product samples say
one<00:00:23.100> in<00:00:23.430> ten<00:00:23.760> thousand<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.630> know<00:00:24.890> products

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
one in ten thousand you know products

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.429 
one in ten thousand you know products
are<00:00:26.039> sampled<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.939> manufacturing<00:00:27.840> plant

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
are sampled in a manufacturing plant

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
are sampled in a manufacturing plant
whatever<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.550> point<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:29.939> they're<00:00:30.210> weighed

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
whatever the point is they're weighed

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.610 
whatever the point is they're weighed
right<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:32.130> get<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.759> bunch<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.570> decimals<00:00:34.170> but

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
right and we get a bunch of decimals but

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.900 
right and we get a bunch of decimals but
it<00:00:34.739> doesn't<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.070> matter<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.489> us<00:00:35.700> because

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it doesn't really matter to us because

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
it doesn't really matter to us because
we<00:00:36.239> only<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.140> mirrors<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.770> gram<00:00:38.070> we

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
we only want it to be mirrors to gram we

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640 
we only want it to be mirrors to gram we
don't<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.700> care<00:00:39.000> about<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.870> decimal

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
don't really care about the decimal

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.120 
don't really care about the decimal
and<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:43.120> very<00:00:43.300> quick<00:00:43.420> way<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:44.020> get<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:44.680> nearest

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
and a very quick way to get the nearest

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.450 
and a very quick way to get the nearest
gram<00:00:45.430> is<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.780> use<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.080> end<00:00:47.260> function<00:00:47.770> but<00:00:48.130> I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
gram is to use the end function but I

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.270 
gram is to use the end function but I
have<00:00:48.790> to<00:00:48.970> specify<00:00:49.450> this<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.320> going<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.920> find

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
have to specify this is going to find

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.260 
have to specify this is going to find
the<00:00:51.790> next<00:00:52.180> lowest<00:00:53.050> integer<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.910> is<00:00:54.940> really

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
the next lowest integer it is really

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.240 
the next lowest integer it is really
annoying<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:56.260> doesn't<00:00:56.620> just<00:00:56.800> go<00:00:56.830> the

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
annoying that doesn't just go the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.950 
annoying that doesn't just go the
closest<00:00:57.670> integer<00:00:57.970> it's<00:00:58.360> going<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.629> find<00:00:58.840> the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
closest integer it's going to find the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.520 
closest integer it's going to find the
next<00:00:59.140> lowest<00:00:59.559> so<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.460> way<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:00.670> do<00:01:00.910> that<00:01:01.150> is

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
next lowest so the way you do that is

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.030 
next lowest so the way you do that is
equals<00:01:02.850> int<00:01:03.850> open<00:01:04.510> parentheses<00:01:05.020> select<00:01:05.860> the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
equals int open parentheses select the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.890 
equals int open parentheses select the
cell<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.520> number<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:07.600> would<00:01:07.750> like

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
cell of the number that you would like

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.790 
cell of the number that you would like
to<00:01:07.930> return<00:01:08.920> its<00:01:09.070> integer<00:01:09.400> only

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
to return its integer only

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.100 
to return its integer only
and<00:01:10.890> then<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.940> one<00:01:12.240> nineteen<00:01:12.600> point<00:01:12.810> two<00:01:12.870> three

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and then so one nineteen point two three

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.770 
and then so one nineteen point two three
becomes<00:01:13.590> one<00:01:13.860> nineteen<00:01:14.310> really<00:01:15.240> easy<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.660> do

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
becomes one nineteen really easy to do

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.010 
becomes one nineteen really easy to do
and<00:01:15.920> it's<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.010> quick<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.850> much<00:01:18.690> quicker<00:01:18.900> to

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and it's very quick it's much quicker to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.980 
and it's very quick it's much quicker to
use<00:01:19.140> this<00:01:19.380> than<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> round<00:01:19.890> function<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.210> long

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
use this than the round function as long

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.170 
use this than the round function as long
as<00:01:22.230> this<00:01:22.380> cheeps<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:22.980> you<00:01:23.100> need<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.090> I'm

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
as this cheeps what you need so I'm

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.760 
as this cheeps what you need so I'm
going<00:01:24.300> to<00:01:24.330> copy<00:01:24.510> this<00:01:24.810> down<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.410> you'll<00:01:25.530> see

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
going to copy this down and you'll see

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to copy this down and you'll see
where<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.040> may<00:01:26.190> be<00:01:26.220> problem<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.300> need

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
where there may be problem so you need

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
where there may be problem so you need
to<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.720> careful<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.890> gonna<00:01:29.010> give<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
to be careful it's gonna give you the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.120 
to be careful it's gonna give you the
nearest<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> next<00:01:30.540> lowest<00:01:31.290> integer<00:01:31.590> right

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
nearest or the next lowest integer right

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.790 
nearest or the next lowest integer right
so<00:01:32.790> one<00:01:33.090> point<00:01:33.300> two<00:01:33.510> two<00:01:33.660> point<00:01:33.990> five<00:01:34.380> eight

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
so one point two two point five eight

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.319 
so one point two two point five eight
still<00:01:35.760> returns<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.780> twenty<00:01:37.110> two

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
still returns one twenty two

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.899 
still returns one twenty two
one<00:01:39.170> twenty<00:01:39.500> point<00:01:39.710> eight<00:01:39.859> nine<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:40.490> returns

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
one twenty point eight nine so returns

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.940 
one twenty point eight nine so returns
one<00:01:41.539> twenty<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.799> take<00:01:43.159> note<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.899> but<00:01:44.950> it

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
one twenty so take note of that but it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.010 
one twenty so take note of that but it
is<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> very<00:01:46.310> quick<00:01:46.640> very<00:01:47.179> easy<00:01:47.329> and<00:01:47.659> efficient

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
is a very quick very easy and efficient

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.080 
is a very quick very easy and efficient
way<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:48.380> return<00:01:49.219> the<00:01:50.020> next<00:01:51.020> lowest<00:01:51.319> integer<00:01:51.679> in

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
way to return the next lowest integer in

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.020 
way to return the next lowest integer in
a<00:01:53.090> series<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.450> numbers<00:01:54.100> so<00:01:55.100> I'll<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:55.670> put<00:01:55.909> the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
a series of numbers so I'll just put the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.480 
a series of numbers so I'll just put the
formula<00:01:56.240> up<00:01:56.450> here<00:01:56.479> in<00:01:56.780> text<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.770> you<00:01:57.829> can<00:01:58.159> see

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
formula up here in text so you can see

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.380 
formula up here in text so you can see
that<00:01:59.950> equals<00:02:00.950> int<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.909> then<00:02:02.600> your<00:02:02.840> number

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390
