neat products and some processes that

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.129 
neat products and some processes that
we're<00:00:11.580> developing<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:12.090> at<00:00:12.269> gun<00:00:12.450> works<00:00:12.630> that

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
we're developing here at gun works that

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.530 
we're developing here at gun works that
allow<00:00:13.410> us<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.710> develop<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.549> build<00:00:14.790> really

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
allow us to develop and build really

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.779 
allow us to develop and build really
cool<00:00:15.780> products<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.740> we<00:00:16.920> can<00:00:17.070> put<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.400> your

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
cool products that we can put in your

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.290 
cool products that we can put in your
hands<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.359> customer<00:00:18.770> essentially<00:00:19.789> I'm<00:00:20.789> very

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
hands as a customer essentially I'm very

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.019 
hands as a customer essentially I'm very
excited<00:00:22.310> probably<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:23.640> engineering

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
excited probably because my engineering

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060 
excited probably because my engineering
background<00:00:24.119> about<00:00:25.050> 3d<00:00:25.619> modeling<00:00:26.039> software

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
background about 3d modeling software

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.480 
background about 3d modeling software
and<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:27.750> capabilities<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.830> gives<00:00:29.070> us<00:00:29.220> for

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and the capabilities it gives us for

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.150 
and the capabilities it gives us for
design<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.529> computer-aided<00:00:31.529> machining

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
design and for computer-aided machining

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.430 
design and for computer-aided machining
and<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:33.000> know<00:00:33.090> n<00:00:33.270> CNC<00:00:33.750> machines<00:00:34.079> you've<00:00:34.260> seen

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and you know n CNC machines you've seen

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260 
and you know n CNC machines you've seen
me<00:00:34.590> use<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> CNC<00:00:35.309> machines<00:00:35.640> before<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> wish<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
me use the CNC machines before I wish I

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
me use the CNC machines before I wish I
could<00:00:36.390> run<00:00:36.510> those<00:00:36.719> more<00:00:36.930> often<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:38.070> I'm

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
could run those more often but I'm I'm

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.700 
could run those more often but I'm I'm
so<00:00:38.820> excited<00:00:39.300> about<00:00:39.480> taking<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.020> big<00:00:40.230> old<00:00:40.410> chunk

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
so excited about taking a big old chunk

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.740 
so excited about taking a big old chunk
of<00:00:40.860> steel<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> turning<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> into<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.629> our

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
of steel and turning it into one of our

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.229 
of steel and turning it into one of our
awesome<00:00:43.309> shooting<00:00:44.309> systems<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.850> that's

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
awesome shooting systems and that's

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
awesome shooting systems and that's
essentially<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:45.809> we're<00:00:46.079> doing<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.530> gun

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
essentially what we're doing here at gun

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.709 
essentially what we're doing here at gun
works<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.370> we'll<00:00:47.550> take<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> 3d<00:00:48.329> modelling

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
works so we'll take a 3d modelling

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
works so we'll take a 3d modelling
program<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.739> spec<00:00:50.370> out<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> product

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
program like this and spec out a product

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.549 
program like this and spec out a product
in<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.329> case<00:00:51.539> we're<00:00:51.780> working<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.199> rifle

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
in this case we're working on a rifle

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.830 
in this case we're working on a rifle
stock<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.190> we'll<00:00:53.309> take<00:00:53.460> an<00:00:53.699> engineered<00:00:54.300> set<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
stock so we'll take an engineered set of

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
stock so we'll take an engineered set of
specifications<00:00:55.199> four<00:00:56.100> dimensions<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:57.090> size

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
specifications four dimensions for size

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.119 
specifications four dimensions for size
and<00:00:58.559> we'll<00:00:59.190> combine<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.270> our<00:01:01.129> design

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and we'll combine that with our design

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.650 
and we'll combine that with our design
that<00:01:02.370> we're<00:01:02.489> looking<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.239> far<00:01:03.270> as

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that we're looking for as far as

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
that we're looking for as far as
function<00:01:04.199> form<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> aesthetic

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
function form and you know the aesthetic

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.050 
function form and you know the aesthetic
so<00:01:06.900> we<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.680> do<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.400> model<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.820> here

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
so we can do that we can model it here

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.520 
so we can do that we can model it here
when<00:01:09.210> we've<00:01:09.390> achieved<00:01:09.510> something<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
when we've achieved something that we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.950 
when we've achieved something that we
like<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.790> want<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.479> find

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
like what we really want to do is find

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.810 
like what we really want to do is find
out<00:01:13.110> if<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> works<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.369> everybody<00:01:14.760> else

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
out if it works and if everybody else

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
out if it works and if everybody else
likes<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> before<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.990> put<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.350> into<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
likes it before we put it into a

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.620 
likes it before we put it into a
manufacturing<00:01:17.400> production<00:01:17.670> process<00:01:18.119> when<00:01:18.600> we

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
manufacturing production process when we

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
manufacturing production process when we
build<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> mold<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.530> stock<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.100> going<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
build a mold for a stock it's going to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.130 
build a mold for a stock it's going to
cost<00:01:20.549> somewhere<00:01:21.240> between<00:01:21.509> five<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:21.900> seven

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
cost somewhere between five and seven

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.230 
cost somewhere between five and seven
thousand<00:01:22.650> dollars<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.100> machine<00:01:23.759> time<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
thousand dollars in machine time and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690 
thousand dollars in machine time and
materials<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.049> create<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.430> want<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
materials to create that so we want to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
materials to create that so we want to
make<00:01:26.790> sure<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.659> before<00:01:27.960> we

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
make sure that this is right before we

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
make sure that this is right before we
get<00:01:28.320> started<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> couple<00:01:29.549> ways<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.030> can

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
get started so a couple ways that we can

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.719 
get started so a couple ways that we can
do<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.659> way<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.100> pretty<00:01:32.100> old-school<00:01:32.369> we

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
do that one way is pretty old-school we

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300 
do that one way is pretty old-school we
can<00:01:32.880> take<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.390> 3d<00:01:34.259> model<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.009> write

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
can take that 3d model and we can write

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.999 
can take that 3d model and we can write
the<00:01:35.549> computer-aided<00:01:36.200> machining<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the computer-aided machining use the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.590 
the computer-aided machining use the
computer<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> machine<00:01:38.729> software<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.240> write<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
computer a machine software to write the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.499 
computer a machine software to write the
code<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.530> machine<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> test

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
code to a machine you know a test

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.840 
code to a machine you know a test
product<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> machine<00:01:44.340> out<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.670> wood

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
product so this is machine out of a wood

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.999 
product so this is machine out of a wood
blank<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.570> we<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.869> take<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.470> finish<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
blank and we can take this and finish it

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
blank and we can take this and finish it
put<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> gun<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.820> shoot<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
put a gun in it and shoot it but it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.569 
put a gun in it and shoot it but it
takes<00:01:49.290> time<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> takes<00:01:49.799> some<00:01:50.100> machine<00:01:50.369> time

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
takes time it takes some machine time

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.249 
takes time it takes some machine time
and<00:01:50.880> if<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.509> machines<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.930> busy<00:01:52.229> making

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and if all the machines are busy making

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.350 
and if all the machines are busy making
parts<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.399> hard<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> squeeze<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.329> there

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
parts it's hard to squeeze that in there

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.219 
parts it's hard to squeeze that in there
so<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:55.229> new<00:01:56.180> prototyping<00:01:57.180> method<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.110> we've

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
so a new prototyping method that we've

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.770 
so a new prototyping method that we've
just<00:01:58.439> started<00:01:59.240> experimenting<00:02:00.240> with<00:02:00.630> is

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
just started experimenting with is

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.899 
just started experimenting with is
called<00:02:00.899> rapid<00:02:01.350> prototyping<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.310> essentially

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
called rapid prototyping it essentially

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.010 
called rapid prototyping it essentially
takes<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.560> printing<00:02:04.560> technology<00:02:05.219> in<00:02:05.490> 3d<00:02:06.390> with

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
takes a printing technology in 3d with

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.169 
takes a printing technology in 3d with
plastic<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.160> really<00:02:08.369> cool<00:02:08.550> we've<00:02:08.729> got<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
plastic and it's really cool we've got a

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.380 
plastic and it's really cool we've got a
sample<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.920> our<00:02:10.920> first<00:02:11.489> version<00:02:11.879> our<00:02:12.150> first

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
sample of our first version our first

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.710 
sample of our first version our first
prototype<00:02:12.599> version<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.319> rifle

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
prototype version of that rifle

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.920 
prototype version of that rifle
stocke<00:02:13.990> right<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.760> shows<00:02:16.030> kind<00:02:16.810> of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
stocke right here and it shows kind of

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.330 
stocke right here and it shows kind of
the<00:02:17.020> features<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.530> shape<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:17.920> essentially

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the features and shape and essentially

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.460 
the features and shape and essentially
if<00:02:18.460> you<00:02:18.550> look<00:02:18.700> at<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.570> print<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.020> real

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
if you look at it we print a real

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.770 
if you look at it we print a real
lightweight<00:02:20.680> honeycomb<00:02:21.490> structure<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.180> then

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
lightweight honeycomb structure and then

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.280 
lightweight honeycomb structure and then
a<00:02:23.110> shell<00:02:23.710> to<00:02:24.100> give<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.520> shape<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.510> fit<00:02:25.750> now

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
a shell to give it the shape and fit now

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.120 
a shell to give it the shape and fit now
we've<00:02:26.470> prototyped<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.520> stock<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:29.130> bottom

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
we've prototyped a stock and a bottom

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.980 
we've prototyped a stock and a bottom
metal<00:02:30.250> with<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> detachable<00:02:30.940> magma<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.810> can

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
metal with a detachable magma so you can

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.320 
metal with a detachable magma so you can
print<00:02:32.200> some<00:02:32.320> really<00:02:32.740> cool<00:02:32.920> parts<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.520> test

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
print some really cool parts and test

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.790 
print some really cool parts and test
them<00:02:34.480> make<00:02:34.630> sure<00:02:34.660> they<00:02:34.930> fit<00:02:35.230> make<00:02:35.530> sure<00:02:35.650> the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
them make sure they fit make sure the

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.620 
them make sure they fit make sure the
design<00:02:35.980> concept<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.030> function<00:02:37.450> is<00:02:37.510> going

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
design concept and the function is going

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.390 
design concept and the function is going
to<00:02:37.750> work<00:02:37.900> so<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.560> that's<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.950> main<00:02:39.160> thing

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
to work so that that's the main thing

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.500 
to work so that that's the main thing
that<00:02:39.430> you're<00:02:39.640> trying<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.910> do<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:40.180> rapid

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
that you're trying to do with rapid

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.060 
that you're trying to do with rapid
prototyping<00:02:40.960> and<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:41.530> even<00:02:41.710> do<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.860> in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
prototyping and you can even do it in

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.350 
prototyping and you can even do it in
some<00:02:42.280> metal<00:02:42.550> parts<00:02:42.850> if<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:42.970> need<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.240> make

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
some metal parts if you need to make

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.600 
some metal parts if you need to make
functional<00:02:43.660> parts<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.740> we're<00:02:45.280> experimenting

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
functional parts so we're experimenting

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.610 
functional parts so we're experimenting
with<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.480> then<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.990> this<00:02:47.170> modeling

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
with that and then in this modeling

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.500 
with that and then in this modeling
software<00:02:48.160> we<00:02:48.370> can<00:02:48.400> take<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:48.970> make<00:02:49.360> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
software we can take and make the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.260 
software we can take and make the
changes<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.380> found<00:02:50.590> here<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:52.150> know

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
changes that we found here and you know

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.090 
changes that we found here and you know
Dane<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.690> Linz<00:02:52.870> are<00:02:53.110> our<00:02:53.320> full-time<00:02:53.650> engineer

Dane and Linz are our full-time engineer

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.880 
Dane and Linz are our full-time engineer
and<00:02:54.420> our<00:02:55.420> gun<00:02:55.660> company<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.560> getting<00:02:56.830> to

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
and our gun company is just getting to

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.500 
and our gun company is just getting to
the<00:02:56.980> point<00:02:57.010> where<00:02:57.310> we're<00:02:57.490> big<00:02:57.670> enough<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.420> be

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
the point where we're big enough to be

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.240 
the point where we're big enough to be
able<00:02:58.600> to<00:02:58.720> put<00:02:58.959> a<00:02:58.990> guy<00:02:59.320> like<00:02:59.350> Damon<00:02:59.770> in<00:02:59.980> place

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
able to put a guy like Damon in place

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.330 
able to put a guy like Damon in place
and<00:03:00.580> put<00:03:00.850> him<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.060> work<00:03:01.170> full-time<00:03:02.170> making<00:03:03.160> new

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and put him to work full-time making new

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.010 
and put him to work full-time making new
parts<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:03.760> products<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.270> we've<00:03:04.390> got<00:03:04.570> action
