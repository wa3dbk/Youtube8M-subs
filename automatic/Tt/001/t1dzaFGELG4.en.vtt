00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.089
 ah 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.490
 to 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.360
 hello youtube friends in this video 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.239
 let's teach how to iron our 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.660
 cellular is to return to the rom of 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.640
 factory or in other words go back to 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.420
 how we had the cell phone when 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.579
 we originally bought 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.650
 well this we should do when 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.760
 our cell phone manufacture 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.640
 begins to restart every time and it 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.920
 it is stuck in the samsung logo 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.510
 good for this they should download the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.379
 files that I will leave in the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.379
 video instruction 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.630
 is to miss the coolest urine and once 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.619
 that you decompress it is going to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.619
 stay this file 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.399
 for this we need to have the 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.399
 samsung streets 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.100
 to recognize the drivers 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.870
 ucb cable storage and also 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.820
 they must download their original version of 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.830
 factory in my case I had the version 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.830
 2.3.4 you will see there if he adopted a 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.830
 3.56 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.250
 we took the 3rd place 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.250
 and we connect it with the change it's 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 Aragon 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.070
 you do not have this 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 and now what we do 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.550
 kept pressed the power button that 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.270
 is this one here and the button with and the 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.159
 volume button down 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.630
 we must keep the three pressed 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.630
 buttons at the same time 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.390
 we should not let go 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.390
 and we're going to go into the download mode 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.819
 we can not leave the path here 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.940
 now we go and we enter this program 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.940
 let it be said 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.410
 we open and this will appear 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.570
 mentality 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.330
 The first thing we have to do is go to 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.970
 go and we select select ones 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.980
 and we press the cooper file that 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.680
 it also comes in the file and you 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.810
 they have to download and now here 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 you select this option this 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.170
 brand 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.099
 the mark was made says juan pagas 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.290
 and now they're going down and they're one for 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:06.140
 enable this option 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.209
 now you are looking for the original rom and 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.510
 they should download it I told them that my 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:16.480
 version was 2.3.4 and open this winrar 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.340
 all we have to do is give 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.140
 start 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.140
 and wait for the procedure 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.400
 this will automatically be you not 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.530
 they should do nothing they should just wait 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.120
 to get a message that goes 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.120

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.180
 let's cause a degree the video I'm going 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.460
 to show how it goes automatically 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.090
 you should not do anything leave it 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.090
 tranquil 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.519

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.989
 at 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.010
 minutes and he 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.680
 that is waiving 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.650
 here we see there is doing 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.310
 again the samsung logo the animation 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.310
 drip 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.760
 we must be patient is a mind 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:43.310
 well in my case it was already finished to the minute 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.770
 4 49 and there I get the peace footage is 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:49.500
 say complete guidance now let's 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.439
 our cell phone we can already remove this 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.300
 ah 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:56.050
 ah 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.050
 now 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:07.130
 in another device we remove the gravel 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.130
 and we removed the battery 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.360
 when putting the battery 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.310
 our cover 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.520
 and we keep the power button and the button 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.860
 home to enter the recovery mode 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.860
 we keep pressed this without releasing it 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.509
 and we're going to go into the recovery mode 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.600
 Without dropping 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:48.790
 and once here we go to options 15 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:51.160
 white the factory recipe we move 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.860
 with the volume keys this is the 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.470
 case down in the third option and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:01.240
 we press the home button to select 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.240
 then we go again down 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.509
 I selected again 10 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.330
 now less than now another option that 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.670
 says white cache for said that is the 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.600
 quarter 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:18.490
 and what we have to do now is 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.620
 Restart the mobile with the first option 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.620
 and press the home button 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.919
 and once this is done we have our 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:39.539
 device as we bought it the first 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:42.389
 it comes with either applications 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:46.220
 that it brings to the trash but we could already 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.220
 save our samsung galaxy 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:53.160
 we hope to reconfigure our 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.980
 now if you had any backup 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.080
 you can restore it with the mode 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.240
 recovery but they have to be in the 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.440
 club what else in another video I will show 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.220
 how to make a backup 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.220
 have the club 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.849
 Well, I hope 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.990
 in functions 

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:14.670
 let's wait to see if a man 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.490
 it may take the first time 

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:20.700
 restart as you are configuring 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:23.900
 zero again our cell 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.900
 and is that being a little patient 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.360
 and now we have to reconfigure 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.360
 all 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:44.420
 the first christer order what's up 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.420
 to appear he 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.569
 lg then they have to turn off the 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.500
 dancers with high balance in the case of 

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.500
 that do not have a data plan 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.740
 and now we close our samsung alexis 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:04.490
 and I hope this video serves from 

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.490
 light and your client and not 

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:09.409
