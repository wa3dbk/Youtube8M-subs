mostly open case from the top of the box
but<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.080> time<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:16.350> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.529> try<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.740> open

but this time I'm going to try to open
it<00:00:17.190> from<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> bottom<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.449> don't<00:00:19.170> know<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.560> to

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
it from the bottom I don't know just to

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.310 
it from the bottom I don't know just to
see<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:19.920> difference<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.340> makes<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.390> it

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
see what difference it makes and it

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.980 
see what difference it makes and it
sounds<00:00:22.710> like<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.220> difference<00:00:23.550> basis

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
sounds like the difference basis

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
sounds like the difference basis
everything<00:00:24.990> inside<00:00:25.140> is<00:00:26.449> coming<00:00:27.449> apart<00:00:27.689> or

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
everything inside is coming apart or

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.310 
everything inside is coming apart or
something<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> don't<00:00:28.320> know<00:00:28.470> sounds<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.010> it

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
something I don't know sounds like it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:48.860 
something I don't know sounds like it
but<00:00:31.320> let's<00:00:31.500> open<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.949> box<00:00:33.140> with<00:00:34.140> mn8<00:00:47.870> alright

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
but let's open the box with mn8 alright

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.779 
but let's open the box with mn8 alright
so<00:00:49.590> looks<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:51.500> we<00:00:52.500> find<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> user's<00:00:53.340> manual

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so looks like we find the user's manual

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.500 
so looks like we find the user's manual
top<00:00:54.030> here<00:00:54.800> so<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> user's<00:00:56.370> manual<00:00:56.820> and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.930 

pick<00:01:00.510> up<00:01:00.660> much<00:01:01.079> girl<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> say<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.760> I

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
to the older version burrito where it

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.740 
to the older version burrito where it
was<00:04:39.740> great<00:04:40.070> this<00:04:41.000> is<00:04:41.150> a<00:04:41.180> really<00:04:41.600> big

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750

GPU<00:04:45.440> air<00:04:45.710> ducts<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.220> didn't<00:04:46.760> think<00:04:46.790> they

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
GPU air ducts I didn't think they

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.050 
GPU air ducts I didn't think they
include<00:04:47.540> that<00:04:47.720> with<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.080> older<00:04:48.440> version<00:04:49.060> but

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
include that with the older version but

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.940 
include that with the older version but
then<00:04:50.180> there's<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.450> few<00:04:50.630> things<00:04:50.870> that<00:04:51.710> they

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
then there's a few things that they

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.090 
then there's a few things that they
didn't<00:04:52.520> change<00:04:52.790> fortunately<00:04:53.860> mainly<00:04:54.860> being

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
didn't change fortunately mainly being

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.530 
didn't change fortunately mainly being
that<00:04:55.400> there<00:04:55.550> is<00:04:55.640> no<00:04:55.760> dust<00:04:55.970> shoulder<00:04:56.270> on<00:04:56.419> the

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
that there is no dust shoulder on the

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.930 
that there is no dust shoulder on the
bottom<00:04:56.930> forty<00:04:57.650> power<00:04:57.950> supplies<00:04:58.190> intake<00:04:58.669> fan

bottom forty power supplies intake fan

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.060 
bottom forty power supplies intake fan
that<00:04:59.419> wasn't<00:04:59.780> there<00:04:59.930> with<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.320> older<00:05:00.680> one<00:05:00.890> and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
that wasn't there with the older one and

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.210 
that wasn't there with the older one and
it<00:05:01.340> still<00:05:01.730> isn't<00:05:01.940> so<00:05:02.270> that's<00:05:02.450> unfortunate<00:05:03.320> and

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
it still isn't so that's unfortunate and

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.180 
it still isn't so that's unfortunate and
then<00:05:04.430> with<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.970> side<00:05:05.720> panel<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.260> don't<00:05:06.950> like<00:05:07.040> a

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
then with the side panel I don't like a

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.260 
then with the side panel I don't like a
side<00:05:07.490> panel<00:05:08.860> mainly<00:05:09.860> because<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.580> have<00:05:11.150> this

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
side panel mainly because you have this
