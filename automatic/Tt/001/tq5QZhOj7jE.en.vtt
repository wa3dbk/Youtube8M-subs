 know where to go it's simple as 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.759

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.369
 covered so if you 're interested 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.250
 do not forget to use crazy code 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 to benefit from the 5% discount and 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.789
 hello to all and to all those 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.800
 created zip and today we end up 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 for a mega pack opening all 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.099
 simply you can see it on the screen 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.660
 the 100000 packs are at our 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.980
 provision so suddenly I asked 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.510
 on twitter how many easter you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.920
 would like me to open several videos 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 people asked me in unopened 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.950
 cat and so that's what we're going 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 do in this video knowing that there 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.760
 will have a small peculiarity for a no 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.020
 do not know that that is number 4 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.030
 I asked on twitter to give me a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.320
 number between 1 and 4 so at attitudes 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.510
 I'll put you the little tweet on the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.950
 video gave me the number 4 and so the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.530
 blow the fourth pack I want 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.570
 open in this video I would win 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.789
 the best pac player knowing that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.780
 even if a player is going to say 79.82 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.399
 general we never know and that's right 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.109
 that there are only rare gold players 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.460
 can have a better player at 82 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.170
 general everything is possible with bowling 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 and so that's it even if it's a player 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.830
 we're going to say shit like that at the level 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 of the general you will win it when 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.580
 even for the beauty of the gesture 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 so suddenly we will open two on this 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 account and two on another account so 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.000
 we will start directly with 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.110
 first package I stop with my so 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.909
 but in any case I hope at least you 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.740
 still win big players 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.720
 I saw who also had but so well 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.700
 sympathetic messiah and especially to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.960
 match maneuvers where there the pack e but 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.619
 very very very long time then knowing 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.950
 that this pack 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.869
 he is mine so at the limit 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:38.479
 I want a good player also month and 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.100
 yeah yeah yeah yeah but not higuain 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.409
 I do not care a word that I do not care 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.270
 completely in fact toni kroos toni 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.020
 kroos we're going to swing him on the track and 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.140
 makes the track 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.780
 the pile of forgiveness transfers go 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.429
 go go it must be clear no 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.569
 he wants by bobo we will take we go 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.610
 take our time anyway in 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.020
 this video here finally he saw he has 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.140
 good enough to clear otherwise frankly 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.490
 here we are going to say thankfully for you 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.470
 that it's not this step that I would have you 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.450
 given so because if I think stop 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.549
 really sad, we sell it all 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.110
 and we go directly chained with the 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.450
 second death I still hope with 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.579
 here are four packs to 100000 that we 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.630
 go at least 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.160
 chopper something that resell themselves 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.230
 a little bit we will say to not lose 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.000
 400 miles credit like that all of a sudden 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.530
 would still be a little bit bad where I 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.180
 think go we left for the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.860
 second 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.090
 again this pack it's mine I 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.340
 I 'm sorry I have a little bit of pain 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.390
 the throat 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.709
 I hope it will not be too much 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.450
 in any case I already have that I start 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.400
 already to be thirsty while that makes that 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.019
 I think two little minutes that I 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.609
 you talk about straws and ben voila 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.739
 listen I'm going to go hungry 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.810
 I was going to say the bottle or the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.639
 bottleneck of the bottle right in front of my 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.510
 mouth and then by mug straws 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.959
 against i just watched 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.100
 ivo he sees little more than 120,000 credit I 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.239
 believe but he's a very good player 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.069
 frankly I think I'm going to 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.180
 keep to test it just wait I 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:00.799
 will still drink a little bit because 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:02.630
 that otherwise I'm choking and that's okay 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.799
 better and listen to straws for for 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.810

 resell well we'll put it to 150 ch is 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.730
 not exactly its price and then I have a 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.900
 little bit laziness we'll say 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.849
 look anyway this pack 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.650
 he is reimbursed unfortunately for 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.239
 you it is not the step that I would have you 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.970
 good with the player I would have you 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.590

 so listen we will not lose more than 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.450
 time we will directly open the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.970
 third before moving on to the fourth 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.069

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.860
 grabbed something again 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.180
 it's not your pack 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.560

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.819
 the screen there is nothing we will go all 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.739
 gently andy carroll and and we're going 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.269
 to catch would show them the 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.489
 month there I will start I have the heart 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:19.739
 who beats mans toulouse and we have 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.810
 nab cuadrado cuadrado 95 84.2 General 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.479
 of speed to isla plays a little bit 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.650
 jonathan biabiany there on the spot then 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.180
 but I do not know 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.260
 how and how much I have seen that 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.180
 memphis straws 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.260
 it's worth it a little less than 100 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.120
 miles so let's say I have 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.550
 repaid the pack but which one quadra 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.169
 will send it directly to the list 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.940
 transfers and so the coup I hope 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.180
 frankly I hope the fourth 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.889
 pack there will be something for you 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.720
 so listen I had I had two 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.100
 interesting players man of the match 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.570
 so for the third we need 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.940
 but if we need it but if I tell you 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.590
 save do not talk anymore wait 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.720
 I'm going to directly deliver 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.330
 a few days on the on the pile on the 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.039
 pile of transfers go that's going away 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.180
 and then we went directly to open the 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.970
 last step when I think there was 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.729
 nothing on the other side do not have anything 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.220
 little drogba a little ashley school and 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.530
 this is the moment you're waiting for 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.600
 all the last pack to 100 miles and 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.930
 this time the biggest player of this 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.460
 pack 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.560
 I will make you win I hope 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.970
 really really really and from the bottom of 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.889
 honestly I hope there is 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.360
 still big players in this pack 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.010
 then at the top there is no message 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.300
 there's no message so I think 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.700
 not that it will be a player of the team of 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.110
 the week but dell and well cost at 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.990
 less it's a boost at least it's a 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:35.610
 boost I will see if there is not a small 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.900
 a big player plus hayati vidal by 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.550
 against vidal I absolutely do not know 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.990
 how are we going to watch we're going 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.610
 look at it or in any case if vidal is worth 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.139
 something i would put medel and 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.810
 vidal like that it will do you a little bit 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.190
 a little bit of credit yeah bah 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.620
 listen and here we go now 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.500
 wait wait 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.210
 gbg not seen there I thought I saw it 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.460
 was at 85 vidal and I have the version 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.199
 86 so suddenly 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.699
 or so I had very bad eyes or so 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.410
 I saw very badly then against I like 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:02.570
 not when his load like that because 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.860
 it's going to be able to disconnect me from 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.660
 servers that will make me leave 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.419
 ultimate team it's going to be a good one again 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.540
 big mess so it would be nice when 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.300
 even that it comes back then is what 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.010
 you want to ruin my moment of joy 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.290
 or anything in that is it 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.400
 come back then so I'm going to look 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.350
 compare prices so is that 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.240
 that was what I had seen yeah 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.970
 it was his diversion at 85 so 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.889
 never to find the version at 86 for 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.300
 see to see how much that's how much 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:32.449
 in any case it will be worth it whore it is 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.270
 over 5000 credit good wait here 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.560

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.639
 players on the price level I am 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.620
 completely dropped so go on we're going 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:52.190
 to say that jeffrey won at one 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:54.400
