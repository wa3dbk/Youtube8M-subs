00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920 
is the video keeps spamming and it like
spasming<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> don't<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.270> why<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.809> doing

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
spasming but I don't know why it's doing

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.420 
spasming but I don't know why it's doing
it<00:00:43.140> since<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.590> wrong<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> fraps<00:00:44.219> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
it since it's the wrong the fraps I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010 
it since it's the wrong the fraps I
think<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> new<00:00:45.239> traps<00:00:45.840> or

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
think we have to get a new traps or

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.340 
think we have to get a new traps or
something<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:46.950> it's<00:00:47.160> sucking<00:00:48.350> anyway

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
something because it's sucking anyway

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.869 
something because it's sucking anyway

just throwing diverse roughening chat
and<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.420> eventually<00:01:30.840> traded<00:01:31.079> me<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:32.150> put

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and it's on eventually traded me I put

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.640 
and it's on eventually traded me I put
any<00:01:33.299> one<00:01:33.420> scrap<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.869> got<00:01:33.960> two<00:01:34.140> weapons<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
any one scrap and got two weapons and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
any one scrap and got two weapons and
these<00:01:34.920> weapons<00:01:35.310> are<00:01:35.400> quite<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.240> know

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
these weapons are quite one is you know

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.910 
these weapons are quite one is you know
that<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.750> wallet<00:01:37.049> chops<00:01:37.259> quite<00:01:37.530> wild<00:01:37.799> up

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that that wallet chops quite wild up

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.609 
that that wallet chops quite wild up
isn't<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.390> far<00:01:39.630> from<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> pyro<00:01:40.140> update

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
isn't not that far from the pyro update

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.310 
isn't not that far from the pyro update
so<00:01:41.430> these<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.450> thought<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:42.899> would<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.140> easy

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
so these I thought these would be easy

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.350 
so these I thought these would be easy
to<00:01:43.439> sell<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.180> to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
to sell as well you don't really have to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.999 
to sell as well you don't really have to
it<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.720> any<00:01:45.899> weapon<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.770> like

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
it can be any weapon really but like

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
it can be any weapon really but like
there<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.310> certain<00:01:47.579> weapons<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> sell<00:01:48.509> what

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
there are certain weapons that sell what

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
there are certain weapons that sell what
quicker<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:50.040> black<00:01:50.280> box<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.820> of

quicker like the black box is one of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.880 
quicker like the black box is one of

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
that I've got so I'm spamming that now

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.260

in<00:02:10.739> trade<00:02:11.129> throwing<00:02:12.060> two<00:02:12.209> weapons<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.959> event

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
in trade throwing two weapons that event

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.590 
in trade throwing two weapons that event
surely<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:15.940> round<00:02:16.180> now<00:02:16.330> eventually

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
surely I think it's round now eventually

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.200 
surely I think it's round now eventually
someone<00:02:16.990> trades<00:02:17.230> with<00:02:17.380> me<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:18.370> they<00:02:18.520> buy<00:02:18.670> both

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
something is no difference really but

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.940 
something is no difference really but
you<00:02:38.320> know<00:02:38.350> for<00:02:39.250> both<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.270> scrap<00:02:40.950> so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
you know for both you get to scrap so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.580 
you know for both you get to scrap so
I'm<00:02:42.280> there<00:02:42.820> just<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:43.630> I've<00:02:43.840> made<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.380> one

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
scrap profit so you know it doesn't take

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.820 
scrap profit so you know it doesn't take
that<00:02:49.510> long<00:02:49.570> either<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.470> doesn't<00:02:50.620> take<00:02:50.800> that

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
that long either it doesn't take that

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.630 
that long either it doesn't take that
long<00:02:50.950> depending<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:51.930> what<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:53.020> want<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.200> do<00:02:53.640> so

want<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.300> make<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.840> lot<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.230> scrap<00:02:59.590> you're<00:03:00.400> going

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
want to make a lot of scrap you're going

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.250

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
bulk so it's better you can work your

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.250 
bulk so it's better you can work your
way<00:03:03.880> up<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.150> obviously<00:03:04.390> by<00:03:04.840> doing<00:03:05.110> it

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
way up to that obviously by doing it

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.820 
way up to that obviously by doing it
slowly

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
slowly
