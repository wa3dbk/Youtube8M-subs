00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
so we need to adjust really quick from

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.279 
so we need to adjust really quick from
the<00:00:28.140> fridge<00:00:28.349> second<00:00:29.310> when<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.550> ball<00:00:30.390> it's

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the fridge second when the ball it's

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
playing on we have to adjust to that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.130 
playing on we have to adjust to that
game<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.620> we<00:00:34.739> try<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.010> impulse<00:00:35.820> our<00:00:36.140> style

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
game and we try to impulse our style

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.240

over<00:00:37.680> there<00:00:37.920> their<00:00:38.579> style<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.620> age<00:00:40.680> they

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
over there their style at that age they

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.590 
over there their style at that age they
already<00:00:41.850> plane<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.829> professional<00:00:43.829> level<00:00:44.010> or

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
players they they don't have that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.260 
players they they don't have that
possibility<00:00:52.039> little<00:00:53.039> tough<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.280> us<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> get

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
possibility little tough for us to get

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.630 
possibility little tough for us to get
ready<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.780> especially<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.530> level

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
ready for that especially at this level

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.240 
ready for that especially at this level
but<00:00:56.660> we'll<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.739> coaches<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.219> really

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
but we'll see our coaches are really

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.720 
but we'll see our coaches are really
good<00:00:59.550> with<00:01:00.469> recovering<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.800> all<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.460> see

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
good with recovering and all that so see

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
good with recovering and all that so see
how<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> goes<00:01:03.110> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:04.559> time<00:01:04.680> we

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
how it goes this is the first time we

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.429 
how it goes this is the first time we
played<00:01:04.890> there<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.909> type<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.439> tournament

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
played there in that type of tournament

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.090 
played there in that type of tournament
format<00:01:08.540> in<00:01:09.540> order<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.020> prepare<00:01:10.350> ourselves<00:01:10.470> for

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
format in order to prepare ourselves for

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
format in order to prepare ourselves for
the<00:01:11.310> qualifying<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.030> for<00:01:12.450> us<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.750> also<00:01:13.080> an

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the qualifying so for us is also an

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.770 
the qualifying so for us is also an
experiment<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.760> need<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:14.970> check<00:01:15.390> which

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
experiment that we need to check which

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.190 
experiment that we need to check which
players<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.490> hold<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.570> player<00:01:18.840> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
players can hold that which player can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.890 
players can hold that which player can
recover<00:01:19.560> quicker<00:01:19.890> which<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:20.970> cannot<00:01:21.540> recover

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
recover quicker which one cannot recover

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
recover quicker which one cannot recover
so<00:01:22.290> that's<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> help<00:01:23.009> us<00:01:23.189> allowed<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so that's going to help us allowed to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
so that's going to help us allowed to
gather<00:01:24.420> information<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.680> type<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.220> exposure

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
gather information this type of exposure

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.319 
gather information this type of exposure
is<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> allow<00:01:28.380> us<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.979> okay<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
is going to allow us to know okay this

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.810 
is going to allow us to know okay this
is<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.720> level<00:01:31.049> we're<00:01:31.680> good<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.490> need<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is a one level we're good we need to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.420 
is a one level we're good we need to
work<00:01:32.970> more<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.159> need<00:01:35.280> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
work more on that or what we need to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.420 
work more on that or what we need to
