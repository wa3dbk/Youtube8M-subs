kind of cheese in it and it has to have

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.160 
kind of cheese in it and it has to have
something<00:03:02.060> that<00:03:02.240> just<00:03:02.270> takes<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.840> from<00:03:03.020> like

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
potatoes really need salt because I

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.460 
potatoes really need salt because I
