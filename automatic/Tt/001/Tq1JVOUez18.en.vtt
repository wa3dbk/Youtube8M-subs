types to see if we can find a way of
finding<00:01:14.890> disease<00:01:15.250> markers<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:16.299> is<00:01:16.450> an

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.830 
have in the department and they're
essential<00:01:21.909> for<00:01:22.180> use<00:01:22.390> in<00:01:22.630> solid-state

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
chemistry because very few other

periodic<00:01:27.460> solids<00:01:27.790> so<00:01:28.420> these<00:01:28.600> allow<00:01:28.930> us<00:01:28.960> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
periodic solids so these allow us to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.680 
periodic solids so these allow us to
apply<00:01:31.090> x-rays<00:01:31.720> through<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.170> sample<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:32.740> then

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
apply x-rays through the sample and then

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.320 
apply x-rays through the sample and then
depending<00:01:34.690> on<00:01:34.780> where<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.380> x-rays<00:01:35.740> diffract

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
depending on where the x-rays diffract

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.300 
depending on where the x-rays diffract
you<00:01:37.330> can<00:01:37.479> detect<00:01:37.960> what<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.619> structure<00:01:39.010> of<00:01:39.159> the

same supervisor I do my PhD with and
again<00:02:09.200> it<00:02:09.379> was<00:02:09.530> involving<00:02:10.310> lipid<00:02:10.610> analysis

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
again it was involving lipid analysis

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.650 
again it was involving lipid analysis
and<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:12.470> was<00:02:12.709> involving<00:02:13.300> optimizing<00:02:14.300> the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
and it was involving optimizing the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.650 
and it was involving optimizing the
ionization<00:02:15.170> pathway<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.860> those<00:02:16.010> lipids<00:02:16.660> and

that's something that I've continued to
look<00:02:19.640> at<00:02:20.019> beginning<00:02:21.019> my<00:02:21.110> PhD<00:02:21.560> work<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:22.310> fourth

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
look at beginning my PhD work the fourth

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.970 
look at beginning my PhD work the fourth
years<00:02:22.819> a<00:02:22.879> lot<00:02:23.120> more<00:02:23.330> independent<00:02:24.049> you<00:02:24.680> get<00:02:24.860> to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
years a lot more independent you get to

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.009 
years a lot more independent you get to
specialize<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.519> lot<00:02:25.790> more<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.629> areas<00:02:26.989> that

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
specialize a lot more in the areas that

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.339 
specialize a lot more in the areas that
you<00:02:27.290> want<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.590> look<00:02:27.709> at<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:29.239> two<00:02:29.750> thirds<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.200> my

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
you want to look at so two thirds of my

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.229 
you want to look at so two thirds of my
time<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.830> taken<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:31.370> by<00:02:31.400> writing<00:02:32.150> a
