have a future war cult ship and we can

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.480 
have a future war cult ship and we can

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
legs and we have hunter cloaks below

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710 
legs and we have hunter cloaks below
that<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.429> helmet<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:09.030> chess<00:02:09.509> piece

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that we then have a helmet a chess piece

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.260 
that we then have a helmet a chess piece
and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.619> three<00:02:11.099> different<00:02:11.310> ghosts

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
and then we have three different ghosts

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.760 
and then we have three different ghosts
however<00:02:12.660> they<00:02:12.780> all<00:02:12.959> look<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.349> same

however they all look the same

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.470 
however they all look the same
so<00:02:14.100> possibly<00:02:14.490> these<00:02:14.730> ghosts<00:02:15.180> are<00:02:15.210> going<00:02:15.420> to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.180 
so possibly these ghosts are going to
have<00:02:15.630> different<00:02:15.900> perks<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.650> upgrades<00:02:17.010> to

see behind the text there and at the top

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.300 
see behind the text there and at the top
we<00:04:12.780> have<00:04:12.930> a<00:04:12.959> load<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.260> packages<00:04:13.860> which<00:04:14.070> look

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
we have a load of packages which look

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.610 
we have a load of packages which look
like<00:04:14.520> you<00:04:14.820> also<00:04:15.060> have<00:04:15.270> some<00:04:15.690> armor<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.380> then

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
like you also have some armor and then

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.140 
like you also have some armor and then
along<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.040> bottom<00:04:17.220> we<00:04:17.430> have<00:04:17.459> what<00:04:17.880> looks<00:04:17.910> to

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
along the bottom we have what looks to

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.270 
along the bottom we have what looks to
be<00:04:18.209> some<00:04:18.330> new<00:04:18.690> future<00:04:19.109> war<00:04:19.290> cult<00:04:19.500> weapons<00:04:19.950> we

are going to be showing off tomorrow
firstly<00:04:30.460> we<00:04:30.550> have<00:04:30.580> nameplate<00:04:31.330> collections<00:04:31.870> so

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
firstly we have nameplate collections so

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.780 
firstly we have nameplate collections so
hopefully<00:04:32.470> all<00:04:32.800> your<00:04:33.070> name<00:04:33.250> plates<00:04:33.490> are<00:04:33.670> going

little bit about we then have infusion

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.260 
little bit about we then have infusion
which<00:04:54.100> I'm<00:04:54.310> not<00:04:54.490> entirely<00:04:54.790> sure<00:04:54.940> where<00:04:55.240> that

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
which I'm not entirely sure where that

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.570 
which I'm not entirely sure where that
is<00:04:55.540> we<00:04:55.900> have<00:04:56.080> shader<00:04:56.590> collections<00:04:57.190> which<00:04:57.430> is

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
is we have shader collections which is

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.040 
is we have shader collections which is
the<00:04:57.700> brand<00:04:57.970> new<00:04:58.060> kiosk<00:04:58.450> which<00:04:58.720> is<00:04:58.840> going<00:04:58.990> to

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
the brand new kiosk which is going to

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.720 
the brand new kiosk which is going to
have<00:04:59.200> all<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.560> shaders<00:04:59.890> you<00:05:00.040> have<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.490> all

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
have all the shaders you have and all

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.220 
have all the shaders you have and all
the<00:05:00.820> shade<00:05:01.000> is<00:05:01.120> you<00:05:01.240> don't<00:05:01.420> have<00:05:01.660> until<00:05:02.140> you

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
the shade is you don't have until you

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.720 
the shade is you don't have until you
have<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.530> get<00:05:02.710> them<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.070> then<00:05:03.370> we<00:05:03.460> have<00:05:03.580> the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
have to get them and then we have the

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.790 
have to get them and then we have the
level<00:05:03.940> 25<00:05:04.420> character<00:05:05.080> boost<00:05:05.290> which<00:05:05.620> now

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
level 25 character boost which now

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.500 
level 25 character boost which now
confirms<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.550> minimum<00:05:06.820> level<00:05:07.210> for<00:05:07.420> the

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
confirms that the minimum level for the

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.960 
confirms that the minimum level for the
taken<00:05:07.810> king<00:05:08.050> is<00:05:08.230> 25<00:05:09.010> and<00:05:09.280> when<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.670> get<00:05:09.850> the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
taken king is 25 and when you get the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.640 
taken king is 25 and when you get the
taken<00:05:10.270> King<00:05:10.480> you'll<00:05:10.750> get<00:05:10.960> a<00:05:11.110> one-time-use

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
taken King you'll get a one-time-use

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.500 
taken King you'll get a one-time-use
character<00:05:12.370> boost<00:05:12.580> which<00:05:12.880> will<00:05:13.060> boost<00:05:13.210> any

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
character boost which will boost any

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.300 
character boost which will boost any
character<00:05:14.080> up<00:05:14.260> to<00:05:14.440> the<00:05:14.530> minimum<00:05:14.920> required

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
character up to the minimum required

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.490 
character up to the minimum required
level<00:05:15.610> which<00:05:15.820> is<00:05:16.000> now<00:05:16.180> 25<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:17.020> then<00:05:17.170> we<00:05:17.350> have

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
level which is now 25 and then we have

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.440 
level which is now 25 and then we have
exotic<00:05:17.920> blueprints<00:05:18.580> which<00:05:18.760> we<00:05:18.940> actually<00:05:19.270> get

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
exotic blueprints which we actually get

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.810 
exotic blueprints which we actually get
a<00:05:19.570> glimpse<00:05:19.840> of<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.470> this<00:05:20.650> says<00:05:20.890> exotic<00:05:21.460> weapon

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
a glimpse of so this says exotic weapon

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.250 
a glimpse of so this says exotic weapon
blueprints<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.480> we<00:05:22.600> have<00:05:22.780> year<00:05:23.080> two

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
blueprints and we have year two
