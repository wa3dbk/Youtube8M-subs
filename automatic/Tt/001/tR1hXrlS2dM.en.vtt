00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
is necessary to have my flaws and you'd

is necessary to have my flaws and you'd
have<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.299> look<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.630> lot<00:00:15.719> into<00:00:16.279> statistics<00:00:17.279> of

committed around the times of each of
these<00:00:22.560> acts<00:00:22.740> come<00:00:22.949> up<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.699> compare<00:00:23.939> them<00:00:24.029> to

these acts come up and compare them to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.660 
these acts come up and compare them to
other<00:00:24.180> countries<00:00:24.300> where<00:00:24.900> they're<00:00:25.490> my<00:00:26.490> flaws

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
other countries where they're my flaws

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.769 
other countries where they're my flaws
on<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> strict<00:00:28.039> but<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.730> can<00:00:30.000> take<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> guess

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
on a strict but I can I can take a guess

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.520 
on a strict but I can I can take a guess
and<00:00:31.080> say<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:32.059> they<00:00:33.059> probably<00:00:33.360> don't<00:00:33.660> change

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
and say that they probably don't change

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.250 
and say that they probably don't change
too<00:00:34.920> much<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.570> would<00:00:36.570> imagine<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.930> most

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
too much I would imagine that most

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.540 
too much I would imagine that most
criminals<00:00:38.190> who<00:00:39.440> well<00:00:40.440> actually<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.520> think

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
criminals who well actually if you think

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
criminals who well actually if you think
about<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.120> criminals<00:00:42.629> they<00:00:43.350> don't<00:00:43.559> care

think<00:03:28.930> it's<00:03:29.110> kind<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.530> bit<00:03:29.739> misdirected

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
think it's kind of a bit misdirected

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.970 
think it's kind of a bit misdirected
sometimes<00:03:30.820> people's<00:03:31.480> ideas<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:32.110> some<00:03:32.860> of<00:03:32.920> the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
sometimes people's ideas and some of the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.360 
sometimes people's ideas and some of the
laws<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.160> our<00:03:33.400> lives<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:35.290> can<00:03:36.070> do<00:03:36.160> all<00:03:36.250> these

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
laws of our lives you can do all these

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.620 
laws of our lives you can do all these
restrictions<00:03:36.579> but<00:03:37.000> people<00:03:37.269> are<00:03:37.329> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.540> get

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
restrictions but people are going to get

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.150 
restrictions but people are going to get
hold<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:37.870> them<00:03:37.989> anyway<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.380> in<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.980> long<00:03:39.130> run

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
hold of them anyway and in the long run

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.949 
hold of them anyway and in the long run
you<00:03:39.730> are<00:03:39.760> only<00:03:39.940> really<00:03:40.180> restricting<00:03:40.660> the

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
you are only really restricting the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.310 
you are only really restricting the
law-abiding<00:03:41.440> people<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.690> if<00:03:43.690> they

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
law-abiding people because if they

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.509 
law-abiding people because if they
didn't<00:03:44.769> obey<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:45.070> laws<00:03:45.989> then<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.769> know<00:03:47.890> it

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
didn't obey the laws then you know it

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:49.590 
didn't obey the laws then you know it
doesn't<00:03:48.730> matter<00:03:48.880> whether<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.329> laws<00:03:49.450> are

doesn't matter whether the laws are

who are not going to break the laws in

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
the first place I'm not going to use

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.860 
the first place I'm not going to use
them<00:03:57.820> for<00:03:57.850> weapons<00:03:58.239> they're<00:03:58.540> just<00:03:58.690> going<00:03:58.780> to

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
them for weapons they're just going to

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.770 
them for weapons they're just going to
collect<00:03:59.019> them<00:04:00.000> that's<00:04:01.000> that's<00:04:01.269> that's<00:04:01.510> part

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
collect them that's that's that's part

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.810 
collect them that's that's that's part
in<00:04:01.840> my<00:04:01.930> opinion<00:04:01.959> but<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.100> knife<00:04:03.459> laws<00:04:03.640> they

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
in my opinion but the knife laws they

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.780 
in my opinion but the knife laws they
are<00:04:03.850> they<00:04:04.239> are<00:04:04.359> there<00:04:04.570> for<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.750> reason<00:04:05.579> maybe<00:04:06.579> if

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
are they are there for a reason maybe if

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.599 
are they are there for a reason maybe if
they're<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.000> bit<00:04:07.180> misguided<00:04:07.500> but<00:04:08.500> we<00:04:09.370> have<00:04:09.489> to

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
they're a bit misguided but we have to

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:10.800 
they're a bit misguided but we have to
see<00:04:09.760> how<00:04:09.880> under<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.239> new<00:04:10.329> government<00:04:10.480> how

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
see how under the new government how

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.870 
see how under the new government how
they<00:04:10.870> go<00:04:11.049> as<00:04:11.170> well<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.590> don't<00:04:12.579> think<00:04:12.730> they'll<00:04:12.820> be

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
they go as well I don't think they'll be

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.660 
they go as well I don't think they'll be
loosening<00:04:13.180> up<00:04:13.329> anytime<00:04:13.570> soon<00:04:13.720> but<00:04:14.670> perhaps

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
loosening up anytime soon but perhaps

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.240 
loosening up anytime soon but perhaps
the<00:04:15.850> whole<00:04:15.970> culture<00:04:16.390> on<00:04:16.510> their<00:04:16.720> paring<00:04:17.709> knife

the whole culture on their paring knife
grammar<00:04:18.519> stuff<00:04:18.729> will<00:04:19.060> change<00:04:19.329> possibly<00:04:20.130> but

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
grammar stuff will change possibly but

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.440 
grammar stuff will change possibly but
just<00:04:21.340> remember<00:04:21.669> that<00:04:21.789> it's<00:04:21.880> not<00:04:21.909> it's<00:04:22.270> not<00:04:22.390> the
