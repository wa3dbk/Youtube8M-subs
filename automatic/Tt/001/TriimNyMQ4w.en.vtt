00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 many times customers could ask 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.400
 make sliding doors so they 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.800
 went to the wall and in many companies 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.290
 they say that by no means 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.360
 think what to do because they are for 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.580
 this is not intended in reality 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.180
 this little bit something special 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.640
 mechanisms for example that strange mechanism 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.359
 install that is, it is a mortgage cassette 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.689
 which is mounted before david from 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.270
 watch a movie here this part is removable 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.140
 she is right here inside the wall 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 respectively and and rails 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.120
 things are going and come here for what it is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 done 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.860
 first mounted cassette that is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.260
 rough work and after when all 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.210
 will be done on this cassette mounted 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.940
 the door that is it is inside 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.699
 the cassette is specially covered with all 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.489
 sides of the grid 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.129
 it was possible to plaster and that was not 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
 cracks it ends here and here 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.299
 brick wall begins so that there is no 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.500
 cracks meanwhile where ends 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.409
 truth newspapers 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.560
 This cassette is designed for two 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.320
 canvases meaning there will be 2 2 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.020
 you are up to 0 and 2 and accordingly when we 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.790
 we will take one door and torture she 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.220
 will fully open the dispute cling 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.970
 the second door and it will close 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:30.020
 completely by doing so we have achieved 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.420
 achieved that they do not walk on the walls 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.299
 are inside but there is a limit 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.280
 wall thickness in order for cassettes to be 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.009
 be at least 18 centimeters 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 respectively for one wall take on 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:49.850
 two times less but necessarily a cassette 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.299
 should go before you started in 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.979
 led 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.890
 exactly this wall where it will be with us 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.209
 marry on if you do something you want 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.840
 do from when all the levels in the game 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:02.209
 prophesied can this not work 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.849
 construction continues 7 month using 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.220
 This time the studio manager order

 refuted the light we follow the progress 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:18.200
 performing sunset taking
