00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.840
 hi friends with you i am dmitry fresco 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.920
 culinary promoter 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.990
 what poor students eat right 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 fried potatoes scrambled eggs and you're right 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.519
 protein maximum 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.720
 maximum fat and maximum carbohydrates 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.150
 what the young grower needs 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.600
 the body to endure all the learning 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.430
 and the social life of the Spaniards have managed 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 connect two traditional student 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 dishes in one traditional national and 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.710
 somehow did not guess 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.579
 and it turned out tortilla de patatas something 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.450
 like 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.250
 potato tortilla although there is no tortilla 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.730
 mexican tortilla tortilla with 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 cornmeal is more like potato 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.649
 omelette or omelette with potatoes sounds 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.870
 plain truth however spanish 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.550
 tortilla is not as simple as it seems there is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.710
 a few nuances that need to be taken into account 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.780
 when cooking as it always happens 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.430
 super popular national dishes 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 not without controversy acutely of course 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.040
 cove and stupidly finisher of blood and guts and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.049
 how to cut potatoes into cubes or 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 cluster slices do not put onions 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.400
 Some Spaniards believe that in the dashboard 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.479
 patatas should not be in any way 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.420
 they fight archers to death hear 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.890
 Although I am not so categorical but also 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:35.210
 made your choice and so we will need 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:42.649
 potato eggs onion pretty much 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:46.170
 do not be afraid of olive oil 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.970
 salt and besides other dishes two 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.649
 1u pans more spacious other 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.280
 smaller and better with non-stick 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.380
 coated 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.159
 cut potatoes with plates and 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.360
 for example 3 4 millimeters we will pour a large 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.770
 frying pan oil about a centimeter 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.770
 on grammy about 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.300
 and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.520
 and put the potatoes and onions the heat should 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.680
 be soft so that the mass slightly 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.690
 stay him and the potatoes as if slowly 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 cooked in oil will cover the pan 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830
 lid until cooked potatoes 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.200
 monitor the temperature God forbid 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.910
 the potatoes turn red with the Spaniards start 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.610
 will not eat 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:36.000
 big bowl to chop and russia and for 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:38.730
 add salt and 1 potato already 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.150
 ready to lay it out in a colander to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.010
 glass maximum oil is not in a hurry 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 it is necessary if there is excess oil in the potato 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.380
 to you because she melts everything upstairs and 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.640
 turning the omelet this butter can 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.430
 pour all around 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.959
 mix eggs and ready potatoes it 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.819
 by the way one more reason for the sacred 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.160
 wars alone think they need potatoes 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.650
 eggs laying others insist that the eggs in 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.370
 I think the potatoes do not need a head 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.380
 fool anyone 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.480
 and do as best for the result is not 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.290
 will affect the attention comes the most 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.540
 responsible stage 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.030
 we heat a griddle on fire 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.870
 Smaller and envelope it to pick up 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:17.549
 so that our party in it was a height of 45 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.600
 centimeters and better to choose with 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.060
 non-stick coating 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.280
 why see a little later pour a couple 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.840
 tablespoons of olive oil can 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.880
 take about in which potatoes are cooked but 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 I prefer 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.620
 unrefined olive it is aromatic 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.769
 heat up and pour out personally 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.350
 potato mixture and wait for conan to grab 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.350
 turn down the fire we cover up waiting for and 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.340
 the body vector clutched a little 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.670
 periodically check our 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.720
 the party when not too before the fire grabbed 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.720
 subtract to below average 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.550
 and neatly with a spatula we move it away 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.670
 from the walls then the oil which is like 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.610
 up between wasting and walls will be 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.280
 go down like that 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.080
 shake sorge in my skillet 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:12.650
 that's what you need and non-stick 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:18.280
 coverage check again so well it seems 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:21.799
 Wirth archive too grabbed laying 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.360
 we pray to all gods we believe in 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:35.090
 America with a cafe let me succeed 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:39.530
 and turn over no oh world although she 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.060
 spanish means all the pictures left on 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.870
 I couldnâ€™t wait for a plate 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.920
 hardening 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.310
 now would clip could 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:52.040
 finish and start washing the kitchen 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:54.980
 returning back to the pan 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.140
 perfect shape and make them redden 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.370
 here is another moment when you can 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.710
 make your choice 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.600
 some love tortilla by denser 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.440
 drier then I need to hold on fire 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.350
 a little longer 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:13.210
 Who would have thought I prefer 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:18.580
 so I cover the plate and 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:21.580
 I turn over and here it is delicious 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.580
 authentic 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.350
 spanish tortilla have u can 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.330
 if it remains cold though 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.870
 stupid things I say there students 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.870
 can stay 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.040
 but if it still remains 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:43.550
 that is also quite good hot it has 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:47.060
 very gentle system excellent 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:52.100
 combination of lightness omelet and on jury 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:54.680
 potatoes are much softer than granite science 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.950
