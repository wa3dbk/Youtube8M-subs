inch and a half on your controller and
allowed<00:02:09.560> stick<00:02:09.769> height<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:11.030> it

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
allowed stick height and and it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.819 
allowed stick height and and it
increases<00:02:11.659> the<00:02:11.900> radius<00:02:12.230> by<00:02:12.379> thirty<00:02:12.650> three

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829 
increases the radius by thirty three

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.440 
increases the radius by thirty three
percent<00:02:12.859> if<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.670> wanted<00:02:13.999> to<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.209> could<00:02:14.329> add
