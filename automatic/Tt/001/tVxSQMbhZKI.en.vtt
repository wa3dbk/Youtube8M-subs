00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi and welcome to this dedicated tutorial 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.429
 to a skype so this is the dean version 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.480
 skype developing the 0.91 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.830
 we will see a feature 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 interesting when making 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.880
 Illustrations with a contour that has 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.260
 full and untied ie 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.100
 very hungry places then the places 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.260
 much thicker we can by modifying 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.510
 outline here automatically the color 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.910
 of background am even the two colors of 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.769
 background one the shadow and and the one from behind 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.210
 a little more can clearer then 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.790
 how to make sand is very simple 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.850
 with the pencil tool we will select 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.550
 so the bezier tool with a smoothing of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 40 and we will select the shape we are going 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.879
 take ellipses for example that's the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.730
 formula ips we make a little head 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:54.090
 quite quickly men here are the jo tac 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:01:01.350
 I'm going to have a little ear 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:09.790
 well round tac here 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:11.830
 the eyebrows the nose the mouth the eyes 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.800
 see so we can rework a 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.780
 little if you want to tweak 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.700
 a little bit of all that I make appear 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.320
 the paddle pad you see here on 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.460
 has white baths activating here this 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.619
 small slap option that fills 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.440
 little holes so before well for 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.759
 put a bottom ben it was obliged to 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.710
 obviously so I want to put a background 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.240
 here like that quickly but it does not 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.660
 applies only to contours so we were 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.130
 forced before duplicating objects 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.670
 to go here in this way of removing 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.789
 the path effect of the color that goes 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.350
 well and put that in the background in 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.259
 more of that there were little worries 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.550
 because there were white people 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.640
 so that to correct that ben I you 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.800
 will show in a few minutes 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.180
 there now with the new 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:07.119
 skype dean feature 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.230
 we just need to clone this object 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:14.050
 teachers like this so I have a clone of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.720
 bring up the facts way and from 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.430
 click here on the little more 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.280
 automatically in skype goes clown and the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.490
 original way so it does not activate it 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.709
 need here in this little palette 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.849
 selected that and do it added 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.849
 so that's it's perfect 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.250
 I now put the little color I 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.630
 put that behind and you see that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.280
 flawless walking now if I 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.560
 select show here you see the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.550
 background follows so it's really great so 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.230
 we have small mistakes 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.900
 it's very simple to correct enough 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:52.590
 just select it here east of 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:58.720
 iron shift r then i did not activate 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.950
 I should have activated associate so I 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.850
 select and six honors by doing 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.620
 schiffter here it corrects shifter that 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.850
 actually fits here to go in 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.150
 way and to make reverse 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.720
 yes if I reverse here and there I find 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.340
 my white here I corrected my mistake 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.799
 so I went a little bit 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.810
 further to have a shadow here 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.019
 it's just like a game 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.819
 duplicate I'm moving I'm going to put 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:29.350
 something dark enough like this 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.730
 maybe too dark that I get the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:38.109
 color I group this object I click 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.630
 here I select in clown that I 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.060
 group and that I'm duplicating so it comes 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.220
 to stand in front of me selects these two 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.670
 objects and I'm not forgiving path 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.000
 cut objects set I go down that 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.380
 at this level here it is not bad and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.030
 like just now if I 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.400
 change you see hop it changes 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.950
 if I change ben we see that everything or 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.450
 am what's really great so there 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.799
 I see that there are some mistakes down there 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.290
 must be at the level of the eye if I do 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.650
 shift airs up I correct the small ones 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.170
 errors 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:15.800
 tac but that much for this little tutorial 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.110
