Okanagan so soon to be 50 years at
actual<00:00:28.619> Knox<00:00:28.949> Mountain<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.500> it's<00:00:31.500> quite<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
actual Knox Mountain so it's quite a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
actual Knox Mountain so it's quite a
statement<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.730> believe<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.630> oldest

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
statement I believe it's the oldest

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.260 
statement I believe it's the oldest
running<00:00:34.530> motorsport<00:00:35.340> event<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.790> Canada

running motorsport event in Canada
continuous<00:00:43.820> there's<00:00:44.820> ten<00:00:45.149> ten<00:00:45.660> major<00:00:45.960> corners

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
continuous there's ten ten major corners

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.180 
continuous there's ten ten major corners
in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.430> track<00:00:47.670> it's<00:00:48.059> 800<00:00:49.190> vertical

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
in the in the track it's 800 vertical

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.180 
in the in the track it's 800 vertical
feet<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> rise<00:00:51.329> elevation<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.260> believe<00:00:52.980> it's

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
feet and rise elevation I believe it's

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.560 
feet and rise elevation I believe it's
2.2<00:00:53.820> miles<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.480> distance<00:00:55.070> so<00:00:56.070> there's<00:00:56.640> three

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
2.2 miles in distance so there's three

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.630 
2.2 miles in distance so there's three
major<00:00:57.780> 20<00:00:58.379> mile<00:00:58.530> an<00:00:58.649> hour<00:00:58.739> hairpins<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
major 20 mile an hour hairpins and a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.510 
major 20 mile an hour hairpins and a
straight<00:01:00.000> where<00:01:00.270> we're<00:01:00.480> doing<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:01.520> 140

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
straight where we're doing about 140

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.240 
straight where we're doing about 140
mile<00:01:02.640> an<00:01:02.760> hour<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.650> going<00:01:04.650> into<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.189> those

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
mile an hour so going into one of those

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.460 
mile an hour so going into one of those
20<00:01:05.580> mile<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:05.820> hour<00:01:05.909> air<00:01:06.119> pin<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.600> becomes

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
20 mile an hour air pin so it becomes

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.550 
20 mile an hour air pin so it becomes
quite<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> challenge<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:09.720> road<00:01:09.900> was<00:01:10.170> designed

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
quite a challenge the road was designed

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.820 
quite a challenge the road was designed
originally<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.939> shed<00:01:12.210> water<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.710> our

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
originally to shed water when we get our

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
originally to shed water when we get our
downpours<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.729> most<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.600> corners<00:01:15.930> are

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
downpours so the most of the corners are

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.590 
downpours so the most of the corners are
all<00:01:16.170> off<00:01:16.439> camber<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> also<00:01:17.850> provides<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
all off camber so it also provides a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.730 
all off camber so it also provides a
challenge<00:01:23.630> Wow<00:01:24.630> we've<00:01:25.320> been<00:01:25.470> coming

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
challenge Wow we've been coming

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 
challenge Wow we've been coming

running since 87 the old car we have the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.160 
running since 87 the old car we have the
production<00:01:38.790> car<00:01:39.000> record<00:01:39.540> which<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> one

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
production car record which is one

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.530 
production car record which is one
minute<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> 49<00:01:41.509> seconds<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.320> few<00:01:43.530> tenths

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
minute and 49 seconds and a few tenths

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.539 
minute and 49 seconds and a few tenths
this<00:01:45.540> new<00:01:45.750> car<00:01:46.020> we're<00:01:46.229> still<00:01:46.439> developing<00:01:46.710> we

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this new car we're still developing we

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.630 
this new car we're still developing we
haven't<00:01:48.140> quite<00:01:49.140> got<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> fast<00:01:50.250> but<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
haven't quite got it to that fast but it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.170 
haven't quite got it to that fast but it
has<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> potential<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.659> faster<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.220> any

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
has the potential to go faster so any

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.300 
has the potential to go faster so any
car<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.049> say<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.560> they've<00:01:55.710> done<00:01:55.920> sub

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
car that can say that they've done sub

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.280 
car that can say that they've done sub
two<00:01:56.579> minutes<00:01:56.880> at<00:01:57.030> this<00:01:57.149> hill<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.689> quite<00:01:58.140> an

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
two minutes at this hill is quite an

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.120 
two minutes at this hill is quite an
accomplishment

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.639 

a<00:02:02.329> lot<00:02:03.329> of<00:02:03.360> guys<00:02:03.600> that's<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.229> shoot<00:02:04.439> for

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
a lot of guys that's what they shoot for

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.419 
a lot of guys that's what they shoot for
that's<00:02:04.890> their<00:02:05.070> benchmark<00:02:05.549> great<00:02:06.000> two<00:02:06.240> minutes

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
that's their benchmark great two minutes

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.600 
that's their benchmark great two minutes
it<00:02:08.429> took<00:02:08.580> us<00:02:08.759> 15<00:02:08.940> years<00:02:09.450> yeah<00:02:10.130> once<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:11.310> did<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
it took us 15 years yeah once we did it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
it took us 15 years yeah once we did it
if<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.819> can't<00:02:12.030> eat<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.840> then<00:02:13.019> of<00:02:13.140> course<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
if you can't eat and then of course it

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.500 
if you can't eat and then of course it
became<00:02:13.800> easy<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.190> go<00:02:14.310> faster<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.970> Allan's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
became easy to go faster and Allan's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.000 
became easy to go faster and Allan's
actually<00:02:15.900> won<00:02:16.080> king<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.530> hill<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.860> our

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
actually won king of the hill with our

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.440 
actually won king of the hill with our
car<00:02:17.250> three<00:02:17.700> times<00:02:18.290> so<00:02:19.819> it's<00:02:20.819> only<00:02:20.910> when<00:02:21.120> John

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
car three times so it's only when John

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.870 
car three times so it's only when John
Hafner<00:02:22.110> who<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.010> ultimate<00:02:23.099> king<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
Hafner who is the ultimate king of the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.410 
Hafner who is the ultimate king of the
hill<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:25.650> doesn't<00:02:25.980> bring<00:02:26.130> his<00:02:26.400> car<00:02:26.670> he

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
hill here it doesn't bring his car he

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.940 
hill here it doesn't bring his car he
didn't<00:02:27.690> bring<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.989> this<00:02:28.110> year<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.860> have

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
didn't bring it this year so we have

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.680 
didn't bring it this year so we have

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
potential but there's several other

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
potential but there's several other
production-based<00:02:31.260> cars<00:02:31.349> here<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.130> could

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
production-based cars here that could

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.490 
production-based cars here that could
beat<00:02:33.120> us<00:02:33.300> this<00:02:33.510> year<00:02:33.750> so<00:02:34.080> there's<00:02:34.319> some<00:02:34.470> very

builder build us a rover mortar dry sump

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.590 
builder build us a rover mortar dry sump
for<00:03:13.769> over<00:03:14.010> mortar<00:03:14.340> we've<00:03:14.519> got<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> nine<00:03:15.390> inch

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
for over mortar we've got a nine inch

forward and uh fancy tranny unit

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.559 
forward and uh fancy tranny unit
basically<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:20.010> our<00:03:20.549> old<00:03:20.790> car<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.269> always<00:03:21.450> a

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
basically we our old car was always a

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.900 
basically we our old car was always a
grenade<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.230> would<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.889> was<00:03:23.010> extremely<00:03:23.519> fast

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
grenade it would it was extremely fast

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.120 
grenade it would it was extremely fast
but<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.209> would<00:03:24.329> blow<00:03:24.510> up<00:03:24.660> all<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.989> time<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.980> we

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
but it would blow up all the time so we

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.379 
but it would blow up all the time so we
wanted<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.459> build<00:03:26.670> something<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.269> was

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
wanted to build something that was

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:31.520 
wanted to build something that was
almost<00:03:27.540> bulletproof<00:03:27.959> so<00:03:28.560> we<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:29.329> we<00:03:30.410> put<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
almost bulletproof so we just we put the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.800 
almost bulletproof so we just we put the
money<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.100> spots<00:03:32.459> where<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:33.180> figured<00:03:33.780> that

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
money in the spots where we figured that

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.839 
money in the spots where we figured that
we'd<00:03:34.170> have<00:03:34.410> any<00:03:34.590> issues<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:36.209> so<00:03:37.049> far<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.290> good

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
we'd have any issues and so far so good

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.989 
we'd have any issues and so far so good
working<00:03:39.659> real<00:03:39.810> good<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:43.170> it's<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.999> custom-built

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:44.999 
working real good so it's a custom-built

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:49.339 
working real good so it's a custom-built
