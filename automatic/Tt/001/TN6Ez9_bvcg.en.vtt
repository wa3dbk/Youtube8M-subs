00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello teacher or teacher, how are you? 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.719
 I'm not even pear and we're going to start a 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.450
 program is a program in which you will 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.670
 receive day-to-day room tips 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.310
 class and I hope you enjoy it because 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.289
 this goal is to contribute to the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.119
 our teachers and make the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.590
 our classes are becoming more and more 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 interesting is not 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
 so I want to start with the first 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.730
 This has to do with the first day of 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.800
 class is not knowing that that first day 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.420
 of the class that you imagine before 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 Wow, how's the class going to be? 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
 that you received will be what you will like 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.420
 will not they like me? 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.040
 concerned about it every time that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.780
 I'm going to teach the first day of school. 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.620
 I'm worried, I'm sure 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.660
 you too 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.730
 If you never taught, you're going to stay. 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.899
 Worst yet I know but it stays 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.430
 quiet first thing you have 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 do the following do not enter from a 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.180
 time in the room comes early to get 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.219
 environment in order to focus on the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 that you will initially do not 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.010
 It should or should not be 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.770
 content does not receive the group with a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.080
 expression is not receiving the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.240
 group with a nice expression there 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.180
 you will emotionally infect this 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.369
 group and there is a speech 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.400
 a little about your life's 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.290
 Professional talks about you do not need 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.080
 have a lot of intimacy, but talk about 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.659
 Do you talk to a solicitor? 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.909
 know more about the expectation group of the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 group and there to the extent that you were 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.950
 noticing in what facial expressions 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.110
 and body are expressing to you a 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.880
 identification where those students 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.250
 begin to participate more 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.270
 then it's worth getting into the content 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.220
 then invest in that initial moment 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.439
 because you only have to win if you have 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.430
 time ahead to be able to minister the 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.860
 your content 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.799
 but this initial moment is a moment 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.869
 magical and if you win class in the 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.960
 first day you are sure to have a 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.299
 rest of course fantastic at least 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.520
 with regard to the relationship to 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.149
 content I trust you on why 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.629
 you know that without the content the teacher 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.600
 You do not have to be a teacher. 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.630
 OK 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.410
 well then we stayed in that first tip I 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.900
 I wait for you 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.900
