00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.120 
or the bone safe not entirely sure I
know<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> size<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.380> Alliance<00:04:04.680> is<00:04:04.769> not<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.100> that

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
know the size of Alliance is not on that

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.100 
know the size of Alliance is not on that
list<00:04:05.310> just<00:04:05.640> because<00:04:05.820> it's<00:04:06.150> too<00:04:06.720> powerful<00:04:07.350> and

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
list just because it's too powerful and

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.850 
list just because it's too powerful and
takes<00:04:08.680> the<00:04:08.860> fun<00:04:09.010> out<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.190> using<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.580> reaper<00:04:09.940> but

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
takes the fun out of using a reaper but

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.170 
takes the fun out of using a reaper but
that's<00:04:11.860> just<00:04:12.100> my<00:04:12.340> opinion

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
that's just my opinion

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
that's just my opinion
so<00:04:14.130> yeah<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.880> pretty<00:04:16.209> much<00:04:16.330> sums<00:04:16.750> up<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
so yeah that pretty much sums up the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.390 
so yeah that pretty much sums up the
build<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.800> mean<00:04:18.060> occasionally<00:04:19.950> I'll<00:04:20.950> stream

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
build I mean occasionally I'll stream

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.830 
build I mean occasionally I'll stream
with<00:04:21.610> it<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:21.940> was<00:04:22.120> screaming<00:04:22.330> with<00:04:22.570> it<00:04:22.690> last

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
with it I was screaming with it last

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.960 
with it I was screaming with it last
night<00:04:22.960> as<00:04:23.230> a<00:04:23.260> matter<00:04:23.410> of<00:04:23.500> fact<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:23.980> actually<00:04:24.250> had

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
night as a matter of fact I actually had

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.220 
night as a matter of fact I actually had
a<00:04:25.000> good<00:04:25.150> time<00:04:25.210> with<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.600> mannequin<00:04:25.990> cloth

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
a good time with the mannequin cloth

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.510 
a good time with the mannequin cloth
that<00:04:27.100> was<00:04:27.580> a<00:04:27.820> very<00:04:28.150> interesting<00:04:28.570> experience

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
that was a very interesting experience

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.680 
that was a very interesting experience
especially<00:04:30.520> now<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.910> patch<00:04:31.090> is<00:04:31.300> out<00:04:31.480> and

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
especially now that the patch is out and

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.160 
especially now that the patch is out and
there<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.620> no<00:04:32.920> separation<00:04:33.760> between<00:04:34.180> new<00:04:34.960> game

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
there is no separation between new game

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.800 
there is no separation between new game
and<00:04:35.380> new<00:04:35.440> game<00:04:35.620> plus<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:37.360> makes<00:04:37.630> things

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
and new game plus it makes things

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.550 
and new game plus it makes things
interesting

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
interesting

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.730 
interesting
so<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.730> don't<00:04:40.180> related<00:04:40.510> note<00:04:40.630> to<00:04:40.720> that<00:04:40.870> I<00:04:41.170> have

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
so I don't related note to that I have

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.500 
so I don't related note to that I have
started<00:04:42.070> to<00:04:42.280> always<00:04:42.550> keep<00:04:42.790> a<00:04:42.880> dagger<00:04:43.090> equipped

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
started to always keep a dagger equipped

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.190 
started to always keep a dagger equipped
for<00:04:43.960> new<00:04:44.650> game+<00:04:45.040> crits<00:04:45.520> because<00:04:46.150> why<00:04:46.960> would<00:04:47.140> I

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
for new game+ crits because why would I

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.580 
for new game+ crits because why would I
not<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.800> mean<00:04:48.220> let's<00:04:48.520> be<00:04:48.580> honest

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
not I mean let's be honest

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.820 
not I mean let's be honest
this<00:04:50.590> build<00:04:50.830> is<00:04:51.070> not<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:52.750> most<00:04:52.960> optimal<00:04:53.590> thing

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
this build is not the most optimal thing

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.520 
this build is not the most optimal thing
ever<00:04:54.160> I<00:04:54.520> mean<00:04:55.150> it's<00:04:55.360> not<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.510> pure<00:04:55.840> dexterity

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
ever I mean it's not a pure dexterity

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.520 
ever I mean it's not a pure dexterity
focus<00:04:56.950> it<00:04:57.490> is<00:04:57.730> a<00:04:57.760> dexterity<00:04:58.180> build<00:04:58.540> but<00:04:59.350> it's

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
focus it is a dexterity build but it's

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.520 
focus it is a dexterity build but it's
not<00:04:59.740> a<00:05:00.010> pure<00:05:00.340> dexterity<00:05:01.210> focus<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:02.230> I've<00:05:02.380> got

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
not a pure dexterity focus and I've got

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.350 
not a pure dexterity focus and I've got
more<00:05:02.770> adaptability<00:05:03.250> than<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.640> need

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
more adaptability than I need

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.210 
more adaptability than I need
I<00:05:04.390> could<00:05:04.990> have<00:05:05.080> pumped<00:05:05.350> that<00:05:05.440> in<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.650> health<00:05:05.860> or

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
I could have pumped that in a health or

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.130
