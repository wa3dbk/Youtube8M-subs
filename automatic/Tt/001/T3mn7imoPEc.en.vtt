00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
logs placed on them here you can see

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.510 
logs placed on them here you can see
actually<00:04:34.540> into<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.870> logs<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.520> they're

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
actually into the logs and they're

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.300 
actually into the logs and they're
sitting<00:04:36.850> on<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.360> scaffolding<00:04:38.169> made<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.949> PVC

sitting on a scaffolding made of PVC
pipe<00:04:39.790> very<00:04:40.540> very<00:04:40.960> easy<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.710> do<00:04:41.860> and<00:04:42.100> use<00:04:42.820> in<00:04:43.090> and

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
pipe very very easy to do and use in and

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.050 
pipe very very easy to do and use in and
in<00:04:43.570> an<00:04:43.690> aquarium<00:04:44.169> I<00:04:44.380> cap<00:04:45.280> off<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.669> ends<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:45.970> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
in an aquarium I cap off the ends of the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.270 
in an aquarium I cap off the ends of the
PVC<00:04:46.540> pipe<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.080> water<00:04:47.350> can't<00:04:47.650> get<00:04:47.770> in<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.190> I

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
PVC pipe so water can't get in and I

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.790 
PVC pipe so water can't get in and I
fill<00:04:48.520> the<00:04:48.639> pipes<00:04:48.850> first<00:04:49.630> with<00:04:50.080> sand<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.590> give

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
fill the pipes first with sand to give

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.650 
fill the pipes first with sand to give
them<00:04:50.949> weight<00:04:51.130> they're<00:04:51.910> much<00:04:52.060> easier<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.449> work

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
them weight they're much easier to work

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.600 
them weight they're much easier to work
with<00:04:52.870> if<00:04:53.080> they<00:04:53.229> sink<00:04:53.560> if<00:04:54.040> you<00:04:54.190> don't<00:04:54.370> fill<00:04:54.520> them

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
with if they sink if you don't fill them

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.730 
with if they sink if you don't fill them
with<00:04:54.669> sand<00:04:54.940> you<00:04:55.180> put<00:04:55.389> PVC<00:04:55.900> structure<00:04:56.380> in<00:04:56.590> the

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
with sand you put PVC structure in the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.100 
with sand you put PVC structure in the
tank<00:04:56.949> it<00:04:57.100> tends<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.400> float<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:58.510> gets<00:04:58.690> hard<00:04:58.960> to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
tank it tends to float it gets hard to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.870 
tank it tends to float it gets hard to
manage

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
manage

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.969 
manage
it'll<00:05:00.880> sink<00:05:01.090> with<00:05:01.570> a<00:05:01.600> weighted<00:05:02.350> object<00:05:02.470> on<00:05:02.830> it

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
it'll sink with a weighted object on it

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.500 
it'll sink with a weighted object on it
but<00:05:03.400> while<00:05:03.550> you're<00:05:03.699> trying<00:05:03.910> to<00:05:04.000> place<00:05:04.210> it<00:05:04.389> it's

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
but while you're trying to place it it's

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.840 
but while you're trying to place it it's
very<00:05:04.750> very<00:05:04.840> difficult<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.560> work<00:05:05.860> with<00:05:05.919> over

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
very very difficult to work with over

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.219 
very very difficult to work with over
here<00:05:07.000> now<00:05:07.240> on<00:05:07.419> the<00:05:07.539> other<00:05:07.690> side<00:05:07.990> of<00:05:08.169> the

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
here now on the other side of the

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.570 
here now on the other side of the
Basking<00:05:08.590> platform<00:05:08.620> you'll<00:05:09.250> see<00:05:09.400> another

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
Basking platform you'll see another

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.000 
Basking platform you'll see another
piece<00:05:10.510> of<00:05:10.660> scaffolding<00:05:10.840> with<00:05:11.350> another<00:05:11.620> tray

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
piece of scaffolding with another tray

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.340 
piece of scaffolding with another tray
and<00:05:12.400> here<00:05:13.360> I<00:05:13.389> think<00:05:13.690> we<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:13.930> see<00:05:14.139> a<00:05:14.169> little

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
and here I think we can see a little

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.210 
and here I think we can see a little
turtle<00:05:15.630> it's<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.810> little<00:05:17.020> female<00:05:17.260> musk<00:05:17.830> turtle

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
turtle it's a little female musk turtle

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.010 
turtle it's a little female musk turtle
in<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:19.020> in<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.860> log

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
in the in the log

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.710 
in the in the log
she's<00:05:23.020> also<00:05:23.229> produced<00:05:23.740> maybe<00:05:24.699> many<00:05:25.090> baby

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
she's also produced maybe many baby

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.560 
she's also produced maybe many baby
turtles<00:05:26.250> back<00:05:27.250> there<00:05:27.520> you<00:05:27.760> see<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.919> aerator

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
turtles back there you see a aerator

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.629 
turtles back there you see a aerator
they're<00:05:31.570> great<00:05:31.840> for<00:05:32.139> breaking-up<00:05:32.740> surface

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
they're great for breaking-up surface

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.580 
they're great for breaking-up surface
scum<00:05:33.849> sometimes<00:05:34.419> they'll<00:05:34.630> feed<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.260> turtle

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
scum sometimes they'll feed the turtle

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.379 
scum sometimes they'll feed the turtle
something<00:05:35.979> very<00:05:36.160> messy<00:05:36.520> like<00:05:36.760> salmon

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
something very messy like salmon

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:39.570 
something very messy like salmon
creates<00:05:38.020> a<00:05:38.139> sort<00:05:38.500> of<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.680> slime<00:05:38.950> on<00:05:38.979> the<00:05:39.220> surface

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
creates a sort of a slime on the surface

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.950 
creates a sort of a slime on the surface
of<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.760> water<00:05:39.940> that<00:05:40.150> spreads<00:05:40.510> all<00:05:40.660> over<00:05:40.690> the

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
of the water that spreads all over the

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.230 
of the water that spreads all over the
place<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.580> aerators<00:05:42.580> are<00:05:42.610> great<00:05:42.880> at<00:05:43.030> breaking

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
place and aerators are great at breaking

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.050 
place and aerators are great at breaking
that<00:05:43.510> up<00:05:43.539> I<00:05:45.960> think<00:05:46.960> I've<00:05:47.380> covered<00:05:47.620> most<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.700> the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
that up I think I've covered most of the

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.440 
that up I think I've covered most of the
components<00:05:49.780> of<00:05:50.110> this<00:05:50.229> tank<00:05:50.530> I<00:05:50.970> will<00:05:51.970> do

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
components of this tank I will do

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.000 
components of this tank I will do
another<00:05:52.660> video<00:05:52.870> just<00:05:53.380> on<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.620> filtration

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
another video just on the filtration

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.320 
another video just on the filtration
system<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:54.820> I'll<00:05:55.060> do<00:05:55.240> additional<00:05:56.110> videos

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
system and I'll do additional videos

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.550 
system and I'll do additional videos
focusing<00:05:58.330> more<00:05:58.479> on<00:05:58.539> the<00:05:58.780> turtles<00:05:59.139> and<00:05:59.289> some<00:05:59.440> of

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
focusing more on the turtles and some of

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.680 
focusing more on the turtles and some of
their<00:05:59.650> behaviors<00:06:00.130> so<00:06:00.729> I<00:06:00.760> hope<00:06:01.000> that<00:06:01.539> this

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
their behaviors so I hope that this

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.010 
their behaviors so I hope that this
video<00:06:01.930> was<00:06:02.289> of<00:06:02.530> some<00:06:02.800> use<00:06:02.979> to<00:06:03.010> you<00:06:03.280> Oh<00:06:04.020> quickly

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
video was of some use to you Oh quickly

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.950 
video was of some use to you Oh quickly
on<00:06:05.320> the<00:06:05.740> top<00:06:05.949> here<00:06:06.190> I<00:06:06.220> should<00:06:06.750> mention<00:06:07.750> a

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
on the top here I should mention a

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.570 
on the top here I should mention a
couple<00:06:08.050> things<00:06:08.229> I<00:06:08.530> have<00:06:08.680> plants<00:06:09.190> along<00:06:09.400> the

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
couple things I have plants along the

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.700 
couple things I have plants along the
back<00:06:09.729> edge<00:06:09.760> of<00:06:10.120> the<00:06:10.180> tank<00:06:10.389> those<00:06:11.050> are<00:06:11.260> not<00:06:11.530> real

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
back edge of the tank those are not real

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.710 
back edge of the tank those are not real
plants<00:06:12.130> they<00:06:12.340> used<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:12.699> be<00:06:12.849> and<00:06:13.120> but<00:06:13.510> they<00:06:13.660> were

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
plants they used to be and but they were

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.900 
plants they used to be and but they were
an<00:06:14.349> awful<00:06:14.680> lot<00:06:14.770> of<00:06:14.800> work<00:06:14.979> maintaining<00:06:15.760> and

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
an awful lot of work maintaining and

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.409 
an awful lot of work maintaining and
very<00:06:16.389> messy<00:06:16.750> so<00:06:17.580> these<00:06:18.580> plastic<00:06:19.000> plants<00:06:19.270> work

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
very messy so these plastic plants work

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.830 
very messy so these plastic plants work
great<00:06:19.720> mostly<00:06:20.650> just<00:06:20.860> for<00:06:21.039> aesthetic<00:06:21.460> purposes

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
great mostly just for aesthetic purposes

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.409 
great mostly just for aesthetic purposes
the<00:06:22.840> outside<00:06:23.260> lamps<00:06:23.710> are<00:06:23.979> not<00:06:24.060> heat<00:06:25.060> lamps

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
the outside lamps are not heat lamps

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.850 
the outside lamps are not heat lamps
they're<00:06:25.570> just<00:06:25.810> regular<00:06:25.990> fluorescent<00:06:26.410> bulbs

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
they're just regular fluorescent bulbs
