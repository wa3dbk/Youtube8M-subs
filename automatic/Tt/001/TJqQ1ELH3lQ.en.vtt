00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.819
 hi girls then in a new review 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:09.610
 on a product just released that the cc 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.420
 magic hair cc will therefore save cc 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:17.110
 crimi for hair of collistar then a 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 moment of this product do not agree 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.949
 much the name in the sense is interesting 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.110
 as a product and is practically identical 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.420
 to the trusty gloss of tito that I already have 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.119
 then a mask behind which stands 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.129
 on from 1 to 5 minutes and applies with 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.309
 gloves in 45 donuts 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.229
 exactly like the fido gloss however but 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.859
 that today there is type but sell i 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.899
 products 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:46.359
 must necessarily put bbc cd of 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.010
 rent cc for hair and then say the 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.139
 I only needed to put mascara on 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.289
 reflecting so much so that it is not a bit 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:57.010
 deceptive because it is called cc not 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:01:00.310
 because type corrector teramano neck 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.910
 simply care and color 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.920
 let me explain then here I find it a bit between 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.710
 False quotes as numbers 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.530
 speaking instead of the product then the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.770
 product is a reflecting mask 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.910
 present in three different colors 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.830
 I chose the multi tom paper car ed 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.930
 which is specific for red hair like 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.630
 mine is dark brown light blond 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.200
 dark brown and who arrived who wants to give 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.700
 a reddish effect rinsed bar with 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.710
 so care as I told you before 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.310
 applied with the gloves that are in the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.090
 pack and I did it already is a 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.970
 cute product a good reflective not 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:49.140
 it's fantastic because lynxes anyway a 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.140
 full of all silicone inside 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.340
 some filled a lot of glycol derivatives 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.340
 in other words, silicone 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.480
 is not comparable to a tint is a 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.760
 reflecting is a bit like a couple of them 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.190
 one with a reflective then me 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.040
 I would take a n that she is among other things is 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.310
 highly curative for both drums and 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.840
 for me it was 10 of the hair then 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.300
 anyway if you want a mask 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.700
 interesting that 2 45 donuts 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:25.540
 the new co list is this 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.760
 just I do not tell you anything that is not 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.370
 think ac sic as cc karin because in 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.190
 reality cc and care and color is fine 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.420
 Girls hope to be helpful a 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.420
 kiss in the next review
