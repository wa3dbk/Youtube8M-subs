00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.710
 premier and at the same time learn 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.710
 what can be done with free software and samuel l 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.520
 the azulgrana goalkeeper 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.869
 the free jaguar 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.839
 final approval 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.189
 and an accelerometer 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.189
 besides Mexicans the source code to sell them 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.759
 good against Albacete the result 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.920
 6 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.920
 Google 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
 as 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.350
 one 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.479
 Diego Martin 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.549
 spectacular 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.409
 these are the elements that make the convent system work with 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.109
 peripheral 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.649
 a fierce repression 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:38.539
 although he was cautious 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.539
 ntx inegi 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.049
 a noise I have not finished 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.509
 but the principle taco shoes work all move it but that does not 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:56.979
 so the do for another 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.069
 an ethernet cable 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.069
 to the computer 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.069
 which behaves some of the 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.129
 the general progress 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.959
 a genius or linux 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.979
 because that's why any team because we're going to sing 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.619
 the bluish ticket 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.909
 and so much for me the application that will see the next dakar light the data by 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.909
 11 m 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:47.839
 humberto of why do you x server 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.149
 Ricardo Lorenzetti 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.149
 than send the data as pressed keys 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.409
 well let's apply it in more detail we have connected to the accelerometer 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.859
 the accelerometer to the Argentine 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.859
 the power supply 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.580
 I spoke little 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.970
 and earth to the first five volts the piece of health 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.659
 and the army's accelerometer pin 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.659
 to the paprika analog 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:48.159
 of the ruin and the pin beverage inc 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.740
 vega has moved to cooperate government 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.999
 and finally it is connected to the computer 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.360
 by him usher to climb 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.699
 the long program and not the palate 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.699
 it transcended yesterday we 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.110
 the program that will recruit minors the region 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.240
 but point 3 that encodes the relationship of the two axes has a character 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:23.020
 in the region but when one the same character on the other hand but the test 

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:25.669
 of reading enroled 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.819
 the way to be able to remove simple 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:31.819
 In this state 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.319
 nz we create to kill the producer that will contain 49 character 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.520
 printable divided into a seven-by-seven eagerness 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.979
 because the port program 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.360
 read 7 degrees of inclination on each axis 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.809
 and uses the network to get the character and dialogue 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.069
 the general director for writers the written 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.800
 and like the code 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 erick thin and it's not the region but point 3 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.289
 this program to collect 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:21.499
 this program to pick up your place to lose by pursuing 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.159
 will remain for the producer in reverse 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.039
 they applaud it bent again and send it as pressed keys 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.430
 the runner counts in the merval is modified to pick up 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.919
 the new pearls forced and use them as if they were movements to invest with 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.369
 different degrees of inclination 

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:45.039
 and this project we present to the contest explained uribe
