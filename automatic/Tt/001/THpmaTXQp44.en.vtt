controls are to the stick itself and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.470 
controls are to the stick itself and
then<00:00:38.280> down<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.699> got<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:38.970> face<00:00:39.120> buttons

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
then down here you got some face buttons

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.549 
then down here you got some face buttons
that<00:00:39.600> make<00:00:39.720> up<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.019> some<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.290> things<00:00:40.320> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
that make up for some of the things that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.200 
that make up for some of the things that
you<00:00:40.739> lose<00:00:40.949> when<00:00:41.580> you're<00:00:41.699> not<00:00:41.820> playing<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.150> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you lose when you're not playing with a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.630 
you lose when you're not playing with a
controller<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:43.080> is<00:00:43.229> really<00:00:43.619> lightweight<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
controller it is really lightweight it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.640 
controller it is really lightweight it
actually<00:00:44.970> I<00:00:45.000> think<00:00:45.449> when<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> hold<00:00:46.049> them<00:00:46.260> next

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
actually I think when I hold them next

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.750 
actually I think when I hold them next
to<00:00:46.710> each<00:00:46.769> other<00:00:46.920> yeah<00:00:47.040> it<00:00:47.190> actually<00:00:47.309> weighs

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to each other yeah it actually weighs

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.469 
to each other yeah it actually weighs
less<00:00:48.119> than<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:49.229> an<00:00:50.190> Xbox<00:00:50.519> 360<00:00:50.699> controller<00:00:51.000> with

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
less than a an Xbox 360 controller with

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.539 
less than a an Xbox 360 controller with
batteries<00:00:51.869> in<00:00:52.019> it<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.619> my<00:00:53.010> immediate<00:00:53.220> thought

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:53.549 
batteries in it so my immediate thought

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:54.619 
batteries in it so my immediate thought
is<00:00:53.580> that<00:00:53.850> when<00:00:54.119> I'm<00:00:54.210> in<00:00:54.269> the<00:00:54.330> middle<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.570> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
is that when I'm in the middle of a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
is that when I'm in the middle of a
dogfight<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.619> flying<00:00:56.339> around<00:00:56.549> screen<00:00:56.909> that<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
dogfight or flying around screen that is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.000 
dogfight or flying around screen that is
you<00:00:57.659> know<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:57.960> may<00:00:58.170> end<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.500> getting<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.860> little

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you know it may end up getting a little

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.320 
you know it may end up getting a little
unwieldy<00:01:00.320> my<00:01:01.320> second<00:01:01.619> issue<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> design

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
unwieldy my second issue with the design

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.530 
unwieldy my second issue with the design
of<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.689> is<00:01:03.869> the<00:01:04.500> button<00:01:04.769> mapping<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.360> see

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
of it is the button mapping so you see

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.910 
of it is the button mapping so you see
here<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.780> has<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.990> handy<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.350> flip<00:01:07.770> up

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
here it has this handy little flip up

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.740 
here it has this handy little flip up
button<00:01:08.250> which<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> be<00:01:09.450> your<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
button which is going to be your you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
button which is going to be your you
know<00:01:09.840> would<00:01:10.049> seemingly<00:01:10.409> be<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:10.890> missile

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250

we're<00:01:52.090> here<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:52.720> that<00:01:53.260> aside<00:01:53.620> let's<00:01:54.070> go<00:01:54.520> ahead

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
we're here so that aside let's go ahead

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.310 
we're here so that aside let's go ahead
and<00:01:54.760> get<00:01:54.820> started<00:01:54.940> what<00:01:55.780> I'm<00:01:55.840> gonna<00:01:55.930> do<00:01:56.140> here

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
and get started what I'm gonna do here

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.440 
and get started what I'm gonna do here
is<00:01:56.380> play<00:01:56.590> through<00:01:56.800> a<00:01:56.890> mission<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.670> mission<00:01:58.060> on

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
is play through a mission a mission on

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.540 
is play through a mission a mission on
hawks<00:01:58.720> first<00:01:59.560> with<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.920> flight<00:02:00.100> stick<00:02:00.370> and

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
hawks first with the flight stick and

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.060 
hawks first with the flight stick and
then<00:02:01.030> with<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.510> standard<00:02:02.290> Xbox<00:02:02.500> 360

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
then with the standard Xbox 360

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.470 
then with the standard Xbox 360
controller<00:02:03.400> just<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.910> see<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.150> what<00:02:04.270> kind<00:02:04.360> of

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
controller just to see it what kind of

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.480 
controller just to see it what kind of
differences<00:02:04.900> there<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.050> in<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.440> gameplay<00:02:05.860> and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
differences there is in the gameplay and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
differences there is in the gameplay and
then<00:02:06.610> we're<00:02:06.700> gonna<00:02:06.790> do<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.000> same<00:02:07.120> thing<00:02:07.360> for

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
then we're gonna do the same thing for

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:42.559 
then we're gonna do the same thing for
Ace<00:02:07.660> Combat<00:02:07.900> six

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.030 

I<00:02:42.659> was<00:02:43.530> definitely<00:02:44.219> having<00:02:44.579> more<00:02:45.060> control<00:02:45.209> and

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
I was definitely having more control and

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.470 
I was definitely having more control and
much<00:02:47.040> more<00:02:47.249> effectiveness<00:02:47.760> against<00:02:48.150> enemies

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
much more effectiveness against enemies

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.879 
much more effectiveness against enemies
when<00:02:48.659> I<00:02:48.719> was<00:02:48.840> using<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.139> xbox360<00:02:49.799> controller

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
when I was using the xbox360 controller

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.069 
when I was using the xbox360 controller
as<00:02:50.639> opposed<00:02:50.939> to<00:02:50.999> the<00:02:51.120> aviator<00:02:51.420> flight<00:02:51.629> stick<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
as opposed to the aviator flight stick I

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.869 
as opposed to the aviator flight stick I
think<00:02:52.560> some<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.799> reasons<00:02:53.099> for<00:02:53.159> that<00:02:53.370> as

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
think some of the reasons for that as

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.360 
think some of the reasons for that as
you<00:02:54.599> can<00:02:54.749> see<00:02:55.019> when<00:02:55.560> you're<00:02:55.650> holding<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.950> 360

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
you can see when you're holding the 360

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.709 
you can see when you're holding the 360
controller<00:02:56.459> everything<00:02:57.359> is<00:02:57.480> right<00:02:57.689> here

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:57.719 
controller everything is right here

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.330 
controller everything is right here
where<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.109> need<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.379> you<00:02:58.469> there's<00:02:58.680> no<00:02:58.920> there's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
where you need it you there's no there's

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.679 
where you need it you there's no there's
nowhere<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.639> reach<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.150> all<00:03:00.329> your<00:03:00.480> controls

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
nowhere to reach it all your controls

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.770 
nowhere to reach it all your controls
are<00:03:01.079> within<00:03:01.439> I<00:03:01.829> would<00:03:02.159> say<00:03:02.219> six<00:03:02.519> fingers<00:03:02.879> with

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
are within I would say six fingers with

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.839 
are within I would say six fingers with
the<00:03:03.810> aviator<00:03:04.230> flight<00:03:04.439> stick<00:03:04.709> you've<00:03:05.250> got<00:03:05.519> you

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
the aviator flight stick you've got you

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.979 
the aviator flight stick you've got you
know<00:03:05.939> you've<00:03:06.090> got<00:03:06.180> things<00:03:06.329> going<00:03:06.629> on<00:03:06.689> up<00:03:06.810> here

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
know you've got things going on up here

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.360 
know you've got things going on up here
you<00:03:07.049> got<00:03:07.230> things<00:03:07.409> going<00:03:07.560> on<00:03:07.709> back<00:03:07.920> here<00:03:08.129> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you got things going on back here and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.259 
you got things going on back here and
then<00:03:08.459> you've<00:03:08.549> got<00:03:08.639> this<00:03:08.790> whole<00:03:09.000> set<00:03:09.180> of

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
then you've got this whole set of

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.819 
then you've got this whole set of
controls<00:03:09.569> over<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:10.530> you're<00:03:10.650> constantly

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
controls over here so you're constantly

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.970 
controls over here so you're constantly
switching<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.669> moving<00:03:11.969> around<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.569> you<00:03:13.319> know

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
switching and moving around and you know

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.550 
switching and moving around and you know
whereas<00:03:14.549> I<00:03:14.819> have<00:03:15.150> got<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.569> placement<00:03:16.439> of

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
whereas I have got the placement of

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.319 
whereas I have got the placement of
these<00:03:16.680> buttons<00:03:17.099> memorized<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.849> still<00:03:18.120> can't

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
these buttons memorized I still can't

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.339 
these buttons memorized I still can't
quite<00:03:18.419> figure<00:03:18.750> out<00:03:18.870> where<00:03:19.319> exactly

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
quite figure out where exactly

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.289 
quite figure out where exactly
everything<00:03:20.129> is<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.549> think<00:03:21.030> that<00:03:21.120> there<00:03:21.269> is

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
everything is I think that there is

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.780 
everything is I think that there is
something<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.620> fact<00:03:22.919> that<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.400> flight

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
something to the fact that the flight

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.659 
something to the fact that the flight
stick<00:03:24.030> is<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.299> much<00:03:24.629> more<00:03:24.870> immersive<00:03:25.669> game

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
stick is a much more immersive game

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.509 
stick is a much more immersive game
experience<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:28.079> certainly<00:03:28.530> applying<00:03:29.280> a

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
experience it is certainly applying a

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.520 
experience it is certainly applying a
level<00:03:29.790> of<00:03:29.909> challenge<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.689> game<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.199> you

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
level of challenge to the game that you

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.839 
level of challenge to the game that you

overall<00:03:35.639> for<00:03:36.480> 50<00:03:36.689> dollars<00:03:37.049> it's<00:03:37.260> not<00:03:37.349> a<00:03:37.469> bad

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
overall for 50 dollars it's not a bad
