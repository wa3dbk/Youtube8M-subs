to<00:01:37.100> do<00:01:37.220> with<00:01:37.250> me<00:01:37.549> but<00:01:37.789> the<00:01:38.539> sheep<00:01:38.840> are<00:01:39.020> good

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.980 
to do with me but the sheep are good
health<00:01:39.440> because<00:01:39.649> Edie<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.130> Dasher<00:01:40.990> are

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
health because Edie and Dasher are

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
kind of letting him know that I'm not a

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.859 
kind of letting him know that I'm not a
danger<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.520> have<00:01:49.759> them<00:01:49.970> come<00:01:50.240> close<00:01:52.600> but<00:01:53.600> Zeeb

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
green on his ear they were gonna put an

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.259 
green on his ear they were gonna put an
ear<00:02:42.470> tag<00:02:42.769> on<00:02:43.010> him<00:02:43.250> which<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.519> really<00:02:43.910> don't<00:02:44.030> like

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
those they can rip the ear so I asked if

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.240 
those they can rip the ear so I asked if
the<00:02:47.690> vet<00:02:47.870> could<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.560> tattoo<00:02:49.040> for

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
the vet could do a tattoo for

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.890 
the vet could do a tattoo for
identification<00:02:49.970> because<00:02:50.330> it's<00:02:50.480> federal<00:02:50.870> law

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
identification because it's federal law

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.690 
identification because it's federal law
that<00:02:51.260> they<00:02:51.350> have<00:02:51.470> to<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.709> ID<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.280> that's<00:02:52.459> his

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
that they have to have ID so that's his

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.970 
that they have to have ID so that's his
little<00:02:52.900> paint<00:02:53.900> from<00:02:54.080> his<00:02:54.200> little<00:02:54.350> ear<00:02:54.500> tattoo

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
little paint from his little ear tattoo

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.370 
little paint from his little ear tattoo
so<00:02:55.850> that<00:02:55.970> allowed<00:02:56.450> him<00:02:56.660> not<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:57.019> get<00:02:57.110> an<00:02:57.230> ear

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
so that allowed him not to get an ear

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.680 
so that allowed him not to get an ear
tag<00:02:57.590> which<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:57.890> good<00:02:58.220> should<00:02:59.209> probably<00:02:59.510> give

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
tag which is good should probably give

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.770 
tag which is good should probably give
you<00:02:59.840> an<00:02:59.930> idea<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.530> size<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.790> don't<00:03:02.510> know<00:03:02.569> he's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
you an idea of size I don't know he's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.820 
you an idea of size I don't know he's
probably<00:03:02.959> like<00:03:03.230> 20<00:03:03.739> inches<00:03:04.100> tall<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.830> he

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
probably like 20 inches tall and he

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.400 
probably like 20 inches tall and he
should<00:03:07.010> be<00:03:07.100> about<00:03:07.250> 34<00:03:07.910> inches<00:03:08.170> at<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.230> withers

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
should be about 34 inches at the withers

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.190 
should be about 34 inches at the withers
when<00:03:09.890> full-grown<00:03:10.340> somewhere<00:03:10.819> around<00:03:10.880> there<00:03:11.269> I

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
when full-grown somewhere around there I

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.470 
when full-grown somewhere around there I
was<00:03:12.769> told<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.190> kind<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.459> hard<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> judge<00:03:14.060> just

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
was told it's kind of hard to judge just

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.530 
was told it's kind of hard to judge just
how<00:03:15.319> tall<00:03:15.380> they're<00:03:15.739> gonna<00:03:15.890> get<00:03:16.130> but<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.760> believe

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
how tall they're gonna get but I believe

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.840 
how tall they're gonna get but I believe
they're<00:03:17.690> always<00:03:17.870> under<00:03:18.200> 41<00:03:19.010> inches<00:03:19.430> so

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
they're always under 41 inches so

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.840 
they're always under 41 inches so
they're<00:03:20.030> very<00:03:20.650> they're<00:03:21.650> very<00:03:21.739> very<00:03:22.310> small<00:03:22.640> but

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
they're very they're very very small but

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.670 
they're very they're very very small but
they're<00:03:23.000> very<00:03:23.180> proportionate<00:03:23.900> because<00:03:24.560> they

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
they're very proportionate because they

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.640 
they're very proportionate because they
aren't<00:03:24.950> miniaturized<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:27.019> it's<00:03:27.109> very<00:03:27.290> hard<00:03:27.560> to

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
aren't miniaturized so it's very hard to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.770 
aren't miniaturized so it's very hard to
judge<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:27.950> think<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.400> pictures<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:29.180> on<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
judge I think in pictures and on the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.500 
judge I think in pictures and on the
video<00:03:29.900> just<00:03:30.350> how<00:03:30.590> tiny<00:03:30.829> they<00:03:31.100> are<00:03:31.390> because<00:03:32.390> to

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
video just how tiny they are because to

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.240 
video just how tiny they are because to
me<00:03:32.630> even<00:03:32.810> looking<00:03:33.290> through<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> video<00:03:33.920> he

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
me even looking through the video he

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.630 
me even looking through the video he
looks<00:03:34.549> like<00:03:34.730> a<00:03:34.760> pretty<00:03:35.090> big<00:03:35.359> cow<00:03:36.200> but<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:37.459> in

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
looks like a pretty big cow but that in

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:45.270 
looks like a pretty big cow but that in
person<00:03:38.030> he's<00:03:38.180> just<00:03:38.359> he's<00:03:38.510> so<00:03:38.750> tiny
