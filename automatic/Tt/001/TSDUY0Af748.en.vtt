month later and it has rooted and grown
all<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> way<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.270> top<00:01:59.510> of<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.750> cage<00:02:00.820> okay

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
all the way to the top of the cage okay

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.430 
all the way to the top of the cage okay
it's<00:02:02.119> now<00:02:02.300> mid-october

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
towards the end of the season and this

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.219 
towards the end of the season and this
is<00:02:06.440> grown<00:02:06.740> all<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.430> way<00:02:07.580> up<00:02:07.850> to<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> top<00:02:08.390> it's

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
is grown all the way up to the top it's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.340

about<00:02:09.470> 11<00:02:09.920> feet<00:02:10.190> tall<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:11.870> was<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.080> good

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
about 11 feet tall so this was a good

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.820 
about 11 feet tall so this was a good
way<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.590> replace<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.400> dead<00:02:13.940> tomato<00:02:14.209> plant

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
way to replace a dead tomato plant

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.290 
way to replace a dead tomato plant
without<00:02:15.830> starting<00:02:16.700> from<00:02:16.880> seed<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:20.060> didn't

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
without starting from seed and I didn't

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.270 
without starting from seed and I didn't
use<00:02:20.420> any<00:02:20.600> rooting<00:02:21.080> hormone<00:02:21.290> or<00:02:21.739> anything<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.250> I

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
use any rooting hormone or anything so I

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.800 
use any rooting hormone or anything so I
just<00:02:22.519> stuck<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.850> branch<00:02:23.780> in<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.050> ground<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.769> it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
just stuck a branch in the ground and it

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.290 
just stuck a branch in the ground and it
grew<00:02:26.810> into<00:02:27.019> this
