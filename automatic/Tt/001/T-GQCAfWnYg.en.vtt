00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.260
 I saw them 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.260
 all that I want 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.549
 philippe dallier a trace of the father intelligence to size the un 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.460
 so fed up with these perpetual quarrels over the meaning of the 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.070
 visit 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.600
 a few comments to two of their most brilliant as skillful citizens of 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.570
 design and build on these super computer issues to calculate 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.890
 the answer to disqualify some countries to everything else 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 we want the ticketing to 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
 Why 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.060
 All the time 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.200
 my favorite be it 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.190
 expenses 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.950
 I have to think about it 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.660
 hat has time to see exactly 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 7 million annual units 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.740
 all this is already done in great sade 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.880
 and that's all 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
 why 7 million and a half years later 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 the answer to the big question 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.160
 two worlds 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 and everything else 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 this problem 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 I am very optimistic 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 moreover she is sure to know what is the question 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.979
 that's not the question 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.639
 but the question is simple 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.729
 here we dance 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.849
 but I was a little girl 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.430
 the new zealand that will host the issue does not arise 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:32.290
 I love the actors of the black series continues to visit Jordan and the 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.809
 Yemen 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.959
 it will be an integral part of these calculation units 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.859
 words even take a new primitive form there would be a 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.529
 computer videos read here 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.429
 she helps her program 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.379
 about computers 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.149
 if ever the same
