00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.879
 Hello everyone and chris here today we are 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.820
 arrived at the penultimate stage of the 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.440
 2015 media campaign in particular 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.490
 we are facing the red and black deck 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.580
 vampires this is over this challenge 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.570
 this battle will be the battle 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.750
 final against the campaign boss a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 bachtin if I remember correctly and therefore 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.530
 nothing we see how it goes also because I have 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.720
 heard that this meeting should not 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.380
 be among the easiest so there 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:48.780
 it is worthwhile to concentrate as first hand e 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.200
 decent but you could do a little something 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.200
 more 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.239
 ok this is a 2 1 that every time i get 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.899
 deals damage takes one plus one 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:09.110
 yes like but it is not it is not but it is not evil 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.110
 let's say however here then we do so 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.659
 let's put them down 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:30.390
 and then we wait in place if it is not one 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.020
 very easy game also because the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.900
 opponent's deck is strong enough not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:45.900
 strong but in short 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:49.280
 he knows something about it too greets us 21 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.280
 with flying and which cannot lock 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:02.850
 then we do so missionary 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.270
 solitary and then we attack with the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.270
 two more 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:23.880
 ok and they are four years old and 16 in place 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:27.810
 now let's see he must attack by force 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:31.620
 In fact the hands of people we have 24 points 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:36.690
 life therefore sum is a problem only 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.330
 relatively and already this is more 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.540
 infamous practically this spell 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.820
 does that every time I suffer damage 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.420
 he can put a counter no more 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.870
 I'm on that one 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.580
 quite informed but still then 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:05.310
 let's put down with the wings of nembro sui 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:08.690
 he becomes a 4 5 and I would say that he can 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.690
 stick with everything we say 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.099
 perfect 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.720
 9 and now attacks me by force because 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:36.090
 so that one cannot use it for 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.090
 block I get 3 years I go to 19 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.540
 ok whenever this other creature 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.620
 so out of 43 it deals damage it gets 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.620
 plus one plus one 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.160
 so president he at 243 I still have 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:00.040
 only two lands since in the store a 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.360
 Starting outrageous him but we're down 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.350
 also because I ca n't do anything else 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:19.479
 played two really land and attack 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:22.360
 we live with them and with these other two 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.930
 what do you rightly do for that 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.490
 stronger though if I didn't hurt i 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.060
 accounts 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.340
 he is now at 4 so if the next 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.440
 turn but mind of some creature 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:42.220
 convolare I have won because the sonica 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:45.070
 convolar creature can't block me 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:51.550
 and I have a fly 45 so I would do it 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:55.110
 just right or four damages and then 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.110
 he wouldn't die then 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.350
 you can put as many counters as you want on 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.560
 that much you don't even see a land 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:13.390
 not even a land with two lands we have 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:21.850
 unbelievable won then ended that way 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:22.210
 gets 4 damages is defined by mica 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.970
 bad 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:33.520
 me if we can open the bag 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:35.590
 let's see what we got is these 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.030
 I'm not as bad as bond cards 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:43.200
 sanguine this is powerful here 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.120
 work fine on the bunch 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:51.790
 intervention of the basic men and 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:53.590
 decent let's say we are in management 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.540
 of the deck 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.820
 I would say before adding the cards 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.380
 then we think about removing them 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:08.410
 blood bond and the mentor of the 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:12.730
 men surely but it is also dead weight 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:18.880
 it's not bad as a door while we raise him 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:24.040
 which is quite useless as a paper ea 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.200
 reluctantly triple the spirits because 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.270
 has a mana cost too high e 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:36.070
 I never played once so it is 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:39.540
 useless and then we still raise massÃ¬ dai 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:44.040
 we still have to pulverize the meat 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.040
 we all have two okay august 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.630
 ok said that for today is everything and there 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.130
 we catch the next gameplay where 

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.889
 finally we will face the final boss 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.540
 of the campaign and from that moment on 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:00.370
 we can finally create our own 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.370
 custom decks to the next
