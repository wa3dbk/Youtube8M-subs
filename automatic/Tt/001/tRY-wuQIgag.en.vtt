when<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.219> roll<00:01:56.460> them<00:01:56.549> though<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:57.060> how

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
when you roll them though you see how

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.139 
when you roll them though you see how
that<00:01:57.270> space<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:59.070> have<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.790> cut

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that space that was here you have to cut

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.940 
that space that was here you have to cut
out<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.570> space<00:02:00.990> between<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.530> head<00:02:01.740> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
out all that space between the head and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.380 
out all that space between the head and
the<00:02:02.040> chest<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.670> have<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.939> keep<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.210> really

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the chest you have to keep it really

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.450 
the chest you have to keep it really
tight<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.140> part<00:02:04.439> here<00:02:04.680> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
tight and this part here and then the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
tight and this part here and then the
head<00:02:05.610> gets<00:02:05.790> turned<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.180> has<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.540> no<00:02:07.200> space

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
head gets turned it has to be no space

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.490 
head gets turned it has to be no space
right<00:02:07.860> here

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
right here

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.499 
right here
so<00:02:08.679> really<00:02:09.250> tie<00:02:09.490> down<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.880> ground<00:02:10.090> same

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
so really tie down to the ground same

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
keep it really tight are you going from

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:35.550 
keep it really tight are you going from
the<00:02:18.340> beginning<00:02:32.580> I'm<00:02:33.580> gonna<00:02:33.780> grab<00:02:34.780> do<00:02:35.260> I'll

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
the beginning I'm gonna grab do I'll

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.900 
the beginning I'm gonna grab do I'll
grab<00:02:35.800> my<00:02:35.830> job<00:02:36.280> spin<00:02:37.030> him<00:02:37.180> at<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> same<00:02:37.660> time

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.580 

from<00:02:42.910> here<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.270> go<00:02:43.510> into<00:02:43.660> Troy<00:02:44.260> code

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.470 

tighten<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.650> up<00:02:47.739> first<00:02:48.070> before<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.209> have<00:02:49.360> to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
tighten it up first before you have to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.800 
tighten it up first before you have to
do<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.320> vice<00:02:50.500> oh<00:02:51.150> yeah<00:02:52.150> get<00:02:52.330> as<00:02:52.450> tight<00:02:52.630> as<00:02:52.780> you

do the vice oh yeah get as tight as you
can<00:02:52.950> mm-hmm<00:02:53.950> when<00:02:54.160> you're<00:02:54.250> doing<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:54.640> that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
can mm-hmm when you're doing it so that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.040 
can mm-hmm when you're doing it so that
you<00:02:54.820> just<00:02:55.000> barely<00:02:55.239> have<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.570> squeeze<00:02:55.840> to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
you just barely have to squeeze to

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.650 
you just barely have to squeeze to
tighten<00:02:56.320> them<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.910> okay<00:02:57.910> someone's<00:02:58.300> there<00:02:58.420> so

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
tighten them up okay someone's there so

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
talk about is that you did a little too

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.190 
talk about is that you did a little too
much<00:03:27.760> blocking<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:28.570> our<00:03:28.750> since<00:03:28.930> we<00:03:29.080> do<00:03:29.170> a

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
much blocking and our since we do a

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.350 
much blocking and our since we do a
little<00:03:29.350> more<00:03:29.470> moving<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.730> defense<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.239> a

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
little more moving the defense of a

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.030 
little more moving the defense of a
punch<00:03:31.600> is<00:03:31.690> coming<00:03:32.019> in<00:03:32.140> my<00:03:32.290> block<00:03:32.590> is<00:03:32.799> really

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
punch is coming in my block is really

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.860 
punch is coming in my block is really
the<00:03:33.160> moving<00:03:33.430> out<00:03:33.549> of<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.730> way<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.540> kind<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
the moving out of the way you kind of

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.990 
the moving out of the way you kind of
tapped<00:03:35.170> his<00:03:35.440> hand<00:03:35.650> out<00:03:35.739> of<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.920> way<00:03:36.070> yeah<00:03:36.459> but

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
tapped his hand out of the way yeah but

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.660 
tapped his hand out of the way yeah but
it's<00:03:37.150> not<00:03:37.209> fast<00:03:37.570> enough<00:03:37.780> because<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:39.100> actions

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
it's not fast enough because the actions

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.280 
it's not fast enough because the actions
faster<00:03:40.150> than<00:03:40.299> reaction<00:03:40.810> meeting<00:03:41.019> that's<00:03:41.110> what

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
faster than reaction meeting that's what

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.020 
faster than reaction meeting that's what
he<00:03:41.350> punches<00:03:41.769> me<00:03:41.860> most<00:03:42.220> very<00:03:42.519> likely<00:03:42.760> i'm<00:03:42.970> going

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
he punches me most very likely i'm going

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.080 
he punches me most very likely i'm going
to<00:03:43.180> get<00:03:43.299> hit<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.590> want<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:44.950> move<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:45.519> tap<00:03:45.940> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
to get hit so I want to move and tap the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.670 
to get hit so I want to move and tap the
same<00:03:46.239> time<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.630> that<00:03:46.780> he's<00:03:46.900> punch<00:03:47.200> me<00:03:47.350> he<00:03:47.380> hits

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
same time so that he's punch me he hits

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.729 
same time so that he's punch me he hits
me<00:03:47.769> whoa<00:03:48.610> I'm<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.570> but<00:03:50.350> I'm<00:03:50.500> still

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
me whoa I'm like this but I'm still

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.330 
me whoa I'm like this but I'm still
going<00:03:50.920> here<00:03:51.280> as<00:03:52.060> opposed<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.570> doing<00:03:52.720> this<00:03:53.340> and

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
going here as opposed to doing this and

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.640 
going here as opposed to doing this and
it's<00:03:54.519> stepping<00:03:54.760> it's<00:03:55.450> really<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.260> movement

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
it's stepping it's really this movement

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:09.759 
it's stepping it's really this movement
is<00:03:57.160> more<00:03:57.940> important<00:03:58.329> than<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.600> blocking<00:03:59.200> hand

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.170 

reaches<00:04:10.769> down<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:11.010> little<00:04:11.220> bit<00:04:11.430> when<00:04:11.879> you<00:04:11.970> reach

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
reaches down a little bit when you reach

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.350 
reaches down a little bit when you reach
over<00:04:13.099> peel<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:14.310> keep<00:04:14.550> a<00:04:14.640> really<00:04:14.760> close<00:04:14.879> really

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
over peel it keep a really close really

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.890 
over peel it keep a really close really
