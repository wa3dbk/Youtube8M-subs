00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:07.759
 very important very in your favor that is your 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.759
 mission the humidity the heat 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.039
 going in there 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.310
 what's wrong with your child's body 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.039
 when you are coming to a match today 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.869
 we come with fox sports fox we come to 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:36.780
 play but they are quite behind what 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.780
 you live in a previous match 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 there is a very curious thing Carlos I do not know if 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.550
 the eyelids and the senses 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.630
 never in its history was it a cup of 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.570
 world 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.670
 today without having the possibility to be in 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.320
 a global or today really of the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.850
 dely valdés cheese director hand 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.070
 technical 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.080
 I think he's dreaming of going for a drink 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.760
 of the world out there by managing have 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.400
 the possibilities because the team has 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.320
 advanced by tricky all of the team is 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.960
 has accommodated because it has good 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.370
 players and we can repeat paramedic 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.110
 it's going to be a complicated game but to me 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.170
 I like this type of matches Mexico 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.920
 I said it and I reiterate mexico grows in 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.890
 moments of pressure 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.890
 for many people they will not be very 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.909
 happy but personal goals 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.800
 qualified even for the media 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.650
 for us the means is to qualify 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.300
 as of place and I believe that these six 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.340
 matches to Mexico is very convenient 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.990
 for more it prevents the possibility of 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.900
 qualify a long way down by 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.510
 travel and I think that marc panama 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.030
 like this one could not shoot but I hope 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.570
 that this Friday for mexico is a 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.490
 difficult match but to come out with a 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.110
 favorable result good what yes 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.540
 we have to warn people that no 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.490
 I know or the pity is the environment is going to be 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.610
 different than this thing people are going to 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.470
 put much more in the tribune the field 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.530
 the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.740
 temperature is high and the rival is much 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.119
 better than the Jamaicans much better or 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.190
 whether a test awaits mexico 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.870
 very interesting and very strong the 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.570
 next friday here in panama city 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.580
