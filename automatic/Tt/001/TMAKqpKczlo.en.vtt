00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.289
 Hello everyone at the microphone cape lens 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.359
 cameras kotofey and today we will tell 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.259
 what is the elder scrolls trailer 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.590
 online 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.210
 and also show how the sets are crafted 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.070
 crafting in the so-called from this 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.710
 blacksmiths who can meet 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.460
 to the world tamriel for example on u lidone 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.739
 there are 3 of them 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.460
 in the southern part of the island in the east near 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.460
 sky-watcher 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.620
 and in the north where I am now trade 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.360
 and these are special properties of things in order 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.489
 to study tried you need to find 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.870
 disassemble Stankevich relevant 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.269
 properties then you can 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.670
 make this type of thing with such 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.739
 same properties 3 can be studied on any 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.570
 craft machines and not only in cellular 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.939
 blacksmiths we just decided to kill two 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 hares immediately here all three machines for 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:08.290
 work on the skin of wood and metal 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.520
 let's start with wood processing 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.310
 wood includes making 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.350
 bows of staffs and bills as you see 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.509
 I have already studied trade for 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.670
 frosty staff and to exploring others 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.579
 trade of I can not get even more 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.530
 four hours learning rate of trade of 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:25.180
 can be raised using the appropriate 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.219
 chairs this carpentry for 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.799
 woodworking at tower g for 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.630
 blacksmithing and stitch in sewing 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.369
 also when learning these skills 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.469
 the number of trade of 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.249
 which you can study at the same time 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.689
 but unfortunately only up to two go to 

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.119
 Forge here we can make 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.069
 various weapons as well as heavy armor 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.899
 but also to learn trade for them and of course 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.689
 trades for all types of weapons in the game 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.999
 same as for armor let's 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.030
 dwell on them in detail let's start with 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:57.869
 weapons trade of enhanced reduces 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.709
 rollback of weapon enchantment 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.369
 charged capacity increases 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:06.310
 enchantment clear increases strength when 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.819
 then weapons and spells filled 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.840
 increases the protective effect of augmenting 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.990
 increases protection 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.160
 due to spell resistance 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.190
 training speeds up ownership training 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.290
 this type of weapon sharpened 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.680
 increases chance to break through armor 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.240
 weighted increases attack speed 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.070
 now we will study trade shopping what 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.780
 will allow us to make in the future 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.000
 one-handed swords with increased performance 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.490
 breakthrough for this we need 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.490
 make out our wonderful orihalka you have 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.340
 let's go to the 3rd armor strong gives a chance 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.360
 that the armor is dying and won't break 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.120
 impermeable increases resistance 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.150
 crit reinforced increases 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.680
 item armor 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.900
 well fitted reduces cost 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.980
 sprint 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.920
 training speeds up ownership training 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.400
 this type of armor filled 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.720
 increases the effect of enchantment 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.050
 research increases the resulting 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.280
 for the terrain research experience 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.680
 divine enhances the effect of stones 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.420
 Mundus 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.370
 since we have the skill of metallurgy we 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.200
 we have the opportunity to study two three at once 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.450
 it is in the forge which we now 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.870
 use putting on the study of the third 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.060
 twain for helmet voila just under 23 hours 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.910
 and it will be possible to study the next 3 in 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.840
 forge 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.120
 in the meantime, something happens 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.350
 fierce battle someone chases 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.630
 the pole of the poor little animals 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.770
 but we will not intervene we are not here 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.770
 for that isn't it 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.689
 go to the tank for sewing here 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.760
 make light or medium borders 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.620
 list 3 is the same as heavy 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.689
 you see that I have three with me 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.239
 things available for me to learn the trade 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:04:07.790
 Jacket and pants and examine trade Shoulders 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:10.159
 and for two of them now let's go to 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.139
 the second part of the video making with this 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:13.909
 out things set 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.680
 This is a set of several things with 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:18.139
 simultaneous wearing of which we 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.060
 we get additional bonuses set 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.889
 low levels consist of three things 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.080
 higher of 5 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.759
 each set is crafted in its own from this 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.740
 blacksmiths in this case we can 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.259
 to make a set of ashen grip 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.020
 he gives a 10 percent chance to exhale 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.449
 flame on attack every 4 seconds 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.310
 let's make it in order to 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.050
 make low-level sets for 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.690
 every thing on the net needs to be studied 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.220
 at least 2 trade of in this case you 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.919
 see that we can't make 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.930
 we have studied gloves for them only 13 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.310
 higher level it requires up to 8 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.740
 tracks for every thing 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.530
 see that the higher level thing 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.449
 we create the higher color effect since 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.580
 we will have some materials 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.139
 do things for the fourth level all 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.710
 equal to this site about birds and only for 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.710
 this video 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.090
 determined by the appearance of things we 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.970
 we can craft things in a giant organ 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.380
 Omsk alt nasty and kadzhit scam styles 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.380
 let the train be altmer 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:23.020
 Next, select the tray for things that we 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:26.150
 make all search ready 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.249
 style is just the look of the thing he neither 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.499
 which is no longer affected despite this 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:33.229
 books style is highly valued at 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:37.059
 market, repeat this procedure for 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.059
 helmet and shoulder pads 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.230
 on more or less decent leather pants 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.220
 not enough well, okay for the set 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.220
 three things are enough 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:06:02.430
 let's admire us dyed us set 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:04.230
 and the conclusion is a little more from rates for 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.240
 each particular time to study 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.280
 trade of grows in proportion to that 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.380
 how many trade of for this thing already 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.170
 studied that is first track examples for 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.750
 helmet you can study in six hours 2 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:18.960
 for 12 and so on the last eighth 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.000
 trade study in 32 days therefore become 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.970
 professional crater uneasy 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.130
 time tracking task 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.110
 There are currently studied rates 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.330
 very wonderful add-on crafter 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.890
 we consider and when you turn it on in 3 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.930
 neat windows reported on 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.880
 what are you and are being studied at the moment 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.540
 and how much time is left for them 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.550
 studying 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.020
 although constantly hanging on the screen window 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:45.120
 which can not be disabled 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:47.250
 a little annoying on this all with you 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.990
 were we sik this movie subscribe to 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.090
 channel watch video on Tess 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:54.090
 play this great game together 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.830
 with us in Ghent and Guard put huskies 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:58.200
 write in the comments about what aspect 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.320
 games you would like to watch the following 

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.320
 video
