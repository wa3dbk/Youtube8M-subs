00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.359 
can get a higher smoke point one of the
things<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.840> really<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.380> about<00:01:46.409> peanut<00:01:46.950> oil<00:01:47.130> is

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
things I really like about peanut oil is

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.670 
things I really like about peanut oil is
that<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:48.600> has<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> cleaner<00:01:49.200> flavor

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that it has a cleaner flavor

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
that it has a cleaner flavor
I<00:01:49.829> think<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.490> canola<00:01:50.880> oil<00:01:51.119> hmm<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
I think the canola oil hmm and one of

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.359 
I think the canola oil hmm and one of
the<00:01:52.290> things<00:01:52.500> that's<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:53.159> about

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the things that's really good about

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.370 
the things that's really good about
peanut<00:01:53.970> oil<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> doesn't<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.750> rancid<00:01:55.229> like

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
peanut oil is it doesn't get rancid like

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.940 
peanut oil is it doesn't get rancid like
sometimes<00:01:55.770> canola<00:01:56.130> oil<00:01:56.399> does<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> we're

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
sometimes canola oil does so we're

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.499 
sometimes canola oil does so we're
getting<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.640> we'll<00:01:59.880> get<00:02:00.030> these<00:02:00.149> fry

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
getting these going we'll get these fry

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.830 
getting these going we'll get these fry
in<00:02:01.310> now<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:02.460> gonna<00:02:02.549> fry<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:02.939> at

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
in now you're gonna fry these at

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350 
in now you're gonna fry these at
medium-high<00:02:04.409> heat<00:02:04.590> in<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.460> thick<00:02:05.729> gauge<00:02:05.969> pan

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
medium-high heat in a thick gauge pan

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.010 
medium-high heat in a thick gauge pan
that's<00:02:06.659> really<00:02:06.960> important<00:02:07.439> as<00:02:07.500> well

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
that's really important as well

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.160 
that's really important as well
I<00:02:08.640> can't<00:02:09.640> use<00:02:09.790> my<00:02:10.000> lightweight<00:02:10.420> aluminum<00:02:10.960> pan

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
I can't use my lightweight aluminum pan

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.350 
I can't use my lightweight aluminum pan
yeah<00:02:12.100> sure<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.610> need<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.850> take<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.120> pans

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
yeah sure you need to take that pans

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.360 
yeah sure you need to take that pans
throw<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> out<00:02:13.960> okay<00:02:14.530> what<00:02:14.710> about<00:02:14.800> cast-iron

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
throw it out okay what about cast-iron

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.020 
throw it out okay what about cast-iron
pan<00:02:15.760> cast-iron<00:02:16.540> would<00:02:16.780> be<00:02:16.870> really<00:02:17.140> good<00:02:17.350> but<00:02:17.680> I

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
pan cast-iron would be really good but I

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.830 
pan cast-iron would be really good but I
think<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> end<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.450> day<00:02:19.570> what<00:02:19.720> you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
think at the end of the day what you

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.120 
think at the end of the day what you
want<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.050> do<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.290> if<00:02:20.440> there's<00:02:20.830> anything<00:02:21.010> that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
want to do is if there's anything that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.070 
want to do is if there's anything that
you're<00:02:21.310> gonna<00:02:21.400> want<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.000> invest<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.660> be

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
you're gonna want to invest in to be

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.020 
you're gonna want to invest in to be
able<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.230> cook<00:02:23.470> very<00:02:23.710> well<00:02:23.800> it's<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.730> really

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
able to cook very well it's a really

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.930 
able to cook very well it's a really
thick<00:02:25.420> gauge<00:02:25.800> solid<00:02:26.800> pan<00:02:27.220> because<00:02:27.550> it'll<00:02:27.760> hold

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
thick gauge solid pan because it'll hold

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.400 
thick gauge solid pan because it'll hold
the<00:02:28.060> heat<00:02:28.240> better<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.870> one<00:02:29.140> thing<00:02:29.320> that's

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
the heat better and one thing that's

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.870 
the heat better and one thing that's
really<00:02:29.680> important<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.340> holding<00:02:30.820> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
really important is that holding the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.980 
really important is that holding the
heat<00:02:31.030> better<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> give<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.720> even

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
heat better is going to give you even

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.600 
heat better is going to give you even
cooking<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.740> it's<00:02:33.070> gonna<00:02:33.160> give<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.460> much

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
site because the coin starts is gonna

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.910 
site because the coin starts is gonna
give<00:03:24.130> me<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.280> really<00:03:24.610> crispy<00:03:25.150> outside<00:03:25.709> okay<00:03:26.709> so
