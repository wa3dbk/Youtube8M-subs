00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840 
can buy them with coins as far as I
understand<00:00:15.960> their<00:00:16.109> unlimited<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.580> could

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
understand their unlimited so this could

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.939 
understand their unlimited so this could
be<00:00:17.910> potentially<00:00:18.300> pretty<00:00:18.960> epic<00:00:19.140> what<00:00:19.859> I'm

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
be potentially pretty epic what I'm

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.080 
be potentially pretty epic what I'm
planning<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.340> doing<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.730> I'm<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> open

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
planning on doing is I'm going to open

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.689 
planning on doing is I'm going to open
up<00:00:21.300> five<00:00:21.630> pro<00:00:21.960> packs<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> five<00:00:22.920> premium<00:00:23.430> packs

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
up five pro packs and five premium packs

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
up five pro packs and five premium packs
so<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> pretty<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.470> heavy<00:00:25.769> amount

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
so that is a pretty pretty heavy amount

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.859 
so that is a pretty pretty heavy amount
of<00:00:26.460> coins<00:00:26.820> being<00:00:27.119> spent<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.539> think<00:00:27.570> that's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
of coins being spent I think that's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.200 
of coins being spent I think that's
going<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> be<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.349> 400<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:31.520> 37,500<00:00:32.520> or

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
going to be what 400 and what 37,500 or

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
going to be what 400 and what 37,500 or
something<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.469> pretty<00:00:34.829> heavy

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
something like that so a pretty heavy

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860 
something like that so a pretty heavy
amount<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.670> coins<00:00:35.880> being<00:00:36.149> spent<00:00:36.420> today<00:00:36.570> in

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
amount of coins being spent today in

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.690 
amount of coins being spent today in

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.020 
thought it would be better than they
just<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.090> simple<00:02:12.930> collectible<00:02:13.920> but<00:02:14.400> still<00:02:14.819> has

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
Eddie Lacy 94 playoff card that was a

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.860 
Eddie Lacy 94 playoff card that was a
budget<00:04:11.220> series<00:04:11.609> running<00:04:11.970> back<00:04:12.239> at<00:04:12.480> one<00:04:12.660> point

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
so I mean at least it's a solid card but

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.240 
so I mean at least it's a solid card but
we<00:04:15.359> are<00:04:15.480> not<00:04:15.660> coming<00:04:16.049> anywhere<00:04:16.320> near<00:04:16.470> making

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.110 
way more than I think it is I don't
think<00:04:23.889> that<00:04:24.010> it's<00:04:24.160> going<00:04:24.340> for<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> ton<00:04:24.880> though

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
think that it's going for a ton though
