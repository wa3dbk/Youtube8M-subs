00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello to all and who would kof for a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.580
 new triplet commented in front of their 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.280
 taxes so today we have 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.700
 follow a 10 French firing tank on 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.219
 trait and my stockings chat 25 t so what 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.059
 what can you tell us about this tank 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.250
 so today so we will follow the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.560
 players or downstairs cat who is a medium 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.850
 two-thirds say they have a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.410
 barrel and there we can see in 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.970
 the occurrence that it has the barrel of 105 mm 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 so they boarded five shots 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.260
 so it's a very, very 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.890
 maneuverable very very fast that turns 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.439
 its turret 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.820
 rather oddly enough can say it 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.920
 she's really a good speed of 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.739
 rotating boat is rotating also on 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.290
 himself and who excels in the role of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 scouts or stalker's dison all 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 field he can really go he can 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.640
 redeploy quickly to the map 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.100
 that's why he's very 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.110
 highly prized in third warao clans which 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 really makes a vehicle capable of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.379
 deal with all situations or 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.610
 on the other hand it is a bit limited level 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.420
 hit points at the resistance level 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.399
 can even say that it is almost 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.020
 nonexistent but otherwise it is a 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.149
 bronchard is a good old age 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.449
 is very useful for controlling the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.250
 map 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.199
 yeah so here we see he's a 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 platoon with two other bachata and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.920
 that he is equipped with fool's gold and therefore 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.650
 as it should be they climbed up 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.740
 from the hill to resume the hill 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.640
 and prevent the enemy from taking it and we 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.750
 may also note that they had to 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.070
 delay because they have no 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 of them had nothing to recharge them 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.520
 so it had to be a little bit 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.170
 this is the time that their battery is 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.759
 reloaded been forced to play frau 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 three tack first two leopard if not 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.939
 he was going to get screwed so there we 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.259
 can see that they lost a colleague 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.270
 and that the second is seriously 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.220
 damaged so it's not it's not at 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.450
 better for now but one side they 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.710
 managed to take the hill that 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.150
 was still the goal 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.409
 yes problem is he henry aude 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.750
 so I do not know if his comrade in 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.979
 again yeah that's the question 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.090
 is set to more comrades bombs to 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.820
 water - that's it it rained two 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.200
 platoon comrades good as safe but 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.740
 they took the hill which allows to 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.630
 shoot in all directions 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.369
 exploit people and pass it on 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.700
 ally position so this is a good 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.470
 thing 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.299
 here it is still necessary that just that 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.740
 colleagues come to support for 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.540
 prevent others from climbing but there he 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.850
 will be able to make another one 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.650
 new barrier 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.080
 then we will note that he only plays in gold 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.970
 good it's not super super folichon but 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.709
 good it assures him in any case a 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.850
 correct penetration even though and we're going 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.220
 see that they should maybe a little 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.180
 targeted a little bit more accurate 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.160
 precisely because he's still 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.130
 a lot of boon is getting ben yeah there 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.510
 four goals in a row in more than 1.50 m 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.360
 I do not imagine it's a shield 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.330
 monstrous not especially aside bah it's 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.200
 that and the worst is that he did not speak 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.580
 masses of ammunition have still 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.380
 on this tank it's one of those faults 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.730
 narrate one has already accused a third it 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.480
 had 30 on purpose at the beginning of the game a 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.340
 aspic 20 that's it so he also has the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.110
 luck in that the enemies are a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.430
 little bit at a time more is nothing the 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.720
 time not very wise because he would have 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.890
 had to suspect that the bat was andré 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.010
 because he stopped saying 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.390
 yes also passes simon tay search 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.470
 he was making boxes and this by the 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.170
 flank by the ace of the team now 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.080
 that he starts to aim it works but he 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.040
 must keep the 5 years to the liner there a 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.959
 little chouya close this is his was filled 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.930
 on wii what will the shooting was foolish 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.350
 was a little bit hard yeah 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.510
 risky on the rest of the map so 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.400
 they let the enemy take the 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.079
 little the little island it's not 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.019
 dramatic since the release of the 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:24.930
 small island and is always difficult in 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.040
 city ​​it looks like is pretty much 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.370
 balanced they are still a lot 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.299
 to try to move forward on the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.470
 center but without getting there 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.820
 will saw the numerical superiority 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.200
 normally allied tanks in column 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.549
 cat and 5 should have already tried to 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.769
 push or at least join the 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.480
 rock for him to press him on the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.090
 mowing there anyway reason that motivated 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.420
 to he set on fire it will be a small bonus 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.590
 he put a fire back no no I think he 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.609
 put a little but he handed a second 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.980
 shot while she was still on fire 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:54.019
 so in fact it's the shock 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.670
 to burn me I do not think I'll finish the t-50 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:00.019
 this dome of state auxerre could 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.879
 go out who's already too much at he's 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.650
 almost 5000 points of damage it's 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.730
 not bad I think he can still do 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.459
 better yeah so let go yes he was trying 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.680
 spots and I had a little yes ben 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.879
 it's worrying reload his balls 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.860
 like what he does there because the 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.199
 guys on the mecca on the island for the 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.940
 to disband quite good it remains 1400 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.930
 pv but it's fast so fast gasoline and 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.010
 his hand very quickly and many 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.510
 disadvantages of the chat buzz knows that 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.590
 it's a shield and paper mache 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.660
 has absolutely no shielding 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.760
 the only advantage being the angles being 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.210
 given that he is good English that it bume 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.530
 this more frequently it's not it's not 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.470
 negligible when we try to survive 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.789
 and there we see all the power of the fact 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.710
 to have taken the hill you arrive in 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.449
 the back half lives and tulle and 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.250
 boxes one by one sound that surrender 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.199
 even count of what is happening but 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.370
 that's where he reaches as early as 4 years old when he has 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.729
 luck was 34 it's completely 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.190
 missed 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:52.070
 yeah he's just waiting for this kirilow 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.389
 from what awaits habana i'm going 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.340
 maybe a celery aude I do not know 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.310
 Wow, that would be a pity 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.729
 swing a little bang in the tea 30 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.860
 will still have on fire the chance 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.990
 smiles to the audacious 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:10.070
 on the other hand it's his last task 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.470
 so just good that it stays in front of 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.630
 wat pussy not interest at bottom her time 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.260
 that he has not finished recharging he gets 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.320
 well sheltered the last three tanks 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.650
 just wait in front of yes well they are 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.570
 all 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.370
 they are however notable is 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.020
 largely all in slip 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.539
 I think he may be doing the 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.919
 badge at your first down if they get to 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:36.020
 time that it goes well stone 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.419
 charles is proud to receive the shot in 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.650
 move tonight ben yeah I'm 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.919
 Nice it's really better now 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.530
 me s3a damage on crappy good go 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.639
 just to make it penetrate a nickel on 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.770
 sees speed as it is 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.759
 already at 60 kilometers per hour and very 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.750
 maneuverable we see that he does not lose 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.699
 really speed in the turns there 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.949
 Well, it's still a damn 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.320
 Bouchard has nothing to complain about 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.330
 yeah clearly good moby well swift 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.310
 rebels a rotation on itself vote 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.350
 in vote to the movement good cadence 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.699
 from shooting to getting married maybe a little 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.259
 light level amount of water but but here 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.060
 we see that he still has 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.410
 swayed 25 shots that touched him he 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.630
 still managed to finish with one more 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.090
 or two shells so that seems to be 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.120
 enough enough state for the length 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.490
 of the party 7418 points of damage 8 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.620
 kills with the walters radio medal and 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.410
 of 1536 points of xp in premium 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.780
 not really a very pretty part yeah 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.639
 but we can see the fragility of the 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.900
 char and the yard having rice time 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.389
 nato early game that cost the 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.979
 life to his two colleagues anyway eh 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.910
 well thanks we received soon 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.910
 for a single commented party
