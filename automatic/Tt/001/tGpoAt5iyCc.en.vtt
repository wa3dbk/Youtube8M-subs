wrap<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.450> here<00:02:25.450> we<00:02:25.630> get<00:02:26.160> 8<00:02:27.160> GB<00:02:27.670> 10<00:02:28.269> class

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
wrap this so here we get 8 GB 10 class

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
wrap this so here we get 8 GB 10 class
memory<00:02:30.160> card<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:30.790> really<00:02:31.150> cool<00:02:31.390> at<00:02:31.750> least
