 hello guys welcome to new monopoly 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 empire and in this case the monopoly is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.420
 as you always see traditional with the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.480
 game system for a sofa and buxom 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.679
 the ever-present cut prison sent 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.660
 apart from the board to be able to 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.529
 show all the features of 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.779
 game 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.320
 the novelty is what we have to do for 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.420
 tell us let's go and conquer not the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.250
 usual classic real estate properties 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.810
 but they had to buy more brands 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.090
 world famous 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.230
 But we have super important from the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.100
 coca cola from ciro lei to make mount 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 producing the game the xbox and there is also 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 makes these 22 Italian brands 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.040
 play that makes us look good 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.710
 the ducati also between one of the pawns 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.390
 golden available invents the look 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.100

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.059
 we are complaining at night 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.699
 kind of times square where we have 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.050
 many buildings motions and skyscrapers on 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.030
 which we must attach the loop 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.049
 advertising or never sticking that well 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 we manage to conquer 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.189

 pawns including cia that our ducati 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.560
 in our case, Italian 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.390
 ok of course all the others 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.369
 version around the 2 our but 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.290
 let's say he represents us inside 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.060
 monopolies 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.560
 returning to the focus of the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.140
 billboard 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.060
 here we are then I told you these are 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.159
 the pawns that love 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.130
 position an airbox one control 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.590
 coca cola a paramount ciak a 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.289
 mcdonald's parking package a scene 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.570
 that our educate comfortable data to 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.880
 available all normal except one 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.920
 face with the possibility of making one 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.689
 exchange the exchange between thing among those 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.689
 which are the properties we owe 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.520
 We must win this case brands 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.220
 obviously go classically like 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.780
 monopoly to pull our data for a 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.789
 march you don't want the board if 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.229
 we end up on a box we put our own 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.289
 that of the ducati we can choose 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.630
 whether to buy it with the money we have e 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:09.369
 of the inevitable paper money line of the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.930
 monopoly if buy it directly 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.690
 paying the banker then player 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.660
 he will be a banker or we can do 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.060
 or the desks and is bound to hold 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.709
 an auction to found thinks also not for which 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.430
 we start from 50 as monetary values ​​in the 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.750
 naples after which the players go to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 offer as much as possible for 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.500
 get the insignia there are 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.760
 teachers on the precious and as for 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.590
 this example of the ducati o 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.900
 even that of samsung because 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.890
 precious both in terms of value and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.140
 because they allow me to reach 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.450
 first the goal of the game though that 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.040
 to fill my skyscraper polla 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.560
 he teaches of trees because he finds 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.090
 conquer this during the game 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.410
 let's say the normal scrolling of the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.460
 then of course there are the 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.720
 unknowns 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.040
 by the unexpected cards take 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.210
 without paying anything 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.370
 a sign of the electric company 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.260
 put in your skyscraper there are 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.620
 in fact two public companies one 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.030
 electric proximity little chance of 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.760
 get on the skyscraper anyway 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.170
 to help then there are empire cards 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.690
 we take one for example 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.730
 absolutely not playing this card 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.340
 when someone some other player 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.170
 that relates to your damage indeed 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.480
 there are several variables there 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.900
 allow the unexpected kept the 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.540
 way that the scoreboard try to 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.030
 take the insignia of the opponents 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.560
 so I also admit to choosing 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.080
 world of the most interesting signs of the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.780
 taller skyscrapers than mine 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.160
 competitors in the race certainly go to 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.960
 choose on the samsung that you 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.330
 takes a lot of space in my photo 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.490
 gate when it went by the way as 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.860
 a monetary benefit always won 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.010
 this case so much from you succeed to 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.290
 see the monetary values ​​of my touch e 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.740
 the winner is the player who manages to 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.510
 publish with his skyscraper then 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.020

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.860
 most current linked to the most global brands 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.130
