00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:10.629
 hi good staff arrived late for me is the 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:14.950
 ask to exchange certain key key 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:19.240
 meriva to rehabilitate the autopilot is 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.720
 my easytronic meriva for you 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.130
 enable autopilot 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.700
 basically have a few steps to follow 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.840
 I do not know if it will work, but I will. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.940
 try 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:36.249
 The first step is to check if your 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:39.429
 car has a sensor that goes in is to 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:43.149
 example in the manual car is a sensor in the 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:45.339
 pedal and goes on another sensor in the 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.980
 on the clutch pedal 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.980
 it is a sensor that when you enable 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.879
 the autopilot if you try to do 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.309
 some change he'll pick up and go 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.949
 back off the autopilot 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.039
 in the case of merisi on my tronic visit 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.549
 that it is already an electronic accelerator I 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.549
 I found that has a sensor not there right 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.490
 I know if the wiring is already built-in and 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.579
 European forums said that it is 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.219
 I'll check but the sensor is already there. 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.329
 the other step would be to buy this key 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:23.369
 this gm code arrow key to that 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:29.649
 on here 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.450
 09 18 54 14 what she is for Corsica 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.450
 meriva and montana 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.990
 although the box is old the new part 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.340
 It's everywhere it costs around 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.820
 120 reais 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.479
 but as I got a place I can 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.899
 Leave the link then leave for me for 75 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.899
 real 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.749
 then this one is the key of right nÃ© 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.939
 she is the same model of the other 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.350
 difference is not even the same model 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.649
 Format 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.360
 the difference is that it has these buttons 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.370
 here on the side 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.989
 so here 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:23.860
 You get the funk, cool here and you. 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:27.040
 press here will be there increases and here 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.180
 you decrease 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.900
 and she sure is does the setap in the panel and 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.409
 this one down is is the side options 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.260
 from the on- board computer and then when I 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:43.739
 enable the on-board computer as well 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.129
 for every squeeze every close here you 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.290
 more change midi function nÃ© 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.150
 First I'll turn on the autopilot. 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.579
 It's easier, you know? 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.829
 are four pins here are four pins 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:03.670
 in theory the spinning already has these four 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.549
 pins I will install today raise at one 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.109
 company that has tek 2 to enable 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:09.790
 autopilot 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.140
 I'll post on the next videos. 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.379
 showing you 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.379
 beauty, thanks, guys!
