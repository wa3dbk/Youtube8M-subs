00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.549
 to the already pre-Latina girls as they are 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.980
 Swedish inah and today I have a 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.970
 small tutorial on how to make a flat 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:20.000
 twist this this is the fla twist 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.250
 it's more or less what I have here 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.380
 You can see the braid 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.810
 Well, I'll show you how it's done 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.369
 pretty simple to me I still have not left 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 perfect because I'm just 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.170
 learning to do them but is that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 I want to show you how they are made and if 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.660
 you have more ability than me because you 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.360
 I say I 'm terrible with making braids 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 possibly it will be much better and you have 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 one more way to stylize or style 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.860
 your hair so good let's go to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.920
 show you how to do it right now 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.010
 I have the hair is a little wet or 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.910
 Wet Wet nothing has has cream 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.550
 to comb 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.940
 is unraveled and I have it then 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.090
 previously divided then 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.030
 basically what you do with this 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.390
 it's like a twisted in two I do not know if 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.520
 You know this term but I show you 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.539
 how is it done 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.260
 The main idea is to divide the hair 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:28.100
 in two 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.340
 and go above and below by 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.470
 above and below above and by 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.270
 underneath and a braid is left you notice 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.490
 well, this is the same as we are going to 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.800
 do but trying to make the hair 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.320
 so that the braid is stuck to 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.410
 our to our skull and leather 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.260
 scalp is then the first step 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.260
 to do this live the hair in 2 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.579
 I do not have another 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.710
 so 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:06.820
 You can make this hair so thick 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.920
 as you want so thin as you want 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.440
 the amount of hair that you most 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.860
 accommodate and since it is to personal taste not 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.319
 then this I am going to do more or 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.480
 less this thickness because if I like it that way 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.739
 not me I do not like that are 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.170
 delgaditas and we started with the process 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.450
 as we have believe before you have to pass 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.580
 above and below here the only 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.980
 difference is that you're going to have to 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.380
 grab hair pull hair with your 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.130
 same finger every time you pass over 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.680
 and below well something like that link me 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.349
 here to make it look better any 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.210
 back takes between the hair tomÃ¡s hair 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:53.380
 time you take new hair you take hair 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.110
 and that you will have to go repeating 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.960
 throughout the entire process 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.960
 day or because you have this hair here 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.950
 month 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.580
 and here is the finished product 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.650
 is a braid of a thickness not so so 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.379
 delicate because it is thin then 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.319
 I think it's very first one is very 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.260
 difficult to do me and then this 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.260
 It is also very difficult to remove them but 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.769
 for example if you want to make a couple 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.290
 of those braids to make them here towards 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.200
 something like that on one side or all of these 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.390
 well and leave the hair that is free in 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.989
 the back side, you can do it 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.459
 however also make it like this and 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.930
 then what I do here is that I get 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.260
 a kind of butterflies 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.290
 little ones in black and this part 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.040
 he left it loose and already with this one 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.900
 I just pick up the hair from the face 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.780
 I do not like having hair on my face 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.040
 and it is therefore sometimes different 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.640
 I make this side here 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.549
 and well it looks like it looks good 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.549
 different you can simply try 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.860
 also make them as if they were this with 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.050
 rose make it all the hair back 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.520
 if you notice it is much easier to 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.160
 be braided that the braiding of the 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.660
 purchases that I definitely do not 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.699
 it goes very well still and this and I have the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.250
 Hair like that picked up does not stop when 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:43.690
 there is a lot of heat or how you want this one 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.150
 I hope this video has been useful and 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.740
 that and that you can put it in 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.830
 practice if you dare to do it 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.860
 send us the photos as you want this one 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.180
 the picture of how you look with them 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.479
 to facebook that if we can see how 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.280
 how was your style and this and continue 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:04.960
 practicing like me so you can 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.520
 until the end the best ones were born 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.400
 customers because the units are not the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.870
 better but at least this porte 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.970
 here finished it remains true 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.390
 good thanks for the video we give them 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.390
 after
