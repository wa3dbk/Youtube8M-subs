that so anyways you want to approach the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.859 
that so anyways you want to approach the
left<00:02:09.190> side<00:02:09.399> of<00:02:09.520> this<00:02:09.640> ramp<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.390> don't<00:02:10.660> want<00:02:10.810> to

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
left side of this ramp you don't want to

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.630 
left side of this ramp you don't want to
go<00:02:10.990> on<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.140> right<00:02:11.290> side<00:02:11.590> over<00:02:11.860> there<00:02:12.040> that's

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
go on the right side over there that's

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.400 
go on the right side over there that's
just<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:13.000> death<00:02:13.270> trap<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.750> will<00:02:13.959> solve<00:02:14.260> this

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
just a death trap you will solve this

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.140 
just a death trap you will solve this
example<00:02:14.740> just<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.610> bottom<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.970> map

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
example just to the bottom of the map

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.050 
example just to the bottom of the map
anyway<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.010> really<00:02:18.010> not<00:02:18.190> worth<00:02:18.459> going<00:02:18.790> for

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
anyway so really not worth going for

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.720 
anyway so really not worth going for
that<00:02:19.209> one<00:02:19.420> so<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.860> basically<00:02:21.040> make<00:02:21.310> your<00:02:21.640> way

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
that one so you basically make your way

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.850 
that one so you basically make your way
over<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.209> right<00:02:22.390> side<00:02:22.600> once<00:02:22.990> you<00:02:23.110> down<00:02:23.320> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
over to the right side once you down the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.000 
over to the right side once you down the
left<00:02:24.040> ramp<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.870> most<00:02:26.410> people<00:02:26.770> know<00:02:26.950> this

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
left ramp and most people know this

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.890 
left ramp and most people know this
point<00:02:27.400> straight<00:02:27.640> away<00:02:27.910> but<00:02:27.940> for<00:02:28.390> those<00:02:28.840> who

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
will obviously most likely possibly

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.550
