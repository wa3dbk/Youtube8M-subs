00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.780 
they get all healthy it will I think
it's<00:01:43.330> way<00:01:43.570> too<00:01:43.630> early<00:01:43.840> right<00:01:44.350> now<00:01:44.740> to<00:01:44.800> say<00:01:45.580> that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
it's way too early right now to say that

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.960 
it's way too early right now to say that
what<00:01:46.690> they're<00:01:46.870> doing<00:01:47.170> there<00:01:47.320> is<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.470> failure

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
what they're doing there is a failure

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.180 
what they're doing there is a failure
right<00:01:48.970> now<00:01:49.150> it<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.390> I<00:01:49.810> think<00:01:50.620> later<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.070> will

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
right now it is I think later it will

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.030 
right now it is I think later it will
not<00:01:51.400> be<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.720> they<00:01:52.930> get<00:01:53.140> healthy<00:01:53.440> and<00:01:53.530> right<00:01:53.770> I

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
not be if they get healthy and right I

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.950 
not be if they get healthy and right I
don't<00:01:54.370> think<00:01:54.580> any<00:01:54.820> team<00:01:55.090> in<00:01:55.330> front<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:55.840> them

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
don't think any team in front of them

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.260 
don't think any team in front of them
will<00:01:56.500> want<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.770> see<00:01:56.920> them<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.310> playoffs<00:01:57.670> ya

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
will want to see them in the playoffs ya

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.060 
will want to see them in the playoffs ya
know<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.320> think<00:01:59.380> they<00:01:59.650> will<00:01:59.800> be<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.010> the

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
know and I think they will be in the

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.930 
know and I think they will be in the
playoffs<00:02:03.120> no<00:02:04.120> I<00:02:04.150> thought<00:02:04.860> honestly<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:06.640> think

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
playoffs no I thought honestly I think

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.850 
playoffs no I thought honestly I think
he<00:02:07.210> was<00:02:07.330> willing<00:02:07.480> to<00:02:07.630> do<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:07.990> this<00:02:08.320> year<00:02:08.380> here

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
he was willing to do that this year here

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.370 
he was willing to do that this year here
I<00:02:09.040> do<00:02:09.490> I<00:02:09.670> think<00:02:10.030> if<00:02:10.119> he<00:02:10.240> had<00:02:10.270> been<00:02:10.570> here<00:02:10.810> I<00:02:10.990> don't

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
I do I think if he had been here I don't

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.840 
I do I think if he had been here I don't
think<00:02:11.470> he<00:02:11.950> would<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.130> had<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> problem<00:02:12.580> with

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
think he would have had a problem with

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.120 
think he would have had a problem with
Paul<00:02:13.210> isn't<00:02:13.360> mature<00:02:13.540> guy<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> mean<00:02:14.740> he's<00:02:14.860> grown

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
Paul isn't mature guy I mean he's grown

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.470 
Paul isn't mature guy I mean he's grown
over<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.550> years<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.150> think<00:02:16.390> he

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
over the years and I think he

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.010 
over the years and I think he
understands<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.310> he<00:02:18.490> scores<00:02:18.850> by<00:02:19.750> playing

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
understands the way he scores by playing

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.720 
understands the way he scores by playing
less<00:02:20.260> minutes<00:02:20.650> probably<00:02:21.130> means<00:02:21.400> he<00:02:21.520> can<00:02:21.640> play

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
less minutes probably means he can play

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.330 
less minutes probably means he can play
about<00:02:21.940> four<00:02:22.180> or<00:02:22.209> five<00:02:22.300> more<00:02:22.630> years<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.310> he's<00:02:24.310> a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
about four or five more years so he's a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.920 
about four or five more years so he's a
basketball<00:02:24.670> player<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.360> probably<00:02:25.630> needs<00:02:25.870> to

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
basketball player and probably needs to

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.170 
basketball player and probably needs to
play
