 from your city where you want 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.720

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.720
 files that I will leave in the 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.730
 description of the video 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.360

 ss h 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.420
 once these files are inside 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.929
 of the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.929
 of the folder will not have to put 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 there is file 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.400
 with the dawn to enter 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.880
 [Music] 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.700
 the the route is 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.510
 diagonal mobile bar 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.510
 then he will enter documents and there 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.580
 will have the pro web installed and these 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.400
 files that you see there 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.880
 are the ones who will have to install 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.439
 good 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.719
 once installed they will have to once 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:27.579
 put into the live boot will have to 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:30.490
 enter each of these give and give 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.009
 On top of them 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.950
 and they're going to give him the installer and I do not 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:41.000
 I'm going to do it because I already did it 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.890
 then after this we will go 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.970
 until 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.110
 yes day 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:54.150
 let's go into his idea 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:58.380
 and we will search the web pro 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.410
 for this they will have to add the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.010
 next repository the repo the 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.320
 Format 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.320
 the iphone by ame puntocom 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.140
 I'm going to leave it two ways 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.490
 also in the link of the video so that 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.500
 add once you have it 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.560
 added now yes we're going to go to 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.560
 search for 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:28.220
 let's go find 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.220
 and there we are going to give the web pro 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.300
 and could use being the 4.0 6 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.100
 once they have it here they will give 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.100
 in installing 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.020
 and we give in confirm 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.400
 now we are going to wait for 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.480
 even if it is installed 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.540
 these errors because when I already 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.540
 I had already installed him 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.480
 the one of you the web pro why that 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.830
 is giving those errors 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.830
 we go back to syria 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.800
 we go out and we'll see if we'll have the 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.230
 ibook but once we have done 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.440
 all the steps we are going to enter the web 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.440
 pro 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.190
 and we 're going to go to the top 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:49.620
 right here where is the sign of 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.620
 left-right admiration sorry 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.950
 we give it there and we're going to activate 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.380
 application 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:02.560
 then they have to put s 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.420
 that code and we're going to give it in validate and 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.550
 sets 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.849
 and you have to look like this to have 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.310
 the validated application once you have 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:15.660
 we give ok 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.239
 and there will be sent to this window 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.910
 now yes you can this would be the 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.980
 connection my own connection seems that 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.650
 there is no connection closer but the 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.690
 way to work would be 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.690
 and give it over the connection 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:36.560
 and automatically the application we 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.129
 will start looking for this 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.959
 the password 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:44.580
 it tells me it's impossible to connect 

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:46.289
 because the handle is already connected 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.389
 the signal 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:52.889
 and well that would be all on my part 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.369
 If you have any questions about any question 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.330
 Any comment do not hesitate to ask me 

00:04:56.369 --> 00:05:02.169
 know and see you 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.169
 until next time
