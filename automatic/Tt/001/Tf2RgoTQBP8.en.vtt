00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.749 
we're going to have some holes we have
to<00:01:46.320> feel<00:01:46.500> we're<00:01:46.710> missing<00:01:47.040> some<00:01:47.250> veterans<00:01:47.610> but

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to feel we're missing some veterans but

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.760 
to feel we're missing some veterans but
i<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.689> team<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.350> capable

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
i think we have a team that is capable

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.130 
i think we have a team that is capable
of<00:01:50.189> winning<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:51.329> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.600> using<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.990> new

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
of winning we're going to be using a new

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.270 
of winning we're going to be using a new
playbook<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.799> year<00:01:52.979> it's<00:01:53.100> gonna<00:01:53.189> be

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
playbook this year it's gonna be

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.800 
playbook this year it's gonna be
interesting<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.030> how<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.360> turns<00:01:54.390> out

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
interesting to see how that turns out

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.780 
interesting to see how that turns out
it's<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.350> some<00:01:55.619> adjustment<00:01:56.399> period

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it's going to be some adjustment period

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.569 
it's going to be some adjustment period
for<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.119> but<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.140> overall<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.159> think

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
for that but you know overall I think

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.490 
for that but you know overall I think
this<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> team<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.450> capable<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.320> winning

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this is a team that's capable of winning

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.539 
this is a team that's capable of winning
and<00:02:02.149> whether<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.450> we<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:04.170> win<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.740> yet<00:02:05.399> to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
and whether or not we do win is yet to

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.880 
and whether or not we do win is yet to
be<00:02:05.579> seen<00:02:06.079> anything<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.200> happen<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.649> know

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
be seen anything can happen you know

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.320 
be seen anything can happen you know
we're<00:02:08.099> going<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.459> tough<00:02:08.580> road<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.239> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
we're going to have a tough road in the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.520 
we're going to have a tough road in the
playoffs<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.080> we're<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
playoffs you know we're going to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.320 
playoffs you know we're going to
probably<00:02:10.800> see<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.069> Broncos<00:02:11.670> again<00:02:11.970> that's<00:02:12.209> a

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
probably see the Broncos again that's a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.730 
probably see the Broncos again that's a
team<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.720> can<00:02:12.959> beat<00:02:12.989> us

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
team that can beat us

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.300 
team that can beat us
any<00:02:14.010> given<00:02:14.370> day<00:02:14.580> uh<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.780> 49ers<00:02:16.590> were<00:02:16.920> probably

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
any given day uh the 49ers were probably

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.580 
any given day uh the 49ers were probably
the<00:02:17.520> most<00:02:17.700> dominant<00:02:18.300> team<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:19.380> this

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the most dominant team that this

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.350 
the most dominant team that this
franchise<00:02:20.220> has<00:02:20.490> seen<00:02:20.820> throughout<00:02:21.180> this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
franchise has seen throughout this

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.010 
franchise has seen throughout this
entire<00:02:21.570> series<00:02:22.170> last<00:02:22.590> year<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.950> mean<00:02:23.190> they<00:02:23.460> were

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
entire series last year I mean they were

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.730 
entire series last year I mean they were
unbelievable<00:02:25.020> so<00:02:25.290> it's<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.650> be

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
unbelievable so it's going to be

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.260 
unbelievable so it's going to be
interesting<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.370> see<00:02:26.580> if<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.760> have<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.090> match

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270
