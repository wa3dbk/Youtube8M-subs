00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.469
 in general in osteopathy people 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.000
 call me mainly for 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 local engine problems ie 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.390
 worries encountered at work with the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.210
 horses 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.410
 when in fact we could expand 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.730
 much more the scope of application of 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.880
 osteopathy since we can intervene 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 also on visceral problems on 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.449
 all the problems actually since at 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 osteopathy we go the principle is a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.640
 little bit to restore the functioning 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.410
 of the organization including the functions 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.270
 immunity and all functions 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.649
 physiological hormonal regulation 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.570
 for example on judgments with 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.789
 water problems towards so in general the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.850
 reason it is a locomotor problem and at 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.340
 during the consultation will see that by 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 the bias of this locomotor problem we're going 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.030
 also go to detect others 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.760
 problematic and have an action 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.500
 much broader on the health of the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.080
 horse in general 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.090
 during a typical consultation I 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.489
 prefer to start by examining the horse 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 without having just collected the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.490
 commemorative horse history and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.870
 the reason for consultation 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.060
 just to have an eye 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.130
 we will say blank on the horse and do not 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.570
 not look for the answer to the problem in 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.940
 function of the consultation reason 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.400
 since to osteopathy the principle 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.560
 it's to do a global review and the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.030
 reason for consultation the problem for 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.120
 which I am called may be the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.530
 consequence of another problem that 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.450
 I would tend to recognize and 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.250
 tendency to a little more eluding 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.940
 if we focus solely on the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.940
 reason for consultation 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.450
 so in my review I included a 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.490
 dynamic locomotor examination relatively 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.340
 succinctly that is to say I look at the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.780
 horse walk in a straight line in 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.180
 out of the box went back and forth 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.430
 in a straight line trotting on the hard and I 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.430
 look at it in general on the odm circle 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.920
 another bone on hard ground so this 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.820
 examination is not essential for the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.080
 treatment is and practices 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.850
 since then for the treatment I 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.430
 will only consider my 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.780
 review not the patois re by cons it's 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.929
 interesting because it's going to bring me 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 diagnostic type information of a 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.290
 scoop of exclusion that is to say that 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.569
 certain musculoskeletal discomfort 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.760
 see on the circle is not online 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.560
 right are going to refer rather to 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.549
 foot problems or problems 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.709
 fittings etc 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.569
 some cases some anomalies 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.310
 locomotive that are quite visible 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.840
 before the exam disappear 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.250
 completely right after the exam 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.069
 so that's interesting too 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.690
 remove it and in other cases some 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.209
 anomalies the co mastery appear 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.560
 after the osteopathic treatment where 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.390
 are aggravated after treatment 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.970
 osteopathic and that gives us here too 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.239
 information since in some 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.190
 case the osteopathic lesion pattern of the 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.980
 horse settled to make up for a 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.299
 pain that is already present the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 horses lends itself very well to 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.690
 manipulations 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.700
 whatever the techniques we 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.700
 typically used during the 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.319
 consultation 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.790
 the horse is sometimes a little bit 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.200
 surprised at first we take it 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.580
 important to take a little bit of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.379
 time at the beginning of consultations that the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.849
 horse relax and understand this 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.709
 we're doing do just 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.690
 near all the manipulations without 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.450
 that they have big worries when there is 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.650
 quite painful lesions some 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.209
 fads can be a little bit 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.349
 uncomfortable for the horse so in 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.410
 these cases you have to take a little 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.760
 plus the time to work with a 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.280
 other technique actually we always 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.530
 different techniques to lift the 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.599
 same osteopathic disorder so in fact 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.540
 we invoke quotation marks we will discuss with 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:35.670
 the horse is found the technique or the 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.840
 manipulation that the horse accepts 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.730
 where there are problems it's on a 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.410
 try to come back in force and in 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.049
 general when the horse does not accept 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.400
 a technique or a mobilization is 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.420
 that she is painful and it is he who 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.340
 rightly it means that you have to find 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.910
 another gateway to get up 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.910
 this dysfunction
