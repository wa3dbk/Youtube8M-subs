 maximum for that reason do not fight against 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.040
 they managed to remove the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.050
 without the need to fight me in your 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 place would have used power but also 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 of the tournament if it had not helped the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.800
 team with my scores for access to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.050

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.370
 You showed your tenacity based on the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.129
 first round without doubt I was happy 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.809

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.939
 go to trust you for going to the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.979
 next round thanks to some who do not 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.540
 they wanted to kick you out, you 're your shark 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.820
 sinde 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.890
 it was clear that I am aware of 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.750
 but I appreciate that you are one of 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.790
 those who did not want to throw me alone 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.490
 try to commit to the team this 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.550
 clear time there is who he is, you can 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.150

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.980
 so is 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.110
 I never saw you reunited with the whole clan 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.670
 when it was the first round it's because 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.830
 some of the blue team wanted 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.080
 become independent in taking away the keys to 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.600
 the roque assistants others formed 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.820
 alliances for it in my case forces me 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.860
 with the mass of muscles here next to me and 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.500
 I ended up sharing a room with him 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.930
 I did not know you liked the big guy but 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.460
 quiet we do not judge he said 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.720
 I said no shared room 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.220
 it means that we do not have something between 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 we learn to listen and did not speak 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.740

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.050

 I will say that hello to all you must be if not 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.060
 I really wrong that same forgiveness 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.190
 without interrupting his talk but I have something 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.110
 announcing that I was in the room and 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.790
 I stumbled upon a disk that contains nothing else 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.400
 or nothing less than the information of the 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.730
 second round 20 fixed of what is 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.000
 written there 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.590
 you had to stop trolling fairies and 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.379

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.780
 instructions for the second round what 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.569
 is what we will see in the mansion 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.190
 of the bdh there is an infestation of rats that 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.709
 is invading all the floors 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.750
 especially the second floor that by 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.879
 true thanks to that happened to this 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.280
 round now they have access to the door 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.380
 to go up to the second floor but what 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.540
 you said that that door was 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.310
 assured as you expect us to go up 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.650
 second floor if you have not given us the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.540
 keys maybe my instinct tells me that 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.459

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.940

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.630
 message also maybe not lend 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.820
 I told you that it was a message 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.760
 recorded not a good video call 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.800
 Let's stop arguing and keep listening 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.750
 the video is over a minute ago it 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.540
 would have listened if they were not 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.580
 discussing Wednesday just tell us what 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.740
 is what we have to do a job 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.690
 simple we simply have to 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.820
 get rid of the rats that are by 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.340
 all the perfect mansion then 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.410
 we will use our powers that is not necessary 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.660
 take it lightly or enthusiastically 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.460
 colleague what he had mentioned that 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.500
 especially the plagues were 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.270
 located on the second floor what 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.340
 it means that you must see the place 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.920
 specific where all meet 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.750
 these Germans macario you and the troop 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.060
 exterminate the ffaa members of this 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.220
 western and latin floor I need you to 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.530
 accompany what you want to do 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.000
 we will go to the second floor to destroy the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.000
 origin of the plan board 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.980
 there are several doors on this floor 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.410
 we will have to separate and exterminate 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.420
 the rats one by one excellent idea 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.340
 but if there are problems with a plague 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.540
 then let's get together for 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.880
 fight them together it was clear follows 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.530
 go ahead boys demons what not 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.570
 you know is that there is someone who is 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.150
 controlling the rats and mice in the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.690
 mansion I will have to take care of the leader 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.690
 myself 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.789
 now things when failing 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.260

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:02.140

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.140
 forgotten that I have not had breakfast 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.140
 damn traps infamous plagues yes 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.630
 had a champion next to me could 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.150
 control these animals but I was 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.460
 something better happens the leader must be 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.570
 hiding but their lackeys can not 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.570
 resist this 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.350
 Y 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.450
 high of the fire something is attracting them 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.830
 to the second floor let's find out 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:51.170
 I have to contact the guys 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.810
 boys help me I have all the 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:57.340
 rodents in the backyard help me to 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.340
 destroy them once and for all 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.870
 the rats are inside the ice 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.870
 let's destroy 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:15.030
 and we have achieved what happened 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.220
 here we take care of eliminating 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.620
 to absolutely all the rats of the 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.560
 mansion I would not count on that still remains 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.080
 a survivor but where is it maybe 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.840
 be the culprit of all the disturbance not 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.430
 Worry I already took care of her 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.440
 We go with Roque to deliver the 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.860
 information on the total extermination of 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.860
 rats 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.680
 well at least I got revenge for the cut 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.740
 what the monkey did to me the first round 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.930
 but I should not underestimate this team me 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.390
 It cost an egg to ask a colleague 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.830
 contact with that mouse and to top 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.260
 becomes an ally of one of the 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.410
 participants and was able to avoid all 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:58.090
 traps that I put on the second floor 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.090
 I will have to think about new strategies 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.830
 so Roque I contract you so that 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.530
 you will use your rats and mice for 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.139
 round like that it is but we end up being 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.000
 defeated by you I would not say that if 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:13.430
 outside you the reactor to which you 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.889
 they will eliminate all the mice but 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.930
 now all are dead the challenge 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.419
 was to get rid of the mice 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.880
 and I got rid of them but not the 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:25.190
 I destroyed with them but if I saw that you and 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.169
 your friends destroyed them I made two 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:29.600
 ice prisons when I locked up the 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.430
 rodents one that was the lure that did not 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.770
 he had nothing inside him which 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.320
 we destroy my friends and me and another in 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.180
 where he kept the rats locked and 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.759
 I buried them in the same patio floor 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:44.599
 butt means that my people are 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:48.080
 alive so now you can take 

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:50.300
 the little ones thank you very much Mr. bonus 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.740
 I owe a lot to you, there's no reason 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.319
 We'll be in touch 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:59.030
 maybe I missed my breakfast but I'm dying 

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:59.030
 I want to see what's in the lunch
