00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:37.379 
split that off again and then that will

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.309 
split that off again and then that will
stop<00:04:37.620> charging<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.310> iphone<00:04:39.090> 5<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.990> take<00:04:40.169> it

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
through the microUSB cable connected so

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.209 
through the microUSB cable connected so
you<00:04:51.960> don't<00:04:52.169> need<00:04:52.259> to<00:04:52.319> keep<00:04:52.650> taking<00:04:52.979> it<00:04:53.069> in<00:04:53.189> and

that's the sort of thing that this case

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.999 
that's the sort of thing that this case
is<00:05:23.699> capable<00:05:24.180> capable<00:05:24.539> of<00:05:24.629> doing<00:05:25.710> in<00:05:25.800> case

you've got one of those ed phones that

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.510 
you've got one of those ed phones that
won't<00:05:28.050> fit<00:05:28.319> in<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.529> socket<00:05:29.039> below<00:05:29.250> there

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
won't fit in that socket below there

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.999 
won't fit in that socket below there
what<00:05:30.180> Murphy's<00:05:30.539> also<00:05:30.839> done<00:05:31.020> is<00:05:31.139> put<00:05:31.349> added

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
what Murphy's also done is put added

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.279 
what Murphy's also done is put added
this<00:05:32.159> extra<00:05:32.580> extension<00:05:32.930> cable<00:05:33.930> there<00:05:34.050> so<00:05:34.199> you

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
this extra extension cable there so you

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.230 
this extra extension cable there so you
can<00:05:34.440> actually<00:05:34.560> easily<00:05:35.129> fit<00:05:35.400> that<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:35.759> there

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
can actually easily fit that in there

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.939 
can actually easily fit that in there
and<00:05:36.419> then<00:05:36.839> you<00:05:36.930> can<00:05:37.080> plug<00:05:37.229> yours<00:05:37.529> into<00:05:37.770> that

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:37.949 
and then you can plug yours into that

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.010 
and then you can plug yours into that
area<00:05:38.099> there<00:05:38.310> that's<00:05:38.490> really<00:05:38.849> nice<00:05:39.210> addition

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
area there that's really nice addition

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.809 
area there that's really nice addition
to<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.199> packaging<00:05:40.770> because<00:05:40.860> that's<00:05:41.550> very

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
to the packaging because that's very

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.129 
to the packaging because that's very
important<00:05:42.300> because<00:05:42.330> I've<00:05:42.690> actually<00:05:42.750> got<00:05:43.110> a

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
important because I've actually got a

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.269 
important because I've actually got a
couple<00:05:43.289> of<00:05:43.409> their<00:05:43.529> phones<00:05:43.740> like<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.129> that

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:44.279 
couple of their phones like that that

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:46.129 
couple of their phones like that that
won't<00:05:44.400> fit<00:05:44.669> in<00:05:44.819> there<00:05:45.000> where<00:05:45.389> my<00:05:45.479> iphone<00:05:45.779> 5s

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
won't fit in there where my iphone 5s

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.709 
won't fit in there where my iphone 5s
are<00:05:46.289> tucked<00:05:46.560> into<00:05:46.770> this<00:05:47.009> case<00:05:47.219> nicely<00:05:47.759> so<00:05:48.060> if

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
are tucked into this case nicely so if

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:50.209 
are tucked into this case nicely so if
you<00:05:48.839> have<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:48.990> look<00:05:49.110> how<00:05:49.319> thin<00:05:49.620> it<00:05:49.710> is<00:05:49.740> it's<00:05:50.159> just

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
you have a look how thin it is it's just

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.519 
you have a look how thin it is it's just
adding<00:05:50.909> that<00:05:51.029> little<00:05:51.210> extra<00:05:51.479> bulb<00:05:51.900> there<00:05:52.199> it's

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
adding that little extra bulb there it's

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.589 
adding that little extra bulb there it's
not<00:05:52.680> a<00:05:52.740> lot<00:05:52.889> of<00:05:52.949> bulk<00:05:53.189> at<00:05:53.370> all<00:05:53.550> which<00:05:53.759> is<00:05:53.939> what

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
not a lot of bulk at all which is what

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:56.629 
not a lot of bulk at all which is what
you<00:05:54.689> need<00:05:54.839> really<00:05:55.139> for<00:05:55.199> the<00:05:55.349> iphone<00:05:55.620> 5<00:05:55.830> but

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
you need really for the iphone 5 but
