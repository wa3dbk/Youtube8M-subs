with<00:00:05.230> the<00:00:05.350> Y<00:00:05.529> a<00:00:05.560> manifold<00:00:07.500> modded<00:00:08.500> the<00:00:08.710> few<00:00:09.309> RL

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:09.519 
with the Y a manifold modded the few RL

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.049 
with the Y a manifold modded the few RL
is<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:11.110> DC<00:00:11.950> 16<00:00:12.940> y8<00:00:13.480> funeral<00:00:14.019> fuel<00:00:14.469> regulator<00:00:15.059> but

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
is a DC 16 y8 funeral fuel regulator but

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:27.720 
is a DC 16 y8 funeral fuel regulator but
the<00:00:16.179> return<00:00:16.509> system

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.490 

there's<00:00:28.179> no<00:00:28.300> big<00:00:28.509> reason<00:00:28.689> why<00:00:28.929> I<00:00:28.960> did<00:00:29.230> it<00:00:29.380> I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
there's no big reason why I did it I

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.980 
there's no big reason why I did it I
just<00:00:29.560> thought<00:00:29.890> it'd<00:00:30.039> be<00:00:30.160> better<00:00:30.310> for<00:00:30.400> tuning

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
just thought it'd be better for tuning

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.709 
just thought it'd be better for tuning
having<00:00:31.990> tuned<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.349> year<00:00:32.529> so<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.270> just<00:00:34.570> what

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
having tuned a year so this is just what

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.660 
having tuned a year so this is just what
I<00:00:34.750> did<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:37.540> show<00:00:37.720> you<00:00:37.809> how<00:00:37.899> the<00:00:37.960> sounds<00:00:38.670> there's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
I did to show you how the sounds there's

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.160 
I did to show you how the sounds there's
actually<00:00:40.090> a<00:00:40.120> k20<00:00:40.920> throttle<00:00:41.920> throttle<00:00:42.730> body

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
actually a k20 throttle throttle body

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.410 
actually a k20 throttle throttle body
modded<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.290> to<00:00:44.409> fit<00:00:44.559> my<00:00:44.589> car<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:45.970> manifold

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
modded it to fit my car and the manifold

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.280 
modded it to fit my car and the manifold
I<00:00:47.640> got<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.879> four<00:00:49.360> two<00:00:49.480> two<00:00:49.659> two<00:00:49.780> one<00:00:49.930> headers

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
I got the four two two two one headers

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.290 
I got the four two two two one headers
raised<00:00:50.530> headers<00:00:51.390> no<00:00:52.390> AC<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:55.030> going<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.210> show

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
raised headers no AC I'm going to show

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.029 
raised headers no AC I'm going to show
you<00:00:55.329> how<00:00:55.570> we<00:00:55.839> take<00:00:55.870> sounds<00:00:57.420> all<00:00:58.420> right

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:09.140 

oh<00:01:05.150> now<00:01:06.150> they<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.600> state<00:01:06.869> two<00:01:07.110> camps<00:01:08.150> stage

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
oh now they have state two camps stage

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.510 
oh now they have state two camps stage
one<00:01:09.390> valves<00:01:09.869> about<00:01:10.560> dolphins<00:01:12.409> and<00:01:13.409> stage<00:01:14.220> 1

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
one valves about dolphins and stage 1

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
one valves about dolphins and stage 1
clutch<00:01:15.409> insert<00:01:16.409> motor<00:01:16.619> mounts<00:01:18.289> that's<00:01:19.289> about

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
clutch insert motor mounts that's about

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:50.389 
clutch insert motor mounts that's about
at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.479> all<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.750> my<00:01:30.869> car<00:01:31.080> looks<00:01:31.320> like

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:02:01.440 

rather<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.329> didn't

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:03:04.380 

oh
