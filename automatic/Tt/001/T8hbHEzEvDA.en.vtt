00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.970
 So language for speaking Toka very much is It is this language culture Toka that it is such a story 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.870
 Such an overall idea of ​​what would happen if you think that symbolically 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:17.699
 What Te Masu' I would like Well continue to kind of talk of English Toka Japanese for language 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 In question is can the say whether I thought what to talk went this way or that this kind of study 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.690
 not to mention 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.260
 I went to bed 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.640
 The first place the English What I mean to say, if what kind of image of that learning English 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.290
 If you don't learn la, you will get such simple questions depending on what the country is like. 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.670
 I 'm from an exam student 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.380
 Among the Taso I was doing the program with the program university entrance exam guidance to teach my exam now 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.680
 Since the students came questions 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.770
 Anyway and let with its share to publish Well videos videos from it is it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.580
 If I try to make a video by saying that I would have been looking at various things if there was an answer 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.450
 It is a story 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.860
 First of all, what does the manuscript mean? What does Marge Formal know? 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.660
 To talk 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.870
 The language is just Japanese There is no Japanese There is Japanese Japanese So let's hide the letters today 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.700
 If there beneath Japanese and English Gatten 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:04.300
 I wondered what I knew when I learned these things 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.130
 From the language here to the difference in that culture 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.420
 You can see the conversation, it's a cultural difference 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.230
 In it Hurst Japan language is, for example, 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.600
 For example, say water 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:23.380
 There are a and add your hot water Neato is located in the Tteyuu ice as something similar 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:28.090
 Say something and say this in one word and the Well h Tsuona not it's h 2 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:34.250
 It is not said that this state change of h 2 o gives such names to Japanese people. 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.310
 And when the water thinking the story Tteyuu of I, but happens when say You're So in English this 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.310
 Say 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:44.960
 Well when I said that smell is in English, but here the partition now divided into three in Japanese 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.950
 Have you, but this it is is this is p reportedly because here the other error 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.070
 But I was ice in the fact that orphans ice by I mean Tsu border book error 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.700
 It was such a feeling, but listening number male is stupid 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:00.659
 First of all, the hot water is watery and utilitarian 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.409
 I divided it by this temperature when I was the name of it and I do n't care too much about it 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.530
 Right 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.679
 Here it is as Korya different thing answer in the place called ice 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.610
 Well in and divided by this answer and liquid 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.030
 But here is over a period of a little ear is divided in temperature did not come head or rather dough 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.870
 Or 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.690
 Attention is paid to say you are open at what this temperature as the Japanese say this water 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.140
 More 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.140
 Temperature This is not the same temperature 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.930
 In English, with the water 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:34.710
 In short So you Tteyuu eye scan is probably because say whether this liquid or solid 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:40.210
 I would like to share it or I would share it with the love of liquid like this 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:44.900
 If you learn the manuscript and how do you try our language, there is something like this in the first place 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:49.280
 There are many things and I have named the words as symbols for them 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:52.819
 This is to say the Tteyuu symbol but is this symbol biological idea is 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.540
 I always say that the different people it is also a look at, for example, about the same thing only, but for example, even I 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.430
 dirty 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:04.350
 Seeing such a picture, there is a certain person, this of this child 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:08.640
 But now what do amazing strange feeling I wrote with the intention of all northern dogs at the time that saw this 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:11.820
 As referred to in English I can not be a little imagination I do not know well something I is other people 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 This I am I feel it 's not You're dock made Dokke 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:21.660
 First of all, I think it looks like a foreign language as a good general 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.370
 And it all the Tteyuu foreign language learning is likely if Toka is the first place English to say I learn English 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.989
 But it is important to learn good language as it is new 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.890
 If you do not too do not follow the sign 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.890
 But I was talking about say 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:37.950
 Well but English it would be Japan language, but there are a variety of languages in France word that all over the world 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:43.870
 In a word, it may be just that it is different from using simply 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.400
 But I was talking about that different from any Anou to be used is different 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.379
 so 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.640
 Japanese translators will certainly be after the foreign air, but after all this clause will be divided 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.590
 But it is different 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.970
 I say that I will talk about it just before 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.810
 It is when there is a hot water there is if there is water ice 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.709
 In some countries, there is a possibility that the exchange is further subdivided 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.000
 Also, in some countries it is here like municipal water, so it's here and there 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:15.580
 Well and to do things such as to understand the cultural differences from something like that or the language 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.870
 While thinking does it say that the real thrill Oh it went so for learning 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:23.220
 The world is quite interesting, so when you learn English, you will learn Japanese 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:28.530
 For example Brother used as examples in operation 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.600
 The pillar is this time, and this is when I say that therapy means both brother and brother 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.169
 I think I said that I thought it was this 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.520
 In short, I'm older brother also be a Brother brother 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.569
 What do with this kind of thing in America where You're saying when you say that it would be Anande 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.680
 That's why 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:48.080
 It seems like American culture age doesn't understand that kind of thing, it's kind of like creation 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.490
 On the other hand in or Toka cancer when you thought the kana to softly of worry about the Japanese people, said: 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.490
 For example, year deduction 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.190
 Seniority thinking should be older at night 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.550
 I am getting old 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:01.210
 In talking with Did was doing me great like a rank and 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.980
 The difference also circular type of difference is it the language and culture of a certain say cultural symbol 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.380
 It is how to eat 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:10.440
 Think of it or something like Kel 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:14.250
 The second and in the first place say that science 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:17.230
 Now that I talked about science, I jumped, but after all this is not science or science 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.370
 Basically speaking by saying 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.360
 It has been progressing that this reproducer's wife is this hashish scissors 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.760
 Hey 2 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:32.800
 It is an English meaning of end or scissors but this is this science 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:37.220
 When the say vegetable garden number and scissors are basically here etymology go chopped the door'm together 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:41.660
 Chop is it is it if there is a natural thing to say things naturally become Ya 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:46.120
 'Cause saying I dumplings child's sputum is Toka is a punishment boot 3 from there if there is a natural 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:51.400
 It seems that it is a science of science 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:56.020
 The mechanics of quantum mechanics, etc. bump The bird's eye view. Thermodynamics, various biology etc. 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:06:00.160
 Basically, Kell is divided into various types of learning 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:04.960
 Is short Well say I do it, but can be seen in the foundation in any place Kubo 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:09.310
 It is understandable to divide it, so it is good to divide it like this even when you are troubled with its study 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.289
 How is not known is what it is people English that what that said they do not know do not know English 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.129
 It's to understand separately from the Tteyuu would do 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.009
 For example , if it is English, it will be divided after the turn and do not understand the word 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:20.930
 Idioms are in the hall 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.469
 No I do not know the pronunciation and not of whether space-time language is not the one also which is also open among the coral know 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.190
 Or 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:28.060
 Pronunciation accent 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:32.100
 See you in the first place alphabet cart is to Fu said that what do not know the spell 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:35.580
 When it is not understood by this, it is alphabet when thinking separately 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.250
 Well, I think it's important to think separately to think like, but what a story 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:44.330
 It's like this is because to have bought and are elements reggae child 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:49.009
 I have seen many talks with only one eye, but I can see it because it is amazing 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:53.360
 In the first place, it is this kind of thing to learn while thinking with your own mind variously 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:56.360
 It's usually different after studying if you 're going to study it while it's normal. 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.380
 Nde I do not care of Tteyuu the academically to your discretion or 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.340
 eh 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:05.930
 That's why people who study for the university entrance exams such research after entering the university 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:09.680
 Then the Toka or the era Histological study Toka or try to question the teacher receives a lesson 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:13.730
 In fact, if anything as a new theory it is of such Neka not it incenses 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:17.030
 That sort of thing Well the university for having said that might also be talked about 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.370
 I enjoy studying If you believe that the First saying that enjoy from entering 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.930
 That 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:27.009
 This is a story about what the English work collection was in the first place in English 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:29.979
 I jumped to something a little bit different from the story, but I want to be more than 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:32.139
 Subscribe Please look by all means is raising the other videos also thank you also 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:36.729
 Rice in detail on whether you are riding would take consultation 

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:39.020
 Video description sentence It is variously written in the description sentence The video description sentence is the lower part of this video 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:42.470
 Although I think that there probably 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:45.190
 Answer Thank you for watching that I would like to end by seeing Chira 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.190
