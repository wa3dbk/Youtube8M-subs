so I just switched over my service from
the<00:00:43.460> Moto<00:00:43.670> e<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.239> I<00:00:44.840> was<00:00:44.989> using<00:00:45.460> the<00:00:46.540> sharp

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
the Moto e and I was using the sharp

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.319 
the Moto e and I was using the sharp
aquos<00:00:47.720> crystal<00:00:48.610> last<00:00:49.610> night<00:00:49.850> and<00:00:50.030> I<00:00:50.059> switched

aquos crystal last night and I switched

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.270 
aquos crystal last night and I switched
it<00:00:50.540> over<00:00:50.660> to<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.140> LG<00:00:51.470> vault<00:00:51.769> running<00:00:52.449> cm12<00:00:53.449> and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
it over to the LG vault running cm12 and

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.689 
it over to the LG vault running cm12 and
although<00:00:55.280> camera<00:00:55.879> doesn't<00:00:56.300> work<00:00:56.329> I<00:00:57.430> am<00:00:58.430> like

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
although camera doesn't work I am like

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.119 
although camera doesn't work I am like
going<00:00:59.180> through<00:00:59.210> like<00:00:59.629> so<00:00:59.989> many<00:01:00.260> brainstorming

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
going through like so many brainstorming

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.540 
going through like so many brainstorming
I<00:01:01.309> like<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:01.850> brainstorming<00:01:02.390> ideas<00:01:03.550> trying

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
I like this brainstorming ideas trying

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.430 
I like this brainstorming ideas trying
to<00:01:04.670> see<00:01:04.850> if<00:01:04.970> certain<00:01:05.239> camera<00:01:05.840> applications

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
to see if certain camera applications

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.620 
to see if certain camera applications
will<00:01:06.649> work<00:01:06.920> kind<00:01:07.700> of<00:01:07.759> racking<00:01:08.090> my<00:01:08.119> brain<00:01:08.420> out

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
will work kind of racking my brain out

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.969 
will work kind of racking my brain out
but<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:08.990> thought<00:01:09.259> I'd<00:01:09.350> take<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.500> moment<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:11.979> take

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
but I thought I'd take a moment to take

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.120 
but I thought I'd take a moment to take
a<00:01:13.009> break<00:01:13.250> for<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.550> second<00:01:14.000> before<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.740> fry<00:01:15.740> out<00:01:15.920> my

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
a break for a second before I fry out my

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.310 
a break for a second before I fry out my
brain<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.700> show<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.660> guys<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.840> couple<00:01:18.110> of

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
brain and show you guys a couple of

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.990 
brain and show you guys a couple of
things<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.149> right<00:01:20.149> now<00:01:20.179> um<00:01:20.690> I<00:01:21.110> think<00:01:21.850> see<00:01:22.850> if<00:01:22.940> I

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
things so right now um I think see if I

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.570 
things so right now um I think see if I
can<00:01:23.179> lower<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.479> brightness<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:24.229> then<00:01:24.580> maybe

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
can lower the brightness and then maybe

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.870 
can lower the brightness and then maybe
you<00:01:25.729> guys<00:01:25.820> will<00:01:25.970> be<00:01:26.030> able<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:26.270> see<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.479> but<00:01:27.880> LTE

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
you guys will be able to see it but LTE

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.779 
you guys will be able to see it but LTE
is<00:01:29.560> working<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:32.320> i<00:01:33.320> do<00:01:33.380> have<00:01:33.619> LTE<00:01:33.860> right<00:01:34.310> now<00:01:34.460> on

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
is working so i do have LTE right now on

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.749 
is working so i do have LTE right now on
the<00:01:35.090> LG<00:01:35.390> vault<00:01:35.660> um<00:01:36.440> it<00:01:37.039> kind<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.369> goes<00:01:37.520> it

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
the LG vault um it kind of goes it

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.140 
the LG vault um it kind of goes it
announced<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.119> little<00:01:38.300> buggy<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:40.220> i'm<00:01:40.939> probably

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
announced a little buggy so i'm probably

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.580 
announced a little buggy so i'm probably
going<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.450> flash<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.110> zv5<00:01:43.299> radio<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:44.600> then

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
going to flash the zv5 radio and then

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.480 
going to flash the zv5 radio and then
reflash<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.490> boost<00:01:47.119> APN<00:01:47.720> settings<00:01:48.140> and<00:01:48.500> maybe

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
reflash the boost APN settings and maybe

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.230 
reflash the boost APN settings and maybe
that<00:01:49.670> should<00:01:49.790> fix<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.799> I<00:01:51.799> don't<00:01:52.310> know<00:01:52.399> it's

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
that should fix that I don't know it's

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.120 
that should fix that I don't know it's
just<00:01:53.420> been<00:01:53.630> really<00:01:53.750> kind<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.110> tough<00:01:54.320> only

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
just been really kind of tough only

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.410 
just been really kind of tough only

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
because it's like a gamble which LG
