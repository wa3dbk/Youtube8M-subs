Aspen and the Hyatts

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.520 
Aspen and the Hyatts
I<00:04:50.410> guess<00:04:51.160> they<00:04:51.340> got<00:04:51.370> into<00:04:51.699> some<00:04:51.729> big<00:04:52.090> war<00:04:52.530> they

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
I guess they got into some big war they

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.240 
I guess they got into some big war they
fought<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:55.150> Hyatts<00:04:55.479> won<00:04:55.949> everyone<00:04:56.949> says

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
fought and the Hyatts won everyone says

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.360 
fought and the Hyatts won everyone says
it<00:04:57.430> wasn't<00:04:57.580> there<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:57.940> they<00:04:58.270> cheated<00:04:59.370> but

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
it wasn't there that they cheated but

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.610 
it wasn't there that they cheated but
they<00:05:01.139> they<00:05:02.139> were<00:05:02.260> never<00:05:02.410> good<00:05:02.710> people<00:05:04.620> they

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
