00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 very good to all bolton handsome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.509
 is that you want not to catch me every day and 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.639
 is here as you are seeing with the 9 pm 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.559
 thermal sight and extended chargers 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.690
 I'm playing in warfare 3 many me 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.940
 ask warfare 3 and also will pass this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 tomorrow he started looking for the target 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.690
 this if I said but where is it if it is 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.820
 that I do not find it then good at 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.189
 ends up finding was below 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.560
 a sleeve of the computer case but 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.029
 Well the truth is that yesterday I was 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.619
 good doing streaming -is or not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.330
 streaming live but in 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.189
 deferred you know it 's good I've 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.559
 rendering and life has treated me 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.980
 now I will tell you a couple of little things but 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.989
 good 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.000
 first of all I'll tell you a tad 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.040
 of the game you will be seeing a 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.559
 double moral fail I do nothing else 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 start a streak of 24 and with this weapon 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.050
 and then they kill me and I get a streak of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.530
 37 plus 5 sheets that I make with total love 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 from 66 casualties to 1 or a game that I 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.960
 very good 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.239
 apart from that with this weapon it is not 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.460
 nothing good and besides I was playing alone 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.980
 It is not, although many of you like it 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.019
 as long as alone and that so here 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.360
 you have it has taken me this morning 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.340
 and well I had already thought 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.650
 rather we think of Carmona alone but 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.420
 well I got the first streak and then 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.550
 I saw that well, I could continue 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.800
 trying the other streaks to get me out 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.560
 see if I would get the double and good 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.030
 it would end up being worth it, it is known that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.910
 has called something because even to the first 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.680
 streak but I can not do anything what 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.740
 you'll see later the first one is pretty 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.930
 quick you cut a piece in which good 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.880
 I think that the streak 17 or something like that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.490
 I had enough nerves because I did not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.380
 I had no bones and as you are seeing 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.690
 this fund in the extreme and in the extreme 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.070
 you get caught and you're given a couple 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.470
 of shots because you're practically dead 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.030
 then the bad but not good this weapon 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.910
 I do not recommend it to you at all 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.619
 I simply wanted to make a challenge of 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.780
 get me out of the water with this gun that does not 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.119
 had had I arrived trying in 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.950
 streaming well I'm not going to tell you 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.990
 if it was given to me, it did not work out but what 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.509
 you will see already when you upload it so good 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.450
 I guess I'll upload tomorrow are 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.640
 one hour 50 minutes and there are a few 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.070
 headings in the results plan 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.320
 enough games that I stay then with 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.580
 90 80 drops something like that so it's 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.490
 fairly good 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.620
 some cooler so I recommend you 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.570
 that over the entire first game is 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.280
 awesome I did not believe myself like in the 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.900
 first necessary game of that so 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.780
 well I will not reveal more things 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.040
 but hey, I just want that good 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.990
 in the there is festival and in that I will go up 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.360
 tomorrow I'll let it go up tonight 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.250
 I imagine tomorrow you will have it 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.660
 I would like very much that you will value it and 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.750
 especially because it's not a streaming of 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.310
 this one that good you get you make your two 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.510
 shores' your hour and a half or something like that 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.280
 doing the streaming is already good 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.600
 attentive this moment I think it is 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.640
 just when they're going to kill me one of the 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.050
 what I'm seeing is the shooting and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.170
 I get another one out of nowhere and it kills me 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.930
 you watching 24-1 and how does he carry killer 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.320
 because good hard line in this in this 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.060
 Star game mode does not come to you 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.220
 very good because you will not do many 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.530
 assists you will not hit a shot 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.330
 just one bullet and then you're going to give 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.640
 an assistance so take away but 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.650
 simply because if it threw clouds and 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.270
 all that moved so good as 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.390
 you will be seeing this is the streak of 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.040
 second of the second and good not of the 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.989
 second more but of the first good yes 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.350
 say it the first one that already has 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.960
 really taken 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.420
 what I would like especially that what 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.770
 we will value when I upload it because 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.330
 it's a streaming of this is that you get 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.100
 an hour and a half that is streaming 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.770
 then you leave it summarized and good in 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.390
 barely 30 minutes you already have it there for 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.680
 your followers and all that 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.420
 this is a streaming that costs me 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.950
 a lot more because I 've had it 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.060
 do then I have to put it together you do not 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.680
 that does not take me anything 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.360
 then they take me because it has taken me 13 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.300
 hours in the center or is it a 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.610
 a lot but to go up then nothing 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.010
 something like that, no, that's about 13 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.140
 14 hours so good is one thing that 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.450
 I take a lot of time if I see that what 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.400
 you recognize quite and you give him mostly 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.680
 Many I like if that surely 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.270
 make more livestream is one of those because the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.370
 I really liked it, they came out 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.010
 some pretty good things to be the 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.200
 first time then I did not play warfare 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.030
 3 for quite some time there was no 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.740
 no preparatory game simply 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.230
 we put them in a group with the 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.210
 that there was out there and we put them up 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.370
 split as you will be seeing as there is a 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.750
 boy who was not playing I think 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.730
 that also had a double command and the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.889
 I command double and he played but he did not like that 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.960
 how good is something strange but one 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.939
 He killed me several times so forgive me for 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.460
 that's not something that I determine but 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.349
 whenever you find there is still no 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.909
 command that is playing well you are going to 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.819
 take advantage of killing him not the most 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:35.620
 possible so good is something that good 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.289
 I can not determine and I was annoyed 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.729
 Tiny because in truth who gives us 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.770
 one that does not play well let's take advantage 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.629
 and so we get the mom easily 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.060
 but he was also shaking hands 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:48.430
 of the dead already an incredible saved and 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.020
 good livestream and tomorrow as I have 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.969
 commented I would like especially that what 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.590
 you will see what if all that cherish those 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:54.909
 do not have much time for them 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.699
 I recommend that you go alone in the 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:59.409
 first game because it's amazing that 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.029
 well, it's just 15 minutes something like that or 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.129
 10 minutes so well that's for sure 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.629
 you have time to see it all but as 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.439
 you are watching first 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:11.680
 m9 the muffler will not stay cool 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.599
 and thermal a weapon that has told us that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.279
 we recommend but good and I wanted 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.379
 get me out of this challenge and I told you that 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:20.129
 let streaming, you'll see what he tried 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.469
 also get me the wet with this weapon 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:25.259
 and good if you also want the management of 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:26.849
 data type games then save two or 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.319
 three and others because you can also 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.409
 to say I have enough to place 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.209
 saved and with it white two because the 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:35.369
 It really has annoyed me that I'm already 

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:37.679
 trying alhama with the good nuclear 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:39.719
 that I am bundled between nuclear inbox and 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:41.369
 I'll try the nuclear with the five seven 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.959
 As you already know, it was the only clue 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:44.819
 I have left to finish, we're going with 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:48.059
 all guns and well they killed me 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.469
 once to one of love the nuclear and other 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.029
 I was killed nine times the next 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.679
 departure so good that of 9 either 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.749
 I'm going to tell a lot but good the other 

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:56.699
 is that it really bothered me like that 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:59.580
 that's good so I do not know if you want 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:03.149
 keep trying to get me out and the nuclear 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.529
 with the 5.7 with what you see or if you want 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:06.689
 to raise the a freire and already when the 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.009
 have then build from the other one 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:10.229
 you can put with for comments 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.759
 As you are seeing, I only had one 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:13.529
 for the water I did not want to play 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:15.869
 more already said well they are there 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:17.339
 reappearing the baby background and with 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:20.039
 This weapon is from afar as you are 

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:21.719
 seeing as it will pretty but 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:24.149
 end up killing that there you have the 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.740
 moa now I keep killing I do not commit suicide 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:26.610
 to try the next one and a triple 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.319
 with this weapon 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.469
 it would be amazing but I keep winning 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:35.879
 it is a streak of 37 seems to me shot 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:38.310
 the most to take it out for good because I do not 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:39.900
 I wanted to get more more I did not care 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.639
 If you are an enemy, what you wanted rises 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.469
 was that the game was over and if 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:48.000
 finished then one better then still 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:50.699
 but the truth 66 low five like apis 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.199
 61 with the gun I think they're pretty 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.270
 incredible and leave me your 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.830
 recognition because many of you tell me 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.389
 that did not raise incredible matches like that 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.069
 that good here's one that I think I 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:01.199
 which is quite incredible, I told you 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.449
 I have saved as well the moa 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.849
 double without recharging that is so I 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:08.310
 he got it pretty good, they do not kill me 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:10.020
 of the mill, so it's good to attract 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.060
 between poquillo then continue to attract that 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.430
 instead of white two because I already have 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.650
 the nuclear ones with all the 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:19.169
 light machine guns and good of 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.849
 streaming things like that and not good 

00:07:19.169 --> 00:07:22.770

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:24.300
 thank you very much especially for the 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.560
 recognition that yesterday's video had 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.590
 I did not expect 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.210
 So we had more than 1,600 comments 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.810

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.110

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:36.510

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.220
 when I already follow and that has more time 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.440

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.630
