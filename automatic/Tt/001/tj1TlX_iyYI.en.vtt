okay<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:01.319> just<00:00:01.350> to<00:00:01.709> explain<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.129> central

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
okay so just to explain the central

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.910 
okay so just to explain the central
locking<00:00:02.760> system<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.259> caster<00:00:04.890> right

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
locking system this is the caster right

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.039 
locking system this is the caster right
here<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.180> tell<00:00:06.390> it's<00:00:06.600> got<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.810> little

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
here you can tell it's got a little

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.589 
here you can tell it's got a little
power<00:00:07.379> with<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> camshaft<00:00:08.189> here<00:00:08.849> so<00:00:09.120> when<00:00:09.450> we

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
power with the camshaft here so when we

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.540 
power with the camshaft here so when we
rotate<00:00:10.080> this<00:00:10.349> part<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.920> don't<00:00:11.160> know<00:00:11.219> if<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.370> can

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
rotate this part I don't know if you can

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.120 
rotate this part I don't know if you can
see<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.880> but<00:00:12.179> when<00:00:12.360> we<00:00:12.389> rotate<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.110> part<00:00:13.410> it

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
see it but when we rotate this part it

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.880 
see it but when we rotate this part it
has<00:00:14.309> an<00:00:14.490> effect<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.350> this<00:00:16.350> part<00:00:16.680> here<00:00:16.859> that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
has an effect on this part here that

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.590 
has an effect on this part here that
comes<00:00:17.220> down<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.730> wheel<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.240> swivel

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
comes down on the wheel and the swivel

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.500 
comes down on the wheel and the swivel
head<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> also<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:21.300> also<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.930> that<00:00:22.230> memory

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
head so also we also out of that memory

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.410 
head so also we also out of that memory
this<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.720> dead<00:00:24.990> man<00:00:25.019> break<00:00:25.439> caster<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.420> it

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
this is a dead man break caster and it

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.509 
this is a dead man break caster and it
consists<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.170> lever<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
consists of this lever here and the

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.730 
consists of this lever here and the
entire<00:00:29.880> drum<00:00:30.330> brake<00:00:30.539> system<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.140> inside<00:00:31.560> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
entire drum brake system is inside the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.740 
entire drum brake system is inside the
cast<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:33.090> wheel<00:00:33.300> doesn't

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
cast or so right now this wheel doesn't

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.799 
cast or so right now this wheel doesn't
turn<00:00:33.960> at<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.520> so<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.850> relieve<00:00:36.239> pressure<00:00:36.540> if

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
turn at all so if we relieve pressure if

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.360 
turn at all so if we relieve pressure if
we<00:00:36.899> apply<00:00:37.200> pressure<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.950> relieves<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
we apply pressure here it relieves the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.920 
we apply pressure here it relieves the
drum<00:00:38.640> brake<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> wheels<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.690> turn

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
drum brake and then the wheels can turn

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.840 
drum brake and then the wheels can turn
so<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> better<00:00:41.219> explain<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:44.460> built<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so to better explain this you built a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.380 
so to better explain this you built a
cart<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.440> on<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.680> same<00:00:46.890> cart<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
cart and on this same cart we have a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
cart and on this same cart we have a
dead<00:00:48.690> man<00:00:48.899> brake<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.379> stir<00:00:49.649> here<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.399> are

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
dead man brake a stir here that are

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.060 
dead man brake a stir here that are
linked<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:50.879> cables<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
linked with cables and you can see the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.250 
linked with cables and you can see the
lever<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:57.120> what<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.390> apply<00:00:57.660> pressure<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
lever here so what we apply pressure the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.680 
lever here so what we apply pressure the
lever<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.739> move<00:00:59.090> relieve<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> drum<00:01:00.449> break

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
lever will move relieve the drum break

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.420 
lever will move relieve the drum break
and<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> wheel<00:01:01.320> turns<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> wheel

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and the wheel turns right now the wheel

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.080 
and the wheel turns right now the wheel
is<00:01:02.640> locked<00:01:02.870> on<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> other<00:01:05.460> end<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> cart

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
is locked on the other end of the cart

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.710 
is locked on the other end of the cart
we<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> central<00:01:06.900> locking<00:01:07.350> caster<00:01:08.720> it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
we have a central locking caster it's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
we have a central locking caster it's
exactly<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> same<00:01:10.530> cast<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.189> showed<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
exactly the same cast as we showed you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.780 
exactly the same cast as we showed you
earlier<00:01:12.260> right<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> wheel<00:01:13.979> swivels<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
earlier right now the wheel swivels and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
earlier right now the wheel swivels and
the<00:01:15.210> wheel<00:01:15.840> turns<00:01:16.140> freely<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> caster

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
the wheel turns freely and the caster

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.060 
the wheel turns freely and the caster
swivels<00:01:17.700> freely<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.240> well<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.830> apply

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
swivels freely as well if we apply

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.719 
swivels freely as well if we apply
pressure<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:21.020> braking<00:01:22.020> lever<00:01:22.520> it<00:01:23.520> has<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
pressure on this braking lever it has a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.390 
pressure on this braking lever it has a
rotational<00:01:24.479> lift<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.840> effect<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.680> will

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
rotational lift that effect that will

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
rotational lift that effect that will
lock<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> caster<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.509> I'll<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.869> ahead<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
lock the caster so I'll go ahead and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.350 
lock the caster so I'll go ahead and
push<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.590> lever

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.630 

so<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.020> can<00:01:33.290> see<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.680> as<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:33.860> apply<00:01:34.280> pressure

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
so you can see that as I apply pressure

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.680 
so you can see that as I apply pressure
on<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:35.750> brake<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.590> terms<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.130> cam<00:01:37.370> which<00:01:38.360> locks

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
on the brake it terms a cam which locks

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.420 
on the brake it terms a cam which locks
the<00:01:38.900> swivel<00:01:39.260> head<00:01:39.410> and<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.250> wheel

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
the swivel head and the wheel

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.360 
the swivel head and the wheel
efficiently<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.780> does<00:01:41.990> that<00:01:42.020> on<00:01:42.440> both

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
efficiently but it does that on both

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.910 
efficiently but it does that on both
casters<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:46.310> better<00:01:46.550> show<00:01:46.820> you<00:01:47.740> will<00:01:48.740> put

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
casters so to better show you will put

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.000 
casters so to better show you will put
the<00:01:49.070> cart<00:01:49.340> straight<00:01:52.900> so<00:01:53.900> right<00:01:54.110> now<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.740> den

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
the cart straight so right now the den

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.010 
the cart straight so right now the den
manray<00:01:55.400> casters<00:01:55.970> a<00:01:56.000> lot<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:56.510> cart<00:01:56.840> for

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
manray casters a lot this cart for

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.440 
manray casters a lot this cart for
moving<00:01:57.290> so<00:01:58.190> if<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:58.460> want<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.790> release<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.120> drum

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
moving so if I want to release a drum

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.810 
moving so if I want to release a drum
brace<00:01:59.690> I<00:01:59.900> applied<00:02:00.260> pressure<00:02:00.560> here<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:01.220> the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
brace I applied pressure here on the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.270 
brace I applied pressure here on the
handle<00:02:02.180> which<00:02:02.410> has<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.650> effect<00:02:04.010> on<00:02:04.160> those

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
handle which has that effect on those

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.070 
handle which has that effect on those
levers<00:02:04.550> we<00:02:04.820> saw<00:02:05.030> earlier<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.510> now<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.660> can<00:02:05.960> move

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
levers we saw earlier and now I can move
