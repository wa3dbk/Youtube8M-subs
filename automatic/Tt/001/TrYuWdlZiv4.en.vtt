pretty<00:00:30.420> insane<00:00:30.570> i<00:00:30.990> don't<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:31.949> i<00:00:32.009> could<00:00:32.099> do

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
pretty insane i don't think i could do

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.470 
pretty insane i don't think i could do
this<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.669> honest<00:00:32.910> i<00:00:32.969> haven't<00:00:33.120> even<00:00:33.239> tried

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
this to be honest i haven't even tried

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.319 
this to be honest i haven't even tried
soloing<00:00:34.020> crotas<00:00:34.380> end<00:00:34.559> yet<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.700> that's

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
soloing crotas end yet but that that's

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.069 
soloing crotas end yet but that that's
just<00:00:36.780> insane<00:00:37.200> on<00:00:38.450> pretty<00:00:39.450> much<00:00:39.540> his<00:00:39.719> weapons

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
just insane on pretty much his weapons

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
just insane on pretty much his weapons
of<00:00:40.200> choice<00:00:40.230> were<00:00:40.710> obviously<00:00:41.160> no<00:00:41.340> land<00:00:41.520> beyond

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
of choice were obviously no land beyond

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
of choice were obviously no land beyond
and<00:00:42.059> i<00:00:42.780> think<00:00:42.960> what<00:00:43.079> else<00:00:43.200> got<00:00:43.410> him<00:00:43.559> did<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and i think what else got him did the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.740 
and i think what else got him did the
raid<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.100> easily<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.850> he<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.149> had<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
raid so easily was that he also had the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
raid so easily was that he also had the
hunger<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.079> crota<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.620> he<00:00:46.680> also<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:47.010> black

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
hunger of crota and he also had black

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
hunger of crota and he also had black
hammer<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:48.270> he<00:00:48.450> was<00:00:48.570> doing<00:00:48.750> very<00:00:48.960> very<00:00:49.020> well<00:00:49.260> on

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
hammer so he was doing very very well on
