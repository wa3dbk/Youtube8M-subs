but before I read you those out let me
show<00:01:23.210> you<00:01:23.270> what<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.539> looks<00:01:23.719> like<00:01:23.899> on<00:01:24.079> the<00:01:24.109> back

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
show you what it looks like on the back

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:25.929 
show you what it looks like on the back
of<00:01:24.469> a<00:01:24.530> board<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.039> here's<00:01:25.189> a<00:01:25.219> board<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.759> the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
of a board so here's a board this is the

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.559 
of a board so here's a board this is the
pedal<00:01:26.090> train<00:01:26.389> mini<00:01:26.689> I<00:01:26.780> think<00:01:27.189> and<00:01:28.420> there's<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:29.569 
pedal train mini I think and there's the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:31.120 
pedal train mini I think and there's the
boltrope<00:01:29.960> plug<00:01:30.229> it's<00:01:30.499> not<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.679> pedal<00:01:30.979> train

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
boltrope plug it's not a pedal train

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.429 
boltrope plug it's not a pedal train
mini<00:01:31.340> it's<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.549> pedal<00:01:31.700> train<00:01:31.969> junior<00:01:32.359> it's<00:01:33.289> a

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
mini it's a pedal train junior it's a

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.039 
mini it's a pedal train junior it's a
pedal<00:01:33.649> train<00:01:34.039> it's<00:01:34.700> written<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.119> it's

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
pedal train it's written on it it's

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.069 
pedal train it's written on it it's
written<00:01:36.229> on<00:01:36.409> it<00:01:36.590> it's<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:36.979> pedal<00:01:37.189> train<00:01:37.549> nano

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
written on it it's a pedal train nano

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.219 
written on it it's a pedal train nano
courses<00:01:39.079> here's<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.409> nano

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.080 

so<00:01:42.709> the<00:01:42.829> voltage<00:01:42.979> just<00:01:43.429> squeezes<00:01:43.759> in<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:43.939> back

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
so the voltage just squeezes in the back

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.179 
so the voltage just squeezes in the back
now<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:44.299> spacing<00:01:45.139> on<00:01:45.229> all<00:01:45.529> pedal<00:01:45.950> train

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
now the spacing on all pedal train

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.309 
now the spacing on all pedal train
boards<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.880> designed<00:01:47.299> for<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.600> volto<00:01:47.959> to<00:01:48.020> just

this of course you now need no mains

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.249 
this of course you now need no mains
lead<00:01:57.979> for<00:01:58.639> your<00:01:58.819> pedal<00:01:59.119> board<00:01:59.329> no<00:01:59.599> connection

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
lead for your pedal board no connection

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.989 
lead for your pedal board no connection
to<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.499> wall<00:02:00.679> it's<00:02:01.009> just<00:02:01.189> completely

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
to the wall it's just completely

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:05.199 
to the wall it's just completely
self-contained<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.969> that's<00:02:04.969> what<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:05.179> looks

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
self-contained so that's what it looks

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:07.690 
self-contained so that's what it looks
like<00:02:05.569> I'll<00:02:06.349> go<00:02:06.590> back<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:06.889> using<00:02:07.069> the<00:02:07.459> one

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
like I'll go back to using the one

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.999 
like I'll go back to using the one
that's<00:02:07.880> out<00:02:07.999> the<00:02:08.179> box<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.410> tiny<00:02:09.740> weenie

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
that's out the box so it's tiny weenie

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.470 
that's out the box so it's tiny weenie
doesn't<00:02:10.429> really<00:02:10.550> weigh<00:02:10.729> anything<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.270> here's

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
doesn't really weigh anything and here's

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.720 
doesn't really weigh anything and here's
the<00:02:11.630> stats<00:02:11.960> so<00:02:12.620> takes<00:02:13.010> me<00:02:13.130> six<00:02:13.310> hours<00:02:13.550> to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the stats so takes me six hours to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.890 
the stats so takes me six hours to
charge<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.270> can<00:02:14.300> charge<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.020> from<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.380> main

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900

have got on the front you can see here
is<00:02:54.120> three<00:02:55.109> bars<00:02:55.409> that<00:02:55.799> tell<00:02:55.980> me<00:02:56.129> how<00:02:56.250> much

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
is three bars that tell me how much

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.649 
is three bars that tell me how much
power<00:02:56.700> I<00:02:56.790> got<00:02:57.000> left<00:02:57.180> can<00:02:57.299> you<00:02:57.329> see<00:02:57.510> that

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
power I got left can you see that

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.539 
power I got left can you see that
hopefully<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.109> can<00:02:58.290> let's<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.769> basically

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
hopefully you can let's just basically

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.869 
hopefully you can let's just basically
just<00:02:59.819> press<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.420> button<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.989> off<00:03:01.049> there

worth of use from this power supply if I

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.770 
worth of use from this power supply if I
go<00:03:19.379> crazy<00:03:19.560> connect<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.220> whole<00:03:20.400> 11<00:03:21.180> pedals<00:03:21.599> and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
go crazy connect the whole 11 pedals and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.300 
go crazy connect the whole 11 pedals and
I'm<00:03:21.900> using<00:03:22.079> sort<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.379> higher<00:03:22.560> draw<00:03:22.919> pedals

I'm using sort of higher draw pedals
typically<00:03:23.970> I'm<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.299> go<00:03:24.389> down<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.750> about

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
typically I'm going to go down to about

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.949 
typically I'm going to go down to about
nine<00:03:25.230> hours<00:03:25.310> so<00:03:26.310> still<00:03:26.639> more<00:03:27.269> than<00:03:27.480> capable<00:03:27.660> of

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
nine hours so still more than capable of

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.449 
nine hours so still more than capable of
getting<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.319> through<00:03:28.500> three<00:03:28.919> or<00:03:28.949> four<00:03:29.040> gigs

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
getting you through three or four gigs

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.430 
getting you through three or four gigs
even<00:03:30.269> if<00:03:30.329> you've<00:03:30.449> got<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.569> massive<00:03:30.870> pedal<00:03:31.290> board

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
even if you've got a massive pedal board

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.619 
even if you've got a massive pedal board
between<00:03:31.620> charges<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.849> will<00:03:32.970> power<00:03:33.180> up<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.599> a
