00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
and let's try to take a quick photograph

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.110 
and let's try to take a quick photograph
we<00:05:46.080> do<00:05:46.230> get<00:05:46.440> this<00:05:46.680> touch<00:05:46.980> to<00:05:47.190> focus<00:05:47.550> as<00:05:47.700> you<00:05:47.910> can

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
we do get this touch to focus as you can

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.620 
we do get this touch to focus as you can
see<00:05:48.360> and<00:05:49.040> yes<00:05:50.040> it's<00:05:50.640> almost<00:05:50.850> instantaneous

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
see and yes it's almost instantaneous

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.490 
see and yes it's almost instantaneous
let<00:05:52.080> me<00:05:52.290> do<00:05:52.410> it<00:05:52.530> again<00:05:53.030> and<00:05:54.050> again<00:05:55.050> as<00:05:55.230> you<00:05:55.470> can

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
let me do it again and again as you can

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.300 
let me do it again and again as you can
see<00:05:55.820> it's<00:05:56.820> almost<00:05:57.140> instantaneous<00:05:58.140> let<00:05:58.920> us<00:05:59.070> see

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
see it's almost instantaneous let us see

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.340 
see it's almost instantaneous let us see
that<00:05:59.490> and<00:05:59.850> as<00:06:00.450> you<00:06:00.540> can<00:06:00.660> see<00:06:00.720> we<00:06:00.990> have<00:06:01.170> these

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
that and as you can see we have these

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.700 
that and as you can see we have these
motion<00:06:02.340> for<00:06:03.330> example<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:04.140> let<00:06:04.350> me<00:06:04.470> disable

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
motion for example and let me disable

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.430 
motion for example and let me disable
that<00:06:04.980> and<00:06:05.240> again<00:06:06.240> as<00:06:06.390> you<00:06:06.480> can<00:06:06.510> see<00:06:06.660> the

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
that and again as you can see the

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.730 
that and again as you can see the
pictures<00:06:07.800> came<00:06:07.980> out<00:06:08.100> to<00:06:08.250> be<00:06:08.370> really<00:06:08.730> sharp
