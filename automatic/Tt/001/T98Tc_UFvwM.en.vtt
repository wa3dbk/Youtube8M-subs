00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.830
 and very simple to make calls 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:25.019
 free this either to landlines 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:28.869
 from home or cell phones 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.179
 this is a very easy way and a way 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.610
 very safe, keep in mind that you do not 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.040

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.260
 phone this is completely free 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.360
 I 've already tried it that way, it's good 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.219
 Like before anything, they should know that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.219
 this works both in mac and in 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.860
 windows is practically the same as 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.780
 same steps the same process so is that 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.250
 good have a lot is good 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.379
 Well, we started with the tutorial 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.789
 first they are going to go to the page that 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.770
 I will leave you in the description of the video 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.160
 which it is all that dotcom them 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.730
 is here 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.830
 if you have a phone, uncles or 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.360
 some phone with android is also 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.760
 available that application for your 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.300
 device in the case of them is 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.580
 available in the app store and in the case 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.830
 of android is available on the android 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.780
 market so it's good that they have a lot in 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.850
 account this also because you can 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.010
 can get them out of some trouble at 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.200
 moment that we do not have credit well 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.330
 Well, once I 'm here in this 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.780
 page we are going to go to this section 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.360
 which says produce 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 and we're going to go to this pink button 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 crisis and we're going to click here in car 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.850
 already being here will redirect us to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.130
 a new page in which we have to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.899
 download a little software I repeat 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.110
 if in this case I 'm doing it in 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.759
 mac if you were in windows 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.740
 automatically laws will download the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.170
 small little program for windows like this is 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.090
 how good are we going to download it as 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.549
 you can see it is a small program 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.090
 that does not happen much is a like a permit 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.679
 to be able to use the are like 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.330
 drivers to use what 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.810
 it would be the microphone of the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.299
 computer by means of this small 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.979
 page that the truth as I repeat them 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.870
 can get out of trouble at the moment of 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 credit data good success right now 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.910
 let's see how this works 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.910
 application 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.550
 well we have already downloaded it we are going to the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.720
 download folder in this case 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.260
 with continued sacrifice continue 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.000
 we accept, we continue and we install 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.000
 will ask for the password we put it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.769
 we wait for it to finish installing 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.670
 there you have it as you can see 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.530
 finished installing what is this 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.100
 small application this small permission 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.410
 let's close it 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.970
 once you have installed what 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.010
 it would be this little application 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.590
 and to be able to announce this page we are going 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.610
 to go here to the login section and the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.610
 calling section 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.140

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.140
 permission or you can do it with your email 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.600

 well as you can see it has opened 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.750
 this little phone 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.800
 in which we can mark here 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.360
 the condition or any number like 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.240
 you can see a small thumbnail 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.870
 there is also what my phone is 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.070
 and I'm going to make a call 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.660

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.460
 mexico and how am I going to make a call to 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.140
 cellular I have if you are going to be

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.180
 put the cell number to which 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.030
 they want to call me in this case for now 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.739
 I'm going to call my phone anyway 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.110
 for security reasons I'm going to censor 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.690
 this part of the video well once you're 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.700
 marked what is the number to which 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.750
 we want to call let's click on this 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.750
 button that says prisco

 Well, how can you see there? 

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:45.830
 is entering what is the call if I 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.819
 I answer at this time 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.669
 I will automatically be able to interact 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:54.689
 with my computer's microphone and it 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.429
 auto and me to my cell phone as you can see 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.949
 you here a small number appears 

00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:00.949
 strange that means that 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.030
 that means there is not a phone 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.770
 specific to which the 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.380

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.030
 it is also good, well, we are going to 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.880
 call again to see that this 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.240

 let's click again there and as 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.230

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.540
 in entering the call in what would come to 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.030
 be the phone as you can see 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.770
 another new number has already appeared 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.420
 I tell them there is not a specific number 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.170
 from which calls come 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.170

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.750
 Well , that's what has already entered 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.160
 it would be the call 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.290
 it is automatically listening in what 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.270
 that undoubtedly sell my horn 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.000
 cell phone 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.710
 when listening 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.450
 Well, as you can see, this is a 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.110
 very easy way very fast and very 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.120
 simple to be able to make a call 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.860
 through your computer I repeat if 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.440
 you have a phone with them 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.300
 or some phone with android also what 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.610
 you can download it well because that has been 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:08.250
 all for the moment to something else that 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.640
 I was forgetting in a few times 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:13.380
 this page this method is saturated and 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.410
 Sometimes the 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.270
 calls to be like that if the 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.850
 call will answer them a 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.160
 answering machine in English that tells you that 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.169
 at the moment it is very saturated what is 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.160
 the page and try a little bit 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:27.690
 later 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.330
 Well, well, keep in mind 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.520
 and I tried it later and they'll see that 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.440
 after a while they will get their already 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.700
