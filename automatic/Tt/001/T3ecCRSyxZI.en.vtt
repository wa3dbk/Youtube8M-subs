they<00:00:14.130> put<00:00:14.340> out<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.730> feel<00:00:14.940> like<00:00:15.120> it's<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.480> test<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
they put out I feel like it's a test to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.840 
they put out I feel like it's a test to

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
best space reporters a store Thor is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
best space reporters a store Thor is
always<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.500> top<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.550> s<00:00:44.820> o<00:00:45.000> doing

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
always on top of it you have s o doing

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.430 
always on top of it you have s o doing
his<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:45.870> always<00:00:46.860> giving<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.809> daily<00:00:49.140> space

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
his thing always giving the daily space

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.500 
his thing always giving the daily space
weather<00:00:49.710> updates<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:50.879> when<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.329> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
weather updates but when it comes to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.760 
weather updates but when it comes to
these<00:00:51.660> images<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.469> we<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:53.129> know<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
these images I think we all know that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
these images I think we all know that
come<00:00:55.770> on

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
come on

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.410 
come on
so<00:00:57.059> much<00:00:57.300> Photoshop<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.609> it's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
so much Photoshop and this and that it's

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.910 
so much Photoshop and this and that it's
what<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.780> they<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.079> trying<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.620> hand<00:01:01.800> out

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
what are they really trying to hand out

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.680 
what are they really trying to hand out
here<00:01:01.949> when<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.489> comes<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.820> series<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.510> just

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
here when it comes to series they just

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
here when it comes to series they just
told<00:01:03.930> us<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.229> was<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> massive<00:01:04.949> pyramid<00:01:05.790> like

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
told us there was a massive pyramid like

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.789 
told us there was a massive pyramid like
structure<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:07.170> massive<00:01:07.920> peak<00:01:08.189> 3<00:01:08.760> miles<00:01:09.030> tall

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
structure this massive peak 3 miles tall

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.310 
structure this massive peak 3 miles tall
sticking<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.189> nowhere<00:01:12.080> they<00:01:13.080> didn't

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
sticking up out of nowhere they didn't

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.270 
sticking up out of nowhere they didn't
expect<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.409> what<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:17.009> two

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
expect that and now we have what was two

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
expect that and now we have what was two
bright<00:01:17.580> spots<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.240> turned<00:01:18.450> into<00:01:18.630> eight<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
bright spots is turned into eight and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.380 
bright spots is turned into eight and
let's<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:20.130> forget<00:01:20.549> something<00:01:21.030> they're<00:01:21.270> not

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
let's not forget something they're not

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.710 
let's not forget something they're not
mentioning<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
mentioning now is that right out the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.149 
mentioning now is that right out the
gate<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.530> look<00:01:25.710> at<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.600> scientific

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
gate when you look at the scientific

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.140 
gate when you look at the scientific
composition<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:30.320> what<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.759> spots<00:01:32.759> are<00:01:32.909> made

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
composition of what these spots are made

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.840 
composition of what these spots are made
of<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> heat<00:01:33.750> signatures<00:01:34.320> alone<00:01:34.790> they<00:01:35.790> were

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
of the heat signatures alone they were

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.440 
of the heat signatures alone they were
different

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
different

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.660 
different
vastly<00:01:37.140> different<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.799> two<00:01:38.040> different<00:01:38.280> sides

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
vastly different on two different sides

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.810 
vastly different on two different sides
of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.240> spectrum<00:01:40.189> there's<00:01:41.189> two<00:01:41.520> biggest

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
of the spectrum there's two biggest

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.969 
of the spectrum there's two biggest
bright<00:01:42.180> spots<00:01:42.509> which<00:01:42.840> showed<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.680> were<00:01:43.710> made

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
bright spots which showed they were made

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.399 
bright spots which showed they were made
of<00:01:44.130> two<00:01:44.430> different<00:01:44.460> materials<00:01:45.049> they<00:01:46.049> stated

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
of two different materials they stated

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.260 
of two different materials they stated
that<00:01:46.530> since<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.579> been<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that since then that's been kind of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.539 
that since then that's been kind of
swept<00:01:48.509> under<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.780> rug<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.159> take<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
swept under the rug and if you take the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.280 
swept under the rug and if you take the
time<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.210> go<00:01:51.689> back<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.899> look<00:01:52.170> at

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
time and actually go back and look at

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.950 
time and actually go back and look at
those<00:01:52.409> images<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.340> very<00:01:53.960> very

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
those images they are very very

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.870 
those images they are very very
interesting<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:55.950> talking<00:01:56.369> zooming<00:01:56.759> in

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
interesting and I'm talking zooming in

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.870 
interesting and I'm talking zooming in
and<00:01:57.030> looking<00:01:57.299> all<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.450> fine<00:01:57.750> details<00:01:58.880> now

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and looking all the fine details now

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.420 
and looking all the fine details now
when<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> comes<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> mounds<00:02:01.380> they<00:02:02.189> say

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
when it comes to the mounds they say

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
when it comes to the mounds they say
that<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:03.090> interesting<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:03.990> its<00:02:04.110> own

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that that is interesting in its own

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.160 
that that is interesting in its own
right<00:02:04.469> because<00:02:05.509> not<00:02:06.509> only<00:02:06.570> did<00:02:06.869> they<00:02:06.930> not

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
right because not only did they not

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.889 
right because not only did they not
expect<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.849> can<00:02:09.000> find<00:02:09.300> mounds<00:02:09.720> like

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
expect it but you can find mounds like

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.720 
expect it but you can find mounds like
that<00:02:10.140> here<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.560> earth<00:02:10.739> but<00:02:11.220> they're<00:02:11.430> much

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that here on earth but they're much

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.870 
that here on earth but they're much
smaller

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
smaller

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.000 
smaller
so<00:02:14.880> earth<00:02:15.150> way<00:02:15.690> bigger<00:02:16.730> mounds<00:02:17.730> much<00:02:18.180> smaller

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
so earth way bigger mounds much smaller

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.200 
so earth way bigger mounds much smaller
here<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:22.200> rock<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.730> massive

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
here on this rock have this massive

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.910 
here on this rock have this massive
mound<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.720> also<00:02:26.510> they<00:02:27.510> say<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.320> possible

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
mound that also they say it is possible

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.340 
mound that also they say it is possible
that<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.610> bright<00:02:29.940> material<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.930> is<00:02:31.050> coming

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
that this bright material that is coming

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.710 
that this bright material that is coming
off<00:02:31.680> of<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> mountain<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.330> same

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
off of the mountain it's the same

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.330 
off of the mountain it's the same
material<00:02:34.550> same<00:02:35.550> bright<00:02:36.030> material<00:02:37.340> causing

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
material same bright material causing

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.870 
material same bright material causing
the<00:02:38.430> bright<00:02:38.670> spots<00:02:40.130> he<00:02:41.130> says<00:02:41.340> we<00:02:41.550> will<00:02:41.700> need

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
the bright spots he says we will need

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.060 
the bright spots he says we will need
better<00:02:42.090> resolution<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:43.050> determine<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.650> is

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
better resolution to determine this is

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.920 
better resolution to determine this is
what<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.850> site<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.240> says<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:48.390> look<00:02:48.660> at

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
what the site that says but look at

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.350 
what the site that says but look at
what's<00:02:49.620> going<00:02:49.680> down<00:02:49.920> here<00:02:50.370> they've<00:02:51.330> been

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
what's going down here they've been

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.580 
what's going down here they've been

a little bit more clear every time if
there<00:03:02.610> are<00:03:02.670> these<00:03:02.790> pictures<00:03:03.030> out<00:03:03.390> now<00:03:03.960> there's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
there are these pictures out now there's

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.940 
there are these pictures out now there's
a<00:03:04.200> big<00:03:04.380> pyramid<00:03:05.120> and<00:03:06.500> now<00:03:07.500> they're<00:03:07.710> trying<00:03:07.830> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
a big pyramid and now they're trying to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.560 
a big pyramid and now they're trying to
say<00:03:08.100> that<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.370> bright<00:03:08.670> material<00:03:09.030> might<00:03:09.390> be

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
say that this bright material might be

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.300 
say that this bright material might be
the<00:03:09.750> same<00:03:09.960> bright<00:03:10.200> material<00:03:10.500> that's<00:03:11.010> causing

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the same bright material that's causing

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.250 
the same bright material that's causing
the<00:03:11.520> bright<00:03:11.730> spots<00:03:12.000> problem<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:12.810> with<00:03:13.110> that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
the bright spots problem is with that

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.410 
the bright spots problem is with that
statement<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.100> said<00:03:14.310> before<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.970> that

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
statement like I said before is that

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
statement like I said before is that
these<00:03:15.600> two<00:03:15.930> bright<00:03:16.230> spots<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.860> two

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
these two bright spots have two

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.330 
these two bright spots have two
different<00:03:18.030> signatures<00:03:18.930> they're<00:03:19.860> made<00:03:20.130> of

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
different signatures they're made of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.610 
different signatures they're made of
something<00:03:20.580> different<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.780> can't<00:03:22.170> be<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
something different so it can't be the

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.060 
something different so it can't be the
same<00:03:22.830> as<00:03:23.040> both<00:03:23.250> if<00:03:23.610> that's<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.540> case<00:03:24.890> but<00:03:25.890> what

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
same as both if that's the case but what

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.460 
same as both if that's the case but what
is<00:03:26.190> interesting<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.910> now<00:03:27.690> we're<00:03:27.960> finding<00:03:28.350> this

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
is interesting is now we're finding this

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.960 
is interesting is now we're finding this
bright<00:03:28.770> material<00:03:29.340> coming<00:03:29.880> out<00:03:30.150> or<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.970> this

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
bright material coming out or on this

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.060 
bright material coming out or on this
massive<00:03:33.300> pyramid<00:03:37.280> can't<00:03:38.280> wait<00:03:38.690> to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
massive pyramid can't wait to

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.520 
massive pyramid can't wait to
august/september<00:03:41.330> because<00:03:42.330> right<00:03:42.570> now<00:03:42.780> this

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
august/september because right now this

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.000 
august/september because right now this
thing<00:03:43.830> is<00:03:43.860> in<00:03:44.130> orbit<00:03:44.340> around<00:03:44.820> well<00:03:45.390> it's<00:03:46.010> 2700

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
thing is in orbit around well it's 2700

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.880 
thing is in orbit around well it's 2700
miles<00:03:47.490> above<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.150> surface<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.690> in<00:03:49.410> August

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
miles above the surface and in August

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.000 
miles above the surface and in August
it's<00:03:50.070> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> dip<00:03:50.550> down<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:53.160> below<00:03:53.510> 900<00:03:55.010> so

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
it's going to dip down to below 900 so

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.780 
it's going to dip down to below 900 so
that's<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.700> timeframe<00:03:57.170> in<00:03:58.170> given<00:03:58.980> they're

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
that's the timeframe in given they're

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.130 
that's the timeframe in given they're
gonna<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> take<00:04:00.330> images<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.050> they'll

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
gonna have to take images and they'll

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.810 
gonna have to take images and they'll
probably<00:04:01.290> give<00:04:01.650> us<00:04:01.680> some<00:04:01.920> more<00:04:02.070> BS<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.670> say<00:04:02.790> oh

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
probably give us some more BS and say oh

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.340 
probably give us some more BS and say oh
it's<00:04:03.180> gonna<00:04:03.300> take<00:04:03.390> another<00:04:03.660> month<00:04:04.050> or<00:04:04.170> two<00:04:04.320> to

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
it's gonna take another month or two to

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.440 
it's gonna take another month or two to
get<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> images<00:04:05.040> back<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.670> processed<00:04:06.209> and

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
get the images back and processed and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.650 
get the images back and processed and
get<00:04:06.630> them<00:04:06.750> out<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.020> public<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:08.490> know<00:04:08.660> when

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
get them out to the public you know when

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.410 
get them out to the public you know when
they're<00:04:09.780> probably<00:04:09.959> watching<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.530> all<00:04:10.770> alive

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.710 
they're probably watching this all alive
you<00:04:12.420> see

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
interesting that now we're hearing it

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.550 
interesting that now we're hearing it
this<00:04:29.960> bright<00:04:30.380> material<00:04:30.860> is<00:04:31.930> on<00:04:32.930> this<00:04:33.169> pyramid

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560
