00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.589 

well<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.260> started<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.970> special<00:00:29.970> makeup<00:00:30.150> effects

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
well I started in special makeup effects

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900 
well I started in special makeup effects
I<00:00:30.900> was<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.199> sculptor<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.949> at<00:00:32.340> effects<00:00:32.610> studio

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
I was a sculptor and at effects studio

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.810 
I was a sculptor and at effects studio
in<00:00:33.059> Georgia<00:00:33.360> called<00:00:33.629> lone<00:00:33.780> wolf<00:00:34.020> effects<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
in Georgia called lone wolf effects and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.430 
in Georgia called lone wolf effects and
I<00:00:35.820> started<00:00:36.329> out<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.900> the<00:00:36.930> bottom<00:00:37.199> of<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> totem

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I started out at the bottom of the totem

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
I started out at the bottom of the totem
pole<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.160> worked<00:00:38.340> my<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.670> up<00:00:38.850> finally

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
pole there but worked my way up finally

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.180 
pole there but worked my way up finally
to<00:00:39.540> sculpting<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.320> movie<00:00:40.860> called<00:00:41.010> eight

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
to sculpting on a movie called eight

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.299 
to sculpting on a movie called eight
legged<00:00:41.370> freaks<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.830> about<00:00:43.830> that<00:00:43.980> time<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
legged freaks and about that time I

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
legged freaks and about that time I
figured<00:00:44.790> I<00:00:44.879> should<00:00:45.059> probably<00:00:45.629> make<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> jump

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
figured I should probably make the jump

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.970 
figured I should probably make the jump
into<00:00:46.589> digital<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.449> I<00:00:48.800> experimented<00:00:49.800> with

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
into digital and I experimented with

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.100 
into digital and I experimented with
some<00:00:50.430> other<00:00:50.550> software<00:00:51.089> packages<00:00:51.330> 3d<00:00:51.900> studio

Max and Maya never it never gave me the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.380 
Max and Maya never it never gave me the
same<00:00:55.230> feeling<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.920> an<00:00:56.430> organic<00:00:56.760> workflow<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
same feeling of an organic workflow I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.970 
same feeling of an organic workflow I
never<00:00:57.659> felt<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.170> could<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.620> clay

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
never felt like what I could do in clay

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.709 
never felt like what I could do in clay
translate<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.789> directly<00:00:59.940> into<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> was

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
translate it directly into what I was

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.170 
translate it directly into what I was
doing<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.110> screen<00:01:01.230> until<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.309> saw<00:01:02.610> ZBrush

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
doing on the screen until I saw ZBrush

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.050 
doing on the screen until I saw ZBrush
and<00:01:03.949> that<00:01:04.949> drew<00:01:05.220> me<00:01:05.369> into<00:01:05.489> working<00:01:05.850> digitally

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
and that drew me into working digitally

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330 
and that drew me into working digitally
because<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.690> could<00:01:06.840> take<00:01:07.050> all<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.830> techniques

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
because I could take all the techniques

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
because I could take all the techniques
they<00:01:08.520> use<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:09.000> clay<00:01:09.300> or<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.780> wax<00:01:10.050> directly<00:01:10.710> into

they use in clay or in wax directly into

the computer and get all the benefits of
working<00:01:13.020> digitally<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> apply<00:01:15.509> them

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
working digitally and and apply them

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:28.340 
working digitally and and apply them
there<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.520> then<00:01:26.520> when<00:01:26.910> ZBrush<00:01:27.450> 2<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:28.020> first

images<00:01:31.940> lights<00:01:32.940> went<00:01:33.240> off<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.959> was

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
images lights went off and I was

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.919 
images lights went off and I was
thrilled<00:01:34.349> I<00:01:35.340> knew<00:01:35.819> that<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.030> had<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.270> make<00:01:36.690> some

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
thrilled I knew that I had to make some

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.419 
thrilled I knew that I had to make some
kind<00:01:37.050> of<00:01:37.170> digital<00:01:37.319> jump<00:01:37.800> if<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.039> wanted<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.340> be

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
kind of digital jump if I wanted to be

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:40.460 
kind of digital jump if I wanted to be
marketable<00:01:38.940> in<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.179> future<00:01:39.539> but<00:01:40.050> this<00:01:40.229> just

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
marketable in the future but this just

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
marketable in the future but this just
made<00:01:40.679> it<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.280> really<00:01:41.940> seem<00:01:42.239> appealing

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
made it you know really seem appealing

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.419 
made it you know really seem appealing
it<00:01:42.780> seemed<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.259> could<00:01:43.289> take<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.250> was

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
it seemed like I could take what I was

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.400 
it seemed like I could take what I was
used<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> doing<00:01:44.759> with<00:01:45.149> my<00:01:45.300> hands<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.929> then

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
physical maquette and the beauty of it

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.300 
physical maquette and the beauty of it
is<00:03:28.760> once<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.209> design<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:29.989> approved<00:03:30.470> all<00:03:31.130> we

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
is once that design is approved all we

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.400 
is once that design is approved all we
have<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.579> do<00:03:31.700> is<00:03:31.940> just<00:03:32.239> reach<00:03:32.629> apologize<00:03:33.230> it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
have to do is just reach apologize it

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.619 
have to do is just reach apologize it
for<00:03:33.560> animation<00:03:34.129> and<00:03:34.250> what<00:03:35.060> they<00:03:35.209> approved

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
for animation and what they approved

for animation and what they approved
what<00:03:35.900> they<00:03:36.049> saw<00:03:36.290> goes<00:03:36.709> right<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.129> game<00:03:37.370> it's

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
what they saw goes right in game it's

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.619 
what they saw goes right in game it's
it's<00:03:38.450> nice<00:03:38.690> because<00:03:39.049> by<00:03:39.610> starting<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:41.269> design

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
it's nice because by starting the design

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.990 
it's nice because by starting the design
in<00:03:41.900> ZBrush<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.590> living<00:03:42.920> in<00:03:43.040> ZBrush<00:03:43.489> it's

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
in ZBrush and living in ZBrush it's

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.880 
in ZBrush and living in ZBrush it's
never<00:03:44.299> reinterpreted<00:03:45.079> they<00:03:45.440> never<00:03:45.680> lose
