00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
we're gonna sort out a mod pack for it

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.660 
we're gonna sort out a mod pack for it
we've<00:02:39.870> got<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.019> mod<00:02:40.200> pack<00:02:40.379> in<00:02:40.530> mind<00:02:40.829> and<00:02:41.069> we're

we've got a mod pack in mind and we're

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.740 
we've got a mod pack in mind and we're
just<00:02:41.760> gonna<00:02:41.909> do<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> little<00:02:42.209> bit<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.569> testing

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
just gonna do a little bit of testing

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.149 
just gonna do a little bit of testing
because<00:02:43.230> we<00:02:43.349> didn't<00:02:43.530> test<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.829> one<00:02:44.010> we<00:02:44.099> just

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
because we didn't test this one we just

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.860 
because we didn't test this one we just
kind<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.459> went<00:02:44.610> right<00:02:44.849> I<00:02:45.000> would<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.690> this

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
kind of went right I would do this

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.339 
kind of went right I would do this
series

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
series

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.750

jump<00:02:46.620> straight<00:02:46.829> into<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.430> would<00:02:47.670> be

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
jump straight into it it would be

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.809 
jump straight into it it would be
awesome<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:49.230> was<00:02:49.379> awesome<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.640> kind

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
awesome it was awesome and then it kind

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.520 
awesome it was awesome and then it kind
of<00:02:50.849> got<00:02:50.940> tedious<00:02:51.269> because<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.629> meant<00:02:51.810> building

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
of got tedious because it meant building

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
machine so like we needed this machine

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.770 
machine so like we needed this machine
the<00:02:57.569> electrode<00:02:58.549> electronic<00:02:59.549> so<00:03:00.540> like<00:03:00.690> we

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
the electrode electronic so like we

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.220 
the electrode electronic so like we
needed<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.079> every<00:03:01.440> smelter<00:03:02.959> we<00:03:03.959> needed<00:03:04.200> like
