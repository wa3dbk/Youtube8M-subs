Scion fr-s and the Subaru BRZ sitting
here<00:00:15.940> in<00:00:16.060> front<00:00:16.330> of<00:00:16.420> me<00:00:16.510> I<00:00:16.750> wanted<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.380> show<00:00:17.530> you

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:17.620 
here in front of me I wanted to show you

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.440 
here in front of me I wanted to show you
guys<00:00:17.680> them<00:00:18.040> side<00:00:18.520> by<00:00:18.550> side<00:00:18.700> because<00:00:19.180> there<00:00:19.300> are

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
guys them side by side because there are

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.320 
guys them side by side because there are
some<00:00:19.810> differences<00:00:20.620> between<00:00:20.830> them<00:00:21.400> also

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
some differences between them also

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.720 
some differences between them also
they're<00:00:22.780> going<00:00:23.020> to<00:00:23.230> react<00:00:23.920> differently<00:00:24.010> when

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
they're going to react differently when

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.190 
they're going to react differently when
you<00:00:24.820> install<00:00:25.120> them<00:00:25.240> on<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.420> car<00:00:25.720> now<00:00:26.020> they're

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
you install them on the car now they're

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.380 
you install them on the car now they're
both<00:00:26.410> 304<00:00:27.250> stainless<00:00:27.370> steel<00:00:28.030> so<00:00:28.270> they're

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
both 304 stainless steel so they're

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.420 
both 304 stainless steel so they're
incredibly<00:00:28.900> high<00:00:29.140> quality<00:00:29.190> both<00:00:30.190> have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
incredibly high quality both have

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.660 
incredibly high quality both have
incredibly<00:00:31.030> thick<00:00:31.360> flange<00:00:31.810> designs

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:32.670 
incredibly thick flange designs

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.340 
incredibly thick flange designs
everywhere<00:00:33.670> on<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:34.060> pipes<00:00:34.360> but<00:00:34.930> the<00:00:35.110> main

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
everywhere on the pipes but the main

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.380 
everywhere on the pipes but the main
difference<00:00:35.380> of<00:00:35.920> course<00:00:36.130> just<00:00:36.580> being<00:00:36.790> unequal

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
difference of course just being unequal

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.510 
difference of course just being unequal
length<00:00:37.510> just<00:00:37.990> being<00:00:38.200> equal<00:00:38.680> length<00:00:38.860> this

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
length just being equal length this

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.940 
length just being equal length this
you've<00:00:39.970> got<00:00:40.180> basically<00:00:41.140> a<00:00:41.260> four<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.920> one

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
you've got basically a four to one

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.040 
you've got basically a four to one
designer<00:00:42.640> what<00:00:43.000> that<00:00:43.120> means<00:00:43.330> you've<00:00:43.600> got<00:00:43.750> four

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
designer what that means you've got four

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.480 
designer what that means you've got four
pipes<00:00:44.350> coming<00:00:44.950> together

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
pipes coming together

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.390 
pipes coming together
all<00:00:45.610> leading<00:00:46.240> to<00:00:46.600> one<00:00:46.870> single<00:00:47.170> pipe<00:00:47.530> now<00:00:48.100> this

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
all leading to one single pipe now this

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.160 
all leading to one single pipe now this
one<00:00:48.610> is<00:00:48.760> a<00:00:48.790> four<00:00:49.120> to<00:00:49.270> two<00:00:49.480> to<00:00:49.660> one<00:00:49.840> and<00:00:50.140> so

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
one is a four to two to one and so

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.610 
one is a four to two to one and so
you've<00:00:51.070> got<00:00:51.340> four<00:00:52.120> pipes<00:00:52.420> leading<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.410> two

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
you've got four pipes leading to two

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.540 
you've got four pipes leading to two
then<00:00:54.400> leading<00:00:54.730> to<00:00:54.970> one<00:00:55.210> now<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.920> factory

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
then leading to one now the factory

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.610 
then leading to one now the factory
header<00:00:57.760> on<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:57.970> Scion<00:00:58.239> fr-s<00:00:58.450> and<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.960> BRZ<00:00:59.260> is

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
header on the Scion fr-s and the BRZ is

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.800 
header on the Scion fr-s and the BRZ is
an<00:00:59.980> equal<00:01:00.370> length<00:01:00.579> header<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.210> that's<00:01:01.630> why

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
an equal length header and that's why

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.170 
an equal length header and that's why
you<00:01:01.870> lose<00:01:02.230> that<00:01:02.500> you<00:01:02.829> know<00:01:02.980> I<00:01:03.250> guess<00:01:04.000> that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
you lose that you know I guess that

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.630 
you lose that you know I guess that
characteristic<00:01:05.050> or<00:01:05.229> that<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.650> normal<00:01:06.190> subaru

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
characteristic or that the normal subaru

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.090 
characteristic or that the normal subaru
sound<00:01:07.000> that<00:01:07.180> we're<00:01:07.300> so<00:01:07.479> used<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.950> can

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
sound that we're so used to you can

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.399 
sound that we're so used to you can
actually<00:01:09.280> get<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.000> back<00:01:10.450> with<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.080> unequal

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
actually get that back with the unequal

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:13.469 
actually get that back with the unequal
length<00:01:11.650> header<00:01:11.920> so<00:01:12.190> if<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.340> really<00:01:12.700> want<00:01:13.120> that

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
length header so if you really want that

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.060 
length header so if you really want that
subaru<00:01:14.140> sound<00:01:14.470> out<00:01:14.650> of<00:01:14.680> your<00:01:14.800> BRZ<00:01:15.340> or<00:01:15.370> FRS

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
subaru sound out of your BRZ or FRS

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.380 
subaru sound out of your BRZ or FRS
unequal<00:01:18.070> length<00:01:18.159> header<00:01:18.400> will<00:01:18.790> definitely<00:01:19.299> do

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
unequal length header will definitely do

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.399 
unequal length header will definitely do
that<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:19.840> bring<00:01:20.080> back<00:01:20.229> that

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
that for you bring back that

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.950 
that for you bring back that
characteristic<00:01:21.159> sound<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.720> we're<00:01:22.840> also

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
characteristic sound that we're also

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.990 
characteristic sound that we're also
familiar<00:01:23.229> with<00:01:23.530> with<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.860> Subarus<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.790> one

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
familiar with with the Subarus this one

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.149 
familiar with with the Subarus this one
also<00:01:25.210> has<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.570> torque<00:01:25.870> monster<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.710> gets<00:01:26.920> rid<00:01:27.130> of

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
also has a torque monster it gets rid of

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.520 
also has a torque monster it gets rid of
that<00:01:27.280> really<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.390> know<00:01:28.479> big<00:01:28.930> torque<00:01:29.290> it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
that really you know big torque it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.890 
that really you know big torque it
coming<00:01:30.190> up<00:01:30.280> through<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.549> RPM<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.270> so<00:01:31.720> this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
coming up through the RPM and so this

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.210 
coming up through the RPM and so this
would<00:01:32.049> be<00:01:32.170> an<00:01:32.290> awesome<00:01:32.560> header<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.070> you're

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
would be an awesome header if you're

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.030 
would be an awesome header if you're
wanting<00:01:33.640> more<00:01:34.270> torque<00:01:34.780> you<00:01:35.350> know<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:35.590> sugu

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
wanting more torque you know that sugu

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.969 
wanting more torque you know that sugu
sound<00:01:36.460> this<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.479> on<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.750> other<00:01:37.840> hand<00:01:38.140> this<00:01:38.920> is

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
sound this one on the other hand this is

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.469 
sound this one on the other hand this is
going<00:01:39.190> to<00:01:39.250> be<00:01:39.310> more<00:01:39.430> for<00:01:39.670> power<00:01:40.060> now<00:01:40.299> this

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
going to be more for power now this

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.620 
going to be more for power now this
still<00:01:40.690> helps<00:01:40.990> reduce<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.500> reduce<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.040> dip

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
still helps reduce that reduce the dip

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.000 
still helps reduce that reduce the dip
compared<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.750> factory<00:01:44.110> manifold<00:01:44.619> but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
compared to the factory manifold but

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.450 
compared to the factory manifold but
this<00:01:45.760> one<00:01:45.970> is<00:01:46.090> more<00:01:46.270> for<00:01:46.500> power<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.920> that's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
this one is more for power and that's

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.830 
this one is more for power and that's
really<00:01:48.909> going<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.210> be<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.479> difference

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
really going to be the difference

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.330 
really going to be the difference
between<00:01:50.020> these<00:01:50.409> two<00:01:50.650> they're<00:01:50.799> both<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.159> same

significantly lighter than stock round
five<00:02:12.520> pounds<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.090> believe<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.420> equal<00:02:14.110> length

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
five pounds I believe the equal length

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.740 
five pounds I believe the equal length
is<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.710> little<00:02:15.070> bit<00:02:15.220> lighter<00:02:15.570> compared<00:02:16.570> to<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
is a little bit lighter compared to the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.780 
is a little bit lighter compared to the
unequal<00:02:17.110> like<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.620> due<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:18.040> extra<00:02:18.460> to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
unequal like just due to the extra to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.270 
unequal like just due to the extra to
being<00:02:18.970> involved<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.600> this<00:02:19.870> one<00:02:20.100> either<00:02:21.100> when

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
being involved on this one either when

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
being involved on this one either when
you<00:02:21.370> choose<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.670> don't<00:02:21.730> think<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.120> can<00:02:22.240> go

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300
