upright more don't like lean forward

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:53.449 
upright more don't like lean forward
stand<00:03:32.970> upright<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:51.830> right<00:03:52.830> after<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.220> you

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
stand upright and right after that you

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.309 
stand upright and right after that you
want<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.790> jump<00:03:54.120> right<00:03:54.180> into<00:03:54.420> these<00:03:54.660> basketball

want to jump right into these basketball

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.930 
want to jump right into these basketball
incline<00:03:55.800> push-ups<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:57.230> put<00:03:58.230> your<00:03:58.320> hands<00:03:58.940> about

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:16.159 
four inches apart and go to a nice and
slow<00:04:03.540> control<00:04:03.959> explode<00:04:04.650> up

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:24.440 

yeah

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.300 

all<00:04:25.450> right<00:04:25.540> guys<00:04:25.720> last<00:04:26.320> exercise<00:04:26.920> we<00:04:27.070> got<00:04:27.190> the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
all right guys last exercise we got the

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.130 
all right guys last exercise we got the
concentric<00:04:27.880> overload<00:04:28.420> incline<00:04:28.810> bench<00:04:28.990> press

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
concentric overload incline bench press

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.080 
concentric overload incline bench press
so<00:04:29.650> on<00:04:30.130> this<00:04:30.280> one<00:04:30.460> it's<00:04:30.640> really<00:04:30.820> important

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
so on this one it's really important

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.520 
so on this one it's really important
that<00:04:31.120> you<00:04:31.240> go<00:04:31.330> down<00:04:31.480> slow<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.350> controlled

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
that you go down slow and controlled

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.710 
that you go down slow and controlled
because<00:04:32.950> on<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.760> eccentric<00:04:34.060> portion<00:04:34.390> you're

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
because on the eccentric portion you're

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.240 
because on the eccentric portion you're
gonna<00:04:34.810> break<00:04:35.020> down<00:04:35.200> more<00:04:35.350> muscle<00:04:35.680> fibers<00:04:35.710> so

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
gonna break down more muscle fibers so

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.950 
gonna break down more muscle fibers so
got<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.880> spotter<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.420> I'm<00:04:37.540> gonna<00:04:37.660> make<00:04:37.720> sure<00:04:37.810> I

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
got a spotter here I'm gonna make sure I

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.810 
got a spotter here I'm gonna make sure I
go<00:04:38.110> nice<00:04:38.290> and<00:04:38.320> slow<00:04:38.650> and<00:04:38.680> controlled<00:04:38.770> I<00:04:39.310> go

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
go nice and slow and controlled I go

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.460 
go nice and slow and controlled I go
ahead<00:04:39.880> another<00:04:40.270> thing<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.750> do<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:41.080> discus<00:04:41.380> that

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
ahead another thing I do to discus that

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.840 
ahead another thing I do to discus that

super long arms so that you guys are

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.800 
super long arms so that you guys are
gonna<00:04:42.970> ask<00:04:43.150> why<00:04:43.270> I<00:04:43.330> do<00:04:43.420> this

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
gonna ask why I do this

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.270 
gonna ask why I do this
that's<00:04:44.260> what<00:04:44.380> there's<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:44.590> much<00:04:44.740> just<00:04:45.070> because
