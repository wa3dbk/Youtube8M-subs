00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.079

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.469
 we decided together 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.110
 better place an orphanage in kenya im 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.239
 more precisely, the sick for over 50 children 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.309
 We want something for this world 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.500

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.539
 strong and is still behind us 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 Together I know that we are together 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.680

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.480
 and that's why we call it the whole 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.010
 Also Michael Chain 2 will be the world too 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.989

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 we can collect that too 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.500
 we really can do together with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.439
 a roof over your head for 50 children 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.689
 Giving very cheap will also be to Kenya 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.280
 Fly in Canada when the donations 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.470
 arrived when the orphanage 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 is built and we will be on site 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.439
 See how the whole thing will look like 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.210
 Of course we will be the camera 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.550
 talk about it and make it difficult about it 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.500
 not to talk but now it can not 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.880
 say and when we all donate together 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.280
 if such a euro is for you 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.570
 probably 50 lives change from 50 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.670
 humans and these are all small 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.650

 happy and how you can donate and what 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.820

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.820
 you often fail the cellphone i have 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.890

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.410
 talked about it in more detail and 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.230
 There will be a link in the infobox below 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.720

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.220
 me forever and only together with you 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.830
 we can do it out there because 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.410
 some could move but 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.910
 our community is so big and we 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.680
 we can do much more together 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.690
 You can just change the world one 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.340

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.470
 enough talk about this project now 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.190
 and finally wants to know stone from the heart 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.390
 you do not like being able to say 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.690
 It could actually be with the bug 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 start tutorial on 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.440
 it's about the little cupcakes 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.360
 they are easy in yogurt if it is at 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.060
 German was I am degree author 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.280
 it is at least a longer spring 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.050
 Kate is the bear time now 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.430
 everywhere you can find strawberries 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.920
 and blueberries there is nothing 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.270
 better than you have to make a mistake 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.489
 and if you know we want to do that 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.739
 remains to do now shop around to it 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.760
 the first thing you need for the dough 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.600
 330 grams of flour 150 grams of soft butter then 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.530
 three eggs 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:11.200
 you need 125 grams of sugar 175 grams 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.420
 natural yoghurt two teaspoons baking powder 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.100
 and packets of vanilla sugar I will 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.490
 first time 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.220
 and vanilla sugar the sugar the avag 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.570
 Clock of lukas samischen do not worry that 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.430
 It looks now as if the Sun 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.300
 lumps as he now no longer 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.460
 indoors 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.170
 then I will add media 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.570
 and everything to a nice smooth dough 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.580
 I stir about 12 minutes 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.800
 The day should be stirred properly 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.230
 in your opinion , a little too tight 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.030
 is what depends on a lowering mehla 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.850
 of different hire but then goes 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.040
 a little bit of yogurt like me in something 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.440
 dig in addition 775 until you think that 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.600
 The dough is a bit creamier now 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.430
 I'll do it this way, that's mine 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.710
 play now from silicone is no matter which 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.750
 take here and are there first so doing 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.120
 like to go in then almost always 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.510
 two tablespoons but really full 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.870
 tablespoons per go and get that 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.150
 Whole in the preheated oven at 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.220
 175 degrees above and below for about 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.200
 25 minutes in the oven 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.510
 what happens in the meantime I do 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.910
 take here 250 degrees fruit dipped 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.470
 after 20 grams of food starch needs it 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.080
 200 grams of quark 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.630
 you need three tablespoons sugar 2 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.000
 tablespoon cream yogurt with only now 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.610
 a handful of fruits a little later 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.560
 decorate capex will nevertheless a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.570
 I take a small amount of fruits then 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.610

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.200

 the only thing you take her 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.270
 Of course her pictures are very good to me 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.190
 you have to give wash containers somewhere 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.130
 and they are first with the 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.230
 blender right by trying what 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.380
 I'll just do it next 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.969
 Nice big and gives this liquid 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.649
 in one 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:53.439
 key in and happens the whole thing 

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:56.689
 that you down would be so beautiful 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:59.360

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:01.419

 Kernels of strawberries or of the 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.049

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.569
 I take a pot give three 

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:11.449

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.149

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:17.149
 I will then heat up and always 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:19.099
 do not worry, that's hers too 

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:21.319
 look cluttered when the clubs have 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.939
 Just take it and see 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.819

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:27.349
 stirred whole with beater so long rum 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.879
 It was just plain 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.679
 i take the whole from the herzberg and 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.619
 agile are a bowl first this 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.689
 year old rin this beer pudding 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:37.069
 I'll call that when, and then you go 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:39.379
 still quark pure 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:42.079
 here are then two tablespoons of 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:44.569
 ivan elliott in and become the whole 

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:45.919
 just mix properly then 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.469
 Let's take the fruits of the woman 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.209
 took away they cut small 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.919
 the smaller the better the group 

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:54.050
 makes which smaller v li was there 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.059
 one in and the whole thing comes afterwards 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.800
 it went for roth has come before 20 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:59.360
 in which it has to freeze 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.889
 is getting really nice in the cold 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.539
 In the meantime we are one doing it 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.629
 Of course , I did not become what I am now 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.699
 I'm doing his head off a lot of fun 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:10.039
 I just take a knife like that 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:13.489
 Stay tuned and just open the lid 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:17.209
 cut completely then I take 

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:19.249
 this cold bear quark mass and 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:21.259
 Give it to your bag when 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.689
 her no injected oil has no problem 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.789
 wanted the mass leads purely 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:28.489
 Praise the whole thing in the end, cut it 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:30.110
 just the tip of me so broken 

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:33.139
 or weather has already been cut off 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.720
 is and will give this mass 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.610
 then discovered 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.460
 on top of it a blob of massa and 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.920
 now, there is no limit to euro creativity 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.020
 set to take as complete as me 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.300
 here for example and just decorate 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.610
 the whole is important that they then in 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.960
 Refrigerator arrives when sugar flowers 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.700
 They should be out fast 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.410
 be consumed because they are easy 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.540
 dissolve something as soon as you come along 

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.150
 Moisture in touch come in dollars 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:07:00.210
 to see my gentle bear spring 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:05.190
 cupcakes out and they are ready now 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:07.830
 14 cupcakes are something to be said 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.530
 easier to Vernal 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.000
 I always like to wait seasonal 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.980
 I do not know which ones with gender 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.350
 I think I do now only times the 

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:24.960
 here and how come the cupcakes 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.610
 they taste so good they are definitely the one 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.760
 difference remember who is part of something 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.500
 the slightly bolder the cupcakes 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.870
 are easy you have learned now too 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.220
 how I made the cupcakes you
