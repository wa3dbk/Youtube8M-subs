you're running with this interesting gun
um<00:00:46.920> i<00:00:47.010> would<00:00:47.969> put<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.149> silencer<00:00:48.600> on<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> if<00:00:49.200> you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
um i would put a silencer on it if you

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.209 
um i would put a silencer on it if you
could<00:00:49.730> because<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:51.000> does<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.570> does<00:00:52.039> left<00:00:53.039> in

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
could because it does it does left in

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.160 
could because it does it does left in
the<00:00:53.340> range<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.270> see<00:00:54.510> happening<00:00:54.719> here

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
the range like you see happening here

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.189 
the range like you see happening here
but<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.699> it<00:01:00.000> makes<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.899> aiming

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
but like that see it makes your aiming

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.280 
but like that see it makes your aiming
really<00:01:01.710> bad<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.690> it<00:01:03.690> causes<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.140> lot<00:01:04.229> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
really bad and it causes a lot of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.679 
really bad and it causes a lot of
destruction<00:01:04.860> but<00:01:04.979> if<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.760> can<00:01:06.030> put<00:01:06.659> a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
destruction but if you can put a

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
destruction but if you can put a
silencer<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.409> because<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.280> no<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.580> see

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
silencer on it because then no one see

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.270 
silencer on it because then no one see
you<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.150> your<00:01:09.270> radar<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.100> that's<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.189> good

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
you on your radar and that's a good

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.039 
you on your radar and that's a good
stuff<00:01:11.580> if<00:01:12.090> no<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.540> find<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
stuff if no one can find you on the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.340 
stuff if no one can find you on the
radar<00:01:13.229> you're<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.630> like<00:01:15.630> you're
