00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.030
 Here that we have disassembled 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.299
 they google up 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:21.090
 nodes may be different here there 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.000
 control usually do not want to eat now 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.390
 you litter the brain weaving knot other 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.520
 it makes no sense here it can 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.919
 on the internet even see yourself then 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.050
 we donâ€™t spend our time alone 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.079
 that for the attachment point I used 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.460
 sex nose is clear than he is good 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.200
 the rope does not enter the knot 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.510
 working here is called working firewood 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.820
 now if you come look here 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.710
 on the rope to come see it 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.610
 never let them enter here is more 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.840
 the lesson you will go down 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.460
 it works on the principle of only 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.800
 go too when you bend 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.890
 will pull down a bend in 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.899
 will be more than 90 degrees clear yes and 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.119
 ahead will happen on the Christmas tree itself 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.979
 that is, she is no longer clamping the rope 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.079
 that she can break can 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.399
 use for fast you dots 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:26.009
 mounting counter eight counter 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:31.499
 eight tie first normal 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:36.030
 eight that tied up from Julia around 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:40.350
 certain attachment of the building there is not 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:54.450
 I know the walls and let's go here small 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:57.950
 tree is about to 8 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:01.710
 pressed see yes 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.899
 roast such 8 k can be around this 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.899
 circled around the building free end and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.610
 we start looking where the working end is going 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.390
 just repeat the same rope and we 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:30.450
 so we can pull the rope that we can 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:45.840
 it will be more convenient to go through the door so let's go 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:47.840
 do the same thing with eyes xap nose 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.160
 this is when we have a lot of time to kiss 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.150
 eight is a very quick see 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.959
 less than replace 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.910
 around any any long here vosmerochka 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.109
 of it will drag on but that way 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.049
 all delayed 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:06.810
 why the eight they bowlin like 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.209
 some there do and 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.420
 most eight removes strength 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.450
 the ropes are only 30 percent walking 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.650
 removes 60 percent strength 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:25.680
 way it takes away or what because 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.519
 kink it is more direct so 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.410
 motorist 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:33.600
 who have cars have quite there yet 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.299
 for the bundle here we have not one rope 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.850
 enough for one rope 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.940
 enough if we have problems somewhere 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.739
 there on top 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.129
 the same can be on the principle of the eight 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.769
 can be fastened 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:56.450
 You can more more fast way now 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:58.250
 show it to the counter node take on 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.150
 end of the rope that will end you 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.810
 we will assume here it is 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.870
 will end 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:12.129
 then come closer here take a new assured 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:18.799
 invest first in the ring 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:21.079
 then for the rope ring I 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:32.860
 always do an extra turn and 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:35.660
 then I run here this counter 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.770
 how could he not drag on first 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.190
 easy to untie 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.180
 and he won't pull more he doesn't 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:48.099
 stretch on static novy rok this 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.099
 generally perfect survived for a bundle tree 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.990
 there will be an opportunity somehow I'll give you another 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.560
 I will show you how to cross quickly 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.560
 pull on
