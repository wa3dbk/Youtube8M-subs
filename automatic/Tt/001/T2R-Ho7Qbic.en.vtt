zippers rearranged because there's those
three<00:00:36.390> zippers<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.930> then<00:00:37.170> set<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.380> zipper

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
three zippers and then set that zipper

so you have that zipper we'll close it
all<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> way<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.890> all<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> way<00:00:41.100> around

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
all the way if I go all the way around

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.729

other<00:00:45.360> way<00:00:45.950> because<00:00:46.950> right<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
other way because right now we have a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.260 
other way because right now we have a
completely<00:00:48.300> loose<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.989> get<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> closed<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:50.270> so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
completely loose to get it closed up so

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.420 
completely loose to get it closed up so
if<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.690> close<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.199> far<00:00:52.739> left<00:00:52.770> zipper<00:00:53.219> only

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
if I close that far left zipper only

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.950 
if I close that far left zipper only
half<00:00:53.579> way<00:00:53.760> then<00:00:54.000> half<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> doors<00:00:54.449> open<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.840> I

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
half way then half the doors open if I

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
half way then half the doors open if I
close<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.620> all<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.070> doors<00:00:56.250> open

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
close it all the way all the doors open

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.500 
close it all the way all the doors open
and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:58.250> this<00:00:59.250> zipper<00:00:59.699> would<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.420> able

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and then this zipper would then be able

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.950 
and then this zipper would then be able
to<00:01:00.660> open<00:01:00.989> up<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.350> door<00:01:01.590> half<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> then

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
to open up this door half way and then

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.020 
to open up this door half way and then
this<00:01:03.960> zipper<00:01:04.559> would<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.489> side<00:01:05.549> now

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
this zipper would be on this side now

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.539 
this zipper would be on this side now
and<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.020> able<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.350> open<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.860> half

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and it would be able to open up half

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.780 
and it would be able to open up half
that<00:01:08.790> door<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:10.010> we<00:01:11.010> got<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.250> open<00:01:11.310> all<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.640> way

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that door so we got it open all the way

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.240 
that door so we got it open all the way
for<00:01:12.030> now<00:01:15.110> we<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> sidewalk<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> we

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
for now we got a sidewalk here so we

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.370 
for now we got a sidewalk here so we
couldn't<00:01:18.140> connect<00:01:19.140> anything<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> anything<00:01:19.799> I

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
couldn't connect anything to anything I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.120 
couldn't connect anything to anything I
guess<00:01:22.380> we<00:01:22.470> could<00:01:22.619> have<00:01:22.740> connected<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
guess we could have connected it to the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.160 
guess we could have connected it to the
pole<00:01:26.130> poles<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.700> couldn't<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.170> guided

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pole poles but we couldn't have guided

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.760 
pole poles but we couldn't have guided
out<00:01:28.610> at<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:30.200> little<00:01:31.200> work<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.619> got

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
out at all little work I think we got

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
out at all little work I think we got
everything<00:01:31.950> we<00:01:32.100> said<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> buy<00:01:32.759> extra<00:01:32.909> poles

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
everything we said to buy extra poles

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.289 
everything we said to buy extra poles
like<00:01:33.540> I've<00:01:33.689> seen<00:01:33.810> before<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.820> these<00:01:35.939> dippers

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
like I've seen before and these dippers

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.480 
like I've seen before and these dippers
are<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> same<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.710> waterproof<00:01:38.009> side

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
are the same this is the waterproof side

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.889 
are the same this is the waterproof side
of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> tent<00:01:42.829> more<00:01:43.829> storage<00:01:44.130> pockets

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.060 

so<00:01:47.380> when<00:01:47.530> we<00:01:47.619> get<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.119> garage<00:01:49.119> on<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.590> can<00:01:50.740> put

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.699 
going to take it off you hold the stake
we<00:03:10.489> think<00:03:10.819> this<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.270> it<00:03:11.540> this<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.319> how<00:03:12.410> we<00:03:12.470> did

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
we think this is it this is how we did

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.000 
we think this is it this is how we did
it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
it

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.610 
it
we<00:03:13.250> velkoz<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.819> up<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:16.160> then<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.400> top<00:03:16.819> has<00:03:17.620> the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
we velkoz it up and then the top has the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.000 
we velkoz it up and then the top has the
bottom<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:20.170> rainfly<00:03:21.170> has<00:03:21.350> velcro<00:03:21.620> on<00:03:21.920> the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
bottom of the rainfly has velcro on the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.370 
bottom of the rainfly has velcro on the
top<00:03:22.489> of<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.819> tent<00:03:23.209> has<00:03:23.480> velcro<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.020> we<00:03:24.140> think

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
top of the tent has velcro so we think

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.240 
top of the tent has velcro so we think
that's<00:03:24.620> how<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.769> do<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:26.000> then<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:27.250> cinch

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
that's how you do it and then you cinch

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.410 
that's how you do it and then you cinch
them<00:03:28.400> together<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.030> makes<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.300> little

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
them together and it makes a little

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.199 
them together and it makes a little
pocket<00:03:29.780> that<00:03:30.019> this<00:03:30.349> end<00:03:30.709> right<00:03:31.370> here<00:03:31.730> goes<00:03:31.940> in

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
pocket that this end right here goes in

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.270 
pocket that this end right here goes in
so<00:03:32.450> that's<00:03:32.720> what<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.870> think<00:03:33.050> we<00:03:33.140> do<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.290> so<00:03:33.590> it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
so that's what I think we do it so it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.300 
so that's what I think we do it so it
was<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.400> guess<00:03:35.680> we're<00:03:36.680> hoping<00:03:36.890> that's<00:03:37.010> it

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.269
