00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
digestive fire or ogni so it's good to

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.490 
digestive fire or ogni so it's good to
understand<00:01:26.460> what<00:01:27.030> will<00:01:27.420> support<00:01:28.049> digestion

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
understand what will support digestion

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.090

and also what will completely stop it or

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.460 
and also what will completely stop it or
slow<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.700> down<00:01:34.220> so<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> first<00:01:35.729> step<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.990> eat

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
slow it down so the first step is to eat

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.910 
slow it down so the first step is to eat
your<00:01:37.650> largest<00:01:38.040> meal<00:01:38.400> around<00:01:38.820> noon<00:01:39.920> there's

two Pizza cycles in a day the first one

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.240 
two Pizza cycles in a day the first one
is<00:01:43.350> between<00:01:43.799> 10am<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.229> 2pm<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:46.979> when

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
is between 10am and 2pm and that's when

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.760 
is between 10am and 2pm and that's when
the<00:01:47.280> fire<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.420> its<00:01:48.899> strongest<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the fire is at its strongest the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
the fire is at its strongest the
digestive<00:01:50.340> fire<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.329> makes<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.780> lot<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
digestive fire so it makes a lot of

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.710 
digestive fire so it makes a lot of
