00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello my name is Victoria Idina 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.760
 the author of the video program school components 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.650
 rhyme on guitar and piano 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.929
 Today an additional lesson video course 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.900
 for my ear students but also for those 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.670
 who follow my update 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.529
 videos talk about how 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.970
 right to stand every guitar 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.720
 guitarist has a favorite way 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.510
 settings my students from courses know 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.400
 my tricky way to customize 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.929
 unparalleled win-win in any 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.750
 conditions does not depend on anything 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.329
 what clothespins and tweak enough 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.399
 just now I want to say how 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.530
 properly tune the guitar that we 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.200
 must comply in any case how would 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.420
 you did not set up the tool it is very 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 it is important to know that to avoid in large 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 big very trouble that I have 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.640
 because when we tune the guitar we 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.520
 should keep the guitar in this way 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.309
 to be pulling 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.430
 country we were calm in case 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.850
 cliff it does not fall on the street and so 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.689
 more like that look here something we 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 not see anything here we have another construction 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.680
 famous moles of what we are here to watch 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.299
 we can touch each form by touch 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.490
 This is how it is very important and 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.740
 people sitting next to you 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.049
 in the same way you have to turn them away 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 either turn away summer or ask 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.979
 man to move away from it back in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.619
 avoidance of a very, very big tragedy 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.190
 I had to see how the string broke 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.560
 a century girls 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.380
 this soap yard playing the guitars myself 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.630
 then I was 13 years old and so 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.730
 I saw the picture and remembered for life 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.500
 Thank God that is not in the eye of item it is 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.900
 caught and the century it was the most 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.670
 scary thread this mind but because all 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.490
 what is connected with the guitar on must put 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.580
 just pleasure and more if you 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.600
 came from cold and cold and became immediately 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.510
 tune the guitar 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.030
 now right you need a little bit 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.000
 wait for the guitar to take the temperature 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.280
 room wait fingers cutting only 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.280
 then it is desirable to tune
