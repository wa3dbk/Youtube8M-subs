to worry about this stuff getting in my
drink<00:03:30.989> now<00:03:31.650> some<00:03:32.040> recipes<00:03:32.790> say<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.359> let<00:03:33.510> it

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
drink now some recipes say just let it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.259

seep overnight and reduce and take the

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.110 
seep overnight and reduce and take the
stuff<00:03:36.480> out<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.930> actually<00:03:37.139> leave<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:38.120> just

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
stuff out I actually leave it in I just

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.280 
stuff out I actually leave it in I just
keep<00:03:39.299> this<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.750> whole<00:03:39.930> entire<00:03:39.959> time
