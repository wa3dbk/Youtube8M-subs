00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.240 
quite a bit it looks more like a I don't
really<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.649> maybe<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> bulls-eye

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

to outline the area that you want your
logo<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.119> I'm<00:01:51.420> going<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.630> choose<00:01:51.810> this

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
logo to be so I'm going to choose this

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.319 
logo to be so I'm going to choose this
window<00:01:52.380> right<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> we're<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
window right here so we're just going to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.749 
window right here so we're just going to
outline<00:01:55.040> everything<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
outline everything as you can see it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.370 
outline everything as you can see it
looks<00:01:56.880> very<00:01:57.299> similar<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.780> illustre

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
looks very similar to illustre

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.639 
looks very similar to illustre
or<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:59.159> pen<00:01:59.369> tool<00:01:59.399> or<00:01:59.729> anything<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
or the pen tool or anything like that so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.649 
or the pen tool or anything like that so
just<00:02:01.649> quickly<00:02:01.829> outline<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> tool<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.600> then

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
just quickly outline the tool and then

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.810 
just quickly outline the tool and then
you'll<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.170> looks<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.649> weird<00:02:05.039> like<00:02:05.549> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you'll see it looks it's weird like this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.460 
you'll see it looks it's weird like this
but<00:02:06.119> it's<00:02:06.960> sort<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:08.899> learns<00:02:09.899> where<00:02:10.110> you're

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
but it's sort of learns where you're

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.140 
but it's sort of learns where you're
going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.679> put<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.580> already<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.880> this

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
going to put it so you already have this

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.420 
going to put it so you already have this
nice<00:02:12.360> grid<00:02:12.660> ready<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.709> to<00:02:13.830> use<00:02:13.860> all<00:02:14.340> you

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
nice grid ready for you to use all you

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.940 
nice grid ready for you to use all you
have<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.610> do<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.030> just<00:02:15.239> do<00:02:15.390> command<00:02:15.810> V<00:02:16.260> or<00:02:16.290> ctrl

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
have to do is just do command V or ctrl

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.140 
have to do is just do command V or ctrl
v<00:02:17.190> whichever<00:02:17.790> one<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.300> you're<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.660> Mac<00:02:18.780> or<00:02:19.110> a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
v whichever one if you're on a Mac or a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.890 
v whichever one if you're on a Mac or a
or<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.510> on<00:02:21.920> Windows<00:02:22.920> computer<00:02:23.599> so<00:02:24.599> now<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
or a on Windows computer so now that you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.320 
or a on Windows computer so now that you
have<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.410> here<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:26.069> drag<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.730> over<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
have this in here just drag it over and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.050 
have this in here just drag it over and
it<00:02:27.420> should<00:02:27.660> auto<00:02:28.170> lock<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.709> dit<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.970> you

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
it should auto lock on dit so that you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.240 
it should auto lock on dit so that you
can<00:02:30.239> see<00:02:30.450> it's<00:02:30.599> already<00:02:30.830> it's<00:02:31.830> really<00:02:32.130> cool

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
can see it's already it's really cool

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.280 
can see it's already it's really cool
but<00:02:32.489> it<00:02:32.580> most<00:02:33.269> of<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.420> times<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.870> might<00:02:34.049> be<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
but it most of the times it might be a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.320 
but it most of the times it might be a
little<00:02:34.500> bit<00:02:34.650> too<00:02:34.769> big<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.610> that's<00:02:35.760> why<00:02:35.910> all<00:02:36.209> you

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
little bit too big so that's why all you

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.360 
little bit too big so that's why all you
have<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.750> do<00:02:37.019> can<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.950> move<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.250> over

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
have to do is do can just move it over

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.509 
have to do is do can just move it over
so<00:02:38.849> you<00:02:38.940> can<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.420> corners<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.920> let's

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
so you can see the corners like so let's

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.339 
so you can see the corners like so let's
do<00:02:41.760> ctrl<00:02:42.120> T<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.720> then<00:02:43.590> while<00:02:43.799> holding<00:02:44.040> shift

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
do ctrl T and then while holding shift

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.490 
do ctrl T and then while holding shift
just<00:02:46.349> scale<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.099> down<00:02:47.870> scale<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.959> down<00:02:49.019> so<00:02:49.319> it's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
just scale it down scale it down so it's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.250 
just scale it down scale it down so it's
the<00:02:49.970> right<00:02:50.970> size<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.720> want<00:02:51.810> it<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.230> be
