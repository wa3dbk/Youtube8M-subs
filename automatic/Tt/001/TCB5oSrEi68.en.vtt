00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hello friends today I want you 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:12.120
 show what is the maximum allowed 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 the slope of the cloud when the load is low 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.440
 there is a milling cutter or is there something else when 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.490
 what is the maximum slope 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.650
 You can work that is when it disappears 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.070
 pressure, yes. 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.900
 here is the boundary there is pressure no pressure 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.719
 oil level in the crankcase from me now 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.700
 somewhere 5 centimeters five six 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 centimeters fit under the pallet and here's how 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.460
 would be if a screwdriver or something so 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.600
 measure the subject here we measure 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 what about thats six centimeters 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.949
 oil on the dipstick probes not factory I myself 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.840
 already redid a little 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.550
 oil level lowered here we are now 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.739
 I will also demonstrate on the instrument 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:07.530
 manometer stock arrow at what angle 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.700
 the slopes of the arrow will fall on 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.700
 zero all look 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:07.299
 guys here is such a bias 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.840
 that is, it is the limit of the control light to 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:15.030
 not lit but gauge pressure 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.030
 pillows then there is some kind there know 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.730
 let's say so maybe the oil pump pumps like 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.290
 would oil with air bubbles pressure 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.140
 a little bit there is one only somewhere there 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.180
 two and a half and this is such limits 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.050
 but there are arrows like basic 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.180
 pressure below never pushes itself 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.520
 you see what level this angle 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.000
 let's say well now I am again 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.160
 I will lead 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.080
 he sees it by looking at the spots 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.080
 device behaves 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.120
 this is normal 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.340
 almost 7 pen david 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.960
 this video is especially for you there I would 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.390
 sacrificing your walker to you 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.100
 show as much as possible within what limits 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.410
 I think there is something terrible as the load 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.900
 no oil on any there and calculation 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.810
 there is pressure a little bit of her 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.630
 it's like for all of you all guys all 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.760
 thanks bye bye bye bye guys yet 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.880
 such an interesting thing, as it were, look 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.740
 after i cant and like in 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.500
 the oil got into the air that is the arrow 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.000
 filed rose now the sound disappeared 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.430
 this chicane 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.530
 picking steadily holding oil articles 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:51.600
 hot warm that's as if clearly 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.970
 hold 6 half 7 i.e. arrow 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.970
 I'll pay attention now I 'll show you 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.610
 I would stand 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.790
 that is, as it were, such that in this 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.630
 such a leap is no longer the reason 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.360
 really discussing with this 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.169
 attraction valve well everything then 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.169
 until
