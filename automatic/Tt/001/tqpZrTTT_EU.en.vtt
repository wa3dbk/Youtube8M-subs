multiple<00:02:16.960> different<00:02:17.350> colors<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:18.010> think<00:02:18.550> it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
multiple different colors I think it

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.460 
multiple different colors I think it
comes<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.240> orange<00:02:19.630> yellows<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.230> bright

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.020 
comes in like orange yellows and bright
greens<00:02:20.770> as<00:02:20.980> well<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.640> want<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.880> change

greens as well so if you want to change

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.540 
greens as well so if you want to change
up<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.360> color<00:02:22.569> then<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:24.190> can<00:02:24.220> really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
up the color then you can you can really

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.040 
up the color then you can you can really
just<00:02:24.580> choose<00:02:25.270> any<00:02:25.450> color<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:25.870> I'm

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
pretty sure there's around five or six

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.490 
pretty sure there's around five or six
different<00:02:27.910> colors<00:02:28.390> which<00:02:28.930> makes<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.350> just

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
different colors which makes it just

is<00:03:18.250> actually<00:03:18.640> quite<00:03:18.880> better<00:03:19.120> than<00:03:19.360> of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
is actually quite better than of

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.810 
is actually quite better than of
headsets<00:03:20.019> so<00:03:20.200> he<00:03:20.739> said<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.040> audio<00:03:21.340> quality<00:03:21.519> is

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
headsets so he said the audio quality is

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.250 
headsets so he said the audio quality is
fine<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.329> couldn't<00:03:22.570> hear<00:03:22.660> really<00:03:22.959> hear<00:03:23.110> any

background<00:03:23.440> noise<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.850> noise

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
background noise so the noise

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.880 
background noise so the noise
cancellation<00:03:25.450> feature<00:03:25.810> must<00:03:26.290> be<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.470> good<00:03:26.709> one

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890
