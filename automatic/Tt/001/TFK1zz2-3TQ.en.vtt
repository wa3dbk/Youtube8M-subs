well I'm against nightmares not that bad
but<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.359> other<00:00:24.539> song<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.869> they<00:00:25.140> put<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.410> on

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
but that other song that they put it on

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.210 
but that other song that they put it on
black<00:00:25.740> ops<00:00:26.000> isn't<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.119> great<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.289> actually

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
black ops isn't that great but actually

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.040 
black ops isn't that great but actually
the<00:00:29.340> one<00:00:29.490> song<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.789> stood<00:00:30.269> out<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.630> me<00:00:30.660> was

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the one song that stood out to me was

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.100 
the one song that stood out to me was
fiction<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.949> reason<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.579> that<00:00:32.700> was

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
fiction and the reason for that was

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
fiction and the reason for that was
because<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.380> thought<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.590> recognized<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.399> revs

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
because I thought I recognized the revs

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.630 
because I thought I recognized the revs
voice<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> then<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> looked<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.160> sure

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
voice so then I looked it up and sure

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.860 
voice so then I looked it up and sure
enough<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:39.059> was<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.480> Rev<00:00:39.980> so<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.870> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
enough it was the Rev so you know and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
enough it was the Rev so you know and
I'm<00:00:43.379> sure<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.710> know<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.190> Rev<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.640> no

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I'm sure as you know the Rev is no

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.560 
I'm sure as you know the Rev is no

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.970 
out the rest I'll definitely post that
all<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.420> intro<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:21.200> think<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:21.860> can

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
all right so the intro I think you can

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.280 
all right so the intro I think you can
either<00:02:22.130> slide<00:02:22.519> this<00:02:22.880> which<00:02:23.360> sounds<00:02:23.750> cool<00:02:23.989> but

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
either slide this which sounds cool but

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.479 
either slide this which sounds cool but
you<00:02:24.380> obviously<00:02:25.099> can't<00:02:25.370> slide<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:25.970> piano<00:02:26.269> so

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
you obviously can't slide on a piano so

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.960 
you obviously can't slide on a piano so
it's<00:02:28.489> what<00:02:29.390> is<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.750> that's<00:02:30.110> eight<00:02:30.970> seven

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
it's what is that that's eight seven

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.949 
it's what is that that's eight seven
eight<00:02:32.709> so<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.829> sounds<00:02:34.099> like<00:02:34.569> or<00:02:35.569> if<00:02:35.720> you<00:02:35.780> wanna

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
eight so it sounds like or if you wanna

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.250 
eight so it sounds like or if you wanna
slide<00:02:36.230> me<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:37.450> obviously<00:02:38.450> it'll<00:02:38.629> last<00:02:38.900> longer

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
slide me and obviously it'll last longer

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.300 
slide me and obviously it'll last longer
with<00:02:39.530> Distortion

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
with Distortion

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.030 
with Distortion
at<00:02:41.060> all<00:02:41.269> it'll<00:02:41.629> sound<00:02:41.810> like<00:02:42.079> oh<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.769> don't

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
at all it'll sound like oh so you don't

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.569 
at all it'll sound like oh so you don't
hear<00:02:46.340> like<00:02:46.549> fade-out<00:02:47.060> when<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.329> slide<00:02:47.569> back

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
hear like fade-out when you slide back

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.850 
hear like fade-out when you slide back
