00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.449 
that that our lab is primarily focused
on<00:02:35.200> treatment<00:02:36.200> development<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.920> think<00:02:37.250> it's

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
on treatment development I think it's

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.720 
on treatment development I think it's
very<00:02:40.720> helpful<00:02:41.720> for<00:02:41.750> us<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.170> be<00:02:42.290> focused<00:02:42.739> in<00:02:42.890> one

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
very helpful for us to be focused in one

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.750 
very helpful for us to be focused in one
area<00:02:44.090> will<00:02:44.420> be<00:02:44.660> it<00:02:44.750> across<00:02:45.110> both<00:02:45.799> diagnostic

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
area will be it across both diagnostic

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.190 
area will be it across both diagnostic
groups<00:02:47.060> as<00:02:47.330> well<00:02:47.360> as<00:02:48.970> age<00:02:49.970> groups<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:50.989> my

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
groups as well as age groups like my

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.289 
groups as well as age groups like my
colleague<00:02:51.530> Eunice<00:02:51.890> Chen<00:02:52.190> who<00:02:52.819> works<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.150> the

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
colleague Eunice Chen who works on the

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.160 
colleague Eunice Chen who works on the
adult<00:02:53.540> side<00:02:54.370> as<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:56.120> share<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.629> same<00:02:56.660> interest

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
adult side as we share the same interest

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.650 
adult side as we share the same interest
in<00:02:57.349> terms<00:02:57.590> of<00:02:57.739> treatment<00:02:57.980> development<00:02:58.700> but

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
in terms of treatment development but

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.360 
in terms of treatment development but
she's<00:02:59.930> primarily<00:03:00.349> focused<00:03:00.859> on<00:03:00.920> the<00:03:01.040> treatment

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
she's primarily focused on the treatment

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.369 
she's primarily focused on the treatment
development<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:01.910> adults<00:03:02.150> with<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.840> indoors

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
development of adults with the indoors

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.449 
development of adults with the indoors
and<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.650> looks<00:03:03.799> very<00:03:03.890> different<00:03:04.129> from<00:03:04.370> what

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
and it looks very different from what

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.970 
and it looks very different from what
I'm<00:03:04.670> doing<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.239> terms<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.930> mobilizing<00:03:06.530> parents

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
I'm doing in terms of mobilizing parents

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.680 
I'm doing in terms of mobilizing parents
to<00:03:07.069> be<00:03:07.250> engaged<00:03:07.549> in<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.120> treatment<00:03:08.359> of<00:03:08.540> their

to be engaged in the treatment of their

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.720 
to be engaged in the treatment of their
teens<00:03:09.140> whereas<00:03:10.900> dr.<00:03:11.900> Chen<00:03:12.140> has<00:03:12.349> to<00:03:12.650> focus<00:03:13.340> on

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
teens whereas dr. Chen has to focus on

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.690 
teens whereas dr. Chen has to focus on
the<00:03:13.970> adult<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.590> doesn't<00:03:15.980> have<00:03:16.069> access<00:03:16.250> to

two<00:03:17.450> parents<00:03:18.379> or<00:03:18.500> partners<00:03:18.920> necessarily<00:03:19.579> to

assist in that treatment process she was

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.960 
assist in that treatment process she was
as<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:22.970> specific<00:03:23.569> interest<00:03:23.720> in<00:03:24.940> adults<00:03:25.940> with

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
as a specific interest in adults with

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.390 
as a specific interest in adults with
very<00:03:26.390> complex<00:03:26.950> presentations<00:03:27.950> of<00:03:28.069> eagerness

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
very complex presentations of eagerness

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.150 
very complex presentations of eagerness
always<00:03:28.669> in<00:03:28.819> that<00:03:28.849> they<00:03:29.060> have<00:03:29.180> comorbid<00:03:30.160> access

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
always in that they have comorbid access

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.890 
always in that they have comorbid access
to<00:03:31.310> disorders<00:03:31.849> more<00:03:32.450> specifically

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
to disorders more specifically

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.650 
to disorders more specifically
personality<00:03:33.620> disorders<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.720> working<00:03:35.720> with<00:03:35.870> a

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
personality disorders so working with a

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.319 
personality disorders so working with a
spectrum<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.919> patients<00:03:39.919> who<00:03:40.130> are<00:03:40.430> very<00:03:40.910> taxing

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
spectrum of patients who are very taxing

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.650 
spectrum of patients who are very taxing
and<00:03:41.720> very<00:03:42.380> treatment-resistant<00:03:43.310> I<00:03:44.000> think

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
and very treatment-resistant I think

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.000 
and very treatment-resistant I think
she's<00:03:44.840> making<00:03:45.260> excellent<00:03:46.250> headway<00:03:46.519> in

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
she's making excellent headway in

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.550 
she's making excellent headway in
developing<00:03:49.010> new<00:03:49.190> treatments<00:03:49.340> to<00:03:50.380> fit<00:03:51.380> that

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
developing new treatments to fit that

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.170 
developing new treatments to fit that
patient<00:03:51.919> population<00:03:52.430> in<00:03:52.549> to<00:03:52.700> test<00:03:52.940> those

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
patient population in to test those

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.809 
patient population in to test those
treatments<00:03:54.169> in<00:03:54.530> randomized<00:03:54.980> control<00:03:55.370> studies

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
treatments in randomized control studies

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.509 
treatments in randomized control studies
so<00:03:56.329> across<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.410> lab<00:03:57.590> we<00:03:57.919> probably<00:03:58.160> have

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
so across the the lab we probably have

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.640 
so across the the lab we probably have
in<00:03:58.669> any<00:03:58.819> one<00:03:59.030> time<00:03:59.269> four<00:03:59.540> or<00:03:59.660> five<00:03:59.840> treatment

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
in any one time four or five treatment

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.099 
in any one time four or five treatment
studies<00:04:00.950> running<00:04:01.359> which<00:04:02.359> i<00:04:02.599> think<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:03.489> very

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
studies running which i think is very

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.619 
studies running which i think is very
good<00:04:06.109> and<00:04:06.379> focused<00:04:07.220> endeavor<00:04:07.609> then<00:04:08.329> you<00:04:08.480> have

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
good and focused endeavor then you have

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.599 
good and focused endeavor then you have
the<00:04:09.079> conference<00:04:09.470> coming<00:04:09.769> up<00:04:09.919> in<00:04:10.069> April<00:04:10.400> here

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609
