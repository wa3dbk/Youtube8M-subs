the<00:01:41.990> either<00:01:42.170> so<00:01:42.409> I<00:01:42.469> get<00:01:42.590> that<00:01:44.799> your<00:01:45.799> typical

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
the either so I get that your typical

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.590 
the either so I get that your typical
kind<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.430> fret<00:01:46.609> tapping<00:01:46.969> motion<00:01:47.270> if<00:01:47.420> you're

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
kind of fret tapping motion if you're

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.120 
kind of fret tapping motion if you're
not<00:01:47.750> familiar<00:01:47.990> with<00:01:48.380> it<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.920> really

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
not familiar with it it's really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.260 
not familiar with it it's really
important<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.549> we<00:01:49.729> end<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.060> with<00:01:50.180> that

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
important that we end it with that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.640 
important that we end it with that
triplet

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.470 
triplet
but<00:01:52.580> what<00:01:52.730> we're<00:01:52.880> gonna<00:01:52.970> do<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.270> we're<00:01:53.420> gonna

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.859 
but what we're gonna do is we're gonna
cross<00:01:53.780> strings<00:01:54.140> here<00:01:54.290> check<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:54.590> out

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:08.639 

that's<00:01:57.799> kind<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.189> neat<00:01:58.369> little<00:01:58.399> motion

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.490 

very<00:02:09.429> dreamy<00:02:09.729> very<00:02:10.269> dream<00:02:10.569> sequence<00:02:11.080> II<00:02:11.200> right

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
very dreamy very dream sequence II right

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.699 
very dreamy very dream sequence II right
and<00:02:11.709> what's<00:02:11.980> kind<00:02:12.129> of<00:02:12.220> cool<00:02:12.400> about<00:02:12.459> this

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.440 

and<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.640> takes<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.939> little<00:02:21.209> bit<00:02:21.390> of

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and it takes a little bit of

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.000 
and it takes a little bit of
coordination<00:02:21.840> between<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.469> hands<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.799> know

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
coordination between the hands you know

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.289 
coordination between the hands you know
I<00:02:23.189> mean<00:02:23.340> typically<00:02:23.700> when<00:02:23.849> we're<00:02:24.000> doing<00:02:24.090> this

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
I mean typically when we're doing this

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.390 
I mean typically when we're doing this
stuff

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.820 

we<00:02:29.299> kind<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.599> work<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.930> individual<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.709> be

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
we kind of work it individual so to be

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.710 
we kind of work it individual so to be
able<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.069> switch<00:02:31.340> between<00:02:31.370> strings<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:32.510> kind

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
able to switch between strings it's kind

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.180 
able to switch between strings it's kind
of<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.870> bit<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.049> a<00:02:33.170> trick<00:02:33.409> but<00:02:33.620> still<00:02:33.860> something

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
of a bit of a trick but still something

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.619 
of a bit of a trick but still something
that's<00:02:34.280> really<00:02:34.610> fun<00:02:34.790> to<00:02:34.819> do<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.239> so<00:02:35.390> we<00:02:35.510> get

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
that's really fun to do and so we get

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:57.300 
that's really fun to do and so we get
this<00:02:35.810> nice

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.410 

and<00:02:58.310> now<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.459> might<00:02:58.610> hit<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:58.910> note<00:02:59.090> here<00:02:59.300> on

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
and now I might hit this note here on

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.880 
and now I might hit this note here on
the<00:02:59.450> third<00:02:59.540> string<00:02:59.959> just<00:03:00.380> every<00:03:00.560> once<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.800> a

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
the third string just every once in a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.040 
the third string just every once in a
while<00:03:00.920> so<00:03:01.190> that<00:03:01.220> way<00:03:01.490> I<00:03:01.730> can<00:03:02.270> give<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.780> a<00:03:02.840> slight

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
while so that way I can give it a slight

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:13.330 
while so that way I can give it a slight
change<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.410> there<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:03.920> an<00:03:04.040> E<00:03:04.220> no<00:03:04.459> right

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.740 

right<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:13.850> we<00:03:13.910> get<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.150> nice<00:03:14.300> little<00:03:14.330> change

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
right and we get that nice little change

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.750 
right and we get that nice little change
in<00:03:14.870> there

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.120 

and<00:03:21.880> it's<00:03:22.060> got<00:03:22.450> this<00:03:22.600> like<00:03:22.900> angled<00:03:23.470> motion<00:03:23.950> you

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
and it's got this like angled motion you

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.380 
and it's got this like angled motion you
know<00:03:24.250> where<00:03:24.400> I'm<00:03:24.490> going<00:03:24.760> from<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.000> ninth<00:03:25.180> fret

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
know where I'm going from the ninth fret

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.030 
know where I'm going from the ninth fret
back<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.810> tenth<00:03:26.020> fret<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.380> we're<00:03:26.770> really

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
back to the tenth fret and we're really

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:42.610 
back to the tenth fret and we're really
switching<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:27.880> here

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.600 

totally<00:03:43.620> cool<00:03:43.800> sounds<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.370> a<00:03:44.400> dream

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
totally cool sounds like a dream

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.040 
totally cool sounds like a dream
sequence<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.180> could<00:03:45.330> put<00:03:45.450> some<00:03:45.569> delay<00:03:45.840> on

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
sequence you could put some delay on

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.390 
sequence you could put some delay on
that<00:03:46.080> thing<00:03:46.380> a<00:03:46.500> little<00:03:46.590> bit<00:03:46.770> of<00:03:46.860> reverb<00:03:47.130> and

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
that thing a little bit of reverb and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.400 
that thing a little bit of reverb and
take<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.480> can<00:03:48.510> move<00:03:48.989> this<00:03:49.230> around

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
take this and you can move this around

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.750 
take this and you can move this around
man<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:49.980> can<00:03:50.130> move<00:03:50.280> this<00:03:50.400> just<00:03:50.640> about

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
man you can move this just about

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.699 
man you can move this just about
anywhere<00:03:51.150> maybe<00:03:51.630> try<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:51.959> mimic<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.500> same

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
anywhere maybe try to mimic the same

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.330 
anywhere maybe try to mimic the same
thing<00:03:52.980> in<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:54.000> different<00:03:54.150> fretted<00:03:54.660> position

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.770 

you<00:03:59.340> could<00:03:59.459> do<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.730> in<00:03:59.819> an<00:03:59.940> octave<00:04:00.360> we<00:04:00.540> could<00:04:00.690> do

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
you could do it in an octave we could do

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.570 
you could do it in an octave we could do
it<00:04:00.870> here

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.760 

I<00:04:04.640> think<00:04:05.480> it's<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.690> concept<00:04:06.170> that<00:04:06.440> we're<00:04:06.620> going

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
I think it's a concept that we're going

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.440 
I think it's a concept that we're going
with<00:04:07.010> right<00:04:07.220> we're<00:04:07.430> saying<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.910> on<00:04:08.090> when<00:04:08.330> we

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
with right we're saying that on when we

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.940 
with right we're saying that on when we
Fred<00:04:08.690> tap<00:04:08.930> we<00:04:09.080> don't<00:04:09.230> necessarily<00:04:09.770> have<00:04:09.920> to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
Fred tap we don't necessarily have to

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.110 
Fred tap we don't necessarily have to
stick<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.820> on<00:04:10.910> one<00:04:11.090> string<00:04:12.430> into<00:04:13.430> our<00:04:13.490> little

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
stick it on one string into our little

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.790 
stick it on one string into our little
fancy<00:04:14.420> triplet<00:04:14.750> all<00:04:14.840> the<00:04:14.930> time<00:04:15.110> we<00:04:15.470> can<00:04:15.500> kind

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
fancy triplet all the time we can kind

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.930 
fancy triplet all the time we can kind
of<00:04:15.830> outline<00:04:16.100> chords<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.580> do<00:04:16.670> some<00:04:16.820> different

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
of outline chords and do some different

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.240 
of outline chords and do some different
things<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.450> some<00:04:17.570> wide<00:04:17.840> shifts<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.560> really

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
things and some wide shifts and really

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.680 
things and some wide shifts and really
really<00:04:19.430> something<00:04:19.820> that<00:04:20.030> was<00:04:20.150> popular<00:04:20.600> with

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
really something that was popular with

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.450 
really something that was popular with
this<00:04:20.840> player<00:04:21.049> something<00:04:21.799> else<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.250> we<00:04:22.340> can

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
this player something else that we can

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.550 
this player something else that we can
kind<00:04:22.670> of<00:04:22.730> do<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.240> expanding<00:04:24.110> off<00:04:24.230> this<00:04:24.380> other

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
kind of do and expanding off this other

kind of do and expanding off this other
position<00:04:24.770> here<00:04:25.190> we<00:04:25.280> got<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:25.670> right<00:04:29.620> all

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
position here we got this right all

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.720 
position here we got this right all
right<00:04:30.770> check<00:04:30.980> this<00:04:31.100> out<00:04:31.280> this<00:04:31.430> is<00:04:31.580> pretty
