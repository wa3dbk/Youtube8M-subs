two thousand eleven just when i hit the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.460 
two thousand eleven just when i hit the
high<00:00:12.269> points<00:00:14.690> overall<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> park<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.350> was

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
high points overall the park it was

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.529 
high points overall the park it was
enjoyable<00:00:16.980> experience<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.699> were<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
enjoyable experience we were here for a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.679 
enjoyable experience we were here for a
better<00:00:19.350> part<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.859> day<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.730> think<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.539> could

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
better part of a day I think you could

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.050 
better part of a day I think you could
do<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> park<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.439> long<00:00:22.650> day<00:00:22.920> a<00:00:23.189> day<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
do the park in a long day a day and a

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.960 
do the park in a long day a day and a
half<00:00:24.090> might<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.689> more<00:00:24.840> optimal<00:00:25.820> obviously<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
half might be more optimal obviously the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.349 
half might be more optimal obviously the
park<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.510> geared<00:00:28.109> towards<00:00:28.789> more<00:00:29.789> towards<00:00:30.090> kids

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
though most of them were for again

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.290

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.730 
pretty sunny it is it's a fairly large
park<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.689> worth<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> trip<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.649> were

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
park is it worth the trip if you were

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.550 
park is it worth the trip if you were
coming<00:01:47.040> from<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> considerable<00:01:47.700> distance

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
coming from a considerable distance

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.630 
coming from a considerable distance
might<00:01:49.560> not<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.860> too<00:01:50.040> bad<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:50.369> there's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
might not be too bad because there's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.889 
might not be too bad because there's
other<00:01:50.790> things<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.689> San

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
other things you can do here in San

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.550 
other things you can do here in San
Diego<00:01:52.350> so

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
Diego so

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.250 
Diego so
but<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.830> single<00:01:56.190> destination<00:01:56.370> I<00:01:57.140> guess<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
but as a single destination I guess it

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.680 
but as a single destination I guess it
depends<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.620> how<00:01:58.740> far<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.160> were<00:01:59.220> going<00:01:59.690> my

depends on how far you were going my
opinion<00:02:01.790> might<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:02.940> be<00:02:03.090> bad<00:02:04.010> you<00:02:05.010> know

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
weekend so the ride weights varied from

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.710 
weekend so the ride weights varied from
you<00:02:44.300> know<00:02:44.420> 45<00:02:45.230> minutes<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.450> according<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.510> some

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
you know 45 minutes to according to some

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.850 
you know 45 minutes to according to some
of<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.840> times<00:02:48.050> up<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.379> an<00:02:48.440> hour<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.709> half<00:02:48.830> so

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
of the times up to an hour and a half so

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.119 
of the times up to an hour and a half so
there<00:02:49.190> can<00:02:49.370> be<00:02:49.400> fairly<00:02:49.970> long<00:02:50.590> ride<00:02:51.590> weights<00:02:51.860> I

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
there can be fairly long ride weights I

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.789 
there can be fairly long ride weights I
think<00:02:52.730> I'd<00:02:52.819> probably<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:54.019> future<00:02:54.170> ago<00:02:54.590> during

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
think I'd probably the future ago during

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.430 
think I'd probably the future ago during
a<00:02:55.160> less<00:02:55.640> peaked<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:57.040> that's<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.220> me
