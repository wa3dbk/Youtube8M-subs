 from the mug he learned everything at all what 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.770
 accept think but so it became sad and 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.780
 insulting and embarrassing for what he did the prize 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.850
 that he fingers life to people and he decided 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.590
 change this is fine cartoon i would 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.270
 also obligate 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.609
 here and review and advise everyone 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.069
 the third movie is welcome or 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.099
 neighbors no entry recently watched 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.290
 this film is time to reconsider 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.970
 remembered and therefore I will tell you 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.040
 the film tells about two neighbors 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.959
 one neighbor he was not very much going 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.970
 celebrate christmas roses neighbor neighbor 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.400
 he decided to celebrate this holiday he 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.220
 secretly region your house over there so much 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.830
 Generally LEDs I just do not know 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.319
 his eyes run so he did 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.489
 bright luminous his house that his became 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.049
 seen from space 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.180
 naturally half didn't like it 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.730
 cities and especially didn't like it 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.920
 neighbor however loud music prevented sleep 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.650
 prevented all live and all these LEDs 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.870
 in the network of fan years of this house they shone in 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.239
 the window interfered with sleep also in general there 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.610
 the war unleashed these two neighboring 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.670
 wanted on the show to each other i carry it 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.319
 comedy and it's so cool to me very 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.360
 liked this movie when you watched it 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.879
 and I advise you his fourth film 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.590
 fourth shows fourth movie 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.150
 snow five in this movie 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.489
 tells about five times puppies 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.060
 who miraculously fell into 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.859
 Alaska 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.470
 and so it happened that they met and 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.180
 friends became a puppy and the owner is Vahovsky 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.280
 then of the little boy he was going 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.170
 take part in the annual marathon 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.750
 the riders ended up there the same way 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.690
 that here these 5 very from they became also 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.640
 finished dogs 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.550

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.630

 the nightmare before christmas will give you right away 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.140
 I did not watch this movie but I did 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.750
 I will definitely look like him 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.270
 advise all the nightmare before christmas as 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.370
 whatever strange it is the protagonist it 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.410
 our sun age is halloween you're all quiet 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.120
 warrior characters for halloween 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.640
 the same thing they are all about 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.800
 formed the risks of years jack it bothered 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.930
 he is tired of doing the same thing 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.180
 celebrate the same thing and he went 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.430
 in the forest there in the meadow he found several 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.010
 doors and each door led to another 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.720
 holiday he walked in the door I was 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.820
 Christmas holiday further description 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.340
 ends trailer like even 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.890
 nothing more understandable wearing guess 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.630
 that there must be something horrible 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.560
 because the cartoon is called a nightmare before 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.600
 merry christmas 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.680
 logical but this video fits 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.270
