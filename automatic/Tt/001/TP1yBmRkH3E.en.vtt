ready<00:00:38.840> position<00:00:39.260> okay<00:00:39.559> here's<00:00:40.010> what<00:00:40.190> we're

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
ready position okay here's what we're

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.590 
ready position okay here's what we're
going<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.519> go<00:00:40.640> this<00:00:40.850> what<00:00:41.059> we're<00:00:41.210> going<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.420> do

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
going to go this what we're going to do

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.600 
going to go this what we're going to do
but<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.290> game<00:00:42.500> isn't<00:00:42.769> like<00:00:43.070> that<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:43.550> know

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
but the game isn't like that and I know

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.290 
but the game isn't like that and I know
that<00:00:44.510> ideally<00:00:45.940> positionally<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.090> goalie

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
that ideally positionally the goalie

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.970 
that ideally positionally the goalie
will<00:00:47.510> always<00:00:47.840> be<00:00:47.989> in<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.200> right<00:00:48.320> position<00:00:48.530> to

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
will always be in the right position to

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.549 
will always be in the right position to
make<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.190> save<00:00:49.640> but<00:00:50.329> that<00:00:50.510> is<00:00:50.750> definitely<00:00:50.960> not

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
make the save but that is definitely not

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.310 
make the save but that is definitely not
the<00:00:51.620> case<00:00:51.860> in<00:00:52.399> reality<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.120> let's<00:00:53.300> just<00:00:53.570> call

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
the case in reality so let's just call

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.760 
the case in reality so let's just call
do<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:54.590> all<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.950> time<00:00:54.980> we'll<00:00:55.489> add<00:00:55.670> in<00:00:55.850> some

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
do it all the time we'll add in some

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.040 
do it all the time we'll add in some
agility<00:00:57.770> drills<00:00:58.219> starting<00:00:58.699> from<00:00:59.000> awkward<00:00:59.899> or

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
agility drills starting from awkward or

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.590 
agility drills starting from awkward or
different<00:01:00.410> positions<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.579> if<00:01:02.090> i<00:01:02.270> have<00:01:02.300> my

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
different positions so if i have my

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.869 
different positions so if i have my
ladder<00:01:02.840> setup<00:01:03.260> here<00:01:03.590> we<00:01:04.129> might<00:01:04.309> even<00:01:04.339> start

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
ladder setup here we might even start

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.810 
ladder setup here we might even start
out<00:01:05.119> with<00:01:05.449> just<00:01:06.050> three<00:01:06.710> small<00:01:07.009> hops<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.700> to

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
out with just three small hops just to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.700 
out with just three small hops just to
get<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.210> transition<00:01:09.110> from<00:01:09.289> one<00:01:09.440> movement

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
get a transition from one movement

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.770 
get a transition from one movement
pattern<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.399> another<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:10.880> we<00:01:10.970> might<00:01:11.149> do<00:01:11.300> one

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
pattern to another so we might do one

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.520 
pattern to another so we might do one
two<00:01:12.700> three<00:01:14.770> to<00:01:15.770> some<00:01:15.979> of<00:01:16.009> our<00:01:16.190> ladder<00:01:16.459> drills

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
two three to some of our ladder drills

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.949 
two three to some of our ladder drills
we<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:18.709> do<00:01:19.030> annealing<00:01:20.030> start<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:20.660> full

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
we can do annealing start so full

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.190 
we can do annealing start so full
wheeling<00:01:21.349> start<00:01:21.679> come<00:01:22.250> up<00:01:22.429> push<00:01:23.090> into<00:01:23.899> that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
wheeling start come up push into that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.919 
wheeling start come up push into that
pattern<00:01:24.500> we<00:01:25.250> can<00:01:25.399> go<00:01:25.789> little<00:01:26.060> pat<00:01:26.360> feeling

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
pattern we can go little pat feeling

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.469 
pattern we can go little pat feeling
half<00:01:27.530> kneeling<00:01:27.860> with<00:01:28.099> this<00:01:28.459> knee<00:01:28.759> up<00:01:28.940> half

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
kneeling with this knee up getting a bit

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.029 
kneeling with this knee up getting a bit
of<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.360> lateral<00:01:32.810> push<00:01:33.220> into<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:35.979> into<00:01:36.979> that

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:37.039 
of a lateral push into that into that

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.100 
of a lateral push into that into that
ladder<00:01:37.399> pattern<00:01:38.170> lie<00:01:39.170> on<00:01:39.200> your<00:01:39.470> tummy<00:01:41.110> why

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
ladder pattern lie on your tummy why

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.430 
ladder pattern lie on your tummy why
from<00:01:42.500> your<00:01:42.649> back<00:01:43.479> facing<00:01:44.479> one<00:01:44.660> way<00:01:44.690> facing<00:01:45.410> the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
from your back facing one way facing the

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.570 
from your back facing one way facing the
other<00:01:45.679> way<00:01:46.270> roll

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
other way roll

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.280 
other way roll
and<00:01:49.270> into<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.780> pattern<00:01:51.840> maybe<00:01:52.840> you'll<00:01:53.080> do

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
and into the pattern maybe you'll do

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.010 
and into the pattern maybe you'll do
just<00:01:53.530> some<00:01:53.770> lateral<00:01:54.130> shuffles<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.840> the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
just some lateral shuffles and so the

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.100 
just some lateral shuffles and so the
partner<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.890> always<00:01:57.130> go<00:01:57.370> so<00:01:58.030> mix<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:58.900> up<00:01:58.960> a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
partner you always go so mix it up a

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.950 
partner you always go so mix it up a
little<00:01:59.140> bit<00:01:59.560> yes<00:02:00.340> ideally<00:02:01.000> you're<00:02:01.420> always<00:02:01.810> in

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
little bit yes ideally you're always in

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.890 
little bit yes ideally you're always in
exactly<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.530> right<00:02:02.680> spot<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:03.660> epoxy<00:02:04.660> is

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
exactly the right spot and epoxy is

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.300 
exactly the right spot and epoxy is
going<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.170> bounce<00:02:05.290> right<00:02:05.590> off<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.190> you'll

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
going to bounce right off you and you'll

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.870 
going to bounce right off you and you'll
make<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> great<00:02:06.730> save<00:02:07.120> but<00:02:08.130> plan<00:02:09.130> for<00:02:09.160> reality

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
make a great save but plan for reality

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.030 
make a great save but plan for reality
too<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.390> it's<00:02:10.780> actually<00:02:10.930> pretty<00:02:11.260> fun<00:02:11.590> it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
too and it's actually pretty fun it

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.270 
too and it's actually pretty fun it
mixes<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:12.550> up<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.700> little<00:02:12.970> so<00:02:13.300> give<00:02:13.810> those<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.020> try

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
