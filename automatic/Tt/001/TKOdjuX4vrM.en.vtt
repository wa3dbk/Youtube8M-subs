00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
showing you how to just reattach that

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.819 
showing you how to just reattach that
with<00:00:55.000> exterior-grade<00:00:56.320> two-sided<00:00:57.320> tape<00:00:57.530> which

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
with exterior-grade two-sided tape which

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.410 
with exterior-grade two-sided tape which
is<00:00:57.860> really<00:00:58.280> how<00:00:58.430> all<00:00:58.640> these<00:00:58.850> things<00:00:59.120> are<00:00:59.239> just

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
is really how all these things are just

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.900 
is really how all these things are just
pulled<00:00:59.630> on<00:00:59.750> anyway<00:01:00.079> you'd<00:01:00.260> be<00:01:00.380> surprised<00:01:00.910> when

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
pulled on anyway you'd be surprised when

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.689 
pulled on anyway you'd be surprised when
I<00:01:01.940> get<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.270> straight<00:01:02.660> I'll<00:01:03.110> be<00:01:03.699> probably

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
I get that straight I'll be probably

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.640 
I get that straight I'll be probably
redoing<00:01:05.059> this<00:01:05.329> piece<00:01:05.630> as<00:01:05.869> well<00:01:06.049> because<00:01:06.470> we've

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
redoing this piece as well because we've

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.190 
redoing this piece as well because we've
got<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.800> little<00:01:07.010> bubble<00:01:07.370> in<00:01:07.840> here<00:01:08.840> if<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.050> can

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
got a little bubble in here if you can

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.180 
got a little bubble in here if you can
see<00:01:09.409> that<00:01:10.810> now<00:01:11.810> we've<00:01:12.020> got<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.260> pick<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.010> up

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
see that now we've got this pick this up

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.790 
see that now we've got this pick this up
used<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:13.960> it's<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.200> starting<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.650> show<00:01:15.770> a

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
used but it's so starting to show a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.710 
used but it's so starting to show a
little<00:01:15.979> bit<00:01:16.100> of<00:01:16.159> wear<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.370> tear<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:16.970> what<00:01:17.690> I

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
little bit of wear and tear but what I

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.930 
little bit of wear and tear but what I
wanted<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.049> show<00:01:18.320> is<00:01:18.530> how<00:01:18.830> easy<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.520> is<00:01:19.549> to

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
wanted to show is how easy it is to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.670 
wanted to show is how easy it is to
clear<00:01:20.479> up<00:01:20.630> things<00:01:20.900> like<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.320> without<00:01:21.530> having

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
clear up things like this without having

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.500 
clear up things like this without having
to<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:23.030> know<00:01:23.060> put<00:01:23.450> on<00:01:23.570> these<00:01:23.690> ridiculous

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
to you know put on these ridiculous

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.320 
to you know put on these ridiculous
attempts<00:01:26.510> of<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.710> know<00:01:27.830> only<00:01:28.460> patching<00:01:29.150> it<00:01:29.240> in

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
attempts of you know only patching it in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.450 
attempts of you know only patching it in
small<00:01:29.600> areas<00:01:30.729> so<00:01:31.729> once<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:32.810> off<00:01:33.250> now<00:01:34.250> or

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
small areas so once this is off now or

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.890 
small areas so once this is off now or
now<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:34.909> is<00:01:35.090> off<00:01:35.270> let<00:01:35.479> me<00:01:35.570> go<00:01:35.690> in<00:01:35.869> and

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
now that this is off let me go in and

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.859 
now that this is off let me go in and
and<00:01:36.409> get<00:01:37.040> some<00:01:37.250> solvent<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:37.850> clean<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:38.630> down

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
and get some solvent and clean this down

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.050 
and get some solvent and clean this down
and<00:01:39.110> I'll<00:01:39.200> show<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:39.440> how<00:01:39.710> it<00:01:39.860> looks<00:01:40.060> once

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
and I'll show you how it looks once

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.940 
and I'll show you how it looks once
we've<00:01:42.340> gotten<00:01:43.340> all<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.490> old<00:01:43.790> glue<00:01:44.060> off

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
we've gotten all the old glue off

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.109 
we've gotten all the old glue off
sometimes<00:01:45.950> these<00:01:46.280> will<00:01:46.460> come<00:01:46.640> off<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:46.850> you'll

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
sometimes these will come off and you'll

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.270 
sometimes these will come off and you'll
see<00:01:47.270> videos<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.659> people<00:01:47.990> using<00:01:48.439> a<00:01:48.500> heat<00:01:48.740> gun<00:01:48.770> to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
see videos of people using a heat gun to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.020 
see videos of people using a heat gun to
soften<00:01:50.180> up<00:01:50.299> the<00:01:50.450> glue<00:01:51.369> with<00:01:52.369> this<00:01:52.520> being<00:01:52.790> a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
soften up the glue with this being a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.410 
soften up the glue with this being a
rubbery<00:01:53.659> rubberized<00:01:54.470> plastic<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.939> think<00:01:56.150> a

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
rubbery rubberized plastic I think a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.630 
rubbery rubberized plastic I think a
heat<00:01:56.630> gun<00:01:56.780> will<00:01:56.990> probably<00:01:57.380> be<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:58.100> good<00:01:58.430> way<00:01:58.610> to

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
heat gun will probably be a good way to

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.230 
heat gun will probably be a good way to
damage<00:01:58.990> this<00:02:00.400> it's<00:02:01.400> easier<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.909> just<00:02:02.060> take

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
damage this it's easier to just take

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.050 
damage this it's easier to just take
this<00:02:02.390> off<00:02:02.630> with<00:02:04.509> solvent<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.130> clean<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.250> up<00:02:07.400> so

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
this off with solvent and clean it up so

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.399 
this off with solvent and clean it up so
that<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.539> nice<00:02:08.720> clean<00:02:08.959> surface<00:02:08.989> for

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
that you have a nice clean surface for

we're cleaning up the last of the glue
this<00:04:23.919> has<00:04:24.130> been<00:04:24.310> a<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.700> slow<00:04:25.530> not<00:04:26.530> complicated

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
this has been a a slow not complicated

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.020 
this has been a a slow not complicated
we're<00:04:29.050> getting<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.800> solvent<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.640> Ray<00:04:30.790> and

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
we're getting the solvent on the Ray and

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.580 
we're getting the solvent on the Ray and
it's<00:04:31.180> got<00:04:31.300> to<00:04:31.360> be<00:04:31.450> a<00:04:31.480> paint<00:04:31.750> friendly<00:04:32.140> solvent

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
it's got to be a paint friendly solvent

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.070 
it's got to be a paint friendly solvent
I<00:04:32.650> wouldn't<00:04:32.950> use<00:04:33.100> brake<00:04:33.430> cleaner<00:04:33.480> on<00:04:34.480> this

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
I wouldn't use brake cleaner on this

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:43.200 
I wouldn't use brake cleaner on this
with<00:04:36.240> wd-40<00:04:37.240> your<00:04:38.910> lighter<00:04:39.910> fluid<00:04:42.060> seems<00:04:43.060> to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
with wd-40 your lighter fluid seems to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.010 
with wd-40 your lighter fluid seems to
be<00:04:43.300> okay<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:46.300> what<00:04:46.420> I'm<00:04:46.510> doing<00:04:46.780> is<00:04:46.900> I'm

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020

and<00:04:50.850> just<00:04:51.850> constantly<00:04:52.300> working<00:04:52.570> it<00:04:52.870> using

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
and just constantly working it using

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.250 
and just constantly working it using
something<00:04:54.130> blunt<00:04:54.400> like<00:04:54.610> my<00:04:54.760> fingernail<00:04:55.260> to

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
something blunt like my fingernail to

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.610 
something blunt like my fingernail to
break<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.710> bond<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.370> glue<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.840> then<00:04:59.410> once

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
break the bond of the glue and then once

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.190 
break the bond of the glue and then once
the<00:04:59.770> glue<00:04:59.980> has<00:05:00.040> been<00:05:00.340> scratched<00:05:00.700> off<00:05:01.200> coming

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
the glue has been scratched off coming

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.440 
the glue has been scratched off coming
behind<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.620> with<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.860> light<00:05:03.670> abrasiveness<00:05:04.360> of

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.300 
the rag and working the rest of the glue
remnants<00:05:07.270> off<00:05:07.530> so<00:05:08.530> this<00:05:08.710> actually<00:05:09.100> went

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
remnants off so this actually went

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.620 
remnants off so this actually went
rather<00:05:09.970> quickly<00:05:10.330> very<00:05:11.320> simple<00:05:11.770> just<00:05:12.670> instance

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
rather quickly very simple just instance

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.690 
just be willing to put in a little bit
of<00:05:14.980> time<00:05:15.220> I<00:05:15.460> think<00:05:16.000> I<00:05:16.060> got<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.500> about<00:05:17.500> 20<00:05:18.400> minutes

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
of time I think I got a about 20 minutes

of time I think I got a about 20 minutes
when<00:05:18.850> I<00:05:18.880> use<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.770> side<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:20.890> this<00:05:20.980> to<00:05:21.250> go<00:05:21.370> with

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
when I use the side of this to go with

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.450 
when I use the side of this to go with
brake<00:05:22.030> cleaner<00:05:22.380> on<00:05:23.380> the<00:05:23.800> back<00:05:23.980> of<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.250> rubber

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
brake cleaner on the back of the rubber

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.520

surface<00:05:55.960> is<00:05:56.260> clean<00:05:56.350> and<00:05:56.950> then<00:05:57.670> I<00:05:57.700> can<00:05:57.940> come<00:05:58.120> out

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
surface is clean and then I can come out

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.270 
surface is clean and then I can come out
and<00:05:58.390> put<00:05:58.570> the<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:58.750> two-sided<00:05:59.440> tape<00:05:59.770> on<00:06:00.040> and

then push the the molding back on and I

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.140 
then push the the molding back on and I
guess<00:06:05.170> when<00:06:05.350> I<00:06:05.380> finish<00:06:05.680> this<00:06:05.860> I'll<00:06:06.760> come<00:06:07.060> up
