00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.880
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.770
 circle tv and today we found this 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.010
 interesting topic of conversation 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.680
 And this machine panzerkampfwagen and charter 4 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.940
 f2 with long barrel seventy five 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.550
 millimeter cannon 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.590
 el 43 which can perfectly 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.290
 destroy enemy tanks well actually 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.120
 in it now on the screen are watching and in 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.809
 In general, you will observe throughout 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.450
 total video 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.760
 but why everything is correct because on it 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.400
 I never learned to survive normally 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.800
 more precisely there was one fight he will be right after 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.050
 of this thread where I destroy the Shermans 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.500
 but there I just flew a client though 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.810
 there was a chance of a very interesting battle and 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.970
 Sorry he did not come out like me 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.880
 it says well oh well we will not be in anything 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.800
 blame the game let's talk about the car and 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.690
 so what is it with us 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.560
 panzerkampfwagen a charter 2 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.050
 well, or just a shell 4 with a desktop 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.270
 tool 75 millimeter he have 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.149
 located on 2 era has a combat rating 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.209
 33 and how justified it is proper 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.149
 Well, I think that is very for getting 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:31.100
 even for vehicles with a combat rating of 4.3 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.500
 he can quite cope with them but 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.539
 by the way notice here now will be 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.380
 a few moments where I'll shoot a 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.270
 bt-7 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.580
 and you just look at the armor 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.310
 impact guns for the armor 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.979
 projectile impact please forgive and yes 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.380
 tank has problems with this gun 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.929
 On the whole, it’s good and accurate. 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.709
 has good ballistics of projectile flight 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.450
 but a very strange effect 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.789
 sometimes you can actually destroy tanks with 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.800
 single shot and sometimes it’s like this 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.929
 what seems to be the cars that should 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.750
 to die well, just from one bullet 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.160
 they hold on and hold on and hold on and you 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.009
 just don't even understand what 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.160
 actually the problem well you see okay 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.290
 proceed further by the instrument continue 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.870
 we have a good rate of fire in the area 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.540
 10 shots per minute can do it 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.580
 actually quite nice and you 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.010
 unlikely to be caught by surprise on reloading 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.630
 No, of course they can but still 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.730
 compares guns to guns 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.080
 thirty-thirty which is with 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.560
 same combat rating 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.140
 or approximately with him we are of course in 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.440
 games we have better ballistics us 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.810
 a much more pleasant weapon overall but 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.280
 Proceed to the next performance in 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.200
 we have 300 horse engine at 22 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.819
 tons and unfortunately we can't 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.130
 brag about some special 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.319
 maneuverability which is beyond dynamics 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.260
 No, of course it 's still medium tanks 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.390
 he more or less goes back and forth however 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.360
 this cannot be boasted especially 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.880
 before the t-34 who fly just go 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.850
 here we are not such a racing car 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.040
 drive to the place you reach but when 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.620
 already a completely different question further 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.690
 going to the question of booking but here 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.940
 here we are still more sad than with 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.950
 our mobility if its a whole 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.440
 missing here's armor really 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.140
 brings us 50 millimeters forehead 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.870
 hulls and towers and 30 boards and each 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.250
 but no tilting in this boxed 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.290
 structure you will not find 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.630
 absolutely no slopes therefore 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.660
 punch us all and sundry even if 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.049
 we fall as they say in the top and no 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.260
 no one is more serious than the same t-34 and sq. by the way 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.750
 Oh to you someone our worst enemy and he us 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.880
 in fact, it greatly interferes 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.220
 pretty tight sometimes makes its way into 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.650
 armor-piercing chamber shells which 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.489
 we punch over 100 millimeters to 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.260
 the word to say 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.209
 and I would like to note that we have 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.590
 piercing shells which have a hundred 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.780
 fifty four millimeters 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.760
 armor penetration at close range they can us 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.950
 useful if we fight 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.170
 probably not good at aiming him 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.420
 weak spots or he will successfully rise 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.340
 but in any case, try not 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.560
 collide and especially in the forehead forehead 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.269
 then guaranteed to die and in general 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.250
 saying we can say that a weapon to us 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.289
 allows him to break through the problem only in 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.959
 that does not always work for him 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:22.360
 get on well and it can play you 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.820
 not at hand but only lead to 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.470
 fatal consequences in general can 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.979
 take panzerkampfwagen 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.979
 f2 pretty good car she calmly 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.100
 copes with such tanks as m4 m4a 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.320
 1 t 34 already heavier well 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.409
 Well, other tanks, I have not even taken into account 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.030
 I take the main thing that this car do not go 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.070
 forward is generally not recommended 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.530
 for any bullet that touches you 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.560
 most likely you will break it starting from 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.810
 caliber 37 millimeters and higher but than 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.310
 the more you understand the worse and let's say 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.230
 the same sherman and with a hundred and five 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.390
 millimeter-high my my of you 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.220
 do just well I don `t know a pile 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.920
 scrap metal and being easy and 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.230
 at ease so don't expose either 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.900
 in any case under enemy shells it 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.420
 It hurts you very much and most likely 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:14.060
 will send you to the hangar but if you learn 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.760
 play behind the allies to act 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.700
 as it is competently from the mounds of good angles 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.200
 the declination of the gun allows -10 degrees 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.420
 we have to the word tool declination angles 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.640
 negative and this is very very 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.590
 cool by the way pay attention to here 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.560
 this moment with bt-7 how many shells by 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.480
 he will be released and so returning to 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.760
 tool we have the declination angles of the gun 20 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.010
 degrees up a little tower by the way 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.890
 spinning is not very fast not that sad 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.150
 what else in the recent update on he 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.250
 introduced machine gunners 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.890
 more precisely the machine gunner who is in 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.920
 to the forehead of the tower to be honest I tried 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.260
 scare them planes do not go at all he 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:54.620
 even anti-aircraft can not normally scare 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.170
 so what was the machine gun that it is not 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.000
 more precisely the opposite but in any case sense 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.930
 from him a little bit except what to create 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.170
 smoke screen 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.660
 but they introduced him and I don’t know about the tank 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.580
 how to say it anyway shell 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.190
 feels pretty good what with 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.390
 him that without him so he is not afraid 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.700
 use it to create 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.550
 some smoke screens but more 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.960
 it is unlikely he will come in handy for something 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.080
 returning to the tank what can be said about 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.880
 in the end, we get such a dealer 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.990
 which can easily disassemble 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.580
 enemy tanks 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.290
 unless of course to take into account 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.480
 incomprehensible some sort of reservation 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.670
 projectile impact which is kind of in 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.500
 some situations there and in some 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.500
 situations flatly refuses 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.930
 manifest yourself if brothers cannon tone 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.210
 smart but the base itself for this gun 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.070
 somewhat controversial yes it seems to be there 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.010
 some kind of armor that allows us 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.620
 protect yourself from at least anti-aircraft guns but honestly 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.350
 speaking of other shells she saves us 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:55.310
 very very bad and coming back again 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:57.210
 same to the topic here you see t28 1 t 28 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.840
 continues to sink shells 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:04.650
 a1 to 28 just died and easy 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:07.319
 and painless with one hit and so 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.569
 Tank as a whole it turns out good 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.940
 punches everything bends all 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.220
 but he can only bend down 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:15.419
 so in no case do not substitute 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.419
 on this machine 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:21.270
 armor will not allow you and will not forgive 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:24.330
 speed we are pretty good but 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.430
 not as good as t-34 so if you 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.099
 want to drastically change position 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.520
 probably you will hardly succeed in 

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:34.680
 On the whole, it’s worth taking and rolling too 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.289
 with you was a loan in hope for this 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:39.530
 the car has become a little clearer to everyone yet 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:39.530
 until
