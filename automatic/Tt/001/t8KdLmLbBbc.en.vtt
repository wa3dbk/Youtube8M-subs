percent more than it might have not but

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.879 
percent more than it might have not but
in<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.169> end<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.349> are<00:03:46.410> really<00:03:46.560> worth<00:03:46.680> it

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
in the end is are really worth it

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.500 
in the end is are really worth it
because<00:03:47.790> they're<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.090> gonna<00:03:48.180> give<00:03:48.359> it<00:03:48.389> away
