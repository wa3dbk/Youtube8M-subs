and voila
and<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:59.759> brakes<00:02:01.650> here<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:04.720> still<00:02:05.020> use

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
and for the brakes here you still use

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.609 
and for the brakes here you still use
all<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.920> servos

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
all the servos

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.479 
all the servos
you<00:02:08.619> know<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:09.100> way<00:02:09.310> you're<00:02:09.459> still<00:02:09.759> using<00:02:10.660> for

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
you know this way you're still using for

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.070 
you know this way you're still using for
back<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:12.790> forth

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
back and forth

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.840 
back and forth
I<00:02:14.190> mean<00:02:15.190> reverse<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.850> forth<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.890> then<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
I mean reverse and forth and then the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.470 
I mean reverse and forth and then the
brakes<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:19.690> using<00:02:20.530> free<00:02:20.950> brake<00:02:21.480> service

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
brakes is to using free brake service

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.170 
brakes is to using free brake service
and<00:02:22.959> then<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.430> have<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:26.010> split<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:29.350> cable

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
and then you have to split the cable

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.890 
and then you have to split the cable
like<00:02:31.180> this<00:02:31.209> one<00:02:31.630> right<00:02:31.750> here<00:02:31.810> goes<00:02:32.500> to<00:02:32.709> the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
like this one right here goes to the

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.240 
like this one right here goes to the
sample<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:36.580> other<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:36.880> is<00:02:37.090> goes<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:38.250> BAC

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
sample and the other one is goes to BAC

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:47.040 
sample and the other one is goes to BAC
and<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:40.720> course<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:44.470> one<00:02:44.739> right<00:02:44.920> here<00:02:46.050> goes

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
and of course this one right here goes

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.620 
and of course this one right here goes
to<00:02:49.620> receiver<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.989> then<00:02:53.920> that's<00:02:54.819> it<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.450> you

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
to receiver and then that's it if you

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.160 
to receiver and then that's it if you
wanna<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:56.140> know<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:58.120> work<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.989> gotta

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
wanna you know do the work you gotta

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.080 
wanna you know do the work you gotta
take<00:02:59.739> out<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.570> make<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:02.380> new<00:03:02.560> plate<00:03:03.100> you

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
take out and make it the new plate you
