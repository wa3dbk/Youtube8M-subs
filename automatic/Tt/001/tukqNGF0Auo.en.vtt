but I think starting around grade 6
I'll<00:06:18.200> just<00:06:18.530> compile<00:06:19.010> 6<00:06:19.670> 7<00:06:20.030> 8<00:06:20.150> 9<00:06:20.300> 10<00:06:20.570> 11<00:06:20.690> 12<00:06:20.900> all

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.290 
I'll just compile 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 all

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.800 
I'll just compile 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 all
into<00:06:21.680> one<00:06:22.030> little<00:06:23.030> thing<00:06:23.240> because<00:06:23.510> I'm<00:06:23.630> not

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
into one little thing because I'm not

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.170 
into one little thing because I'm not

so<00:06:27.950> so<00:06:28.940> there's<00:06:29.120> an<00:06:29.270> idea<00:06:29.330> that's<00:06:30.080> how<00:06:30.200> you<00:06:30.260> can

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
so so there's an idea that's how you can

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.260 
so so there's an idea that's how you can
do<00:06:30.530> a<00:06:30.560> school<00:06:30.890> scrapbook<00:06:31.370> all<00:06:31.670> right<00:06:31.850> get<00:06:32.240> to
