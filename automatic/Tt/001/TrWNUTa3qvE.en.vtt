00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
was the new charge in general everything

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.749 
was the new charge in general everything
is<00:01:16.200> basically<00:01:16.380> new<00:01:16.770> body<00:01:17.070> wise<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.490> may<00:01:17.580> look

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
is basically new body wise it may look

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.249 
is basically new body wise it may look
the<00:01:17.790> same<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.600> only<00:01:18.810> things<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the same but the only things are the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.460 
the same but the only things are the
same<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> glass<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:21.540> rear<00:01:21.780> doors<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
same are the glass the rear doors and

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.219 
same are the glass the rear doors and
the<00:01:22.920> roof<00:01:23.130> every<00:01:23.880> other<00:01:24.090> panel<00:01:24.840> has<00:01:25.200> been

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
the roof every other panel has been

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.200 
the roof every other panel has been
changed<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.950> car<00:01:26.130> every<00:01:26.610> single<00:01:27.000> panel

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
changed on this car every single panel

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.270 
changed on this car every single panel
so<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.659> been<00:01:27.840> massaged<00:01:28.259> fiddle<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
so it's all been massaged fiddle with it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.310 
so it's all been massaged fiddle with it
and<00:01:29.670> as<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.090> imagine<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:31.020> effect<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
and as you can imagine the effect is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.109 
and as you can imagine the effect is
quite<00:01:31.439> nice<00:01:31.680> actually<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.430> we<00:01:32.579> look<00:01:32.610> at<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
quite nice actually if we look at the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.450 
quite nice actually if we look at the
racetrack<00:01:34.049> LEDs<00:01:34.860> now<00:01:35.130> they're<00:01:35.310> now

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
racetrack LEDs now they're now

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.160 
racetrack LEDs now they're now
continuous<00:01:36.060> as<00:01:36.180> opposed<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> segmented

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
continuous as opposed to the segmented

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.929 
continuous as opposed to the segmented
versions<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:37.650> before<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.790> much

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
versions which before so it's much

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.249 
versions which before so it's much
cleaner<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:40.320> modern<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.070> crisp

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
cleaner and more modern and crisp

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.420 
cleaner and more modern and crisp
basically<00:01:43.259> this<00:01:43.320> whole<00:01:43.470> car<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.070> one<00:01:44.250> big

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
basically this whole car is just one big

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.580 
basically this whole car is just one big
