00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello friends welcome to 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.809
 a little last most 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.860
 be intelligent 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.889
 probably already seen 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.910
 it goes two petersohn the legend of 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.519
 Sommerlad so that it will be 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.169
 you hear less of this razzia is life 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.169
 has call is now already some 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:27.949
 time ago and had one, so to speak 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.929
 adventure web built in minecraft as 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.180
 a calculator left had it greased 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.489
 the whole distributed part lost 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.230
 had to start from scratch and prove 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.950
 probably beginning with it and that's it 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.370
 to the project or frozen 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.610
 then we thought so I still 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.370
 a few other people that we did 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.530
 continue to build 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.530
 because now there are also npcs 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.930
 give the channel and second and so 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.300
 it is also so that already hurt 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.430
 can implement his cheap pretty cheap 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.049
 ideas and that's what we work on and 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.470
 therefore probably show 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.149
 only started what we build so 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.710
 this one starts even in a small 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.710
 fishing village and we have here too 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.180
 he sees here the big wide sea here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.350
 his book the wall is now 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.990
 probably the oversized 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.479
 changed 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.149
 then you come here just because they 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.770
 equal to a market place in houses is 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.950
 so the giant made sure that the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.300
 church in mother city here is so huge 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.820
 village but always a little on yes me 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.000
 vary the harbor master quite 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.700
 not thought otherwise it still has to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.500
 orient the occupants horses 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.869
 overcome the programs 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.840
 There is already a Aussiedlerhof 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.740
 So that's your life's work 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:57.860
 Do you want to make little ones here ? 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.210
 easter eggs and tasks quests so alex 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.350
 Thomson close if you are with build 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.220
 I wanted to go to the web I just write 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.220
 on on youtube then 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:17.819
 the teams off again 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:21.620
 only here because it will rock the shop 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.360
 can get into a pretty big one 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.680
 From this, these list up powerfully 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.890
 from the inside actually not yet 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.120
 but the landscape in the from the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.100
 find out and the tent becomes this 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.850
 wanted to build on the counter 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.810
 comes in doing so over the coming sunsets here 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.830
 There is a toilet there 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.540
 demonstrate 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.270
 English winding paths with deer 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.000
 try to build everything too 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.860
 continue to build that and if one 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.269
 animal says support then you can 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:11.349
 you do not necessarily like to build 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:15.910
 verify a minecraft inversion 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:18.170
 kitchen house is on the castle so power 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.269
 as well as said the ideas have one 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.100
 I quickly write it to me 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.180
 I would be very connected because of me 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.140
 try also with the teradata 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:32.599
 community to build up a bit 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.160
 So bye bye and mail late 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.160
