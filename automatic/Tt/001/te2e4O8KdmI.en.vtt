 they know they still see it as a taboo 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.969
 well in this method like the 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.129
 Ouija is a well-known phenomenon within 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.960
 of the parapsychology and is very 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.689
 related to the sessions of 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.359
 Spiritualism is about making a 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.580
 contact with other intelligences by 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:27.710
 means of using a pen and paper 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.039
 while in a state of meditation 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.800
 or just very concentrated this 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.170
 practice is very used by mediums 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.410
 anyone can learn to perform 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.670
 successful automatic writing 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.220
 investing just a little bit of time and 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.040
 effort do not let fear 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:49.010
 make you back out and not try anything 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.900
 will happen to you this practice only channels the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.870
 energy that is around you 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.140
 energy by which paranormal beings 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.720
 can communicate some authors say 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.820
 that women experience a 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.100
 higher incidence than men in this 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.830
 phenomenon because they usually 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.550
 they have more connective tissue that binds 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.700
 two cerebral hemispheres writing 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.670
 automatic has been used basically in 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.920
 three areas in the literature in the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.679
 psychology and communication with 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.200
 spiritual or extraterrestrial entities 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.240
 it gained great strength in the middle of the 20th century 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.850
 where they started talking about messages 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.670
 channeled and books were written under 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.390
 this methods like the book during a 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.970
 philosophical theological spiritual work of 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.340
 which they claim is not written by 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.310
 humans 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 there are three types of writing 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.310
 automatic the first is the mechanics is 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.020
 of the rarest but not for that 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.789
 non-existent the medium has no 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.399
 kind of idea of ​​what he is writing 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.319
 so that the phenomenon occurs 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.719
 spirit momentarily has the 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.209
 control of the middle arm by that 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.640
 motive the spirit writes in a way 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.690
 completely oblivious to how the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.380
 medium in the conscious way 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.780
 the second is semiautomatic the spirit 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.790
 borrows the medium's arm but 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.650
 he is more or less aware of what 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.580
 the spirit transmits through the paper 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.980
 and the pencil and the third is the intuitive 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.440
 the medium is aware of what the 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.600
 spirit wants to transmit producing itself 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.080
 a telepathy between the medium and the 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.540
 spirit 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.390
 knowing the above, I invite you to 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.970
 practice this simple exercise that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 it will undoubtedly be a good experience 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.130
 if you like this world so much paranormal 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.250
 Like me, first of all you have to have 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.950
 a lot of patience with this process maybe 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.650
 Do not leave the first time or the second nor 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.530
 the first day but with practice is 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.380
 shown that they work mentally 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.970
 feel a sincere respect and enormous desire 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.850
 to communicate with them 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.500
 imagine the spirit or in any case the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.900
 extraterrestrial with whom you love 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.060
 communicate remember that the power of the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.880
 mind has not yet been discovered by 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.350
 complete the human being only uses one 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.350
 quarter of its full potential 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.340
 It is recommended to be alone or accompanied 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.410
 for only people who want to do what 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.380
 same and have the same concerns 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.540
 that later you can already 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.810
 convey to others but to begin 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.640
 it is better to be alone and relaxed take a 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.160
 ballpoint pen and a paper sit 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.530
 comfortably with your hand in the form of 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.930
 writing and place the pen on the 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.420
 paper with the tip stuck to it 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.130
 many people place it separately but 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.069
 the tip of the pen has to be 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.709
 touching the paper leaves your body that 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:53.410
 relax and become aware of what you are 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.260
 doing with all the confidence of the world 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.299
 ask him if he is with you and simple 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.430
 questions that you would ask someone you see 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.830
 for the first time and what president is that 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.989
 the coexistence will be long is 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.510
 important that you do not try to guess 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.910
 things because if you do it you will lose the 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.519
 time such as what is my name 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.630
 when I was born what is my mother's name 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.330
 etc 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.910
 if the pen does not move let it 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.340
 write let the channel be open to 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.580
 through your peace of mind if it puts you 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.920
 nervous or do you want to practice tell 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.680
 you want to say goodbye and you will continue 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.570
 then do not try in those moments 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.750
 analyze with your mind what is 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.300
 happening already you will do it later in that 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.480
 moment what is important is that you trust and 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.040
 that you let take by that sensation 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.160
 let yourself go and channel for those 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.500
 energies if with all this process you 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.050
 polygraph does not move do not get 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.390
 nervous since the first times is 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.060
 normal leave it for another day or 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.340
 he quietly takes another paper and returns 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.710
 to start this process this time while 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.780
 is the question begins to draw 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.880
 circles on the paper until it 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.700
 manifest the phenomenon and feel the 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.100
 need to write or draw the 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.010
 most of the time the words are 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.920
 arrows in your mind and those you have to 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:19.070
 sometimes write are letters or images 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.370
 which you can write or draw is 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.400
 the most common way in which it is common 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.100
 this process many people see it as 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.410
 dangerous and it may be true to 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.479
 Like ouija is a means by 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.030
 which can communicate with spirits 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.240
 you never know what kind of presence 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.280
 you'll come across you never know how powerful 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.070
 that can be that entity but about
