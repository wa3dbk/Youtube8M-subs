some of them were but not all of them
were<00:05:34.710> I<00:05:34.979> think<00:05:35.340> it's<00:05:35.460> because<00:05:35.820> they<00:05:36.539> were

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
were I think it's because they were

were I think it's because they were
probably<00:05:37.289> doing<00:05:38.160> it<00:05:38.599> creating<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:39.720> figures

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
probably doing it creating the figures

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.860 
probably doing it creating the figures

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
what whatever it might have been but but

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.080 
what whatever it might have been but but
as<00:05:46.139> the<00:05:46.380> line<00:05:46.740> progressed<00:05:47.340> they've<00:05:47.639> gotten

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
as the line progressed they've gotten

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.500 
as the line progressed they've gotten
progressively<00:05:48.450> better<00:05:49.200> and<00:05:49.820> we're<00:05:50.820> toward

were<00:05:54.210> really<00:05:54.539> outstanding<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:57.139> also<00:05:58.490> they'd

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
were really outstanding and also they'd

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.810

be actually the Lord of the Rings line
also<00:06:03.240> had<00:06:03.720> a<00:06:03.750> lot<00:06:04.320> of<00:06:04.349> figures<00:06:04.710> had<00:06:04.889> the<00:06:05.180> action

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
also had a lot of figures had the action

also had a lot of figures had the action
gimmick<00:06:06.510> I'm<00:06:06.930> not<00:06:07.169> a<00:06:07.199> fan<00:06:07.530> of<00:06:07.560> action<00:06:08.099> gimmick

gimmick I'm not a fan of action gimmick
especially<00:06:08.940> at<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.240> expense<00:06:09.720> of

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
especially at the expense of

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.339 
especially at the expense of
articulation<00:06:11.130> and<00:06:11.250> pose<00:06:11.430> ability<00:06:11.910> but<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:12.930> have

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
articulation and pose ability but I have

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.020 
articulation and pose ability but I have
to<00:06:13.560> say<00:06:13.710> that<00:06:13.949> toy<00:06:14.160> business<00:06:14.400> actually<00:06:14.849> did<00:06:15.000> a

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
to say that toy business actually did a

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.200 
to say that toy business actually did a
pretty<00:06:15.240> good<00:06:15.389> job<00:06:15.449> with<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:16.110> action<00:06:17.210> gimmicks

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
pretty good job with the action gimmicks

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.290 
pretty good job with the action gimmicks
at<00:06:18.780> least<00:06:18.990> most<00:06:19.199> of<00:06:19.380> them<00:06:19.500> have<00:06:20.150> where<00:06:21.150> they

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
at least most of them have where they

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.010 
at least most of them have where they
don't<00:06:21.479> sacrifice<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.830> detail<00:06:23.370> or

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
don't sacrifice the detail or

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.029 
don't sacrifice the detail or
articulation<00:06:25.020> of<00:06:25.139> the<00:06:25.260> figure<00:06:25.289> which<00:06:25.860> is

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
articulation of the figure which is

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.659 
articulation of the figure which is
really<00:06:26.340> really<00:06:26.520> nice<00:06:26.900> so<00:06:27.900> I<00:06:28.340> just<00:06:29.340> wanted<00:06:29.580> to

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669 
really really nice so I just wanted to

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.870 
really really nice so I just wanted to
create<00:06:30.270> this<00:06:30.419> video<00:06:30.599> just<00:06:31.500> at<00:06:31.650> least<00:06:31.770> to<00:06:32.729> go

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
create this video just at least to go

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.959 
create this video just at least to go
over<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:34.830> action<00:06:35.250> figure<00:06:35.490> line<00:06:35.700> in<00:06:35.849> general

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
over the action figure line in general

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:38.689 
over the action figure line in general
it<00:06:36.510> doesn't<00:06:36.750> seem<00:06:37.080> to<00:06:37.289> be<00:06:37.440> very<00:06:37.800> many

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
it doesn't seem to be very many

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.249 
it doesn't seem to be very many
reviews<00:06:39.449> or<00:06:40.490> peeks<00:06:41.490> into<00:06:41.789> the<00:06:42.180> Lord<00:06:43.110> of<00:06:43.199> the

Rings action figure line on YouTube and

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.029 
Rings action figure line on YouTube and
I<00:06:45.240> thought<00:06:45.419> I'd<00:06:45.569> create<00:06:45.840> this<00:06:46.050> at<00:06:46.949> least

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
I thought I'd create this at least

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.570 
I thought I'd create this at least
familiarize<00:06:47.960> with<00:06:48.960> a<00:06:49.020> lot<00:06:49.259> of<00:06:49.379> folks<00:06:49.620> who<00:06:49.860> who

familiarize with a lot of folks who who

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.980 
familiarize with a lot of folks who who
