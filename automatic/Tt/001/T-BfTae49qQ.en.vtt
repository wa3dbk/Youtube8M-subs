00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.080
 free alternative that offers us 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.390
 adobe for our mobile devices 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.730
 we are going to open a photograph of the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.739
 gallery and now that we have it we are going to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.720
 see the interface of this simple editor 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.449

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.220
 of returning undo option and a 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.260
 magic wand that what they will do will be a 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.820
 automatic adjustment that will follow 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.710
 Adobe algorithms to beautify the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.530
 image and the truth shows a result 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.809
 very positive if you want to disable the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.910
 you press again and ready the third button 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.920
 is to compare the photograph when 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.570
 you have made some changes if we 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.489
 we go to the bottom part we see that what 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.710
 first that shows us are some looks 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.840
 is the name that adobe wanted to put 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.240
 the filters and the truth contains a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.030
 huge variety of free filters as well 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.600
 complete however the filters that 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.420
 have in the free version are very 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.060
 good and they will allow you to edit your 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.530
 photography in a very easy and very 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 weird 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.090
 let's select for example this 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.369
 sommer effect and now in the part of more 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.409
 below we can change section if 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.780
 we select the second option we can 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.850
 cut the photograph to the way that 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.940
 we want for example we are going to 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.040
 cut it like this and we can also straighten 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.659
 if it has come out a little crooked 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.149
 with the help of the guides that we 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.549
 show we can rotate it already with angles 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.210
 defined or we can also flip 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:56.790
 either horizontally or vertically 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.159
 if we go to the third option we can 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.170
 change parameters like clarity the 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.200
 level of detail the exhibition the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.270
 contrast saturation temperature and 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 several things for example we 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.619
 change a bit the exposure of this 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.900
 photography and we will select that 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.670
 have a little more light now let's go 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.860
 also to vary the contrast a little 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.620
 as well as the shadows we are also going to 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.000
 put them a little more intense and well 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.890
 as you see in a few seconds 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.930
 we have managed to edit the photograph of 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.030
 a fairly easy way the last 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.980
 option is to correct red eyes in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.360
 the portrait photographs 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.940
 finally we can save the result 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.670

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.380
