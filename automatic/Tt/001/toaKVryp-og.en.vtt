00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello friends comrades with you Anton 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.610
 Chase leading the most healthy lifestyle 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.940
 well sometimes i'm drunk but not about that today 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
 and why am I even the other day in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.889
 Once again 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.650
 another famous football player 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.740
 burned with a fucking cigarette at least 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.119
 a cigarette is not in a gay club any 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 that 's the same jack wheels horde that is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.760
 after this photo he said well, more precisely, his 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.599
 Agent commented that they say Jack doesn't smoke 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.669
 and he was just given a cigarette to hold 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.860
 what the hell in his mouth and and gave something 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 hold well what kind of nonsense in the photo yet 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.210
 Clearly visible fucking but if not for him closely 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.430
 in a gay club would burn so that the agent 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.649
 would say that they say jack gave dick 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.390
 hold in your hands or in your mouth or ass 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.840
 but so no less jack cool footballer 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.879
 and this is an indisputable fact so today I 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.610
 I would like to briefly and clearly express my 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.059
 opinion on this issue that is, well, what 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.670
 Well we start with the fact that I myself do not smoke 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.440
 and never smoked well, more precisely was the case 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
 that tried but to know the enemy in 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.290
 face but I absolutely did not like it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.990
 and how many smokers say they say 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.049
 are you smoking when you feel cooler and 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.909
 I’m more confident than that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.280
 felt at the first puff this word 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 not nice in the mouth shit so i 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.900
 most likely so I will die without understanding all 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.390
 those people who get high from 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.729
 fucking smoke and by the way noticed such 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.790
 a piece of yourself and many of your friends 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.950
 that in most percentages of cases 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.650
 smoking and if parents 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.600
 if the parents smoke, then the child is more likely 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.520
 of all, too, lit up well, which is quite logical 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 This is the usual psychology of the child. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.380
 since they do that and they are so cool 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.170
 adults and why not days I don’t 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.090
 try here but my parents 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.700
 never smoked and brought up such 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.979
 handsome bald like me what but not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.369
 less considering i never smoke myself 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.530
 and did not smoke i am neutral to myself 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.829
 smokers now explain why yes 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.030
 because fuck is their business that is 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.600
 another thing is that i'm never allowed 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.429
 an example of his girlfriend smoking and what 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.190
 some dick from the mountain smokes and poison itself 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.230
 Yes, I just do not care this is his personal 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.659
 I think that he understands perfectly 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.090
 kills himself and now this whole 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.760
 propaganda that they say smoking kills but 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.400
 damn well I don't even know what to think that 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.349
 smokers don't understand smoke kills 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.830
 they are well aware or invent that 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.090
 he fucking sits smoking cigars think to fuck 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.310
 now it will give me health + 5 + 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.670
 500 kg of agility there is a stamina endurance 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.010
 Of course not so whether to smoke or not 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.540
 it is his business personally that is the main thing is not 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.239
 stop this from around you know how 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.220
 happens you walk in a dark area at night 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.090
 from fucking dark like this fucking 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.220
 voice and packs of cigarettes and in such 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.129
 moments my point starts to play 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.079
 the mozart melodies and the intensity of this 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.989
 playing just where depends on 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:05.579
 abominations of the voice of the suppliant 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:08.010
 what about soccer players smoking this 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.500
 I am exactly the same that is while you 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.209
 play well at least you fucking though Geres 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.030
 than kolis at least do what is important 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.980
 show a decent game shorter dudes 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.040
 of cydia is evil most smokers 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.260
 who have not yet jumped out their lungs 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.049
 the brain is perfectly aware of it and go themselves 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.940
 On this pic Well this is their business flag them 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.950
 good luck to all of you 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.109
