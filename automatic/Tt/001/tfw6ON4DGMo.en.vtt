a this orange there's a sort of Kermit
green<00:00:33.660> which<00:00:33.780> apparently<00:00:33.929> looks<00:00:34.229> quite<00:00:34.379> like

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:34.409 
green which apparently looks quite like

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:38.209 
green which apparently looks quite like
that<00:00:34.649> sign<00:00:34.889> up<00:00:34.920> there<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.550> also<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.389> great<00:00:37.219> 650

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that sign up there and also a great 650

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.860 
that sign up there and also a great 650
s<00:00:38.690> 650<00:00:39.690> PS<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.769> 50<00:00:41.100> horsepower<00:00:41.870> torque

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
s 650 PS so it's 50 horsepower torque

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.169

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
sorts of other little bits inside is now

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.849 
sorts of other little bits inside is now
a<00:00:59.010> full<00:00:59.399> outcome<00:00:59.850> tarah<00:01:00.119> livery<00:01:01.109> inside<00:01:01.559> and

a full outcome tarah livery inside and
you<00:01:02.249> can<00:01:02.369> see<00:01:02.489> down<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.729> side<00:01:02.819> here<00:01:02.999> we've<00:01:03.989> got

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
you can see down the side here we've got

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810 
you can see down the side here we've got
these<00:01:04.350> carbon<00:01:05.010> fiber<00:01:05.190> straights<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.610> help

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
these carbon fiber straights to help

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.510 
these carbon fiber straights to help
both<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.689> air<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.469> the<00:01:07.560> bigger<00:01:07.950> radiators

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
both the air into the bigger radiators

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.770 
both the air into the bigger radiators
on<00:01:08.609> the<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.850> which<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.210> need<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> because

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
on the side which we need it because

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.200 
on the side which we need it because
it's<00:01:10.049> more<00:01:10.140> powerful<00:01:10.850> other<00:01:11.850> things<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's more powerful other things to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.499 
it's more powerful other things to
mention

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
mention

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.270 
mention
well<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.259> chassis<00:01:13.560> has<00:01:13.829> had<00:01:14.070> some

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
well the chassis has had some

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.700 
well the chassis has had some
developments<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:14.939> well<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.960> normal<00:01:16.500> is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
developments as well so now normal is

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.069 
developments as well so now normal is
closest<00:01:17.609> to<00:01:17.640> sports<00:01:17.969> sports<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.420> much<00:01:18.780> closer

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
closest to sports sports is much closer

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.929 
closest to sports sports is much closer
to<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.469> the<00:01:19.590> track<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.159> before<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.729> track

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
to what the track was before and track

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.050 
to what the track was before and track
is<00:01:21.119> obviously<00:01:21.420> Denver's<00:01:21.869> belief<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.530> heads

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
is obviously Denver's belief on heads

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.459 
is obviously Denver's belief on heads
it'd<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.210> interesting<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.689> drive<00:01:24.899> one<00:01:25.079> see

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
it'd be interesting to drive one see

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:26.870 
it'd be interesting to drive one see
what<00:01:25.590> they've<00:01:25.740> learned<00:01:25.950> from<00:01:26.009> p1<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.609> all<00:01:26.729> see

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
what they've learned from p1 we all see

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.669 
what they've learned from p1 we all see
which<00:01:27.509> amoebans<00:01:27.899> driven<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.560> he

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
which amoebans driven that and he

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:29.630 
which amoebans driven that and he
absolutely<00:01:28.890> loved<00:01:29.310> it

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
absolutely loved it

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.090 
absolutely loved it
so<00:01:30.179> yeah<00:01:30.810> actually<00:01:31.289> really<00:01:31.619> looking<00:01:31.829> forward

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so yeah actually really looking forward

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
so yeah actually really looking forward
to<00:01:32.159> driving<00:01:32.249> 650s<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.409> couldn't<00:01:34.409> leave<00:01:34.499> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to driving 650s I couldn't leave the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.109 
to driving 650s I couldn't leave the
sound<00:01:34.799> without<00:01:34.920> having<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.219> sit<00:01:35.429> inside<00:01:35.789> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
sound without having a sit inside the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.730 
sound without having a sit inside the
car<00:01:36.359> I'd<00:01:36.630> say<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> driving<00:01:37.320> position<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
car I'd say the driving position is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.590 
car I'd say the driving position is
still<00:01:37.950> probably<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.670> favorite<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.119> any<00:01:39.329> car

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
still probably my favorite of any car

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200 
still probably my favorite of any car

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.650 
something I think we first saw on the
Audi<00:02:22.900> r8<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.120> there<00:02:25.270> we<00:02:25.330> go

apparent<00:02:26.200> 650s<00:02:26.800> yes<00:02:27.100> it's<00:02:27.310> more<00:02:27.459> expensive

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940

than<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.120> 12c<00:02:28.569> but<00:02:29.050> I<00:02:29.110> think<00:02:29.319> most<00:02:29.530> people

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
than the 12c but I think most people

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.290 
than the 12c but I think most people
