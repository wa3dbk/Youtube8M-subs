00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
everyone's in the same boat so this is

everyone's in the same boat so this is
her<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> certainly<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> pressure

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
her this is certainly a pressure

her this is certainly a pressure
situation<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.610> wouldn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610

send<00:01:23.820> never<00:01:24.000> felt<00:01:24.150> push<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.689> it's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
send never felt push like this but it's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
send never felt push like this but it's
certainly<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.229> pressure<00:01:25.460> whose
