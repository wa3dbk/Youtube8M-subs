00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.548
 What are you doing, Rafa? 

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:10.366
 I want to do a little trick with my dad. 

00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:12.091
 We will be playing Wii 

00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:13.433
 And when he leaves 

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:17.060
 I'm going to change into that. 

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.236
 BROKEN SCREEN 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.151
 We were playing Wii, I ended up letting go of control. 

00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:37.786
 Now we have no TV. 

00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:43.078
 You can fix it, right? 

00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:47.890
 It's over. Already lost. 

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:55.153
 You're going to have to pay. 

00:00:56.234 --> 00:00:57.131
 I? Because? 

00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:59.056
 Cause you that broke. 

00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:05.204
 Well, it was an accident, so no. 

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:15.246
 What is going on? What did they do? 

00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:18.909
 We let the control hit the tv. 

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:22.355
 Look Rafael, 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.123
 You who get caught up in it. 

00:01:25.238 --> 00:01:26.350
 But we were playing ... 

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:30.003
 Since it costs nothing to you, they do it. 

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:31.441
 How do you not like it for us? 

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:33.377
 How not? 

00:01:33.377 --> 00:01:36.351
 Because I would pay, but since there is my father. 

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:38.951
 Ah, you, the father, come here! 

00:01:39.337 --> 00:01:41.784
 Rafael, come here. 

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:45.383
 Why did not you tell me about it? 

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:48.038
 Rafa asked not to tell you. 

00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:54.926
 There is no solution. 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.332
 The liquid crystal is already broken. 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.254
 And your reaction is like that? Only that? 

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:05.008
 What's the use of getting bored? 

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.400
 You can not fix this. 

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:16.854
 You know what shocks you? You always keep hiding everything! 

00:02:18.297 --> 00:02:19.753
 I'm not hiding 

00:02:19.753 --> 00:02:21.017
 He asked me not to tell you! 

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:23.592
 Ah yes! Funny! 

00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:29.205
 Look at this. 

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:30.549
 It is! 

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:37.624
 What did they do? 

00:02:37.648 --> 00:02:38.411
 Is a joke 

00:02:38.436 --> 00:02:39.612
 For Father's Day. 

00:02:39.612 --> 00:02:42.611
 You already knew! You already knew! 

00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:43.481
 Knew what? 

00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:45.263
 You already knew! Look! 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.654
 You already knew! You already knew! 

00:02:50.654 --> 00:02:52.539
 It can not be! Not! 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.005
 You were not angry, you were not angry because? 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.551
 He was not angry. Do not be a liar! 

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:01.966
 You already knew! You already knew! 

00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:03.535
 I knew nothing! 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.773
 Out over there! 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.287
 Rafa, what if someone wants to play the same game? 

00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:15.377
 If they want to do the same download the image that has a link in the description. 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.183
 They're going to kill me!
