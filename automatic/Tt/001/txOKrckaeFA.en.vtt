00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.219
 this is the deserves of the pretty 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.350
 we use more beautiful than tuna 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.920
 it's curious 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 because we distinguish the part 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.150
 of color in one of the most 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.290
 important that we distinguish tuna from 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 nice is for the fins for this and for 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.650
 'the one you have here in courage from below 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.630
 the bowl and the tuna have triangular 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.430
 pretty has like backwards 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.280
 he only has them triangular and he does not have 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.100
 a list without club the clac to the pretty 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.680
 Let us read and looks because it is the longest 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.910
 fin but transversal or parallel to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.700
 body and in the tuna we call the 28 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.270
 It is called a cimarron in Basque 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.629
 and the fin is triangular clack 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.580
 or this good you see that it is a part that 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.270
 he has stuck a cut that is the 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.219
 belly and say part of 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.760
 of the throat and all that we want 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:17.110
 I cut here 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.110
 and we turn it around 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.330
 and but it's going to clean up a little 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.659
 he has not done alone to use 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:28.820
 a lot of car when I return from faith 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.460
 but it turns around a little earlier but 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.790
 we avoid the bone and everything then we go 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.610
 cleaning and we use it for other 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.340
 things so to do some kind of 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.010
 some appetizer we all use for 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 the marmitako because they make us a little 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:50.280
 big though you'll see what we 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.990
 we take him out to take our actions 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.140
 what we leave alone the heart of the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.490
 mothers here the good thing that you notice when 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.150
 it's juicy between the skin and the meat there 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.119
 as fat or gelatin then it will come out 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.960
 juicy if you do not have that so it's not 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.960
 it will come out juicy 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.710
 during all the shrinkage that this 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.790
 intriguing benito like andrÃ©s that has 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.790
 so much that 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.030
 Well now everything is done like this 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.030
 You see what it is worth
