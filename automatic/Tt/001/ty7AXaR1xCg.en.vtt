00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello my name is quietly Lashchenko you 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.080
 see issue 11 prepared descriptions 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.120
 tars district in which i am considering 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.820
 interesting guitar and today i have in 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.190
 arms firms guitar prs this subscription 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.980
 model Chris guitarist Anderson 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 reduce down the specifications back 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.720
 Part of the deck is made of mahogany 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.529
 top here is maple fingerboard 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.859
 rosewood 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.240
 Vultures are sick too mahogany suit 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.390
 lacquer pegs that can be twisted 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.700
 thereby preventing the descent down 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 concert time to some extent 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.360
 brisha you see branded Pereslavsky 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.980
 but here you can adjust the mentura 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.510
 separately each string in contrast to 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.790
 cheaper models of guitars and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.920
 this company so you already noticed on this 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.559
 guitar three pickups humbucker native 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.329
 delivered by the factory but not every 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.690
 thunder position is responsible for every 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.610
 sensor 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.219
 and we already have a pool on one of 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.969
 potentiometers including which raising 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.949
 potentiometer 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.590
 we add to any of the sensors 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.719
 the average sensor thus very much 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.800
 interesting sound 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.000
 unusual in my opinion the system of three 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.860
 sensors in my very 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.420
 interesting and well let's listen 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.420
 wedge sound bridge cottages 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270
 not 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.790
 and 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.290
 and 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 and 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.900
 not 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.990
 name 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.659
 and 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.340
 etc. 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.170
 and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.220
 etc. 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.220
 and not 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.120
 and now 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.120
 money 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.510
 and you cable 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.510
 or 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.890
 and 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.890
 and 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.890
 and 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.430
 and 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.260
 not 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.920
 these plates 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.920
 and 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.700
 and and 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.560
 this baby baby 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.560
 and 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.230
 be-be-be-be-be 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.140
 and 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.210
 baby baby 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.800
 which is probably very diverse 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.050
 one of the best guy i have when 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.760
 either played to be honest I'm confused in 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.980
 these all potentiometers are none to my 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.300
 look too much but proper 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.819
 saying i think it is a matter of habit 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.120
 I just could not play this balcony 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.980
 sound attributed to fender stratocaster 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.720
 gibson les paul boiler us guitars 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.300
 somehow she has her own 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.660
 I do not know the sound is very recognizable but 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.660
 its 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.960
 with me 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.740
 well , in the end I will play a little under 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.510
 buoy track i think i need something 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.240
 alternative is still cress 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.240
 Henderson play alternative music 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.240
 go 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.050
 and 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.650
 and 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.200
 and
