also<00:03:15.390> was<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.750> great<00:03:15.959> example<00:03:16.230> of<00:03:16.530> horizontal

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
also was a great example of horizontal

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.830 
also was a great example of horizontal
integration<00:03:17.400> across<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.209> corporation<00:03:18.750> we

were able to draw upon expertise from

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.949 
were able to draw upon expertise from

was<00:03:30.359> such<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> great<00:03:31.049> asset<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:32.099> think<00:03:32.340> that

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
was such a great asset and I think that

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:39.330 
was such a great asset and I think that
it's<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.910> unique<00:03:33.510> attribute<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:34.079> walking<00:03:34.440> one
