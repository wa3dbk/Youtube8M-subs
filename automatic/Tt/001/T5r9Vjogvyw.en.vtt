00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
straight line up here comes out neater

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.090 
straight line up here comes out neater
that<00:02:08.090> way<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:10.480> line<00:02:11.480> from<00:02:11.930> right<00:02:12.320> to<00:02:12.590> left<00:02:12.620> right

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
that way a line from right to left right

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.630 
that way a line from right to left right
listen<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.940> ahead<00:02:15.010> one<00:02:16.010> ear<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.580> other

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.410 

see<00:02:22.640> how<00:02:22.820> with<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.720> set<00:02:24.110> you're<00:02:24.590> here<00:02:24.800> just

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
it gets used to it minus they're used to

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.160 
it gets used to it minus they're used to
it<00:02:31.280> now<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:33.590> after<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:35.390> get<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.750> like<00:02:35.930> this
