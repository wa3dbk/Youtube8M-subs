see there's a lot of people this might
apply<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> well

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
apply to and so how do you do it well

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
apply to and so how do you do it well
using<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:13.680> system<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.400> go<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.240> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
using our system you would go in and you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.539 
using our system you would go in and you
would<00:01:15.689> choose<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.680> four<00:01:16.920> servings<00:01:17.310> now

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
would choose two or four servings now

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
would choose two or four servings now
keep<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.939> mind<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.360> choose<00:01:18.570> two<00:01:18.840> servings

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
keep in mind if you choose two servings

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920 
keep in mind if you choose two servings
it's<00:01:19.799> going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> give<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:21.060> total<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.720> four

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it's going to give you a total of four

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.420 
it's going to give you a total of four
servings<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.500> we<00:01:22.619> always<00:01:22.770> double<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
servings because we always double in the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.490 
servings because we always double in the
ommm<00:01:23.970> system<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.170> would<00:01:25.259> give<00:01:25.409> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
ommm system and so that would give you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
ommm system and so that would give you
four<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.979> each<00:01:26.159> meal<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.240> doing<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
four of each meal and so in doing that

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
four of each meal and so in doing that
you<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:28.590> make<00:01:28.829> those<00:01:29.070> meals<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.640> choose

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
you then make those meals you choose

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090 
you then make those meals you choose
lunch<00:01:30.299> items<00:01:30.840> lunch<00:01:31.170> items<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:31.710> items<00:01:32.040> that

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
lunch items lunch items or items that

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
get cooked on your cooking day rather

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.240

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
than on your serving day so they're

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.560

already cooked they just need to be
reheated<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.009> portion<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.640> single

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
