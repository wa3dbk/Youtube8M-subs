I<00:02:06.789> wonder<00:02:07.789> psychologically<00:02:08.420> if<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.599> tell

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
I wonder psychologically if you tell

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.910 
I wonder psychologically if you tell
someone<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.170> something<00:02:09.470> tastes<00:02:09.830> like

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
someone that something tastes like

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.500 
someone that something tastes like
peanut<00:02:10.069> butter<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.520> you<00:02:10.729> give<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.120> them

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
peanut butter and you give it to them

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.030 
peanut butter and you give it to them
I<00:02:11.540> think<00:02:11.900> I'd<00:02:11.989> agree<00:02:12.230> with<00:02:12.260> you<00:02:12.410> or<00:02:12.500> they<00:02:12.890> guys

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
I think I'd agree with you or they guys

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.820 
I think I'd agree with you or they guys
you're<00:02:13.280> gonna<00:02:13.430> kind<00:02:13.940> of<00:02:14.030> fact<00:02:14.330> check<00:02:14.599> it

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
you're gonna kind of fact check it

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.500 
you're gonna kind of fact check it
because<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.310> peanut<00:02:16.580> butter<00:02:16.670> flavor<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.239> weak

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
because the peanut butter flavor is weak

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.140 
because the peanut butter flavor is weak
it<00:02:18.200> reminds<00:02:18.709> me<00:02:18.920> more<00:02:19.129> really<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.760> maple<00:02:20.120> syrup

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
it reminds me more really of maple syrup

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
think of the role of the outside cover

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.710 
think of the role of the outside cover

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
syrup bar I know I think that would

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.240 
syrup bar I know I think that would
actually<00:02:42.489> be<00:02:42.610> even<00:02:42.880> better<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.860> then<00:02:44.980> again

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
actually be even better but then again

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.430 
actually be even better but then again
how<00:02:45.400> many<00:02:45.459> maple<00:02:46.000> syrup<00:02:46.360> bars<00:02:46.690> do<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:47.050> see<00:02:47.290> out
