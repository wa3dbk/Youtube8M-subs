00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.379
 out of these needs 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:09.719
 I know that our 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.099
 speech talking about wines here on our blog ansa 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.329
 according to government sources 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.329
 I would like to talk to you about health hygiene 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.050
 let's even wine it is already considered medicines already had known these 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.630
 health benefits 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.789
 has dignity paulo 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.589
 Famous doctors like mortgages 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.170
 we already know 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.240
 but it was in 1991 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.450
 When 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.650
 ended with a united states program similar website 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 eliene reports on the French paradox 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.150
 this means that we will transfer they have an intake of 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.090
 Extremely caloric greasy comets like cheese create month 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.319
 too high to buy 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:03.179
 to Americans, however, the financial mortality rate is much lower 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:06.689
 grandson an autopsy 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 the consumption of wine, ie if they have a habit of consuming 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.480
 the names of heart problems in relation to comments 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.400
 good agreement said in an interview that was given by josé edson silveira marks the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.090
 wine consumption in the United States increased a lot the next day 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.910
 Sino-Americans run to me 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.240
 and then also aroused the interests of other scientists to study more 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.820
 actions benefit 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.430
 then make 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.580
 with the reduction of heart diseases such as health and education 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.990
 cancer of diabetic and hypertensive problems have doubts about the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.000
 human health but could also benefit from 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.250
 not the medical class has come to the conclusion that electrotronorte is not 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.980
 considered toxic to the organism 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.540
 the person should consume at most one gram of alcohol 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.410
 around here the group of people 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.520
 and said Lord of reason but this account that the obese person 70 80 kilos not 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.639
 should know with a bottle of wine 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.590
 this is what it is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.430
 we think it would be the limit of the person consuming a bottle of wine a day 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.899
 a person of 77 kilos 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.360
 but I do not want them to recommend 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.079
 that they also decided to support treating this beneficial effect 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:29.549
 always thinking about improving 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.989
 perhaps related to the consumption could take frequent or that of the dam of 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.629
 Beautiful mount over the weekend and do not take it for a week 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.439
 so it's raining and if you lose all the money 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.570
 For men 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.679
 around 70 80 kilos 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:50.669
 half a bottle of wine preferably without it along with the meals because 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.259
 when you are learning from consumer institutions 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.449
 or with the weapon 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:00.709
 the migration of alcohol to venezuela faces is much more favorable 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.129
 would also be judged help to thin motor-racing right 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:09.709
 and for women then even a little less 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.139
 ex-palm player is to gain a lot of weight from the person because sometimes the 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:15.329
 people in the area 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.399
 denied target sensitivity 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.939
 this would be very nice the scary interior people greeted the governor 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.689
 should receive 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.659
 so it is a solution that landed with at most two glasses of wine per day 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.840
 and it's lunch at dinner 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.559
 so he stayed inside too 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:37.309
 of our Brazilian requirement of traffic laws, or to be a company there 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:39.139
 will drive later 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.360
 was the maximum piglet donation of a bottle delivery 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.209
 to arrive 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.300
 but also the two patients he deserves 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.649
 is within the allowed limit 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:53.839
 come back to the point where many scientists are studying the effects of 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.109
 of alcohol in the body are Carlos 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.109
 among the main ones of the day were cited in several papers 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:06.029
 we are in a decrease of the bad cholesterol the increase of the occurrence of the robbery 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.969
 macgyver he is favored 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:09.949
 I'm not 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.099
 or daily alcohol then people who drink regularly 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:18.780
 the club finally not only the author I answer comparative studies 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.999
 on the next day's edition 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:23.559
 and other drinks like beer 

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:28.629
 hours it is generally perceived that the government is more favorable than the 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:33.549
 other drinks because besides alcohol he has several federal agencies like 

00:04:33.549 --> 00:04:37.229
 the astral reader was also well studied 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:41.789
 then in these other agents and entertainment of the city and alcohol the 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.379
 item other actions 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.800
 numbers that organizes 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.669
 so my foot and a half with daily consumption with the new law 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.219
 decreases the body's bad cholesterol - Brazilian production does not play well 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.949
 this also causes us to reduce people on board because of problems 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.529
 cardiac 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.809
 also has the frame with the favoring of the partners of the 

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:09.020
 petrobras that started well before 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.770
 means that the risk of having a higher risk of diseases such as coagulation 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.080
 in the blood 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.439
 there are others also have 66 were found alzaimer ammo of 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.529
 insanity 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.529
 the suspects are people over 65 years 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.759
 showed that people who consumed with this daily frequency changes 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:30.919
 moderate 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.519
 decreased more per cent in the residence of alzaimer 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.919
 and other dependencies 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.979
 there was also by sérgio kings with it also reduces cdi stone rate in 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.379
 poultry 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:49.069
 it has an already significant effect against the risk of cancer 

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.509
 all the senses 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:57.069
 will also analyze the researches will still triple the athletes still 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.569
 there are many athletes there 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.919
 of truth and lies but is what the international medical society 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.259
 recommends that 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:09.740
 the person is receiving money from anyone according to the minister 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.319
 same 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:14.469
 with medical monitoring of the selection has no restriction even 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.159
 There is more to life than knowing how to use good 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.949
 good maybe any doubt disasters can be noticed by parents talk about the use 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.489
 of wines with the confrontation takes the central prudent guild to the new local team 

00:06:28.489 --> 00:06:29.860
 also 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:30.640
 to the square
