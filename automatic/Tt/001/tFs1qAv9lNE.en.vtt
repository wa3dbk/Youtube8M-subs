you mix together to give a pretty wide
variety<00:01:03.659> of<00:01:03.930> sounds<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.559> then<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> have

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
variety of sounds and then you have

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.300 
variety of sounds and then you have
presents<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.489> depth<00:01:06.150> which<00:01:06.920> give<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.040> more

number<00:01:12.570> ten<00:01:12.810> below<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.430> 50<00:01:14.909> watt<00:01:15.229> el34

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
number ten below that is a 50 watt el34

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.670 
number ten below that is a 50 watt el34
amp<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.790> has<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:19.020> single<00:01:19.290> channel<00:01:19.560> but

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
amp that has it's a single channel but

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.219 
amp that has it's a single channel but
it<00:01:19.799> has<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.220> gain<00:01:20.580> boost<00:01:20.760> and<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.720> volume<00:01:21.900> boost

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
it has a gain boost and a volume boost

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.350 
it has a gain boost and a volume boost
so<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.100> actually<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:24.030> options<00:01:24.180> than

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
so you actually have more options than

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
so you actually have more options than
just<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.689> typical<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> channel<00:01:25.409> amp<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> have

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
just a typical to channel amp you have

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
just a typical to channel amp you have
you<00:01:26.010> can<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.760> increase<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.689> gain

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you can you can have increase the gain

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.660 
you can you can have increase the gain
and<00:01:28.200> increase<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> volume<00:01:28.710> independently

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and increase the volume independently

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.359 
and increase the volume independently
and<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.000> course<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.360> control<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:30.750> much

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
and of course you can control how much

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.789 
and of course you can control how much
of<00:01:32.369> gain<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.390> volume<00:01:33.570> boost<00:01:33.929> you<00:01:34.079> can<00:01:34.439> dial<00:01:34.649> in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
of gain and volume boost you can dial in

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.560 
of gain and volume boost you can dial in

and<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.350> made<00:01:55.530> some<00:01:56.280> interesting<00:01:56.429> two

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
and you made some interesting two

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.760 
and you made some interesting two
choices<00:01:57.509> for<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.689> preamp<00:01:58.020> section<00:01:58.229> as<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
choices for the preamp section as you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.809 
choices for the preamp section as you
explained<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.189> me<00:01:59.369> earlier

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
explained to me earlier

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.700 
explained to me earlier
yeah<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.359> preamp<00:02:00.719> section<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.409> don't<00:02:01.590> use

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
yeah the preamp section I don't use

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
yeah the preamp section I don't use
12ax7<00:02:02.009> s<00:02:02.460> or<00:02:02.549> twelve<00:02:02.789> anything<00:02:03.420> sevens<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.960> use

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
12ax7 s or twelve anything sevens I use

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
12ax7 s or twelve anything sevens I use
6s<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.340> 7s<00:02:05.579> which<00:02:05.909> are<00:02:06.060> octal<00:02:06.390> preamp<00:02:06.780> tubes

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
6s and 7s which are octal preamp tubes

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.520 
6s and 7s which are octal preamp tubes
and<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.369> me<00:02:08.460> they<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.910> bigger<00:02:09.179> sound<00:02:10.020> more

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and to me they have a bigger sound more

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.220 
and to me they have a bigger sound more
of<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.800> power<00:02:11.190> tube<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:12.420> sound<00:02:12.810> particularly

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
of a power tube like sound particularly

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.809 
of a power tube like sound particularly
when<00:02:13.440> they're<00:02:13.530> over<00:02:13.710> driven<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.550> it's<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
when they're over driven so it's a

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.920 
when they're over driven so it's a
little<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> different<00:02:15.300> character<00:02:15.600> it<00:02:15.720> still

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
little a different character it still

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.150 
little a different character it still
sounds<00:02:16.170> familiar<00:02:16.290> still<00:02:16.680> sounds<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.010> rock

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
sounds familiar still sounds like a rock

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.650 
sounds familiar still sounds like a rock
amp<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> me<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:17.819> sound<00:02:18.060> much<00:02:18.330> more<00:02:18.360> like

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
amp but to me they sound much more like

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.110 
amp but to me they sound much more like
like<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.960> big<00:02:19.380> amp<00:02:19.560> being<00:02:19.860> over<00:02:20.010> driven<00:02:20.310> than

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
like a big amp being over driven than

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.309 
like a big amp being over driven than
12ax7<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.780> do<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:21.990> they<00:02:22.050> don't<00:02:22.110> have<00:02:22.290> that

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
12ax7 to do and they don't have that

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.650 
12ax7 to do and they don't have that
sort<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.340> harshness<00:02:24.240> that<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
sort of you know harshness that you

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.750 
sort of you know harshness that you
sometimes<00:02:24.870> get<00:02:25.140> with<00:02:25.319> 12ax7<00:02:25.620> s<00:02:26.010> of<00:02:26.670> course

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
sometimes get with 12ax7 s of course

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.370 
sometimes get with 12ax7 s of course
well-baked<00:02:27.090> 7s<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.480> been<00:02:27.569> used<00:02:27.780> for<00:02:28.170> years

well-baked 7s have been used for years

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
well-baked 7s have been used for years
you<00:02:28.680> know<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.980> many<00:02:29.130> great<00:02:29.490> classic<00:02:30.000> wonderful

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
you know in many great classic wonderful

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.730 
you know in many great classic wonderful
amps<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.900> you<00:02:31.020> know<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.200> can't<00:02:31.500> argue<00:02:31.650> with

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
amps that you know you can't argue with

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.410 
amps that you know you can't argue with
them<00:02:31.950> but<00:02:32.130> these<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.880> sound<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.120> little<00:02:33.209> bit<00:02:33.390> a

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
them but these just sound a little bit a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.760 
them but these just sound a little bit a
little<00:02:33.750> bit<00:02:33.840> different<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> little

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
little bit different and have a little

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.110 
little bit different and have a little
bit<00:02:34.890> more<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.459> power<00:02:35.610> tube<00:02:35.850> kind<00:02:36.060> of

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
bit more of a power tube kind of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.940 
bit more of a power tube kind of
character<00:02:36.480> well<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.650> sounding<00:02:37.920> pretty

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
character well this is sounding pretty

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.680 
character well this is sounding pretty
cool<00:02:38.340> so<00:02:38.550> far<00:02:38.790> let's<00:02:39.150> hear<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.300> little<00:02:39.360> more<00:02:39.630> of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
cool so far let's hear a little more of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:52.400 
cool so far let's hear a little more of
the<00:02:39.750> ten<00:02:40.020> perhaps

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:06.839 

mmm

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
all right cool well you want to plug in

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.869 
all right cool well you want to plug in
the<00:03:09.260> nine<00:03:09.470> now<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.010> maybe<00:03:10.189> we<00:03:10.340> can<00:03:10.459> hear<00:03:10.670> some

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
the nine now and maybe we can hear some

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.520 
the nine now and maybe we can hear some
and<00:03:11.299> compare<00:03:11.599> the<00:03:11.689> two<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:11.870> hear<00:03:12.319> some<00:03:12.500> of

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
and compare the two and hear some of

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:37.520 
and compare the two and hear some of
these<00:03:12.620> differences<00:03:12.890> are

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.020

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
so just me or am I hear a little more

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.059 
so just me or am I hear a little more
rasp<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.840> one<00:03:41.020> may<00:03:41.200> be<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.349> good<00:03:41.530> rasp<00:03:41.800> that

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
rasp in this one may be a good rasp that

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.880 
rasp in this one may be a good rasp that
is<00:03:42.280> yeah<00:03:42.790> that's<00:03:43.120> it's<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.390> non<00:03:43.510> master<00:03:43.900> design

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
is yeah that's it's a non master design

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.140 
is yeah that's it's a non master design
so<00:03:45.220> you're<00:03:45.400> hearing<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.670> power<00:03:45.849> tubes<00:03:46.060> a

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
so you're hearing the power tubes a

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.309 
so you're hearing the power tubes a
little<00:03:46.330> bit<00:03:46.420> more<00:03:46.540> than<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.810> other<00:03:46.930> one<00:03:47.110> at

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
little bit more than the other one at

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.500 
little bit more than the other one at
the<00:03:47.410> volume<00:03:47.680> we<00:03:47.770> were<00:03:47.860> listening<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.520> and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
the volume we were listening to so and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.110 
the volume we were listening to so and
we've<00:03:49.750> got<00:03:49.870> quite<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.140> bit<00:03:50.319> of<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:51.220> right

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
we've got quite a bit of the right

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.030 
we've got quite a bit of the right
volume<00:03:52.330> dialed<00:03:53.080> in<00:03:53.200> there<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.830> little<00:03:53.920> bit

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
volume dialed in there and a little bit

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.770 
volume dialed in there and a little bit
less<00:03:54.220> normal<00:03:54.580> volume<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.300> two<00:03:55.390> channels

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
less normal volume so the two channels

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.170 
less normal volume so the two channels
get<00:03:56.260> mixed<00:03:56.470> together<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.980> you<00:03:57.760> know<00:03:57.940> like<00:03:58.120> I

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
get mixed together and you know like I

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.240 
get mixed together and you know like I
said<00:03:58.239> you<00:03:58.420> can<00:03:58.569> vary<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.290> amount<00:03:59.319> of<00:03:59.680> each<00:04:00.040> and

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
said you can vary the amount of each and

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.650 
said you can vary the amount of each and
the<00:04:00.610> boost<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:00.910> on<00:04:01.030> which<00:04:01.209> gives<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.420> little<00:04:01.540> bit

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
the boost is on which gives a little bit

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.410 
the boost is on which gives a little bit
more<00:04:01.720> more<00:04:02.709> gain<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.230> again<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
more more gain and so and again the the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.949 
more more gain and so and again the the
presence<00:04:07.420> and<00:04:07.510> depth

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
presence and depth

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:09.360 
presence and depth
allow<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.530> control<00:04:08.739> get<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.010> little<00:04:09.190> bit<00:04:09.280> of

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
allow you to control get a little bit of

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.280 
allow you to control get a little bit of
thump<00:04:09.610> with<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> depth<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.780> ups<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.110> low

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
thump with the depth it ups the low

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.110 
thump with the depth it ups the low
frequency<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.160> little<00:04:12.910> frizzy

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
frequency and it that little frizzy

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.340 
frequency and it that little frizzy
response<00:04:13.420> at<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.630> at<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.930> back<00:04:14.080> end<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.260> the

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
response at the at the back end of the

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.020 
response at the at the back end of the
answer<00:04:14.799> so<00:04:15.250> if<00:04:15.340> you're<00:04:15.430> gonna<00:04:15.549> say<00:04:16.950> assign<00:04:18.030> one

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
answer so if you're gonna say assign one

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.370 
answer so if you're gonna say assign one
of<00:04:19.060> these<00:04:19.150> respective<00:04:19.690> amps<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.049> kind<00:04:20.229> of<00:04:20.260> a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
of these respective amps to kind of a

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.670 
of these respective amps to kind of a
player<00:04:20.620> type<00:04:21.900> do<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:22.930> have<00:04:23.050> any<00:04:23.200> idea<00:04:23.590> about

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
player type do you have any idea about

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.040 
player type do you have any idea about
how<00:04:23.889> how<00:04:24.639> you<00:04:24.700> would<00:04:24.910> approach<00:04:25.090> that<00:04:25.389> well

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
how how you would approach that well

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.020 
how how you would approach that well
they're<00:04:26.229> both<00:04:26.380> designed<00:04:26.620> for<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.700> gigging

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
they're both designed for the gigging

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
guitarist and in fact I tweaked my amps

guitarist and in fact I tweaked my amps
I<00:04:31.810> mean<00:04:31.930> I'm<00:04:32.200> in<00:04:32.290> a<00:04:32.320> band<00:04:33.100> a<00:04:33.310> semi-professional

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.790 
band and I take my prototypes to
rehearsal<00:04:36.160> and<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.490> even<00:04:37.479> gigs<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.139> have

rehearsal and and even gigs and I have

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.629 
rehearsal and and even gigs and I have
switches<00:04:39.130> on<00:04:39.220> them<00:04:39.310> to<00:04:39.400> try<00:04:39.520> different

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 
switches on them to try different

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.090 
switches on them to try different
components<00:04:40.150> as<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.330> tweak<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.780> sound<00:04:41.350> so<00:04:41.919> that

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
components as I tweak the sound so that

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.320 
components as I tweak the sound so that
I<00:04:42.130> know<00:04:42.250> that<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.580> works<00:04:42.669> not<00:04:42.880> just<00:04:42.940> in<00:04:43.210> your

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
I know that it works not just in your

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.850 
I know that it works not just in your
living<00:04:43.539> room<00:04:43.630> or<00:04:43.750> sitting<00:04:44.260> you<00:04:44.410> know<00:04:44.500> in<00:04:44.740> your

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
living room or sitting you know in your

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.469 
living room or sitting you know in your
bedroom<00:04:45.130> but<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:45.310> actually<00:04:45.430> works<00:04:45.729> in<00:04:46.270> the

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
bedroom but it actually works in the

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.440 
bedroom but it actually works in the
context<00:04:46.900> of<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.050> band<00:04:47.229> situation<00:04:47.770> and<00:04:48.700> the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
context of a band situation and the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.390 
context of a band situation and the
having<00:04:50.289> a<00:04:50.350> non<00:04:50.470> master<00:04:50.800> volume<00:04:50.979> means<00:04:51.280> that

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
having a non master volume means that

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.560 
having a non master volume means that
you<00:04:51.490> can<00:04:51.610> be<00:04:51.700> playing<00:04:51.880> loud<00:04:52.120> if<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.419> want

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
you can be playing loud if you want

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.100 
you can be playing loud if you want
overdrive<00:04:53.070> so<00:04:54.070> number<00:04:54.910> 10<00:04:55.120> is<00:04:55.330> more<00:04:55.720> flexible

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
overdrive so number 10 is more flexible

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.420 
overdrive so number 10 is more flexible
than<00:04:56.289> number<00:04:56.440> 9<00:04:56.590> at<00:04:56.740> regard<00:04:57.010> you<00:04:57.130> can<00:04:57.250> dial

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
than number 9 at regard you can dial

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.159 
than number 9 at regard you can dial
down<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.700> volume<00:04:58.030> with<00:04:58.210> a<00:04:58.240> master<00:04:58.630> volume

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
down the volume with a master volume

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:01.770 
down the volume with a master volume
control<00:05:00.240> but<00:05:01.240> you<00:05:01.419> know<00:05:01.510> they're<00:05:01.660> both

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
control but you know they're both

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.020 
control but you know they're both
designed<00:05:01.960> for<00:05:02.530> for<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.310> rock<00:05:03.490> you<00:05:03.910> know

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030

guitar<00:05:04.330> player<00:05:04.539> and<00:05:04.979> number<00:05:05.979> 9<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.190> just<00:05:06.340> it's

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
guitar player and number 9 is just it's

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.850 
guitar player and number 9 is just it's
simpler<00:05:06.910> and<00:05:07.289> it's<00:05:08.289> a<00:05:08.410> little<00:05:08.620> bit<00:05:08.710> more

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
simpler and it's a little bit more

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.710 
simpler and it's a little bit more
straightforward<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:10.180> circuits<00:05:10.510> are<00:05:10.600> both

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
straightforward the circuits are both

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.790 
straightforward the circuits are both
are<00:05:10.870> very<00:05:11.020> simple<00:05:11.320> they're<00:05:11.440> both<00:05:11.560> single

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
are very simple they're both single

are very simple they're both single
channel<00:05:12.039> amp<00:05:12.220> well<00:05:12.370> there's<00:05:12.550> two<00:05:12.669> channels<00:05:13.000> on

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
channel amp well there's two channels on

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.120 
channel amp well there's two channels on
there<00:05:13.210> but<00:05:13.680> they're<00:05:14.680> pretty<00:05:14.889> straightforward

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
there but they're pretty straightforward

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.730 
there but they're pretty straightforward
because<00:05:15.550> one<00:05:15.700> of<00:05:15.729> my<00:05:15.880> sort<00:05:16.270> of<00:05:16.740> driving

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
because one of my sort of driving

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.590 
because one of my sort of driving
philosophies<00:05:18.280> is<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.580> more<00:05:18.729> circuitry<00:05:19.330> your

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
philosophies is the more circuitry your

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.840 
philosophies is the more circuitry your
guitar<00:05:19.840> signal<00:05:19.990> has<00:05:20.289> to<00:05:20.410> go<00:05:20.500> through<00:05:20.710> the<00:05:21.700> more

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
guitar signal has to go through the more

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.340 
guitar signal has to go through the more
it<00:05:21.910> becomes<00:05:22.060> degraded<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.720> little<00:05:23.110> bit<00:05:23.200> at<00:05:23.289> a

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
it becomes degraded a little bit at a

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.820 
it becomes degraded a little bit at a
time<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.520> purer<00:05:24.789> the<00:05:25.470> simply<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.560> circuit

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
time so the purer the simply the circuit

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.400 
time so the purer the simply the circuit
the<00:05:26.889> period<00:05:27.160> of<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.520> sound<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:28.840> that's<00:05:29.229> kind

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
the period of the sound so that's kind

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.570 
the period of the sound so that's kind
of<00:05:29.440> when<00:05:29.560> I'm<00:05:29.650> shooting<00:05:29.889> for<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.220> people
