00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
with the pliers I have to stick them in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.230 
with the pliers I have to stick them in
there<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.400> bit<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.759> it<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.909> pull<00:01:12.090> out

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
there a little bit to get it to pull out

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.429 
there a little bit to get it to pull out

with the pliers and you'll see that that

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.260 
with the pliers and you'll see that that
provides<00:01:16.619> room<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.119> just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
provides room for this thing just

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.330 
provides room for this thing just
squishing<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.810> pull<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.079> pin<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.740> ring

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
squishing just pull the pin out so ring

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.069 
squishing just pull the pin out so ring
do<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.090> isn't<00:01:21.329> camera<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.990> can

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
do that now this isn't camera as you can

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.929

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
see we just pop a little part of the pin

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.600 
see we just pop a little part of the pin
out<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.299> bit<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> flat<00:01:25.350> head<00:01:25.610> neck

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
you're probably never going to get it

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.359 
you're probably never going to get it
back<00:01:32.990> now<00:01:36.590> take<00:01:37.590> your<00:01:37.710> time<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.100> part

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
back now take your time with this part

definitely<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.030> drop<00:01:39.180> anything

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.210 

there's<00:01:51.330> a<00:01:51.390> whole<00:01:51.509> pin<00:01:51.860> when<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.189> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
there's a whole pin when you just do a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.830 
there's a whole pin when you just do a
second<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.299> difficult<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.720> get

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
second one it's really difficult to get

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
second one it's really difficult to get
to<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.159> but<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.670> can<00:01:56.820> get<00:01:56.940> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
to it but we can get it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.280 
to it but we can get it
pros<00:01:59.390> there's<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:00.600> easier<00:02:00.930> than<00:02:01.020> last

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
pros there's a lot easier than last

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.690 
pros there's a lot easier than last
thing<00:02:02.180> actually<00:02:03.180> known<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:04.490> next<00:02:05.490> tip<00:02:05.610> is

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
thing actually known this next tip is

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.219 
thing actually known this next tip is
