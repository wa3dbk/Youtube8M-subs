00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.430 
in my opinion I did not use a thicker
cream<00:03:19.430> with<00:03:19.640> this<00:03:19.819> um<00:03:20.090> my<00:03:20.569> foundation<00:03:21.140> is

cream with this um my foundation is
L'Oreal<00:03:22.250> True<00:03:22.489> Match<00:03:22.540> so<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:23.870> not<00:03:24.050> that

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
L'Oreal True Match so it's not that

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.740 
L'Oreal True Match so it's not that
