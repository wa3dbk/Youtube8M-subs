okay<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.100> your<00:00:02.129> driveshaft<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:03.060> we

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
okay this is your driveshaft that we

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.650 
okay this is your driveshaft that we
want<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.480> replace<00:00:03.659> which<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.589> right<00:00:04.770> here

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
want to replace which is right here

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.919 
want to replace which is right here
your<00:00:06.660> countershaft<00:00:07.519> is<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.610> little<00:00:09.000> gear<00:00:09.269> to

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
your countershaft is a little gear to

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.580 
your countershaft is a little gear to
the<00:00:10.050> right<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.969> the<00:00:11.969> final<00:00:12.320> reduction<00:00:13.320> gear

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the right and the final reduction gear

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
the right and the final reduction gear
is<00:00:16.400> right<00:00:17.400> here<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.940> which<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.210> don't<00:00:18.330> really

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
is right here and which we don't really

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.970 
is right here and which we don't really
play<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.830> different

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
play with but you can get different

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.259 
play with but you can get different
sizes<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> final<00:00:21.600> reduction<00:00:22.130> for<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
sizes for the final reduction for the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.980 
sizes for the final reduction for the
countershaft<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:26.539> different<00:00:27.539> ratios

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
countershaft here and different ratios

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.940 
countershaft here and different ratios
for<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.619> driveshaft<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.510> right<00:00:31.820> here<00:00:32.820> so

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
for the driveshaft here or right here so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.250 
for the driveshaft here or right here so
let's<00:00:34.950> let's<00:00:35.250> take<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.520> off<00:00:35.930> all<00:00:36.930> right<00:00:37.079> we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
let's let's take this off all right we

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:47.569 
let's let's take this off all right we
tipped<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> motor<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:42.920> like<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:46.340> this<00:00:47.340> whole

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
tipped the motor up like so this whole

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.250 
tipped the motor up like so this whole
back<00:00:47.789> cover<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> come<00:00:48.570> off<00:00:48.750> try<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
back cover is going to come off try and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.299 
back cover is going to come off try and
keep<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:51.170> gasket<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.559> good<00:00:52.770> shape<00:00:52.980> because

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
keep this gasket in good shape because

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
keep this gasket in good shape because

take pictures of it go clip you don't
want<00:01:13.200> step<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.740> step<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.250> do<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
want step one step as you do it so you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.520 
want step one step as you do it so you
can<00:01:15.060> redo<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.930> don't<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> book

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
can redo it if you don't have a book

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.399 
can redo it if you don't have a book
it's<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.460> rocket<00:01:17.759> science<00:01:18.080> okay<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it's not rocket science okay so this

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's not rocket science okay so this
whole<00:01:19.650> thing<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.920> come<00:01:20.070> off<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.549> may<00:01:20.700> need

they<00:01:30.509> were<00:01:30.570> suppressed<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.369> driveshaft<00:01:32.369> right

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
they were suppressed in driveshaft right

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
they were suppressed in driveshaft right
there<00:01:32.970> which<00:01:33.750> we're<00:01:33.930> gonna<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.320> out<00:01:34.530> now

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100

stock one as you can see that this part

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.960 
stock one as you can see that this part
of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.310> shaft<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:51.320> larger<00:01:52.320> okay<00:01:52.979> we're<00:01:53.729> going

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
of the shaft is larger okay we're going

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
of the shaft is larger okay we're going
to<00:01:54.119> replace<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.110> is<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> stock<00:01:55.619> gear

we're going to place this this

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.420 
we're going to place this this
countershaft<00:01:59.219> gear<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:02.040> make<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.310> go

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
countershaft gear and this to make it go

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.530 
countershaft gear and this to make it go
faster<00:02:03.020> now<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.079> look<00:02:04.290> back<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> keys<00:02:04.920> and

faster now we look back in the keys and
you<00:02:06.540> see<00:02:07.729> two<00:02:08.729> gears<00:02:09.440> now<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.530> want<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.770> go<00:02:10.860> on

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
you see two gears now you want to go on

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.830 
you see two gears now you want to go on
the<00:02:11.129> other<00:02:11.250> side

a<00:02:34.230> secondary<00:02:35.040> gear<00:02:36.290> replacement<00:02:37.290> right<00:02:37.470> here

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
a secondary gear replacement right here

a secondary gear replacement right here
and<00:02:37.980> I've<00:02:38.340> used<00:02:38.610> my<00:02:38.970> drive<00:02:39.480> shaft<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:40.049> different

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and I've used my drive shaft a different

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.509 
and I've used my drive shaft a different
drive<00:02:40.560> shaft<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:40.950> that's<00:02:41.160> it

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
drive shaft and that's it

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.650
