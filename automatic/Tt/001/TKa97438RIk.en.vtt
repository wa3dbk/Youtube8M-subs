00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
do that because minecraft was blocked on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.290 
do that because minecraft was blocked on
the<00:01:36.710> server<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.100> can<00:01:37.370> make<00:01:37.760> a<00:01:37.790> server<00:01:38.150> at

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
the server you can make a server at

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.500 
the server you can make a server at
school<00:01:38.840> or<00:01:39.080> even<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.500> land<00:01:39.800> because<00:01:40.430> uh<00:01:41.000> you

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
school or even a land because uh you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.330 
school or even a land because uh you
know<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.990> was<00:01:42.110> just<00:01:42.140> blocked<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.160> they

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
know it was just blocked so what they

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.180 
know it was just blocked so what they
ended<00:01:43.580> up<00:01:43.730> doing<00:01:43.790> was<00:01:44.360> on<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.170> max<00:01:45.470> going

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
ended up doing was on the max going

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.880 
ended up doing was on the max going
ahead<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:46.760> making<00:01:46.820> like<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.720> private<00:01:48.620> network

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
ahead and making like a private network

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.250 
ahead and making like a private network
I<00:01:49.310> guess<00:01:49.550> so<00:01:49.730> they<00:01:49.880> made<00:01:50.090> this<00:01:50.270> like<00:01:50.960> little

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
I guess so they made this like little

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.170 
I guess so they made this like little
private<00:01:51.740> network<00:01:52.070> thing<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.550> go<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.820> your

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
private network thing you go to your

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.210 
private network thing you go to your
like<00:01:53.420> network<00:01:53.870> preferences<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:54.980> say

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
like network preferences and you say

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.520 
like network preferences and you say
create<00:01:56.030> a<00:01:56.090> new<00:01:56.150> network<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.930> on<00:01:57.050> this<00:01:57.230> new

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
create a new network and on this new

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.670 
create a new network and on this new
network<00:01:58.040> minecraft<00:01:58.880> wouldn't<00:01:59.390> be<00:01:59.540> bad<00:01:59.840> but

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
network minecraft wouldn't be bad but

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.070 
network minecraft wouldn't be bad but
this<00:02:00.920> was<00:02:01.160> strictly<00:02:01.610> like<00:02:02.060> against<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.720> rules

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
this was strictly like against the rules

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.480 
this was strictly like against the rules
the<00:02:03.380> school<00:02:03.650> had<00:02:03.830> in<00:02:03.980> place<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:04.400> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
the school had in place for the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.390 
the school had in place for the
computers<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.270> they<00:02:05.510> knew<00:02:06.500> something<00:02:07.010> bad<00:02:07.190> was

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
computers so they knew something bad was

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.460 
computers so they knew something bad was
gonna<00:02:07.520> happen<00:02:07.640> anyway<00:02:08.390> they<00:02:08.720> ended<00:02:09.019> up<00:02:09.140> making

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
gonna happen anyway they ended up making

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.070 
gonna happen anyway they ended up making
it<00:02:09.769> and<00:02:09.979> they<00:02:10.489> ended<00:02:10.879> up<00:02:11.000> naming<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.780> server

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
it and they ended up naming the server

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.220 
it and they ended up naming the server
ass<00:02:12.500> or<00:02:13.160> no<00:02:13.400> no<00:02:13.459> no<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.879> network<00:02:14.390> itself<00:02:14.599> was

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
ass or no no no the network itself was

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.920 
ass or no no no the network itself was
named<00:02:15.440> like<00:02:15.709> ass<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.150> everyone<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
named like ass and so everyone in the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.030 
named like ass and so everyone in the
school<00:02:18.200> could<00:02:18.410> see<00:02:18.620> it

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
school could see it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.039 
school could see it
and<00:02:19.129> then<00:02:19.519> this<00:02:19.819> group<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.299> friends<00:02:20.629> would<00:02:20.750> use

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
and then this group of friends would use

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.539 
and then this group of friends would use
it<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.500> UM<00:02:21.890> get<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.819> together<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.390> then<00:02:23.989> they

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
it to UM get on together and then they

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.770 
it to UM get on together and then they
invited<00:02:25.549> everyone<00:02:25.879> else<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.480> school<00:02:26.599> and

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
whenever anyone like join the server

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.300 
whenever anyone like join the server

stuff like that and so this went on for
about<00:02:36.439> a<00:02:36.709> week<00:02:37.099> and<00:02:37.400> then<00:02:37.489> word<00:02:38.180> got<00:02:38.209> out<00:02:38.510> that

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.410 
about a week and then word got out that
the<00:02:39.230> school<00:02:39.620> was<00:02:39.859> looking<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.670> whoever<00:02:40.939> did

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
the school was looking for whoever did

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.509 
the school was looking for whoever did
it<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.230> school<00:02:42.500> knew<00:02:42.829> that<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.250> network

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
it so the school knew that the network

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.399 
it so the school knew that the network
was<00:02:43.879> up<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.359> they<00:02:44.420> were<00:02:44.480> playing<00:02:44.810> Minecraft

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
was up and they were playing Minecraft

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.309 
was up and they were playing Minecraft
and<00:02:45.680> stuff<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.189> saying<00:02:46.459> bad<00:02:46.670> stuff<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.329> but

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
and stuff and saying bad stuff and but

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.809 
and stuff and saying bad stuff and but
they<00:02:48.439> couldn't<00:02:48.709> track<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.129> people<00:02:49.400> who<00:02:49.579> did

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
they couldn't track the people who did

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.000 
they couldn't track the people who did
it<00:02:49.969> so<00:02:50.209> they<00:02:50.359> immediately<00:02:50.719> closed<00:02:51.470> down<00:02:51.769> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
it so they immediately closed down the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.759 
it so they immediately closed down the
server<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.639> just<00:02:53.569> kind<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.959> stopped<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.620> so

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
server and just kind of stopped and so

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.740 
server and just kind of stopped and so
the<00:02:54.920> school<00:02:55.189> had<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.700> continue<00:02:56.120> looking<00:02:56.299> and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the school had to continue looking and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.659 
the school had to continue looking and
they<00:02:57.169> had<00:02:57.409> to<00:02:57.590> pretty<00:02:57.859> much<00:02:58.099> go<00:02:58.159> through

00:02:58.659 --> 00:02:58.669 
they had to pretty much go through

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.659 
they had to pretty much go through
everyone's<00:02:59.060> like<00:02:59.569> computer<00:03:00.230> other<00:03:00.980> serial

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:01.669 
everyone's like computer other serial

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.059 
everyone's like computer other serial
keys<00:03:02.180> whatever<00:03:02.659> what's<00:03:03.079> it<00:03:03.230> called<00:03:03.470> i<00:03:03.650> don't

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
keys whatever what's it called i don't

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.580 
keys whatever what's it called i don't
know<00:03:04.129> but<00:03:04.909> their<00:03:05.120> computer<00:03:05.599> identification

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
know but their computer identification

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.869 
know but their computer identification
number<00:03:06.799> i<00:03:06.889> don't<00:03:07.280> know<00:03:07.370> what<00:03:07.489> she<00:03:07.579> called<00:03:07.760> out

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
number i don't know what she called out

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.059 
number i don't know what she called out
i<00:03:07.909> think<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.329> serial<00:03:08.720> number<00:03:08.959> yeah<00:03:09.169> and<00:03:09.439> so

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
i think it's a serial number yeah and so

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.399 
i think it's a serial number yeah and so
they<00:03:10.579> eventually<00:03:10.939> chased<00:03:11.569> it<00:03:11.780> back<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.290> the

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
they eventually chased it back to the

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.530 
they eventually chased it back to the
group<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.859> friends<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.639> then<00:03:13.849> they<00:03:14.090> denied<00:03:14.510> it

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
group of friends and then they denied it

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.390 
group of friends and then they denied it
they're<00:03:14.840> like<00:03:15.049> nah<00:03:15.290> that<00:03:15.650> wasn't<00:03:15.829> us<00:03:16.069> that

they're like nah that wasn't us that
wasn't<00:03:16.609> us<00:03:16.909> and<00:03:17.569> then<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.739> little<00:03:19.159> Network

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
wasn't us and then in the little Network

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.569 
wasn't us and then in the little Network
thing<00:03:19.970> they<00:03:20.629> had<00:03:20.959> their<00:03:21.470> name<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:22.069> so<00:03:22.340> the

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
thing they had their name and so the

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.939 
thing they had their name and so the
lady<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.359> runs<00:03:23.629> the<00:03:23.900> tech<00:03:24.169> support<00:03:24.409> was<00:03:24.769> like

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
lady that runs the tech support was like

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.129 
lady that runs the tech support was like
okay<00:03:25.340> let<00:03:25.609> me<00:03:25.729> see<00:03:25.909> your<00:03:26.000> computer<00:03:26.479> cuz<00:03:26.989> they

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
okay let me see your computer cuz they

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.199 
okay let me see your computer cuz they
could<00:03:27.349> see<00:03:27.530> what<00:03:28.069> had<00:03:28.280> logged<00:03:28.519> on<00:03:28.760> who<00:03:29.060> had

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
could see what had logged on who had

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.599 
could see what had logged on who had
logged<00:03:29.389> onto<00:03:29.659> the<00:03:29.870> server<00:03:30.169> and<00:03:30.500> then<00:03:31.159> they<00:03:31.340> saw

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
logged onto the server and then they saw

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.390 
logged onto the server and then they saw
that<00:03:32.269> they<00:03:32.720> had<00:03:32.750> lot<00:03:33.139> done<00:03:33.440> basically<00:03:33.979> and

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
that they had lot done basically and

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.849 
that they had lot done basically and
they<00:03:34.819> kept<00:03:35.060> trying<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.449> deny<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.139> so<00:03:36.709> the

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
they kept trying to deny it and so the

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.619 
they kept trying to deny it and so the
principal<00:03:37.250> was<00:03:37.430> eventually<00:03:37.669> just<00:03:37.970> like<00:03:38.209> okay

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
principal was eventually just like okay

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.420 
principal was eventually just like okay
