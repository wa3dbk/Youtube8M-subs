a<00:01:11.890> theme<00:01:12.510> pretty<00:01:13.510> often<00:01:13.720> it's<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.200> big<00:01:14.380> part<00:01:14.710> of

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
a theme pretty often it's a big part of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.680

each<00:01:15.280> of<00:01:15.460> his<00:01:15.610> books<00:01:15.909> and<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.270> don't<00:01:16.450> know<00:01:16.570> if

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
people maybe that's the reason they

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.630 
people maybe that's the reason they
don't<00:01:19.600> really<00:01:20.259> understand<00:01:20.950> his<00:01:21.189> work<00:01:21.430> is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
because they don't like that so much but

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.679 
because they don't like that so much but

just<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.990> speaks<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.710> her<00:02:26.150> she's<00:02:27.150> really

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
just it speaks to her she's really

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.390 
just it speaks to her she's really
attracted<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:28.770> some<00:02:28.950> reason<00:02:28.980> she

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
attracted to it for some reason she

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.790 
attracted to it for some reason she
can't<00:02:29.550> explain<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.240> then<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.440> picture

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
can't explain and then the picture

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.780 
can't explain and then the picture
starts<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.400> come<00:02:32.760> alive<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.630> that's<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:35.610> was

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
starts to come alive and that's that was

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.610 
starts to come alive and that's that was
the<00:02:35.940> weird<00:02:36.240> thing<00:02:36.570> for<00:02:36.810> me<00:02:36.959> like<00:02:37.200> it<00:02:37.410> would

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
the weird thing for me like it would

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.680 
the weird thing for me like it would
have<00:02:37.709> been<00:02:37.830> just<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.610> perfectly<00:02:39.180> fine<00:02:39.390> book

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
have been just a perfectly fine book

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.050 
have been just a perfectly fine book
probably<00:02:39.959> an<00:02:40.140> ordinary<00:02:40.620> book<00:02:40.860> is<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.790> it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
probably an ordinary book is that it

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.960 
probably an ordinary book is that it
just<00:02:42.240> kept<00:02:42.480> with<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.630> husband-wife<00:02:43.110> thing

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
just kept with the husband-wife thing

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.190 
just kept with the husband-wife thing
but<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> fact<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.420> they<00:02:45.570> threw<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.020> this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
but the fact is they threw in this

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.590 
but the fact is they threw in this
mysterious<00:02:46.680> picture<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.060> didn't

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
times I didn't really understand if it's

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.960 
times I didn't really understand if it's
like<00:03:07.380> there's<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.680> symbolism<00:03:08.580> that's

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
like there's this symbolism that's

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.630 
like there's this symbolism that's
supposed<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.300> go<00:03:09.420> along<00:03:09.660> with<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.900> picture<00:03:10.290> or

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
supposed to go along with the picture or

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.280 
supposed to go along with the picture or
like<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.080> completely<00:03:13.920> random<00:03:15.260> after<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
like it's just completely random after a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
like it's just completely random after a
while<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.620> start<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.920> understand<00:03:17.489> that<00:03:17.820> the

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
while you start to understand that the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.880 
while you start to understand that the
world<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.510> woman<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> picture<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.500> like<00:03:19.860> a

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
world the woman in the picture is like a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.940 
world the woman in the picture is like a
representation<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.180> wife<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.690> don't<00:03:22.650> have

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
i think i would give it like a b-minus

I'm grading it oh no I graded a
different<00:03:37.530> way<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:38.010> would<00:03:38.489> give<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.850> like<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.239> six

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
different way I would give it like a six

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.530

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
little twist on it but it's kind of

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.910 
little twist on it but it's kind of
similar<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.630> other<00:04:06.870> stuff<00:04:07.200> I've<00:04:07.380> read<00:04:07.650> and

similar to other stuff I've read and
that<00:04:08.549> stuff<00:04:08.970> caught<00:04:09.329> my<00:04:09.540> attention<00:04:10.110> more<00:04:10.290> this

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500
