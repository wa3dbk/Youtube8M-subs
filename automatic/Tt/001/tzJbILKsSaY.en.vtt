alright<00:05:21.229> so<00:05:21.379> let's<00:05:21.529> go<00:05:21.679> ahead<00:05:21.709> and<00:05:21.919> take<00:05:22.189> a

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:22.309 
alright so let's go ahead and take a

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:23.799 
alright so let's go ahead and take a
look<00:05:22.519> at<00:05:22.729> what's<00:05:22.939> in<00:05:23.059> store<00:05:23.269> for<00:05:23.479> us<00:05:23.509> for

00:05:23.799 --> 00:05:23.809 
look at what's in store for us for

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.649 
look at what's in store for us for
articulation<00:05:24.379> this<00:05:25.099> time<00:05:25.339> around<00:05:25.459> so<00:05:26.329> pretty

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
articulation this time around so pretty

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:31.259 
articulation this time around so pretty
much<00:05:26.749> what<00:05:27.469> you<00:05:27.589> see<00:05:27.619> is<00:05:29.409> about<00:05:30.409> what<00:05:30.589> you<00:05:30.679> get

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:31.269 
much what you see is about what you get

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:37.749 
much what you see is about what you get
yeah<00:05:34.599> Mordecai's<00:05:35.599> is<00:05:35.899> obviously<00:05:36.459> better<00:05:37.459> at

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 
yeah Mordecai's is obviously better at

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.719 
yeah Mordecai's is obviously better at
doing<00:05:38.299> the<00:05:38.509> bobble<00:05:38.839> head<00:05:38.989> motion<00:05:39.489> then<00:05:40.489> rig

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
doing the bobble head motion then rig

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.819 
doing the bobble head motion then rig
these<00:05:43.569> not<00:05:44.569> really<00:05:44.929> much<00:05:45.139> movement<00:05:45.409> at<00:05:45.589> all<00:05:45.679> in

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:45.829 
these not really much movement at all in

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:50.789 
these not really much movement at all in
fact<00:05:45.860> it's<00:05:46.219> almost<00:05:46.369> like<00:05:46.519> a<00:05:46.549> broken<00:05:47.539> joystick

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:50.799 

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:53.769 

yeah<00:05:51.799> so<00:05:52.309> these<00:05:52.519> arms<00:05:52.969> are<00:05:53.149> made<00:05:53.389> out<00:05:53.569> of<00:05:53.599> a

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:53.779 
yeah so these arms are made out of a

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.809 
yeah so these arms are made out of a
bendy<00:05:54.110> sort<00:05:54.379> of<00:05:54.469> plastic<00:05:54.979> but<00:05:55.519> they're<00:05:55.699> not

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
bendy sort of plastic but they're not

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.209 
bendy sort of plastic but they're not
intentionally<00:05:56.360> made<00:05:56.419> for<00:05:56.869> bending<00:05:57.289> so<00:05:57.860> keep

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
intentionally made for bending so keep

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.059 
intentionally made for bending so keep
that<00:05:58.249> in<00:05:58.429> mind<00:05:58.729> but<00:05:59.599> other<00:05:59.749> than<00:05:59.809> that<00:05:59.989> like<00:06:00.979> I

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
that in mind but other than that like I

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.379 
that in mind but other than that like I
said<00:06:01.159> what<00:06:01.429> you<00:06:01.489> see<00:06:01.639> is<00:06:01.729> what<00:06:01.789> you<00:06:01.939> get<00:06:02.119> you

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
said what you see is what you get you

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.269 
said what you see is what you get you
get<00:06:02.539> this<00:06:02.779> and<00:06:04.689> that<00:06:05.739> not<00:06:06.739> as<00:06:06.860> good<00:06:07.009> so<00:06:07.959> yeah

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
get this and that not as good so yeah

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.909 
get this and that not as good so yeah
not<00:06:10.279> great<00:06:10.489> I<00:06:10.819> mean<00:06:11.289> obviously<00:06:12.289> they're<00:06:12.769> more

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
not great I mean obviously they're more

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:15.040 
not great I mean obviously they're more
