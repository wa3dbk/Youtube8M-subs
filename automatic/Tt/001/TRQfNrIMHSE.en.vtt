00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
rig or a cam Kelly on the other hand you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
rig or a cam Kelly on the other hand you
could<00:01:03.000> use<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> tripod<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.690> hold<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.019> upside

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
could use a tripod and hold it upside

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.830 
could use a tripod and hold it upside
down<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.890> yeah<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> really<00:01:06.090> risky<00:01:06.390> but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
down and yeah this is really risky but

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810 
down and yeah this is really risky but
it<00:01:06.960> works<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.320> me<00:01:07.590> another<00:01:08.189> popular<00:01:08.430> shot<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
it works for me another popular shot is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
just move the tripod or a hand to follow

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590 
just move the tripod or a hand to follow
the<00:01:14.070> longboarder<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> prettiest

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the longboarder one of the prettiest

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.120 
the longboarder one of the prettiest
when<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.049> move<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> camera<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> slider

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
when you move the camera with a slider

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.830 
when you move the camera with a slider
this<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.700> when<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.970> move<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> camera<00:01:18.479> along

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
this is when you move the camera along

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.929 
this is when you move the camera along
in<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> line<00:01:19.259> sideways<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.759> shot

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
in a line sideways and that kind of shot

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.980 
in a line sideways and that kind of shot
looks<00:01:21.090> like<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:23.390> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.509> also<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.840> this

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
looks like this you can also do this

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
looks like this you can also do this
shot<00:01:25.140> without<00:01:25.290> using<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.799> slider<00:01:26.070> by<00:01:26.700> putting

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
shot without using a slider by putting

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.460 
shot without using a slider by putting
the<00:01:27.090> camera<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.509> smooth<00:01:27.810> longboard<00:01:28.290> than

the camera on a smooth longboard than

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
the camera on a smooth longboard than
just<00:01:28.619> pushing<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.009> longboard<00:01:29.400> sideways<00:01:29.820> with

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
just pushing the longboard sideways with

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.690 
just pushing the longboard sideways with
a<00:01:30.119> steady<00:01:30.390> hand<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.840> make<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> look<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.409> this

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700
