turn<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.300> your<00:01:06.659> model<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.590> may<00:01:07.800> mean<00:01:08.040> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
turn on your model that may mean that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.070 
turn on your model that may mean that
there's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> brass<00:01:08.700> trap<00:01:09.090> hair<00:01:09.420> clip<00:01:09.690> something

like<00:01:10.230> that<00:01:10.380> blocking<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> filter<00:01:11.460> from

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
like that blocking the filter from

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
like that blocking the filter from
turning<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:13.050> mean<00:01:13.230> that<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.440> have<00:01:13.620> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
turning this will mean that you have to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.870 
turning this will mean that you have to
get<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.980> the<00:01:14.070> pump<00:01:14.370> behind<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> filter

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:27.550 

thankfully<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.000> one's<00:01:21.210> okay

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560 

a<00:01:27.640> good<00:01:28.640> idea<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.270> to<00:01:30.110> take<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:30.710> long<00:01:31.570> headed

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
a good idea is to take a long headed

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.130 
a good idea is to take a long headed
screwdriver<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:34.060> use<00:01:35.060> that<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.960> give

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
screwdriver and use that just to give

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.060 
screwdriver and use that just to give
the<00:01:36.409> pump<00:01:36.950> impeller<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.790> spin<00:01:38.210> at<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.570> back

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
the pump impeller a spin at the back

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:49.740 
the pump impeller a spin at the back
that<00:01:40.070> should<00:01:40.369> spin<00:01:40.670> freely<00:01:48.340> no<00:01:49.340> issue<00:01:49.520> there

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
that should spin freely no issue there

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.600 
that should spin freely no issue there
now<00:01:50.750> if<00:01:50.869> your<00:01:51.020> machine<00:01:51.170> is<00:01:51.409> draining<00:01:51.979> slowly

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
now if your machine is draining slowly

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.660 
now if your machine is draining slowly
there<00:01:53.149> may<00:01:53.299> be<00:01:53.330> a<00:01:53.450> problem<00:01:53.659> with<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:53.960> hoses<00:01:54.440> or

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
there may be a problem with the hoses or

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.460 
there may be a problem with the hoses or
the<00:01:55.670> pipes<00:01:55.940> now<00:01:56.630> in<00:01:56.720> order<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:56.960> get<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.290> those

the hoses just bring the hose clips up
the<00:03:23.329> hose<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:24.680> makes<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.040> easier<00:03:25.310> to<00:03:25.340> replace

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
the hose this makes it easier to replace

the hose this makes it easier to replace
them<00:03:25.880> later

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.800 

this<00:03:46.550> also<00:03:46.730> gives<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.150> check<00:03:47.420> second

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
this also gives you a check second

chance to check the hoses if necessary

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.960 
chance to check the hoses if necessary
then<00:03:51.590> you<00:03:51.650> can<00:03:51.770> just<00:03:51.920> grab<00:03:52.070> your<00:03:52.310> new<00:03:52.400> pump<00:03:52.670> and

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
then you can just grab your new pump and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:09.850 
then you can just grab your new pump and
fit<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.750> hoses<00:03:54.050> back<00:03:54.170> on<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:09.530> there<00:04:09.650> we<00:04:09.740> have

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
fit the hoses back on so there we have
