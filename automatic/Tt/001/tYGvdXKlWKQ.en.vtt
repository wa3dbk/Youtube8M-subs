00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
so now you can see I started money gas

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.570 
so now you can see I started money gas
whenever<00:00:04.799> but<00:00:04.890> I'm<00:00:04.980> gonna<00:00:05.130> put<00:00:05.250> him<00:00:05.339> back<00:00:05.430> on

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
whenever but I'm gonna put him back on

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.039 
whenever but I'm gonna put him back on
minerals<00:00:05.940> because<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:06.509> notice<00:00:06.720> I<00:00:06.810> didn't<00:00:06.960> have

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
minerals because I notice I didn't have

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.810 
minerals because I notice I didn't have
enough<00:00:07.230> drums<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.589> minerals<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.670> was

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
enough drums on minerals and I was

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.970 
enough drums on minerals and I was
getting<00:00:09.030> plenty<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.330> gas<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.320> I'm<00:00:10.800> starting

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
getting plenty of gas and I'm starting

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.080 
getting plenty of gas and I'm starting
it<00:00:11.160> up<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.460> critical<00:00:11.700> number<00:00:12.030> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
it up to that critical number of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.400 
it up to that critical number of
greedless<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.540> I'm<00:00:12.599> pretty<00:00:12.719> comfortable<00:00:12.929> feel

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
greedless so I'm pretty comfortable feel

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.810 
greedless so I'm pretty comfortable feel
pretty<00:00:13.710> comfortable<00:00:13.830> engaging<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.610> at<00:00:14.700> this

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
pretty comfortable engaging them at this

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.140 
pretty comfortable engaging them at this
point

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
point

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.790 
point
especially<00:00:15.750> if<00:00:15.929> they're<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.199> using<00:00:16.350> hydro

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
especially if they're just using hydro

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.470 
especially if they're just using hydro
switch<00:00:17.130> like<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.789> said<00:00:17.970> you'll<00:00:18.119> see<00:00:18.270> how<00:00:18.359> they

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
switch like I said you'll see how they

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.760 
switch like I said you'll see how they
come<00:00:18.660> into<00:00:18.779> play<00:00:19.260> with<00:00:19.380> their<00:00:19.500> lack<00:00:19.619> of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
come into play with their lack of

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.740 
come into play with their lack of
mobility<00:00:19.920> here<00:00:20.250> pretty<00:00:20.400> soon<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:21.480> looking

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
mobility here pretty soon just looking

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.849 
mobility here pretty soon just looking
around<00:00:21.810> making<00:00:22.020> sure<00:00:22.140> they're<00:00:22.320> gonna<00:00:22.650> try<00:00:22.830> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
around making sure they're gonna try to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.410 
around making sure they're gonna try to
sneak<00:00:23.010> me<00:00:23.279> explain<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> me<00:00:23.670> where<00:00:23.789> nearby

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
sneak me explain to me where nearby

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.640 
sneak me explain to me where nearby
not<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.869> you're<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.019> see<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.380> because

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
not that you're gonna see that because

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.080 
not that you're gonna see that because
it's<00:00:25.769> really<00:00:25.859> hard<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.160> defend<00:00:26.400> extra

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
it's really hard to defend extra

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.660 
it's really hard to defend extra
expansions<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.660> degreaser<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.490> as<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.580> can

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
expansions and degreaser and as you can

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.640 
expansions and degreaser and as you can
see<00:00:29.730> I've<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.240> enough<00:00:30.480> Mewis<00:00:30.750> now<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.500> can

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
see I've got enough Mewis now that I can

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.229 
see I've got enough Mewis now that I can
just<00:00:31.769> pick<00:00:31.920> them<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.700> really<00:00:32.790> bad<00:00:33.030> job

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
just pick them off I do a really bad job

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.910 
just pick them off I do a really bad job
of<00:00:33.420> my<00:00:33.540> growing<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.410> mostly<00:00:34.739> just

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
of my growing here like I mostly just

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.319 
of my growing here like I mostly just
get<00:00:35.070> hit<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.430> don't<00:00:35.610> need<00:00:35.700> any<00:00:35.880> puffs<00:00:36.120> any

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
get hit and don't need any puffs any

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
get hit and don't need any puffs any
shots<00:00:36.540> but<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.260> was<00:00:37.350> kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.559> an<00:00:37.680> awkward

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
shots but it was kind of an awkward

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.630 
shots but it was kind of an awkward
angle<00:00:38.780> right<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.100> micro<00:00:41.460> these

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
angle right and the way you micro these

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.130 
angle right and the way you micro these
guys<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> group<00:00:42.899> them<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
guys is you want to group them in a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.779 
guys is you want to group them in a
group<00:00:43.350> anyone<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> group<00:00:43.950> with<00:00:44.190> either<00:00:44.309> either

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
group anyone a group with either either

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
group anyone a group with either either
an<00:00:45.000> overlord<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> larva<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.739> makes<00:00:46.980> me

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
an overlord or a larva which makes me

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.350 
an overlord or a larva which makes me
like<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.460> notice<00:00:47.730> right<00:00:47.850> now<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.059> mean<00:00:48.239> no

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
like if you notice right now I mean no

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.700 
like if you notice right now I mean no
one<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.809> catch<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.440> they're<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.680> of

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
one has to catch up but they're kind of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.410 
one has to catch up but they're kind of
all<00:00:49.829> stacked<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.280> top<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.520> top<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.149> each<00:00:51.239> other

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
all stacked on top of top of each other

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.270 
all stacked on top of top of each other
so<00:00:51.600> it's<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:51.899> what<00:00:52.140> having<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.590> single<00:00:52.920> muta

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so it's like what having one single muta

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.799 
so it's like what having one single muta
list<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:54.000> allows<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.420> micro<00:00:54.690> them<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
list which allows you to micro them a

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.900 
list which allows you to micro them a
lot<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:54.960> effectively<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> way

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
lot more effectively and then the way

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.099 
lot more effectively and then the way
you<00:00:56.969> micro<00:00:57.390> especially<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:57.840> you're<00:00:57.930> fighting

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
you micro especially if you're fighting

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.479 
you micro especially if you're fighting
combat<00:00:58.680> units<00:00:58.920> there's<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> few<00:00:59.250> different

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
combat units there's a few different

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.069 
combat units there's a few different
types<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.879> newest<00:01:00.120> micro<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.960> most

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
types of newest micro but the most

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.299 
types of newest micro but the most
standard<00:01:01.289> against<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.829> their<00:01:01.980> combat

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
standard against this way their combat

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.799 
standard against this way their combat
units<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.699> hydras<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.329> more<00:01:03.539> commonly

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
units like hydras or more commonly

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
units like hydras or more commonly
Marines<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.309> kind<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> wait<00:01:05.610> till<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
Marines you just kind of wait till you

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.310 
Marines you just kind of wait till you
get<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.119> range<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.720> hit<00:01:06.810> eight<00:01:07.049> real

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
get in range and then you hit eight real

quick wait for the shoot and then the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.100 
quick wait for the shoot and then the

better soon as they're shooting just
click<00:01:10.350> behind<00:01:10.619> them<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.979> they<00:01:11.070> flee<00:01:11.340> back

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
click behind them so that they flee back

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.830 
click behind them so that they flee back
up<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.880> here's<00:01:12.180> where<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.420> comes<00:01:12.600> into<00:01:12.750> play

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
up and here's where that comes into play

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.600 
up and here's where that comes into play
with<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> mobility<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.040> see<00:01:14.189> he<00:01:14.310> wants<00:01:14.520> to

with the mobility you see he wants to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.399 
with the mobility you see he wants to
expand<00:01:14.909> there<00:01:15.060> but<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:15.930> snipe<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> off

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
expand there but I can just snipe it off

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
expand there but I can just snipe it off
and<00:01:16.680> his<00:01:16.979> hydras<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.729> pretty<00:01:18.360> slow

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and his hydras have is pretty slow

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.690 
and his hydras have is pretty slow
hydras<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.680> go<00:01:19.830> leave<00:01:20.189> his<00:01:20.369> base<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
hydras I have to go leave his base and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.219 
hydras I have to go leave his base and
run<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> way<00:01:21.060> around<00:01:21.330> those<00:01:21.420> natural<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
run all the way around those natural and

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.330 
run all the way around those natural and
then<00:01:22.350> he<00:01:22.439> brings<00:01:22.590> him<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.009> into<00:01:23.250> his

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
then he brings him all that into his

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.590 
then he brings him all that into his
natural<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> can<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.090> fly<00:01:24.360> into<00:01:24.479> his

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
natural there I can just fly into his

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.640 
natural there I can just fly into his
base<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.930> kill<00:01:25.049> his<00:01:25.170> drone

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
base and kill his drone

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
base and kill his drone
which<00:01:26.160> is<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> main<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.120> one<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
which is the main which is one of the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.570 
which is the main which is one of the
main<00:01:27.510> reasons<00:01:27.810> why<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.230> don't<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.800> do<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
main reasons why you see don't I do that

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.120 
main reasons why you see don't I do that
and<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.150> won't<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.300> taking<00:01:30.600> effective

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
and they just won't be taking effective

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.920 
and they just won't be taking effective
so<00:01:32.130> as<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> can<00:01:32.490> see<00:01:32.580> I<00:01:32.640> fly<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:33.030> him<00:01:33.120> hit<00:01:33.750> H

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so as you can see I fly at him hit H

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.410 
so as you can see I fly at him hit H
shoot<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:34.830> fly<00:01:35.010> away<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.820> that's

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
shoot and then fly away and that's

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.180 
shoot and then fly away and that's
pretty<00:01:36.600> much<00:01:36.720> how<00:01:36.870> you<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.440> that<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.920> then

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
pretty much how you do that and then

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.260 
pretty much how you do that and then
there's<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.400> few<00:01:38.520> other<00:01:38.610> times<00:01:38.730> like<00:01:38.910> if<00:01:39.090> you're

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
there's a few other times like if you're

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
there's a few other times like if you're
being<00:01:39.630> chased<00:01:39.780> by<00:01:39.960> skirts<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.410> want<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.590> use

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
being chased by skirts you want to use

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.740 
being chased by skirts you want to use
patrol<00:01:41.040> micro<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.940> you've<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.510> run<00:01:42.660> away

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
patrol micro so you've kind of run away

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.650 
patrol micro so you've kind of run away
from<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.520> hit<00:01:44.520> key<00:01:44.760> for<00:01:44.970> patrol<00:01:45.300> and

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
from and then you hit key for patrol and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.970 
from and then you hit key for patrol and
kind<00:01:45.870> of<00:01:45.930> click<00:01:46.140> behind<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.620> me<00:01:46.740> listen

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
kind of click behind your me listen

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.610 
kind of click behind your me listen
behind<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.370> church<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.480> you<00:01:49.440> just

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
behind this church and then you just

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.860 
behind this church and then you just
give<00:01:50.370> them<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.910> split<00:01:51.240> second<00:01:51.690> and<00:01:51.810> then

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
give them just a split second and then

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.050 
give them just a split second and then
you<00:01:52.020> click<00:01:52.290> back<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.890> 20<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.190> moods<00:01:53.370> again<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you click back in 20 of moods again and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.280 
you click back in 20 of moods again and
if<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.450> right<00:01:54.630> they'll<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.990> really

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
if you do it right they'll just really

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.830 
if you do it right they'll just really
turn<00:01:55.500> around<00:01:55.710> fire<00:01:55.950> quick<00:01:56.340> shot<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.970> kill<00:01:57.690> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
turn around fire quick shot and kill the

pilasters

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.220 
pilasters
but<00:01:59.430> that's<00:01:59.640> tricky<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.570> if<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.080> miss

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
but that's tricky to do and if you miss

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.450 
but that's tricky to do and if you miss
time<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.560> obviously<00:02:01.860> you're<00:02:01.980> gonna<00:02:02.070> take<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
time and obviously you're gonna take the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.250 
time and obviously you're gonna take the
full<00:02:02.610> damage<00:02:02.730> from<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.000> spirit<00:02:03.300> which<00:02:03.870> is<00:02:04.140> why

scourge you're good to use I mean at the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.670 
scourge you're good to use I mean at the

pro level you'll see them use patrol
Michael<00:02:07.950> pretty<00:02:08.190> effectively<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:08.910> it's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
Michael pretty effectively but it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.930 
Michael pretty effectively but it's
tough<00:02:09.929> to<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.230> consistently<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.490> not<00:02:11.580> get<00:02:11.760> hit

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
tough to do consistently and not get hit

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.130 
tough to do consistently and not get hit
especially<00:02:12.420> you've<00:02:12.540> got<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> lot<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:12.930> spare

especially you've got a lot of spare
chasing<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
chasing you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.710 
chasing you
although<00:02:14.850> obviously<00:02:15.180> having<00:02:15.390> more<00:02:15.540> needless

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
although obviously having more needless

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
although obviously having more needless
helps<00:02:16.110> there<00:02:16.230> because<00:02:16.500> you've<00:02:16.590> got<00:02:16.710> more

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740

you might be able to take out a few more

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.640 
you might be able to take out a few more
if<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:23.790> got<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.090> lemon

drones

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.340 
drones
so<00:02:45.970> I've<00:02:46.150> little<00:02:46.330> done<00:02:46.540> this<00:02:46.660> insider<00:02:47.050> list<00:02:47.260> so

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
so I've little done this insider list so

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.690 
so I've little done this insider list so
now<00:02:47.470> I'm<00:02:47.620> pretty<00:02:47.740> much<00:02:47.860> free<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.190> go<00:02:48.370> ahead<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
now I'm pretty much free to go ahead and

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.680 
now I'm pretty much free to go ahead and
just<00:02:48.790> start<00:02:48.940> decimating<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.510> drone<00:02:49.720> line<00:02:51.690> was

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
just start decimating the drone line was

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.790 
just start decimating the drone line was
attaching<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:53.020> pointer<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.320> more<00:02:53.530> hard<00:02:53.680> left

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
attaching a pointer to more hard left

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.020 
attaching a pointer to more hard left
got<00:02:53.950> one<00:02:54.070> at<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.250> time<00:02:54.400> obviously<00:02:54.640> isn't<00:02:54.910> gonna

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
got one at a time obviously isn't gonna

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.440 
got one at a time obviously isn't gonna
do<00:02:55.240> anything<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.600> folder<00:02:55.840> with<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.170> weapon

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
do anything to a folder with the weapon

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.470 
do anything to a folder with the weapon
so<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.870> recap<00:02:59.280> the<00:03:00.280> build<00:03:00.730> order<00:03:00.880> of<00:03:01.060> 12<00:03:01.270> hatch

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
so to recap the build order of 12 hatch

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.300 
so to recap the build order of 12 hatch
what<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.050> want<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.290> do<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.620> when<00:03:02.800> both<00:03:03.040> drums

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
what you want to do is when both drums

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.070 
what you want to do is when both drums
till<00:03:03.550> 9<00:03:03.730> when<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.000> get<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.240> nine<00:03:04.390> supply<00:03:04.780> build

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
till 9 when you get to nine supply build

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.640 
till 9 when you get to nine supply build
it<00:03:05.200> Overlord<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.920> then<00:03:07.260> then<00:03:08.260> keep<00:03:08.500> building

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
it Overlord and then then keep building

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.170 
it Overlord and then then keep building
drones<00:03:08.890> they<00:03:09.100> get<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.340> twelve<00:03:09.550> supply<00:03:09.850> and

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
drones they get to twelve supply and

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.820 
drones they get to twelve supply and
then<00:03:10.480> right<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.050> you<00:03:11.110> start<00:03:11.170> hatching<00:03:11.530> those

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
then right so you start hatching those

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.680 
then right so you start hatching those
drones<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.340> are<00:03:12.490> taking<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.209> twelve<00:03:13.420> supply

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
drones that are taking to twelve supply

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.780 
drones that are taking to twelve supply
send<00:03:14.350> out<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.470> drone<00:03:14.709> gear<00:03:14.890> natural<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.580> build

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
send out a drone gear natural and build

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.280 
send out a drone gear natural and build
a<00:03:15.850> hatchery<00:03:16.000> gear<00:03:16.330> natural<00:03:16.690> as<00:03:16.870> soon<00:03:17.110> as<00:03:17.200> you

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.320 
a hatchery gear natural as soon as you
have<00:03:17.380> triggered<00:03:17.709> minerals<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:19.000> then<00:03:19.180> from

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
have triggered minerals and then from

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.360 
have triggered minerals and then from
there<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.810> immediately<00:03:20.260> want<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.470> go<00:03:20.650> build

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
there you immediately want to go build

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.500 
there you immediately want to go build
any<00:03:21.490> more<00:03:21.550> drones<00:03:21.880> at<00:03:22.000> this<00:03:22.090> point<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.420> then

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
any more drones at this point and then

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.540 
any more drones at this point and then

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
before I want to go defend it but just

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.010 
before I want to go defend it but just
try<00:05:29.850> to<00:05:29.910> be<00:05:30.030> smart<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.450> try<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.690> find

try to be smart and try to find

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.290 
try to be smart and try to find
weaknesses<00:05:31.230> in<00:05:31.590> this<00:05:31.710> flaw<00:05:31.950> it<00:05:32.580> or<00:05:32.730> it<00:05:32.850> is<00:05:32.940> in

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
weaknesses in this flaw it or it is in

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.930 
weaknesses in this flaw it or it is in
this<00:05:33.480> game<00:05:33.630> plan<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:35.190> as<00:05:35.340> you<00:05:35.460> can<00:05:35.580> see<00:05:35.760> here

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
this game plan and as you can see here

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.280 
this game plan and as you can see here
this<00:05:36.090> is<00:05:36.150> an<00:05:36.300> example<00:05:36.540> of<00:05:36.690> weedless<00:05:37.050> against

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
this is an example of weedless against

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.410 
this is an example of weedless against
hydra<00:05:37.650> and<00:05:37.890> it's<00:05:38.670> just<00:05:38.850> why<00:05:38.970> you<00:05:39.030> don't<00:05:39.270> use

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
hydra and it's just why you don't use

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.560 
hydra and it's just why you don't use
fibrosis<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.650> Richard<00:05:41.400> because<00:05:42.210> they're<00:05:42.480> not

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
fibrosis and Richard because they're not

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.850 
fibrosis and Richard because they're not
very<00:05:42.630> effective<00:05:43.080> against<00:05:43.260> me<00:05:43.410> lists<00:05:43.710> and

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
very effective against me lists and

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.250 
very effective against me lists and
they're<00:05:44.430> way<00:05:44.730> too<00:05:44.760> slow

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.920 

so<00:05:49.890> yeah<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:51.000> start<00:05:51.030> using<00:05:51.540> this<00:05:51.690> built

so yeah you start using this built

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.470 
so yeah you start using this built
you're<00:05:52.110> gonna<00:05:52.200> notice<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.800> you're<00:05:53.160> gonna<00:05:53.280> do

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
viable option he has I mean this is

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.980 
viable option he has I mean this is
really<00:06:47.250> the<00:06:47.340> only<00:06:47.460> way<00:06:47.580> to<00:06:47.640> play<00:06:47.880> you<00:06:48.690> know<00:06:48.780> and

really the only way to play you know and
if<00:06:49.080> he<00:06:49.140> goes<00:06:49.260> for<00:06:49.320> hive<00:06:49.650> tech<00:06:49.890> well<00:06:50.160> he's<00:06:50.400> gonna

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
if he goes for hive tech well he's gonna

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.010
