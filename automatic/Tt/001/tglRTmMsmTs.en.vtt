PlayStation<00:00:21.940> 3<00:00:22.090> controller<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.800> is<00:00:23.860> the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
PlayStation 3 controller this is the

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.750 
PlayStation 3 controller this is the
real<00:00:24.220> one<00:00:24.690> that's<00:00:25.690> the<00:00:25.779> outside<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.260> it<00:00:26.760> this

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
real one that's the outside of it this

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.190 
real one that's the outside of it this
is<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:27.970> fate<00:00:28.150> board<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:31.810> can't<00:00:32.020> tell

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
is the fate board you can't tell

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.260 
is the fate board you can't tell
difference<00:00:32.619> unless<00:00:33.130> you<00:00:33.190> look<00:00:33.370> closely<00:00:33.640> I<00:00:36.270> can

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
difference unless you look closely I can

a<00:02:45.680> motherboard<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.550> was<00:02:46.640> like<00:02:47.350> so<00:02:48.350> stupid

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
a motherboard so I was like so stupid

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.910 
a motherboard so I was like so stupid
but<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:49.970> did<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> good<00:02:50.270> job<00:02:50.410> nobody<00:02:51.410> can<00:02:51.740> figure

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
but it did a good job nobody can figure

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.460 
but it did a good job nobody can figure
out<00:02:52.040> which<00:02:52.490> one<00:02:52.670> is<00:02:52.790> fake<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.120> real<00:02:53.270> by<00:02:54.080> just

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
out which one is fake it real by just

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.610 
out which one is fake it real by just
looking<00:02:54.740> at<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.020> touch<00:02:57.230> right<00:02:57.260> here

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
looking at it it's a touch right here

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.680 
looking at it it's a touch right here
but<00:02:57.770> that<00:02:58.010> doesn't<00:02:58.040> work<00:02:58.370> now<00:02:58.550> for<00:02:58.790> some

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
but that doesn't work now for some

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.450 
but that doesn't work now for some
reason<00:02:59.870> that's<00:03:00.410> why<00:03:00.620> I<00:03:00.650> hold<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.980> up<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.250> check

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
reason that's why I hold it up to check

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.290 
reason that's why I hold it up to check
it<00:03:01.640> while<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.120> wasn't<00:03:02.330> working

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
it while I wasn't working

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.150 
it while I wasn't working
look<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.570> says<00:03:05.720> connected<00:03:06.230> now<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.890> says<00:03:07.040> it

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
look it says connected now it says it

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.490 
look it says connected now it says it
connected<00:03:07.610> but<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.840> left<00:03:09.020> trigger<00:03:09.140> doesn't

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
connected but the left trigger doesn't

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.370 
connected but the left trigger doesn't
work<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.570> I'm<00:03:11.570> trying<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.840> make<00:03:11.960> the<00:03:12.080> best<00:03:12.230> out

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
work so I'm trying to make the best out

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.170 
work so I'm trying to make the best out
of<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.620> even<00:03:13.610> though<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.850> little<00:03:14.000> work

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
of this even though the little work

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.740 
of this even though the little work
that's<00:03:14.870> $60<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.590> lost<00:03:16.600> all<00:03:17.600> right<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.980> battery

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
that's $60 I lost all right the battery

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:29.080 
that's $60 I lost all right the battery
that's<00:03:20.750> one<00:03:20.930> pair<00:03:21.050> of<00:03:21.110> batteries<00:03:28.090> originals

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
that's one pair of batteries originals

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.560 
that's one pair of batteries originals
bigger<00:03:29.300> and<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:30.350> looks<00:03:30.620> all<00:03:31.490> concealed<00:03:31.940> and

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
bigger and it looks all concealed and

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.500 
bigger and it looks all concealed and
plastic<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.700> don't<00:03:34.700> know<00:03:34.820> what<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.240> heck<00:03:35.360> they

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
plastic I don't know what the heck they

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.820 
plastic I don't know what the heck they
did<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.840> this<00:03:37.030> motherboard<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:38.270> bool

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
did with this motherboard is bool

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:47.010 
did with this motherboard is bool
multiple<00:03:39.830> mrs.<00:03:40.190> green<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.830> vibrators<00:03:43.430> are

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.220 

basically<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.260> same<00:03:49.510> other<00:03:50.510> than<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:50.990> is

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
basically the same other than that is

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.850 
basically the same other than that is
the<00:03:51.560> brown<00:03:51.800> in<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.010> back<00:03:53.350> that's<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.410> hard

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
the brown in the back that's a hard

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.100 
the brown in the back that's a hard
plastic<00:03:55.070> compared<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.090> white<00:03:56.270> one<00:03:56.480> on<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
plastic compared to the white one on the

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.729 
plastic compared to the white one on the
ps3<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:01.280> that's<00:04:01.580> basically<00:04:02.030> it

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
ps3 so that's basically it

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.020 
ps3 so that's basically it
it's<00:04:03.739> nineteen<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.160> difference<00:04:04.520> between<00:04:04.820> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
it's nineteen of difference between a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.340 
it's nineteen of difference between a
fake<00:04:05.270> interval<00:04:06.140> one<00:04:06.350> I<00:04:06.880> got<00:04:07.880> gypped<00:04:08.060> off<00:04:08.350> don't

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
fake interval one I got gypped off don't

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.540 
fake interval one I got gypped off don't
let<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.530> happen<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.800> you<00:04:09.980> eBay<00:04:10.880> it's<00:04:11.660> not<00:04:11.810> good

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
let it happen to you eBay it's not good

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.570 
let it happen to you eBay it's not good
to<00:04:13.550> buying<00:04:13.790> stuff<00:04:14.300> that<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.750> don't<00:04:14.930> really

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
to buying stuff that you don't really

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.409 
to buying stuff that you don't really
know<00:04:16.580> what<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:16.850> is<00:04:17.500> if<00:04:18.500> it's<00:04:18.650> really<00:04:18.859> not

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
know what it is if it's really not

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.270 
know what it is if it's really not
little<00:04:20.419> bit<00:04:20.540> older<00:04:21.530> that<00:04:22.150> stop<00:04:23.150> fake<00:04:24.280> got

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
little bit older that stop fake got

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.110 
little bit older that stop fake got
stuck

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
stuck

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.580
