00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.040
 very good to all people I am a machine and 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.900
 welcome to a new guild video 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.400
 wars 2 and this time is to give you 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.700
 a little information about the state 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.080
 current game today May 20 is 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.540
 introduces a new patch that will 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.730
 serve as a transition for the new 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.439
 story that is going to be developed in 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.619
 guild wars 2 I do not know if you know but 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.930
 good the story that started from 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.790
 a beginning ended and each killing the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.290
 final boss the scarlett and well then 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.030
 Now let's say there is a small 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.610
 transition to start the new 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.800
 good story in the final arc fight 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.600
 of the lion that is the capital that brings together 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.700
 all races of tijd was already let's say 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.290
 devastated was destroyed and well then 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.690
 now it is in the process of 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.280
 recovery then because of it 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.560
 the festival of the four has returned 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.760
 winds with a lot of attractions by 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.440
 example that of the cliffs 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.870
 labyrinths that we have to use those 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.090
 aspects of movement also the sprint 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.650
 of the tabernacle and good some more also 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.150
 It has reopened the canopy crown 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.489
 what is this place in the city of 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.049
 humans in the boundaries of divinity is 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.299
 this circle where there are a lot of 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.680
 bosses there are like several not good biomes 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.540
 more videos I do not know if it would be the word 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.530
 adequate but good there are several areas and 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.700
 there are bosses then 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.770
 people have to agree 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.869
 in going to kill a boss and they are winning 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.760
 different rewards and also it 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.250
 open the queen's runner that is 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.049
 this place where we can beat us in 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.600
 duel one against one against the bosses 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.950
 let's say most important of the game and 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.659
 you are also going to find some changes 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.729
 as for the location of some n 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.110
 fish for example in lion's bow as 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.840
 the city is half destroyed 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.240
 many of the times we get used to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.799
 visit are relocated by the map so 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.399
 that nothing will have to look for them and know 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.399
 where are they 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.350
 they have also said that there are clues 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.360
 on the maps about then history 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.340
 next from guild wars 2 I the truth is 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.990
 that for now they have found nothing and the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.180
 only track that I have now that I 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.400
 I'm agreeing is at the end of the last 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.670
 video of the battle against scarlett 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.160
 a dragon came out at the end opening one eye 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.320
 that came in as the clue of what 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.820
 it could be the next story and good 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.860
 otherwise, there are some changes in 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.020
 traits there are also changes in terms of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.550
 fractals there is a pretty curious thing 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.200
 which says that the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.910
 probability of occurrence of boxes of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.739
 arms and armor extended in the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.510
 higher fractal levels that's 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.890
 one thing to keep in mind but good 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.310
 otherwise I have already told you it's a 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.800
 small performance that brings us then the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.320
 best and the best attractions that 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.970
 we have been able to play during the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.860
 history to the living world that is going to 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.630
 serve as a transition to the next 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.980
 living world story that I imagine 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.730
 It will not be long before the next 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.800
 patch 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.180
 I hope it adds and at least one 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.070
 introduction to what will be the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.300
 next story and nothing else I hope 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.190
 that you liked this little video 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.890
 over wash 2 for good so for the 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.200
 that you are not up to date 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.780
 the game so that you know a little in 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.130
 what moment are we and nothing else 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.360
 Greetings to all and see you in the 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.360
 next video see you later
