00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
over them fairly easily I think for a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.420 
over them fairly easily I think for a
metallic<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> they've<00:01:26.040> got<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.369> of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
metallic and they've got a lot of

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.190

pigment<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> color<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.049> they're

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
pigment a lot of color in them they're

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.990 
pigment a lot of color in them they're
really<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.890> nice<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.340> not<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> fan<00:01:29.970> of
