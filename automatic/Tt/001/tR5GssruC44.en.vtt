00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:06.654
Forehand Spin Net Shot

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:12.685
Hello, I am Lee thank you for coming

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:16.215
in this video I am going to demonstrate

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:21.918
how to make spin net shot, forehand spin net shot

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.011
there are several learning points

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:28.081
I will explain one by one

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:34.402
first of all, how to hold the grip

00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:38.548
depending on the type of grip 

00:00:38.548 --> 00:00:43.218
the shot, the quality of shot will be different

00:00:43.218 --> 00:00:48.849
the forehand slice net shot needs very sensitive feelings

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:51.100
in the finger

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.198
so the grip must be gentle and the racket should be hold 

00:00:57.198 --> 00:01:00.033
by the fingers, end of the finger areas

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:03.149
rather than this palm area

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.965
so have a look

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.183
number 1 point

00:01:09.183 --> 00:01:13.217
there should be little room here

00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:14.098
and

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:19.414
this second finger is better to be straight

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:22.316
rather than holding like that

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:26.650
and the thumb also better to be straighted

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.701
so thumb and second finger, hold together

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:37.016
so slicing, using this two fingers

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:44.629
and this 3 fingers hold the racket gently

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:46.935
like this

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:52.571
from in front

00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:53.237
there

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.988
and there

00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.726
this is right way

00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:12.193
of holding the racket when a player is doing the slice net shot

00:02:12.193 --> 00:02:13.428
and this is wrong way

00:02:15.415 --> 00:02:16.305
like this

00:02:18.525 --> 00:02:21.776
this is for the power shot

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.200
not very sensitive shot

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.551
this is right way

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.055
so more feelings at the end of fingers

00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:33.882
now

00:02:33.882 --> 00:02:38.299
how to spin the net shot

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.515
its better to make semi circle

00:02:41.515 --> 00:02:43.665
rather than flat movement

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:46.183
which I mean this

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:48.624
not like that, slice like this

00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:52.635
do semi circle, like this

00:02:52.635 --> 00:03:00.683
in this way of spin, that will be more effective

00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:01.785
please have a look

00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:30.003
like this

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:31.850
like that

00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:38.672
the important things here

00:03:38.672 --> 00:03:44.176
the player must take shuttle in front of their body

00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:44.991
which is here

00:03:46.515 --> 00:03:48.181
so they have room to slice it

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.151
if they hit it side of their body

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:56.681
which is here

00:03:56.681 --> 00:04:01.681
then its difficult to carry on slicing

00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:04.366
because shuttle is in front of the body

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:07.451
that is possible

00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.099
but side of the body

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.318
that is not possible

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:15.080
so when shuttle is little bit side here

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.799
then its better to move little bit wider

00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.020
so that action is posssible

00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:24.617
like that

00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:25.350
rather than

00:04:25.805 --> 00:04:26.818
go

00:04:26.818 --> 00:04:27.671
like this

00:04:28.624 --> 00:04:29.991
thats difficult

00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:31.698
ok wrong one with shuttle

00:04:31.698 --> 00:04:33.856
shuttle is there

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:34.587
not here

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:37.583
not there

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.417
this is not right way

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.844
this one should be hit by this position

00:04:49.844 --> 00:04:50.644
like this

00:04:57.624 --> 00:04:59.739
so there is more speed

00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:04.620
the third one

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.768
take shuttle as high as possible

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.085
that way

00:05:11.085 --> 00:05:15.955
more safe shot can be made, which is this

00:05:16.786 --> 00:05:17.434
higher

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.715
rather than

00:05:24.144 --> 00:05:24.811
here

00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:28.089
not here

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:32.214
should be here

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:44.462
and the posture should be same

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:49.979
the level of eyes, the level of impact should be similar

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.962
much better control will be made

00:05:53.962 --> 00:05:54.717
like this

00:05:57.447 --> 00:05:58.046
there

00:06:05.827 --> 00:06:06.526
rather than

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.231
here - here does not match

00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:25.278
for techniques like that, lots of repeat will be essential

00:06:25.278 --> 00:06:31.711
for practice, this kind of forehand net shot slice spin

00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:34.861
also backhand net shot

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:36.612
when you have spare time

00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:41.079
you can practice like this

00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:46.479
have one normal shuttle and then you can slice

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:51.629
forehand as well as backhand in any directions

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:55.527
in this way you will be able to develop it

00:06:55.527 --> 00:07:00.879
your eyes to hit the cock rather than the feather

00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:03.766
practice is like this

00:07:25.855 --> 00:07:28.556
I hope you enjoyed this video

00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:29.187
thank you
