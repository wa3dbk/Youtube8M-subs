00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.560 
like that basically this is just a kind
of<00:02:53.040> in-between<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.700> extends<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.150> gameplay<00:02:54.540> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
of in-between it extends the gameplay a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.270 
of in-between it extends the gameplay a
little<00:02:54.840> bit<00:02:54.990> keeps<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.560> from<00:02:55.680> being<00:02:55.830> too

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
little bit keeps it from being too

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.010 
little bit keeps it from being too
linear<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:56.940> always<00:02:57.300> about<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.780> combat

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
linear and always about you know combat

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.140 
linear and always about you know combat
but<00:02:58.770> really<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.490> is<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.730> only<00:02:59.850> stuff<00:03:00.060> you're

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
but really this is the only stuff you're

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.370 
but really this is the only stuff you're
gonna<00:03:00.209> do<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.600> overall<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.140> you're<00:03:01.290> gonna

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
gonna do in the overall so you're gonna

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.080 
gonna do in the overall so you're gonna
drive<00:03:01.620> from<00:03:01.860> place<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.070> place<00:03:02.220> hit<00:03:02.880> up<00:03:03.000> these

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
drive from place to place hit up these

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.490 
drive from place to place hit up these
missions<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.750> when<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.020> get<00:03:04.110> enough<00:03:04.230> cash

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
missions and when you get enough cash

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.540 
missions and when you get enough cash
you're<00:03:04.740> just<00:03:04.860> going<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.010> go<00:03:05.130> on<00:03:05.190> with<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.430> rest

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550
