ok let's talk about making your own head
pins<00:00:14.269> so<00:00:15.080> I'm<00:00:15.230> going<00:00:15.259> to<00:00:15.379> pick<00:00:15.559> up<00:00:15.679> where<00:00:15.889> I

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
pins so I'm going to pick up where I

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.690 
pins so I'm going to pick up where I
off<00:00:16.390> with<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:16.720> last<00:00:16.900> video<00:00:17.170> and<00:00:17.650> I'm<00:00:18.490> going<00:00:18.670> to

I'm<00:00:21.010> going<00:00:21.130> to<00:00:21.190> make<00:00:21.280> an<00:00:21.370> oversized<00:00:21.850> piece<00:00:22.150> so

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
I'm going to make an oversized piece so

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.370 
I'm going to make an oversized piece so
that<00:00:22.330> you<00:00:22.510> can<00:00:22.630> see<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:22.930> a<00:00:22.990> little<00:00:23.170> bit

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
that you can see this a little bit

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.859 
that you can see this a little bit
better<00:00:24.270> so<00:00:25.270> let<00:00:25.570> me<00:00:27.150> hold<00:00:28.150> this<00:00:28.450> out<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:28.720> little

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
better so let me hold this out a little

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.250 
better so let me hold this out a little
bit<00:00:29.200> and<00:00:30.689> okay<00:00:31.689> we're<00:00:31.900> going<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.080> make<00:00:32.140> the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
bit and okay we're going to make the

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.100 
bit and okay we're going to make the
cloverleaf<00:00:32.620> I<00:00:32.890> just<00:00:33.160> showed<00:00:33.340> you<00:00:33.370> how<00:00:33.580> to<00:00:33.610> make

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
cloverleaf I just showed you how to make

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.360 
cloverleaf I just showed you how to make
the<00:00:35.110> open-loop<00:00:35.620> really<00:00:36.580> really<00:00:36.850> simple<00:00:38.370> now

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
the open-loop really really simple now

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.260 
the open-loop really really simple now
this<00:00:39.850> clover<00:00:40.180> leaf<00:00:40.510> you<00:00:41.110> start<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:43.059> way<00:00:43.210> you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
this clover leaf you start the way you

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:50.810 
this clover leaf you start the way you
do<00:00:43.600> with<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.050> open<00:00:44.350> loop<00:00:44.730> okay<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.750> I'm<00:00:47.050> gonna

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.360 

okay<00:00:51.820> I'm<00:00:52.210> going<00:00:52.329> to<00:00:52.420> make<00:00:52.540> my<00:00:52.690> loop<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:54.190> i'm

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
okay I'm going to make my loop but i'm

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.650 
okay I'm going to make my loop but i'm
not<00:00:54.489> going<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.700> straighten<00:00:55.059> this<00:00:55.210> up<00:00:55.390> at<00:00:55.570> the

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
not going to straighten this up at the

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.770 
not going to straighten this up at the
end<00:00:55.840> here<00:00:56.140> ok<00:00:56.829> leave<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.460> way<00:00:57.489> it<00:00:57.579> is<00:00:57.780> then

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
end here ok leave it the way it is then

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.490 
end here ok leave it the way it is then
i'm<00:00:59.079> going<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.320> come<00:00:59.590> in<00:00:59.800> with<00:01:00.489> my<00:01:00.670> round

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
i'm going to come in with my round

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
i'm going to come in with my round
pliers<00:01:03.660> okay<00:01:04.950> you<00:01:05.950> see<00:01:06.130> that<00:01:06.310> at<00:01:06.460> this<00:01:06.610> point

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
pliers okay you see that at this point

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.139 
pliers okay you see that at this point
here's<00:01:07.990> my<00:01:08.080> loop<00:01:08.350> i<00:01:08.500> just<00:01:08.680> made<00:01:08.910> like<00:01:09.910> move<00:01:10.119> my

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
here's my loop i just made like move my

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.650 
here's my loop i just made like move my
pliers<00:01:10.570> over<00:01:11.130> okay<00:01:12.130> come<00:01:13.030> in<00:01:13.149> tight<00:01:13.420> right

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
pliers over okay come in tight right

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.639 
pliers over okay come in tight right
here<00:01:15.390> now<00:01:16.390> we're<00:01:16.810> going<00:01:16.899> to<00:01:16.960> make<00:01:17.110> it<00:01:17.259> figure

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
here now we're going to make it figure

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:26.270 
here now we're going to make it figure
eight<00:01:17.890> we're<00:01:18.700> going<00:01:18.789> to<00:01:18.850> loop<00:01:19.119> this<00:01:19.330> across<00:01:21.869> ok

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.380

now we have that and then i'm going to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.039 
now we have that and then i'm going to
put<00:01:31.689> my<00:01:31.720> pliers<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.409> right<00:01:32.619> here<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.750> then<00:01:34.960> I'm

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
put my pliers in right here and then I'm

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.899 
put my pliers in right here and then I'm
going<00:01:35.229> to<00:01:35.260> bend<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.680> wire<00:01:38.310> back<00:01:39.310> over<00:01:39.820> on

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
going to bend the wire back over on

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:51.500 
going to bend the wire back over on
itself<00:01:42.000> okay<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.500> where<00:01:44.710> we're<00:01:44.890> at<00:01:44.950> now

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
okay it's a little bit large so I need

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.130 
okay it's a little bit large so I need
to<00:01:55.260> bring<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.160> little<00:01:56.340> bit

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
to bring this in just a little bit

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:12.000 
to bring this in just a little bit
straighten<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.290> up

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010

ok<00:02:13.010> there's<00:02:13.400> my<00:02:13.520> little<00:02:14.480> clover<00:02:15.020> leaf<00:02:15.520> but

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
ok there's my little clover leaf but

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.250 
ok there's my little clover leaf but
we're<00:02:16.670> not<00:02:16.700> quite<00:02:17.030> done<00:02:19.420> next<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.170> little

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
we're not quite done next it's a little

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.559 
we're not quite done next it's a little
bit<00:02:21.410> miss<00:02:21.620> shapen<00:02:22.150> we're<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.330> flatten

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
bit miss shapen we're going to flatten

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.870 
bit miss shapen we're going to flatten
it<00:02:23.750> out<00:02:23.840> a<00:02:23.900> little<00:02:24.050> bit<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:25.340> other<00:02:25.490> thing<00:02:25.730> this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
it out a little bit the other thing this

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.380 
it out a little bit the other thing this
wires<00:02:27.459> needs<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.520> be<00:02:28.640> hardened<00:02:28.970> up<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.180> little

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
wires needs to be hardened up a little

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.760 
wires needs to be hardened up a little
bit<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.690> have<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> hard<00:02:33.170> surface<00:02:33.440> of

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
bit so if you have a hard surface of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.250 
bit so if you have a hard surface of
some<00:02:33.980> sort<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:35.000> isn't<00:02:35.870> going<00:02:35.989> two<00:02:36.050> morrow

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
some sort that isn't going two morrow

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.020 
some sort that isn't going two morrow
your<00:02:36.440> metal<00:02:36.800> I'm<00:02:37.250> going<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.520> use<00:02:37.640> my<00:02:37.670> little

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
your metal I'm going to use my little

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.720 
your metal I'm going to use my little
anvil<00:02:38.420> here<00:02:38.690> but<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:40.160> know<00:02:40.250> anything<00:02:40.610> would

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
anvil here but you know anything would

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.270 
anvil here but you know anything would
work<00:02:40.940> piece<00:02:41.270> of<00:02:41.480> heavy<00:02:42.050> aluminum<00:02:42.470> stainless

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
work piece of heavy aluminum stainless

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.620 
work piece of heavy aluminum stainless
steel<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:48.380> could<00:02:48.560> go<00:02:49.190> out<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.610> use<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> brick

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
steel you could go out and use a brick

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.900 
steel you could go out and use a brick
and<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:51.050> put<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> maybe<00:02:51.830> a<00:02:51.920> strip<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.730> leather

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
and just put a maybe a strip of leather

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.820 
and just put a maybe a strip of leather
down<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.630> then<00:02:53.900> place<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.320> on<00:02:54.500> top<00:02:54.650> of<00:02:54.709> the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
down and then place this on top of the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.410 
down and then place this on top of the
leather<00:02:55.070> and<00:02:55.310> have<00:02:55.580> the<00:02:55.700> brick<00:02:55.880> underneath<00:02:56.150> it

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
leather and have the brick underneath it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.990 
leather and have the brick underneath it
something<00:02:56.660> like<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.900> would<00:02:56.989> work<00:02:57.170> fine<00:02:57.380> then

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
something like that would work fine then

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.670 
something like that would work fine then
what's<00:02:59.000> really<00:02:59.390> nice<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.930> take<00:03:00.260> another

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
what's really nice is to take another

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.520 
what's really nice is to take another
piece<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.160> leather<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.060> place<00:03:02.630> on<00:03:02.840> top<00:03:03.110> and

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
piece of leather and place on top and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.059 
piece of leather and place on top and
then<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:05.720> just<00:03:05.870> go<00:03:06.080> in<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.560> pound<00:03:06.769> this

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
then you just go in and you pound this

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.920 
then you just go in and you pound this
and<00:03:07.900> I'm<00:03:08.900> not<00:03:09.890> putting<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.580> lot<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.420> pressure<00:03:11.750> on

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
and I'm not putting a lot of pressure on

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.009 
and I'm not putting a lot of pressure on
this<00:03:12.050> metal<00:03:12.650> but<00:03:13.550> it's<00:03:13.580> just<00:03:13.970> enough<00:03:14.360> that<00:03:14.870> it

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
this metal but it's just enough that it

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.160 
this metal but it's just enough that it
will<00:03:15.200> harden<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.910> make<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.329> stiffer<00:03:18.100> ok<00:03:20.170> this

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
will harden and make it stiffer ok this

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.300 
will harden and make it stiffer ok this
is<00:03:21.410> much<00:03:21.620> stiffer<00:03:21.950> here<00:03:22.610> than<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.060> is<00:03:23.209> here

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
is much stiffer here than it is here

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.319 
is much stiffer here than it is here
because<00:03:26.709> I've<00:03:27.709> hardened<00:03:28.160> it<00:03:28.280> up<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.090> little

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
because I've hardened it up up a little

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.860 
because I've hardened it up up a little
bit<00:03:31.510> ok<00:03:32.510> so<00:03:33.230> that's<00:03:33.410> always<00:03:33.590> helpful<00:03:34.870> that's

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
bit ok so that's always helpful that's

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.690 
bit ok so that's always helpful that's
how<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.049> make<00:03:36.260> that<00:03:36.530> one<00:03:36.739> now<00:03:42.130> this<00:03:43.130> is<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:43.370> a

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
how you make that one now this is just a

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.890 
how you make that one now this is just a
continuation<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:49.760> single<00:03:50.209> first<00:03:50.630> loop

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
continuation of the single first loop

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.479 
continuation of the single first loop
that<00:03:51.079> we<00:03:51.230> did<00:03:51.410> so<00:03:51.769> let<00:03:51.890> me<00:03:51.980> show<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:52.160> how<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.370> do

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
that we did so let me show you how to do

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.210 
that we did so let me show you how to do
that

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.630 

i'm<00:03:58.180> going<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.390> use<00:03:58.480> your<00:03:58.600> round<00:03:58.750> nose<00:03:58.870> pliers

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.090 

and<00:04:07.080> come<00:04:08.080> in<00:04:08.230> here<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.770> you're<00:04:08.920> going<00:04:09.040> to

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
and come in here and you're going to

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.070 
and come in here and you're going to
make<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.550> small<00:04:09.970> loop<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:13.000> then<00:04:13.780> you're<00:04:13.990> going

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
make a small loop and then you're going

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:22.290 
make a small loop and then you're going
to<00:04:14.140> continue<00:04:14.320> around<00:04:20.070> don't<00:04:21.070> have<00:04:21.280> that<00:04:21.519> quite

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
to continue around don't have that quite

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:30.080 
to continue around don't have that quite
right<00:04:22.330> yet

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:58.059
