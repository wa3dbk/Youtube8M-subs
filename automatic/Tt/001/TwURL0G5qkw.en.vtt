00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.179 
big fan of playing the music box to move
spring-trap<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.829> he<00:02:33.890> goes<00:02:34.010> in<00:02:34.099> the

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
spring-trap and he goes in the

spring-trap and he goes in the
ventilation<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:35.299> was<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.480> good<00:02:35.659> game<00:02:35.870> and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930

everything but number one triumphs over

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.160 
everything but number one triumphs over
it<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:37.939> three<00:02:38.209> would<00:02:38.359> be<00:02:38.390> my<00:02:38.599> second<00:02:39.019> and

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
