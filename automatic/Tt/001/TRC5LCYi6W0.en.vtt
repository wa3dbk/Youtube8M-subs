00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
word ice lateral before isolates all
that<00:00:33.060> means<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.630> there<00:00:33.810> is<00:00:33.930> 2<00:00:34.560> loading

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

this sort of action this sort of action
is<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.780> sort<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.110> action<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.590> used<00:00:46.770> to

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
is the sort of action that we used to

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.920 
is the sort of action that we used to
try<00:00:47.040> and<00:00:47.070> pull<00:00:47.370> ourselves<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:48.000> onto<00:00:48.900> a

situation trying to pull somebody down

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.100 
situation trying to pull somebody down
towards<00:00:54.420> us<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.610> isolate<00:00:57.090> roll<00:00:57.270> action<00:00:57.630> helps

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
towards us the isolate roll action helps

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.780 
towards us the isolate roll action helps
us<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.740> to<00:00:58.950> another<00:00:59.010> level<00:00:59.280> because

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
us to take this to another level because

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.240 
us to take this to another level because
we<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.060> use<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.240> single<00:01:00.750> hand<00:01:00.960> action<00:01:01.230> by<00:01:01.890> using

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
we can use a single hand action by using

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
we can use a single hand action by using
a<00:01:02.310> single<00:01:02.670> hand<00:01:02.910> action<00:01:03.150> what<00:01:03.510> happens<00:01:03.900> is<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
a single hand action what happens is it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.499 
a single hand action what happens is it
then<00:01:04.890> starts<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.610> us<00:01:05.790> do<00:01:05.970> more<00:01:06.210> work

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
then starts to make us do more work

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.630 
then starts to make us do more work
through<00:01:06.899> the<00:01:06.990> muscles<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.799> stabilize<00:01:08.009> our

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
through the muscles that stabilize our

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.990 
through the muscles that stabilize our
spine<00:01:08.969> laterally<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.200> also<00:01:10.409> gives<00:01:10.770> us

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
spine laterally it also gives us

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
spine laterally it also gives us
rotational<00:01:12.000> force<00:01:12.299> in<00:01:12.539> pulling<00:01:12.810> movements<00:01:13.409> as

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
rotational force in pulling movements as

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.940 
rotational force in pulling movements as
well<00:01:15.049> let's<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.229> about<00:01:16.380> how<00:01:16.740> we're<00:01:16.920> going

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
well let's think about how we're going

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800 
well let's think about how we're going
to<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.310> ourselves<00:01:17.759> up<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.179> get<00:01:18.390> ourselves

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
to see ourselves up and get ourselves

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.739 
to see ourselves up and get ourselves
going<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.609> I<00:01:20.609> mentioned<00:01:20.969> before<00:01:21.270> there's<00:01:21.539> two

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
going as I mentioned before there's two

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.719 
going as I mentioned before there's two
voting<00:01:22.020> points<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.679> you<00:01:22.710> see<00:01:23.039> I've<00:01:23.249> got<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
voting points so you see I've got a

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.459 
voting points so you see I've got a
weight<00:01:23.999> plate<00:01:24.179> already<00:01:24.479> loaded<00:01:24.899> on<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.200> side

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
weight plate already loaded on this side

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.279 
weight plate already loaded on this side
and<00:01:25.710> there<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.460> second<00:01:26.880> side<00:01:27.259> make<00:01:28.259> sure

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
and there is the second side make sure

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.779 
and there is the second side make sure
that<00:01:28.679> you've<00:01:28.799> got<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> same<00:01:29.219> weight<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.609> each

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
that you've got the same weight on each

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:31.899 
that you've got the same weight on each
side<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.840> desire

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
side if this is what you desire

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.090 
side if this is what you desire
now<00:01:32.909> seat<00:01:33.270> height<00:01:33.560> position<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.679> seat<00:01:34.920> height

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
now seat height position the seat height

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.249 
now seat height position the seat height
such<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.819> as<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.090> pull<00:01:36.329> through<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.020> elbow

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
such that as you pull through the elbow

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.959 
such that as you pull through the elbow
passes<00:01:37.770> through<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.069> part<00:01:38.399> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.609> line<00:01:38.789> of

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
passes through this part of the line of

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.239 
passes through this part of the line of
the<00:01:39.060> body<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:40.259> hand<00:01:40.469> comes<00:01:40.710> down<00:01:40.799> just

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
the body and the hand comes down just

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:42.739 
the body and the hand comes down just
around<00:01:41.549> front<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.969> shoulder<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.420> slightly

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
around front of shoulder or slightly

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.429 
around front of shoulder or slightly
below<00:01:43.999> so<00:01:44.999> I<00:01:45.030> adjust<00:01:45.359> my<00:01:45.450> seat<00:01:45.719> into<00:01:46.020> position

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
below so I adjust my seat into position

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.279 
below so I adjust my seat into position
by<00:01:46.560> lifting<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.039> and<00:01:47.810> then<00:01:48.810> dropping<00:01:49.079> it

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:49.289 
by lifting it up and then dropping it

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.219 
by lifting it up and then dropping it
back<00:01:50.210> make<00:01:51.210> sure<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:51.689> knee<00:01:51.840> pad<00:01:52.079> is

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
back make sure that the knee pad is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.590 
back make sure that the knee pad is
slightly<00:01:52.499> elevated<00:01:52.819> we<00:01:53.819> take<00:01:54.090> hold<00:01:54.359> of<00:01:54.479> the

machine<00:03:55.680> you'll<00:03:56.680> see<00:03:56.919> people<00:03:57.159> and<00:03:57.549> they'll

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
machine you'll see people and they'll

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.849

pull<00:04:00.129> through<00:04:00.459> with<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.699> biceps<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.479> the

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
pull through with the biceps and the

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.330 
pull through with the biceps and the
shoulders<00:04:01.959> will<00:04:02.079> stay<00:04:02.260> up<00:04:02.409> around<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.829> ears

shoulders will stay up around the ears
for<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.150> reason<00:04:04.689> we<00:04:05.079> say<00:04:05.109> to<00:04:05.379> take<00:04:05.620> the

for this reason we say to take the

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.229 
for this reason we say to take the
shoulders<00:04:06.040> down<00:04:06.159> out<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.549> the<00:04:06.609> ears<00:04:06.819> as<00:04:07.120> the

shoulders down out of the ears as the

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.789 
shoulders down out of the ears as the
elbows<00:04:07.540> pull<00:04:07.810> through<00:04:08.079> to<00:04:08.199> the<00:04:08.319> side<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.680> the
