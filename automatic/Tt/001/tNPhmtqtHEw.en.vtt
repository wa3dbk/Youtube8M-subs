00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.420 
you could think of even alcohol wine and
spirits<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:46.960> these<00:04:47.740> merchants<00:04:48.550> and<00:04:48.960> companies

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
spirits so these merchants and companies

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.730 
spirits so these merchants and companies
minted<00:04:51.430> and<00:04:51.669> produce<00:04:52.030> their<00:04:52.330> own<00:04:52.360> tokens<00:04:52.990> for

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
minted and produce their own tokens for

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.210 
minted and produce their own tokens for
services<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.750> army<00:04:56.349> did<00:04:56.530> something<00:04:56.949> as

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
services and the army did something as

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.580 
services and the army did something as
well<00:04:57.550> that<00:04:58.060> was<00:04:58.240> similar<00:04:58.509> actually<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.440> Armed

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
well that was similar actually the Armed

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.860 
well that was similar actually the Armed
Forces<00:04:59.940> they<00:05:00.940> did<00:05:01.180> something<00:05:01.419> called<00:05:01.690> a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
Forces they did something called a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.279 
Forces they did something called a
sutler<00:05:02.139> token<00:05:02.740> which<00:05:03.220> pretty<00:05:04.030> much<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.539> sutler

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289 
sutler token which pretty much a sutler

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.210 
sutler token which pretty much a sutler
token<00:05:05.860> it<00:05:06.130> was<00:05:06.460> given<00:05:06.849> to<00:05:07.120> soldiers<00:05:08.039> to<00:05:09.039> be

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
token it was given to soldiers to be

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.730 
token it was given to soldiers to be
spent<00:05:09.550> at<00:05:09.789> various<00:05:10.570> merchants<00:05:11.229> goods<00:05:11.560> and

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
spent at various merchants goods and

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.770 
spent at various merchants goods and
services<00:05:12.250> so<00:05:12.849> those<00:05:13.270> are<00:05:13.509> the<00:05:13.630> two

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
services so those are the two

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.960 
services so those are the two
differences<00:05:14.199> and<00:05:14.650> another<00:05:15.520> one<00:05:15.699> is<00:05:15.940> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
differences and another one is the

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.050 
differences and another one is the
counter<00:05:16.509> stamp<00:05:16.810> like<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.229> see<00:05:17.409> before<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:18.060> so

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
counter stamp like you see before you so

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.560 
counter stamp like you see before you so
what<00:05:19.720> do<00:05:19.870> these<00:05:20.080> typically<00:05:20.710> go<00:05:21.009> for<00:05:21.310> well<00:05:22.060> the

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
what do these typically go for well the

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.899 
what do these typically go for well the
Devon's<00:05:23.020> in<00:05:23.139> Bolton<00:05:23.590> was<00:05:23.860> a<00:05:23.889> very<00:05:24.460> common

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
Devon's in Bolton was a very common

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.180 
Devon's in Bolton was a very common
counter<00:05:25.599> stamp<00:05:25.930> but<00:05:26.169> they<00:05:26.319> still<00:05:26.710> command

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
counter stamp but they still command

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.270 
counter stamp but they still command
quite<00:05:27.460> a<00:05:27.490> bit<00:05:27.699> of<00:05:27.789> money<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:28.180> paid<00:05:29.139> $18<00:05:29.889> for<00:05:30.159> the

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
quite a bit of money I paid $18 for the

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.100 
quite a bit of money I paid $18 for the
example<00:05:30.789> that<00:05:30.820> you<00:05:31.090> see<00:05:31.330> right<00:05:31.539> before<00:05:31.960> you

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
example that you see right before you

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.200 
example that you see right before you
but<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.650> know<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:33.190> worth<00:05:33.460> several<00:05:34.090> hundred

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
but I know it's worth several hundred

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.189 
but I know it's worth several hundred
dollars<00:05:34.840> because<00:05:35.110> it's<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.620> only<00:05:36.150> 1855

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199

actually<00:05:47.139> has<00:05:47.349> an<00:05:47.590> example<00:05:48.039> much<00:05:48.250> like<00:05:48.520> this

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
actually has an example much like this

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.480 
actually has an example much like this
only<00:05:49.000> it's<00:05:49.270> the<00:05:49.650> 1857<00:05:50.650> that<00:05:50.830> they<00:05:50.979> have<00:05:51.190> in<00:05:51.400> the

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
idea the rarity you know I knew exactly

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.060 
idea the rarity you know I knew exactly
what<00:05:57.250> it<00:05:57.340> was<00:05:57.490> because<00:05:57.789> I've<00:05:58.060> seen<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.509> Bolton

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
what it was because I've seen the Bolton

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.730 
what it was because I've seen the Bolton
stamps<00:06:00.070> before<00:06:00.250> on<00:06:00.729> like<00:06:01.180> us<00:06:01.539> large<00:06:01.900> cents<00:06:02.320> and

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
stamps before on like us large cents and

you know the Bank of Canada tokens and

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.290 
you know the Bank of Canada tokens and
they're<00:06:06.190> a<00:06:06.219> little<00:06:06.370> bit<00:06:06.550> more<00:06:06.699> common<00:06:07.000> but

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300 
they're a little bit more common but

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.930 
they're a little bit more common but
they<00:06:07.479> still<00:06:07.780> command<00:06:08.320> some<00:06:08.500> money<00:06:08.759> so<00:06:09.759> when

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
they still command some money so when

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.670 
they still command some money so when
you're<00:06:10.090> out<00:06:10.120> there<00:06:10.509> searching<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.259> sifting

you're out there searching and sifting

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.709 
you're out there searching and sifting
through<00:06:11.710> like<00:06:12.250> for<00:06:12.580> example<00:06:12.669> foreign<00:06:13.330> coins

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
through like for example foreign coins

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.480 
through like for example foreign coins
you<00:06:14.349> know<00:06:14.469> generally<00:06:14.919> there's<00:06:15.159> gonna<00:06:15.310> be<00:06:15.460> a

you know generally there's gonna be a
you<00:06:15.880> know<00:06:15.909> a<00:06:16.030> box<00:06:16.330> or<00:06:16.750> a<00:06:16.810> bin<00:06:17.259> with<00:06:18.039> these<00:06:18.250> coins

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
you know a box or a bin with these coins

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.850 
you know a box or a bin with these coins
in<00:06:18.849> there<00:06:19.060> I<00:06:19.240> would<00:06:19.599> highly<00:06:20.050> encourage<00:06:20.080> you<00:06:20.560> to

in there I would highly encourage you to

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.100 
in there I would highly encourage you to
thumb<00:06:21.490> through<00:06:21.520> them<00:06:21.969> look<00:06:22.599> through<00:06:22.630> them<00:06:22.990> to

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
thumb through them look through them to

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.189 
thumb through them look through them to
see<00:06:23.320> anything<00:06:23.680> with<00:06:23.830> a<00:06:23.979> counter<00:06:24.610> stamp<00:06:25.199> some

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 
see anything with a counter stamp some

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:28.140 
see anything with a counter stamp some
of<00:06:26.320> them<00:06:26.440> might<00:06:26.680> be<00:06:26.710> a<00:06:26.889> modern<00:06:27.370> type<00:06:27.699> of<00:06:27.880> stamp

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
of them might be a modern type of stamp

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.800 
of them might be a modern type of stamp
some<00:06:28.840> of<00:06:28.990> them<00:06:29.080> might<00:06:29.259> be<00:06:29.289> during<00:06:29.770> the<00:06:29.889> period

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
some of them might be during the period

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.969 
some of them might be during the period
that's<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:32.080> make<00:06:32.229> all<00:06:32.380> the<00:06:32.500> difference<00:06:32.860> in

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:32.979 
that's that make all the difference in
