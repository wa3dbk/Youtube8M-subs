especially and download download is a

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.620 
especially and download download is a
pain<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.690> it's<00:03:36.900> very<00:03:37.230> annoying<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:38.630> against

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
you just you know most people running

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.130 
you just you know most people running
the<00:03:55.620> specs<00:03:56.010> set<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.610> very<00:03:56.910> powerful<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:57.930> now

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
the specs set it's very powerful but now

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.750 
the specs set it's very powerful but now
you<00:03:58.200> got<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.650> consider<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.190> having<00:03:59.520> mega

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
you got to consider it having mega

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.060 
you got to consider it having mega
Latios<00:04:00.300> and<00:04:00.330> if<00:04:01.200> it's<00:04:01.410> really<00:04:01.650> gonna<00:04:01.890> have

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
Latios and if it's really gonna have

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.860 
Latios and if it's really gonna have
adaptability<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.060> an<00:04:03.239> increase<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.750> its

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
adaptability and an increase in its

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.140 
adaptability and an increase in its
stats<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.950> could<00:04:05.190> be<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> very<00:04:05.700> big<00:04:05.910> problem

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
stats that could be a very big problem

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.150 
stats that could be a very big problem
and<00:04:06.600> I'm<00:04:06.690> gonna<00:04:06.870> expect<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:07.650> go<00:04:07.800> Uber's

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
and I'm gonna expect it to go Uber's

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.790 
and I'm gonna expect it to go Uber's
which<00:04:08.400> is<00:04:08.550> why<00:04:08.700> it's<00:04:08.940> not<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.420> top<00:04:09.720> top<00:04:10.650> of

my threats because I don't expect it to

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.840 
my threats because I don't expect it to
be<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.720> game<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.080> long<00:04:13.850> considering

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
be in the game that long considering

be in the game that long considering
male<00:04:15.000> Latios<00:04:15.660> make<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.169> light<00:04:16.500> yes<00:04:16.739> it's<00:04:16.950> gonna

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
male Latios make a light yes it's gonna

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.050 
male Latios make a light yes it's gonna
be<00:04:17.310> even<00:04:17.669> more<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.330> problem<00:04:18.630> with<00:04:19.080> running

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
be even more of a problem with running

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.880 
be even more of a problem with running
multi<00:04:21.060> scale<00:04:21.330> and<00:04:21.660> having<00:04:22.049> dragon<00:04:22.560> ferry

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
go for a single dragon move against it

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.920 
go for a single dragon move against it
like<00:04:25.710> seriously<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.390> only<00:04:27.630> super

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
to see so yeah my biggest threat that

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.490 
to see so yeah my biggest threat that
will<00:05:00.090> be<00:05:00.180> coming<00:05:00.390> in<00:05:00.570> from<00:05:00.810> pokey<00:05:01.110> Bank<00:05:01.290> though

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
will be coming in from pokey Bank though

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.850 
will be coming in from pokey Bank though
is<00:05:01.770> he<00:05:02.520> trained<00:05:02.850> he<00:05:03.270> trained<00:05:03.600> is<00:05:03.810> needed<00:05:04.320> a<00:05:04.500> lot

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
is he trained he trained is needed a lot

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.680 
is he trained he trained is needed a lot
right<00:05:05.100> now<00:05:05.130> because<00:05:05.760> hal<00:05:06.210> flame<00:05:06.510> is

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
right now because hal flame is

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.320 
right now because hal flame is
absolutely<00:05:07.410> destroying<00:05:07.860> everything<00:05:08.640> in<00:05:09.030> its

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
absolutely destroying everything in its

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.330 
absolutely destroying everything in its
path<00:05:09.480> pretty<00:05:10.170> much<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.650> if<00:05:11.040> you're<00:05:11.190> not

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
path pretty much and if you're not

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.770 
path pretty much and if you're not
running<00:05:11.520> rocks<00:05:11.910> then<00:05:12.240> you're<00:05:12.420> gonna<00:05:12.570> have<00:05:12.750> a

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
running rocks then you're gonna have a

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.480 
running rocks then you're gonna have a
problem<00:05:13.260> but<00:05:13.470> with<00:05:13.590> he<00:05:13.710> train<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.070> can<00:05:14.100> run

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
problem but with he train you can run

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.490 
problem but with he train you can run
