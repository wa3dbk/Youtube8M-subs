00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.370
 Y 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:51.510
 coches.net we are going to give us a return in 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.510
 this period 508 efe xh hybrid please 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.570
 we started 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.590
 'we are notary 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.799
 we have automatic since then the list 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.979
 outside 4 meters and 82 centimeters from 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.110
 period 508 rx h 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.979
 for all this that comes to say then 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.770
 well, what about the family saloon 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.960
 or ranchera type that has but in 508 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.880
 recently renovated and I 've seen them 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.280
 headlights that have left them fantastic the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.020
 super aggressive front they have 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.549
 put the hair hybridization system 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.640
 improved with respect to the one we saw makes 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.069
 a few years in the 3008 and well then these 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.350
 200 horses of this unit come 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.500
 of the 163 horses of the diesel engine of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.500
 two liters and 37 of an electrical system 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.340
 with its own batteries clear is that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.490
 comes to push or propel the shaft 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.409
 rear as the combustion engine what 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.959
 what it does is propel or move the axis 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.190
 forward with that but get it to be 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.750
 a 4wd as they say a car with 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.580
 four-wheel drive always and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.040
 when the electric motor has a battery 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.530
 as you see right now we have here three 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.990
 hairline 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.690
 have enough battery charge for 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.970
 move the rear axle this how it 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.240
 So get the mother of all 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.720
 battles as they say colloquially 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.640
 comes with this with this roulette in which 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.950
 you can choose if you are auto mode let's move 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.600
 now that the car the computer of a 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.400
 board is the one that chooses all mode 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.840
 electric that would be doing so with 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.459
 four-wheel drive that 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.590
 would force the rear axle to work 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.390
 then the battery would move that axis 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.850
 back and the mode is because good then 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.950
 here the most mode in all 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.050
 more sporting features of this 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.489
 I can also tell you 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.959
 good in these four meters 82 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.750
 centimeters but has done a job 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.850
 excellent especially at the level of space 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.350
 because if we look back the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.030
 rear seats I can assure you that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.470
 they are authentically of ministers that is 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.209
 an awful thing how comfortable it is to leave 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.400
 back we have done the test with three 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.290
 adults and I can assure you that fair 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.880
 as there is no such thing as there is room for 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.100
 the feet in the central square 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.870
 the three people can go phenomenal 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.489
 this is a vehicle but it shows that 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.530
 who has treated him with special affection 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.270
 and with special care because then good 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.820
 Well, because we see what 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:30.260
 is equipped to the bars and almost 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.680
 everything is standard this small 508 rx h 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.630
 bradford comes standard series cost 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.090
 40 thousand 500 euros and comes standard with 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.710
 elements like this panoramic roof that 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.990
 honestly, the more sitting back is 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.120
 a joy because it seems that it will be in 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.650
 a in a cinema of these three that what 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.840
 you see absolutely everyone already you are 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.660
 living the trip is fantastic 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.580
 problems as you have seen inside the 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.100
 level of finishes is excellent I can 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.840
 ensure that it's almost premium has 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.660
 many own characteristics like this 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.920
 7 inch touch screen 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.600
 in which you can go seeing good 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.360
 from the consumptions that you have been making 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.460
 lately until good but it is that 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.890
 we have done 1500 kilometers already with one 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.540
 average of 6.2 the consumption is quite 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.190
 pretty well accomplished especially of 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.230
 city depends on where you move 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.270
 it depends on the path you can do 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.250
 4.5 or you can make a 7 liters 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.959
 depends on good because the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.850
 autonomy that you have in the load 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.340
 etcetera etcetera one thing i want 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.840
 what you see is the perfect graphic that 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.190
 we have in which you can always see 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.140
 if it is the combustion engine that is going 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.460
 feeding the batteries if it is the 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.710
 battery that is feeding the shaft 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.740
 hind end in a thing that is super 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.720
 well done more things that we can you 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.830
 count then good at those 40 thousand 500 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.580
 euros we have already told you that they have 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.460
 right to this to this hybridization that 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.840
 well, it's associated with a 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.510
 equipment that we have also commented 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.100
 what is the bomb and obviously the 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.230
 comparisons are odious and you always go 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.930
 to have the doubt of whether he deserves an audi a4 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.210
 avant or if a series 3 touring in 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.390
 any case this little 508 is a 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.040
 great buying option perhaps the only 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.730
 The biggest drawback that you have is the 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.169
 400 liters of luggage compartment hybrid mode 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:12.290
 the truth is that you eat it quite 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.850
 enough space and always what you can 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.430
 to do is the one that you do not like the roof that 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:22.840
 you want more more more 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:24.490
 more let's say and go more discreetly and such 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.760
 Well, here is a button 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.540
 fantastic is it that you turn it on and then 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.820
 You will see how automatically 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.550
 you do not have to endure the rigor of rigor 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.960
 summer and heat with the roof 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.570
 discovered here you have all the 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.550
 privacy of the world and you have a 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.630
 atmosphere then well much more 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.630
 quiet and much more discreet 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.940
 the change of gea has improved a lot 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.500
 still has some things to improve 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.270
 but the truth is that we liked it 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.479
 quite and as you see has a manual mode 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.919
 that would be this then through the 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.389
 cams that we have here that are very 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.490
 large very narrow 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.620
 you can handle everything and the truth is that 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.240
 it comes pretty well as you see 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.530
 the steering wheel has an exquisite touch 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.270
 closed down has all the 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.490
 buttons that you have to have in order is a 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.350
 car that we liked a lot is very 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.940
 well equipped and that's good 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.919
 you want to know even more things you know 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.060
 on portal coches.net website or 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.919
 reference to engine mode you're going to have 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.599
 absolutely all the details in the 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.220
 written analysis that we do so 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.810
 as always I say thank you for being 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.050
 there and see you in the next soon 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.050
 bye
