this<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.579> already<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.299> battlefield<00:01:39.780> 3

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
this is kind of already in battlefield 3

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.289 
this is kind of already in battlefield 3
ever<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.500> slightly<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.430> ways<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.150> I'm

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
ever so slightly in some ways but I'm

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.340 
ever so slightly in some ways but I'm
guessing<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> maps<00:01:43.049> have<00:01:43.200> been

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
guessing that the maps have been

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.440 
guessing that the maps have been
designed<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.920> this<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.460> mind<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.970> adds<00:01:45.119> more

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
designed with this in mind and adds more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.940 
designed with this in mind and adds more
options<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.020> chances<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.829> happen

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
options and chances for this to happen

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.789 
options and chances for this to happen
