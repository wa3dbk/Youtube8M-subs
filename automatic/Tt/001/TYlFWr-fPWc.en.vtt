use the frost and glow kit to begin with

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.940 
use the frost and glow kit to begin with
is<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.010> I<00:01:56.310> knew<00:01:56.610> people<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.830> said<00:01:58.830> it

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
is because I knew people like said it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.840 
is because I knew people like said it
was<00:01:59.070> gonna<00:01:59.250> end<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.910> like<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.150> coppery<00:02:00.690> color

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
was gonna end up like a coppery color

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.950 
was gonna end up like a coppery color
because<00:02:02.850> there's<00:02:03.000> no<00:02:03.120> built-in<00:02:03.360> toner<00:02:03.750> which

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
because there's no built-in toner which

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.560 
because there's no built-in toner which
is<00:02:04.080> why<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.229> tried<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:05.550> l'oreal<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.420> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
is why I tried the l'oreal because it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
is why I tried the l'oreal because it
was<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:06.750> medium<00:02:07.200> ash<00:02:07.410> color<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.979> want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.490> get
