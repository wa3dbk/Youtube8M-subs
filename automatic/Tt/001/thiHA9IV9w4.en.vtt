actually<00:01:49.290> slowly<00:01:49.590> filter<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.070> way<00:01:50.159> down<00:01:50.369> so

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
actually slowly filter the way down so

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.149 
actually slowly filter the way down so
from<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.750> grain<00:01:51.960> coming<00:01:52.380> in<00:01:52.500> all<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.860> way<00:01:53.009> to

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
from your grain coming in all the way to

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.800 
from your grain coming in all the way to
the<00:01:53.430> B<00:01:53.549> again<00:01:53.820> putting<00:01:54.180> two<00:01:54.329> kinks<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
the B again putting two kinks it's a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.510 
the B again putting two kinks it's a
very<00:01:55.020> manual<00:01:55.229> process<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.159> means<00:01:56.369> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
very manual process but it means that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.859 
very manual process but it means that
they<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.210> physical<00:01:57.659> touch

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
they actually have that physical touch

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.950 
they actually have that physical touch
with<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> product<00:01:58.649> all<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> way<00:01:58.920> through

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
with the product all the way through

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.470 
with the product all the way through
it's<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.770> real<00:02:00.950> feel<00:02:01.220> thing<00:02:01.490> being<00:02:02.360> either

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
it's a real feel thing being either

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.300 
it's a real feel thing being either
watching<00:02:02.990> or<00:02:03.110> listening<00:02:03.140> for<00:02:03.620> sounds<00:02:03.980> but

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
watching or listening for sounds but

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.590

it's quite good to hear the noises of

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.800 
it's quite good to hear the noises of
things<00:02:06.320> because<00:02:06.680> you<00:02:06.800> noise<00:02:07.670> changes<00:02:08.300> you

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
things because you noise changes you

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.510 
things because you noise changes you
know<00:02:08.990> there's<00:02:09.200> something<00:02:09.470> wrong<00:02:09.680> and<00:02:10.460> you

machinery - and built like an ox you

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.170 
machinery - and built like an ox you
know<00:02:24.890> he's<00:02:25.130> won't<00:02:25.280> break<00:02:25.580> it<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.850> know<00:02:25.970> I
