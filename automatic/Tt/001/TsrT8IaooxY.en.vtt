00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.000
 hello to all mates 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.439
 fiction today in this video will 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.500
 present this medical bag of the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.600
 mark tasmanian tiger 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.270
 it's a fanny bag 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.420
 thought to be taken as such to the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.329
 waist with a quick release clip 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.510
 and denver adjustable straps 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.850
 very well finished 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.100
 it can also be used by the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.579
 molle system to buy it in a 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.579
 tactical vest 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.000
 the tactical backpack or followers 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.940
 that support this without flames 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.160
 we can also of panels springs in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.060
 both lateral and in the lower part 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.060
 of the ass team 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:06.200
 also available on the front of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.200
 one pocket the velcro closure 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 it is released it opens completely 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.730
 and it gives us access to a series of bands 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.980
 Elastic 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.320
 which are originally designed to 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:21.050
 the holding of ampoules syringes and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.210
 another type of medical material but that 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.060
 they would be perfect to organize 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:31.770
 perfectly our kind of 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.770
 Survival or our team etc 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.630
 this beautiful you have here is 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.460
 situation vehicles to attach a 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.040
 Identification tag of the content 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.590
 for example a label that identifies 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.719
 that this is a little 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.130
 at the top we have a small 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.049
 right pocket 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.659
 I think it allows for carrying a razor 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.340
 a small knife a scissors another 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.260
 material that may need to be removed 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.000
 quickly 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.180
 maybe the most interesting thing in this bag 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.280
 It is the zipper closure system 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.590
 parallel that takes inside here from 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.900
 security 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:12.280
 and with a simple pull 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.620
 we completely open the bag 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.120
 access to content is higher than 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.020
 facilitates a lot without needing 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.180
 take us out to get to the material 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.690
 that we have in the upper part 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.960
 some elastic 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.330
 and a small pocket of duty 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.990
 and in the inner part three 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.990
 departments 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.900
 vertical hostels 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.030
 the first of them with 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.030
 transparent plastic that allows to see 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.100
 well the content the second 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.990
 with elastic bands inside and 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.459
 this being a little bigger too with 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.459
 elastic bands inside 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:01.470
 In short, it is a bag designed to 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.510
 that the team that is inside is easy 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.630
 and quickly accessible very compact 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.240
 Lightweight manufactured in Cordura 700 of 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.870
 a lot of resistance 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.120
 a bag designed for military purposes 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.740
 but they have a great application in 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.740
 the terrain of our hobbies 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.720
 concern for survival 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.370
