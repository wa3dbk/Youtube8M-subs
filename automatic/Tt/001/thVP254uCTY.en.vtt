works perfect that goes out works like

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.050 
works perfect that goes out works like
it<00:01:48.100> should<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:51.250> could<00:01:51.460> turn<00:01:51.610> that<00:01:51.730> back<00:01:51.910> off

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
give us our volume go to echo out again

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.630 
give us our volume go to echo out again
I'm<00:01:58.000> going<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.210> turn<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.480> on<00:02:00.360> works<00:02:01.360> fine
