00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.780
 here 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.839
 b 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.629
 so I considered you may now 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.199
 to a new command were held against Plech 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.820
 we welcome the 7 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.800
 like all players always only in second place on their markets 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.960
 and in the game modes Team Deathmatch 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
 too stupid bounce off the opponent 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.800
 if we put several in the game right now 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.910
 will now see that i am using eu-target game with silencer 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.460
 as eg Mary I have the USB and 40 in Making bid 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.490
 here is also a few times I think I'm not bad 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.900
 Viol 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.490
 Take care of Barca 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.780
 Kohl called it playing high with the Perfect 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.030
 still could some AP light 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.930
 been 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.390
 Speaking of flops, of course, I've also suspected others except probably or at 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.859
 there is still dexterity and firepower 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.820
 Music and light for together the business is not all by itself 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.660
 but one thing is always a matter of taste 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.890
 I am today you are like that 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.390
 it will survive 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.610
 Team Deathmatch 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.830
 if you play alone and much, for example, the duty mainly 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.450
 alone 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.159
 Dr or two maybe still 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.100
 mostly alone possible 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.880
 and therefore 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 feeling a little bit fit to fight alone 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.100
 I've already seen that, after all, I put myself in a clear position in the business area 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.630
 Here I come to my first topic of key assignment FranÃ§aise 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.780
 he ran the key assignment is wrong 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.799
 so you get too slow in English box 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.780
 yes and for exactly the reason I have you right now times the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.970
 different 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.060
 Attitudes of the movement of doctors is and actions 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.879
 around Konya 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.849
 I did not say much about it 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.849
 Two facts I still want to clarify even more vicious 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.349
 no one is there on paper by March 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.120
 open 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
 on advice so this grandfather scrolls 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.879
 usually the default is eBay 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.970
 I thought I would not always get him on Moscow for every shooter 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:34.459
 and 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.309
 I do not know what to follow so you will recommend 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.959
 but so there are the problems to quickly come to the cash register yesterday 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.709
 is something you 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.440
 It must be important for him to do things quickly 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.299
 Life, whatever it is 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.549
 and as then 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.849
 then 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.539
 where I used to wonder when still had problems calmed down 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.699
 Default setting for sighting 

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:03.679
 is the r around 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:05.509
 so that one 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:07.399
 ultimately annihilated 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.319
 and if you make respect the way it is still targeted and that has me 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.009
 formerly so disturbed and I did not know 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.149
 I think that all play stays that way 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.029
 yes, but then 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:20.560
 I have to put this week 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.159
 like it is much better because Dallmann 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.479
 Wittlich 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.909
 Clicking this will cap the user Becquerel again 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.569
 until today received there 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.650
 So who does not do the gate does not make himself unpopular 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.029
 QlikTech 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:40.789
 now the Cadillac has the higher up 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:44.019
 Michael Stix favorite clubs Terhaar and Faido 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.399
 good guides 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.529
 Zigbee Health Care Medicine Amrum Mirror 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.170
 Oh, we poor girls from the 7 z 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.340
 Are you satisfied Dacia falls 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.320
 l is both their bodies now theirs 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.640
 just exactly on the screenshots dance on it is vice versa 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:05.349
 so 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.439
 40 km from 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.369
 percent 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.129
 from the full, so to speak 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.199
 Mittermeier I plays with a formal degree 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.590
 So do not stop second 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.069
 nothing is as it is Sniper 2 is not often deep in the most intimate higher 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.699
 than me then I can change 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.029
 just works better 

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.479
 Now I have to do with ammunition all of course, I have rarely experienced 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.719
 out 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.719
 I believe and hope with this sermon 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.590
 left scandal 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.430
 That's also what people are afraid to think 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.360
 the shoot with weapons at full speed 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.820
 Peter Olofsen more or whatever 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.439
 and then look uplifted are naturally killed 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.439
 No, if you have nothing to lose you can do something like that but not otherwise 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:58.949
 Of course we have to 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.949
 Audis on this good thing 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.780
 As of October, this item is individually off the window but 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.069
 the PP 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:13.430
 one receives the landlord is to question 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.029
 there were 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.400
 May go 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.439
 easy machine guns Premier Latif 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.389
 Tixier 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.879
 86 so much that it's 86 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.469
 with the abrupt farewell goes on power until the 8 4 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.189
 completely retrieved here 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.699
 he does not simply give a share to buy correctly in total 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:37.610
 be achieved 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.389
 it does not matter 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.770
 of the 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.249
 Zeltner may therefore fall from the Munich as well as 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.279
 Percent at the 23 with in the boat point 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.379
 Thousands of homeless people have to 

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.229
 I do not know if that from GM for Opel Astra 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.759
 formal remains open 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.759
 yes culture week test 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.169
 so it can all be hand made Colonel 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.849
 promise in the year 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.909
 prohibits are important but grows 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.280
 And most of all, of course, he lost and then he can do the Beijing tour with it 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.279
 actually 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.099
 that is rare and it is 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:16.979
 even if she saw herself 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.160
 Finally, Merz continues 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.719
 they sit 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:22.099
 for a 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.479
 Cup play easier way the others jump 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.960
 especially 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.249
 if you just 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:29.080
 because you just finished 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.990
 percent 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.270
 Grenades light for Bayer to announce the hotplate 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.229
 if you know how to make sense kicker the opponents look 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.050
 but most of the stores have and not yet 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.629
 Wait a short while so the enemy can not avoid it 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:43.229
 because some things get it 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:45.770
 Camichel 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.770
 not too much 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.449
 with Trichet almost dead 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.150
 he was almost dead and he usually had to switch every day 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.069
 Instinctively to word I think there is nothing more 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:00.879
 and make it easy for me 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.550
 and around 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.749
 By the way, on the other hand, resp 

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:07.749
 so control 

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.699
 because you just have to think about where to go with your fingers 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.269
 The quickest in what could have been the most important thing now is the Centrums 

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:16.169
 sure always 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.629
 the mouse and as the right hand 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:22.330
 and percent the left always up to who is actually here or 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.099
 three children of the left hand 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.389
 Observers can 14 fingers on the St 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:29.969
 to control the Prof 

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:33.649
 and now what's not really exciting with the knives that 

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.349
 g Data is 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:39.129
 what happened to the buckle things are so likely to come 

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:40.879
 next also Commentary 

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.969
 Place both other channels 

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:46.399
 and she will stay that way, says Thomas because no one died 

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.589
 remember that Aachen is not 

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:52.589
 that the FDP benefits 

00:07:53.159 --> 00:07:55.179
 the couple the gameplay 

00:07:55.179 --> 00:07:56.319
 around 

00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:59.089
 Of course I believe in liquor stores yes 

00:07:59.089 --> 00:08:02.240
 at disco light stretches 24 to 4 I hope you had fun 

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:05.889
 and she moves to Mexico with Emily and Jazz
