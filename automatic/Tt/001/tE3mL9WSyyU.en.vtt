best-of-five that actually played to
their<00:07:06.120> strengths<00:07:06.480> I<00:07:06.630> don't<00:07:06.960> think<00:07:07.110> it'll<00:07:07.230> be

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
their strengths I don't think it'll be

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.780 
their strengths I don't think it'll be
exactly<00:07:07.440> the<00:07:07.830> same<00:07:07.860> case<00:07:08.250> the<00:07:08.430> split<00:07:08.520> but<00:07:08.730> I

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790 
exactly the same case the split but I

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.340 
exactly the same case the split but I
think<00:07:08.970> it's<00:07:09.090> too<00:07:09.210> early<00:07:09.270> to<00:07:09.690> write<00:07:10.140> them<00:07:10.290> out

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
think it's too early to write them out

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.780 
think it's too early to write them out
already<00:07:10.560> yeah<00:07:11.100> we<00:07:11.310> will<00:07:11.400> see<00:07:11.550> what<00:07:11.670> happens
