00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
work the first thing that I did is I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.729 
work the first thing that I did is I
realized<00:00:49.829> very<00:00:50.489> early<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.510> career<00:00:51.739> that

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
realized very early in my career that

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.069 
realized very early in my career that
you<00:00:53.460> had<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> develop<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.270> style<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you had to develop a style and it was a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.590 
you had to develop a style and it was a
unique<00:00:55.500> style<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.850> thing<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.270> did

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
unique style so the thing that I did

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.139 
unique style so the thing that I did
that<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> would<00:00:59.579> probably<00:00:59.940> stand

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that I think that would probably stand

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.619 
that I think that would probably stand
everyone<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.289> good<00:01:01.500> stead<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:02.270> use<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> same

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
everyone in good stead to use the same

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.160 
everyone in good stead to use the same
guidelines<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.760> I<00:01:05.760> sit<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.020> analyze

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
guidelines is I sit down and analyze

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.550 
guidelines is I sit down and analyze
myself<00:01:08.040> personally<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.720> physical<00:01:10.170> abilities

I realized or made myself ever so aware
of<00:01:17.549> my<00:01:18.030> weak<00:01:18.270> points<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:18.869> well<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.320> my<00:01:19.470> strong

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
of my weak points as well as my strong

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.070 
of my weak points as well as my strong

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
suit so what I tried to do to develop a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.370 
suit so what I tried to do to develop a
style<00:01:22.409> around<00:01:23.450> my<00:01:24.450> strong<00:01:24.900> points<00:01:25.350> and

minimize the weak points my strong

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.800 
minimize the weak points my strong
points<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.590> were<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.430> fail<00:01:30.090> who<00:01:30.420> were<00:01:30.540> my

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
points actually were I fail who were my

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.050 
points actually were I fail who were my
intelligence<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.560> my<00:01:31.650> speed<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
intelligence and my speed so

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
intelligence and my speed so
consequently<00:01:33.570> that's<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.860> I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
consequently that's basically how I

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.160 
consequently that's basically how I
developed<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> style<00:01:35.729> around<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.780> intelligence

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
developed a style around my intelligence

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.710 
developed a style around my intelligence
and<00:01:37.439> my<00:01:37.530> speed<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.490> try<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.850> minimize<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
and my speed and try to minimize the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.929 
and my speed and try to minimize the
thing<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.470> never<00:01:41.250> considered<00:01:41.820> myself

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
