00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.039
 Talk that guys are the wagner branches of the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.869
 channel wr kit this is another video from 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.940
 robotics series 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.880
 Let's continue some more with the 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.099
 arm programming fayfi asked to 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.859
 explain a little better about the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.580
 step-by-step algorithm programming 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:37.000
 that makes the alarm range the robotic arm 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.490
 is to position the cubes with the letters 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.070
 form words so I'm here with a 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.700
 algorithm used for those who did not see the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.080
 video is still the tenth episode of 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.600
 season one then gives a 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.990
 that the video is very interesting. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.330
 of the muffin air running then all 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.060
 this algorithm I have already explained a 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.040
 episode of the third season of a 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.980
 on the channel you will understand 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.770
 all right but then some more 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.049
 details about the algorithm 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.700
 so here are the prototypes of the 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.030
 auxiliary functions 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.880
 we have these here that are for movement 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.090
 sweaty and I already explained 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.160
 using loops outside we can 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 move the servos far more 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:28.690
 slow through a loop then the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.210
 from the interactions of each degree step 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.650
 by then the arm moves well 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:38.260
 I slowly have an example here 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.900
 morphy stamp then we have a loop outside 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.620
 that makes the interactions as a 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.620
 variable i and starts at an angle 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.840
 beginning here and goes to the 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.299
 final angle that is to end with a 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.820
 variable end-end and start-end variables are the 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.650
 parameters to my function then to the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.229
 beginning of the movement towards the end of 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.940
 movement 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.610
 this way the wrist movement of the arm 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.420
 upward then I increment in one 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.030
 drive the variable i 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.239
 I apply the variable and the tape servo function 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.830
 right point that the point servo library 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.930
 H 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.210
 so its increase by 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.550
 example from zero up to 90 degrees 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.000
 instead of going straight to the 90 he 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.670
 will add 1 en1 until it reaches 90 then 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.800
 This detail makes the brain 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.340
 move more subtly and more 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.310
 gentle but at what time do I have these 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.040
 interactions to the time of law that is the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.170
 first parameter of the function so I 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.350
 determine time of law for example 10 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.470
 5 milliseconds or as we here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.170
 suggestion in comment and every 5 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.390
 milliseconds and increments variable and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.160
 starting angle up to the final year I 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.620
 I want to die, or I want to die. 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.080
 for example the opposite direction of 90 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.990
 for 10 then I have to decree with 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.490
 the command is less - so the function 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.490
 muffins gives a 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:21.750
 aquino void cetanp then I have the 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.550
 my declared outputs for each servo 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.440
 including the treadmill that was the theme of 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.970
 last video right then declare a pin 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.710
 extra for treadmill because I want to 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.070
 move there too 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:39.160
 and here the point to you from the library 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.950
 servo, I determine which pin will be 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.140
 used for each servo of the treadmill 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:48.220
 then it was placed on pin 4 of the Arduino 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.840
 there I determine a positioning 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:55.060
 The initial 80 was the angle determined for 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.180
 hysteria being stopped then depends on the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.860
 used this angle of 80 degrees 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.120
 here you have to determine in a way 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.190
 empirical because normally a servant of 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.950
 360 degrees that was the case of the used 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.670
 it was not a deer converted to 360 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.980
 degrees 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.250
 use 90 degrees for it to be 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.980
 stopped 180 to move to one side and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.950
 and zero to move to another but 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.250
 these data should be obtained in Pirica 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.340
 mind then it will not loop we have the 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.270
 letter-by-letter mapping in case 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.570
 it's six 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.690
 so each letter a cube it initiates 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.000
 here and there you put 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.220
 mat is to the destination that is the point 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.710
 end this all has to be determined 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.450
 in a practical way as I have already demonstrated here 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.940
 in the third season 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.160
 then this is the simplest programming 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.170
 of a robotic arm as I have already mentioned 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.130
 other resources as matrices already 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:56.140
 Colombian and xyz positions that are well 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.800
 more complicated 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.870
 then it goes and delivers the letter 1 after 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.690
 the letter u comes the letter two in a new 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.680
 mapping is done to get the letter 2 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.170
 and position 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.380
 on the side of letter 1 until word 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.790
 then we have the letter 3 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.750
 I realize that I'm using the functions 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.900
 created right now and it hurts that already 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.390
 I explained in another video so it's okay 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.340
 even after letter three 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.510
 have the letter 4 then 5 and then 6 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.129
 ending the word then always 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.929
 moving the treadmill and stop 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.969
 when she has to be careful to 

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:37.509
 see an arm synchronization with the 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:41.409
 I also place an arm in the 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:43.989
 starting position again and gave the 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:47.229
 delay of 10 seconds to power 

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:49.509
 shut down the system then algorithm that 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.159
 allows the arm to do this task is 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.559
 there 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:56.110
 I hope I have clarified a number of doubts there. 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:58.360
 staff and if you have not yet 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.279
 other videos of the third season of 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.639
 an assisted to learn even more 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:06.369
 on the construction and programming of a 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.949
 robotic arm is quite interesting 

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:12.069
 next week we will have the closure of 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.319
 third season so do not lose 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.080
 the arm to the fae will perform a task 

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.419
 Pretty cool, you guys are going to enjoy the video. 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.279
 next week for sure is a 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.379
 quite different from what has already been 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.659
 we show so far so do not miss the 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:29.919
