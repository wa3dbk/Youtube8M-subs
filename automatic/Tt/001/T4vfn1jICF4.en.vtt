00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:12.929
 Jalisco television prevents you from 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:15.990
 what good tonalá tapalpa sayula la 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 truth is that I am very surprised of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.279
 the huge tourist offer but also 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.260
 good gastronomic course that 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.570
 one can find in places that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.970
 I thought they already knew them today they try 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.489
 how it is for lack is where they are 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.440
 the stones the stones the stones 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.230
 One day they invited me and I said that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.170
 we go some stones since I imagined 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:46.140
 this I do not know if they are exaggerating but 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.390
 literal stones are stones and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.309
 the people of jalisco de guadalajara is 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.680
 as your excursion helps to know and is 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.530
 very nice 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.010
 that's where generally the people who 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.329
 lives in guadalajara has his house 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.610
 field seasons huge stones and no 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.340
 It's very nice the town is magical 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.100
 very beautiful divine I think good 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.020
 we are going to have the opportunity to talk 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.040
 during two programs at least on the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.530
 issue of leaving jalisco and I think that 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 On the one hand, it's good to talk about 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.890
 this there is no kitchen of guadalajara or 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 jalisco that we think we already know and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.330
 the truth is that there is much more much more 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.800
 a hand we are also referring to the 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.540
 drowned cakes because they are from there 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.940
 exactly a dish of presenteeism 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.830
 hello west but tatemado tacos 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.350
 for example that the subject of the recipe 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.330
 It seemed like a wonderful kitchen and good 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.240
 the whole process that takes cooking 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.820
 the meat the truth is that I never 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.350
 I had seen the toast with which 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.530
 they also do in sayula with the tenderloin 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.750
 of the leg because it's like it's a 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:09.509
 slice and then then it already takes the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.030
 lettuce the tomatoes the cheese and the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.430
 chopped good little eyes that call 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.600
 they pilots or pesitos or whistles 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.510
 little eyes carry uf this the juice of the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.959
 meat or the consommé they are throwing 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.959
 over 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:38.280
 the food the salivary glands to 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.319
 to get upset then was very 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.750
 interesting for example discover that and 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.269
 in sayula there is also the card 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.860
 but here the cajeta is made with milk and 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.890
 it's a company that has a lot of time 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.730
 doing this 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:01.959
 this race and I loved it because 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:04.610
 it's from cajeta lugo orange sticker 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.650
 like milk seal red beam of account 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.020
 at the end it is the same as me red 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.820
 Guadalajara is the milk red stamp 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.090
 I loved it because the truth is that 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.830
 Guadalajara is ready to say sorry 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.980
 things that the truth does not imagine us the 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.300
 road to sayula and vines and then 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.450
 Tapalpa is very beautiful in fact you go through 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.480
 the plain where Juan Rulfo was inspired 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.880
 to write no longer in flames because it was 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.709
 an area that good at some point 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.140
 It was full of water and now it's a plain 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.370
 where even blizzards are made 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.050
 Very strong 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.420
 you have to go there very carefully 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.000
 when is the time in which they are made 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.100
 like some eddies and good and after 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.350
 that this great mountain range appears 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.269
 tiger that is a beauty and good too 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.070
 that diversity that they have in the climate 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.300
 both Sayula and Tapalpa him 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.790
 lets have 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.740
 for example the production of raspberries 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.190
 It is one of the most important 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.190
 Mexico 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.670

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.940
