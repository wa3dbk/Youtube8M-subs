00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.510
 what's happening here here lowe 3 is not this new 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.750
 video in minecraft and good this video to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.810
 go on a new reston tutorial and 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.599
 is how to make a trap of a trap 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 that is not right the eye that does not 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.329
 we can not see it is not like 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.480
 the typical plant in prison or what 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.090
 they added recently of the trip willy good 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.829
 recently, a lot of people have already done 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.590
 If I'm not mistaken, I think it should be 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:52.469
 1.3 good in this this trap is worth 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.940
 it's a trap that goes by with a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.160
 blind is worth a diamond for example 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.510
 How nice this is because of a ship 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.370
 minecraft to explain how it is done 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.260
 here I have prepared it how good 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.479
 basically that when you chop the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.479
 diamond here comes out a piston and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.690
 explode everything is worth if we had in his 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.110
 rival 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.060
 anyway 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.070
 in the trap you can simply do 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:26.750
 with any block that is activated 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.630
 for the rest, that is, well, yes, that's 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.790
 also more imagination and things are worth 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.000
 does with a back suit that good the back 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.040
 yes it's basically a good bug in 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.430
 this trap a bit delicate because 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.870
 it is not worth any order of not not 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.700
 You can do it like that, so you have to 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.979
 have an exact order of how they are made 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.380
 the good things first is done as well as 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.360
 a donut with the normal stone has to 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.840
 be stone standards preferably for 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.020
 that is less showy in order to know if 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.850
 a donut and is covered on the outside so it's worth 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.070
 this is normally found hillside 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.649
 a mountain or whatever things are 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.929
 the piston has to be here and so 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.239
 it's worth here we put a torch of 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:15.330
 straight torch forgiveness and good and here a 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.010
 active lever now here we are going to put 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.620
 the block that is raised we can put a 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.440
 diamond goal a block any 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.420
 block is block and when we put the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.430
 diamond this energy will be transmitted 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.940
 this block which in turn will give it to 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.300
 piston 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.040
 here we have to put now the tnt no 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.970
 before it is valid these have to be followed 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:39.400
 steps exactly like that because if you do not the 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.850
 pacs and ris will alter and hospital to that 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.380
 Well there you can see several holes of 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.380
 previous attempts in order 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.580
 is done now to give more power to 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.410
 the trap basically makes a hole 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.940
 It's worth more or less like that in two 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.950
 this block is very important to leave it 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.580
 earth because if it would not be activated by the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.650
 torch and good we fill it with tnt and already 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.030
 is if we want it to not break things 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.920
 that only harms, because we would put 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.650
 water in the end 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.590
 now we remove the lever and well then 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.890
 already simply when someone goes in his 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.890
 rival 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:25.430
 with his piquito 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.430
 with its calm iron peak 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.970
 what the fuck is this 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:37.560
 and take for ass so good 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.060
 basically the trap is made 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.159
 I already say that this also depends a little 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.230
 of the ingenuity of each one if there is this 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.209
 it would be the base and each one is going to 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.250
 investigate mom okay this is a boost 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.989
 of straight that is quite good is the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.150
 pack suit and good 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.560
 I hope it has served tutorial and we 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.560
 we see in the next video 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.540
 we go
