00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:19.250
 with its four arms the da vinci robot provides greater precision 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.079
 The surgeon controls the surgeon from the control center of the 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.119
 console located a few meters from the operating table from it the surgeon 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.500
 handles the two controls with manipulators that move the four arms that 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.890
 they hold the instruments with which the patient is intervened 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.870
 in this case it is the doctor and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.809
 ignacio pascual director of the neurology department of the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.350
 Clinical University of Navarre which deals with a radical prostatectomy 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 will direct to remove prostate tumors 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.820
 One of the arms is in charge of carrying the camera that transmits the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.359
 images of the internal anatomical region that is going to intervene 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.110
 to the surgeon's console 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.190
 three-dimensional vision with depth of field and optics 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.549
 up to 12 increases much higher than laparoscopy 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.069
 allows the surgeon greater precision in their movements at the same time 

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.270
 ergonomics of the system offers you the same movement skills as the 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.270
 open surgery 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.470
 the console also has pedals so that the surgeon with his feet 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.130
 controls part of the instrumental 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.840
 the nursing staff works in the sterile area next to the car of the 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.890
 patient and the operating table 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.950
 and is responsible for the exchange of instruments and endoscopes as you go 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.870
 specifying the surgeon 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.240
 The system also incorporates a vision car in which the 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.650
 image processing equipment 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.420
 the da vinci robot eliminates the natural tremor of the surgeon's hand and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.420
 allows a better visualization of the anatomical field that is operated 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.240
 In addition, the instruments are designed in such a way that 7 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.990
 degrees of freedom of movement 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.009
 practically similar to the mobility of the surgeon's hand 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.610
 to date the medical specialties in which there are indications 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.979
 for the surgical use of the system 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.609
