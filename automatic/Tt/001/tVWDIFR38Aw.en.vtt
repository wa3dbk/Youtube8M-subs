own<00:01:50.820> tomatoes<00:01:51.360> because<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.560> ones<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> buy<00:01:52.920> at

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100

own tomatoes because the ones you buy at
the<00:01:53.250> store<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.270> taste<00:01:54.570> great<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.310> I

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
the store just don't taste great so I

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
the store just don't taste great so I
got<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> plant<00:01:57.390> put<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> ground<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
got a plant put in the ground and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
got a plant put in the ground and
watered<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> it<00:02:00.090> grew<00:02:00.450> some<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
watered it it grew some but then the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.300 
watered it it grew some but then the
weather<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.860> hot<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.790> nearly<00:02:03.210> died
