dominant and will always try and

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.340 
dominant and will always try and
suppress<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> other<00:00:50.900> inevitably<00:00:51.900> ending<00:00:52.260> in

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
suppress the other inevitably ending in

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.140 
suppress the other inevitably ending in
the<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.560> dying<00:00:52.860> interestingly<00:00:53.370> what<00:00:53.790> happens

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
the one dying interestingly what happens

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.319 
the one dying interestingly what happens
is<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.680> they<00:00:55.680> were<00:00:55.740> born<00:00:56.010> opposite<00:00:56.550> sex<00:00:56.790> then

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
is if they were born opposite sex then

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.380 
is if they were born opposite sex then
immediately<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.320> male<00:00:59.180> submits<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.360> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
immediately the male submits to the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.700 
immediately the male submits to the
female<00:01:00.810> and<00:01:01.560> once<00:01:02.190> he<00:01:02.340> submits<00:01:03.470> she<00:01:04.470> allows

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
female and once he submits she allows

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.999 
female and once he submits she allows
him<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.280> access<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:06.869> milk<00:01:07.079> so<00:01:07.409> you'll

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
him the access to two milk so you'll

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.770 
him the access to two milk so you'll
probably<00:01:08.399> find<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.149> when<00:01:09.359> you<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.630> them

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
probably find when you when you see them

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.940 
probably find when you when you see them
out<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:09.899> the<00:01:10.109> wild<00:01:10.409> you'll<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.710> one

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
out in the wild you'll see one

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.120 
out in the wild you'll see one
relatively<00:01:11.579> big<00:01:11.939> baby<00:01:12.329> and<00:01:12.569> one<00:01:12.749> small<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:13.950> so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
relatively big baby and one small one so

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.649 
relatively big baby and one small one so
it<00:01:14.189> doesn't<00:01:14.219> get<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> premium<00:01:14.999> milk<00:01:15.450> or

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it doesn't get the premium milk or

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.749 
it doesn't get the premium milk or
access<00:01:16.079> to<00:01:16.200> milk<00:01:16.350> all<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.560> time<00:01:16.859> but<00:01:17.069> she<00:01:17.280> will

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
access to milk all the time but she will

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.480 
access to milk all the time but she will
allow<00:01:18.030> him<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.719> do<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.079> and<00:01:19.499> won't<00:01:20.189> fight

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
allow him to do that and and won't fight

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.330 
allow him to do that and and won't fight
with<00:01:20.819> him<00:01:20.990> all<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.170> time<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.859> reason<00:01:23.249> why

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
with him all the time and the reason why

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
with him all the time and the reason why
they<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.700> inflict<00:01:24.179> such<00:01:24.389> damage<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.990> such<00:01:25.139> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
they can inflict such damage at such a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.830 
they can inflict such damage at such a
young<00:01:25.289> age<00:01:25.469> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.460> baby<00:01:27.119> spotted<00:01:27.539> hyena

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
young age is that the baby spotted hyena

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.709 
young age is that the baby spotted hyena
is<00:01:28.109> born<00:01:28.469> fully<00:01:29.340> mobile<00:01:29.819> in<00:01:30.270> other<00:01:30.479> words<00:01:30.630> they

is born fully mobile in other words they

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:33.260 
is born fully mobile in other words they
can<00:01:30.899> scurry<00:01:31.229> around<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.909> they're<00:01:32.909> born<00:01:33.149> of

the full set of deciduous teeth and as

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.739 
the full set of deciduous teeth and as
well<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.659> being<00:01:37.200> able<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.729> have<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> very<00:01:39.450> basic

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
well as being able to have a very basic

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.449 
well as being able to have a very basic
vision<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.380> mean<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.829> make<00:01:41.219> out<00:01:41.429> shapes

00:01:41.449 --> 00:01:41.459 
vision I mean they can make out shapes

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.080 
vision I mean they can make out shapes
and<00:01:42.179> and<00:01:42.530> different<00:01:43.530> forms<00:01:44.069> and<00:01:44.340> obviously

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and and different forms and obviously

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
and and different forms and obviously
the<00:01:45.270> visual<00:01:45.539> acuity<00:01:45.810> gets<00:01:46.170> better<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.590> they

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the visual acuity gets better as they

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
the visual acuity gets better as they
get<00:01:46.859> older<00:01:47.249> but<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.209> really<00:01:48.329> interesting

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
get older but it's really interesting

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.989 
get older but it's really interesting
because<00:01:48.869> compared<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> lion<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.009> leave<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
because compared to a lion I leave the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.809 
because compared to a lion I leave the
camera<00:01:51.799> compared<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> lion<00:01:53.219> which<00:01:53.429> is<00:01:53.549> born

camera compared to a lion which is born

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.569 
camera compared to a lion which is born
completely<00:01:54.509> blind<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.560> born<00:01:56.069> hopeless

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
completely blind that's born hopeless

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.310 
completely blind that's born hopeless
and<00:01:56.880> has<00:01:57.869> no<00:01:58.079> teeth

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
and has no teeth

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.490 
and has no teeth
you<00:01:59.770> can<00:01:59.920> see<00:02:00.130> how<00:02:00.310> advanced<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.450> hyenas<00:02:01.870> are

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
you can see how advanced the hyenas are

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.920
