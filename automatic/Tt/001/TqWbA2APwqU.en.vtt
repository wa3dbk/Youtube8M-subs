us one of which is do I go with an
inflatable<00:00:34.899> or<00:00:35.410> do<00:00:35.500> I<00:00:35.590> get<00:00:35.770> a<00:00:35.800> rigid<00:00:36.250> so<00:00:36.700> let's

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
inflatable or do I get a rigid so let's

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.420 
inflatable or do I get a rigid so let's
start<00:00:37.120> with<00:00:37.239> storage<00:00:38.020> storage<00:00:38.680> is<00:00:38.950> huge<00:00:39.250> if

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
start with storage storage is huge if
