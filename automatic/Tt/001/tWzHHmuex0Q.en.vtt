00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.360
 nokia and windows a golden combination 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.070
 at least in some cases enough 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.840
 lumia devices that are in fact the revue 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.559
 have passed and on a good judgment 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.619
 could count 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.270
 so leaves the Nokia Lumia 620 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.740
 i may have been it also this lumia 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.779
 820 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.430
 certainly does not disappoint 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.800
 it even more than that 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.660
 The Nokia Lumia 820 only shares the Lumia 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.369
 920 above 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.960
 therefore, the device must have a number 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.940
 parts must of course be returned 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.780
 compared to its big brother does so 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.340
 for example, none 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.780
 unibody housing but that has 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.519
 of course as an advantage that you yourself 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.960
 replace the battery 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.699
 the rest they don't really need 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.160
 this smartphone is easy for a day 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.420
 also with intensive use 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.059
 the device is running though 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.519
 the same processor as the lumia 920 and 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.620
 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor with 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.559
 a giga working memory the device can 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.909
 just like the 29 wireless charging and the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.620
 camera has the same number of megapixels 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.940
 namely 8 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.059
 The difference lies in the fact that this is 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.560
 is not a pureview camera and that means 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.210
 in practice that photos and videos 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.670
 simply of lesser quality 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.259
 the device also lacks image stabilization 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.490
 and that is mainly noticeable when you 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.750
 video shoots 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.220
 that does not mean that the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.420
 quality of the photos immediately 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.710
 bad is certainly good 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.619
 light conditions it looks 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.700
 actually great and the hardware 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.890
 button on the side of the device 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.780
 makes shooting the photo extra 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.610
 easy and you care too 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.310
 in addition, excellent applications with which the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.509
 then edit photos 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.430
 well i had to get used to it a bit 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.530
 appearance of the 820 it is what to the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.570
 heavy side and the eye above no one thick 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.979
 and log it took me about three 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.990
 seconds to get used to this and 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.000
 since then I actually think about it 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.710
 bright yellow case I doubt a little longer 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.509
 but the people around me were 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.549
 actually within that my judgment 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.200
 what a cool smartphone that actually 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.640
 I therefore tacked 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.619
 the device is about lump in all sorts 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.539
 other colors also available and shape 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.590
 a bit more businesslike, luckily 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.600
 the black 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.000
 big downside to this 28 will incidentally 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.000
 the resolution of the 4.3 inch screen 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.770
 but the 29 are still an HD display 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.220
 has to do this gear with one 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.899
 resolution of only 480 by 800 pixels 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.450
 certainly in the price category in which it 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.830
 falls that is rather on the low side 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.630
 nevertheless, you have not immediately got rid of it 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.830
 for windows 8 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.050
 it just looks beautiful 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.580
 on this screen and that windows 8 is 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.410
 then again the biggest plus 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.120
 on the device it is clear 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.130
 it is accessible and thanks to the live 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.560
 while also nice and dynamic 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.880
 nice is that you have the color of 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.230
 can have a home match the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.700
 housing or dressed properly you can 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.500
 find out that I am very sorry about it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.150
 and if you do have a windows tomorrow 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.290
 purchase let it be one of them 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.840
 be nokia 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.010
 That means some excellent ones 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.750
 pre-installed applications 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.640
 free navigation worldwide 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.830
 Nokia doesn't drive that your own 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.210
 music and other online playlists 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.310
 with nokia music 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.660
 you see in a kind through city lens 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.190
 augmented reality which 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.080
 sightseeing restaurants or 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.000
 Pubs are all nearby 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.070
 it all works out yet is excellent 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.840
 they are third-party applications that are in 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.610
 comparison with the ios and android 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.870
 version may be disappointing 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.060
 for example, options are exhausted 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.800
 facebook a bit scarce and open the 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.300
 youtube app is really only a mobile 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.860
 version of the website 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.050
 it may be clear i'm kinda too 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.790
 speak about this smartphone and it is crazy 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.050
 actually not 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.610
 the device is relative to its 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.290
 big brother just as fast 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.160
 and offers the same software 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.110
 functionalities 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.910
 maybe the room is a bit less 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.019
 screen resolution is somewhat low but they 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.070
 that still things that are not for you 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.720
 to be important 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.230
 this no reason to make more money 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.820
 spend on the lumia 920 for 350 euros 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.280
 get excellent windows smartphone 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.739
 which definitely does not disappoint 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.830
 therefore get gear 4 stars and I 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.830
 also
