00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
normally you start drawing from one

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.200 
normally you start drawing from one
corner<00:00:49.800> outward<00:00:50.800> but<00:00:51.520> if<00:00:51.610> you<00:00:51.700> hold<00:00:51.910> command

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
corner outward but if you hold command

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.080 
corner outward but if you hold command
or<00:00:52.390> control<00:00:52.950> instead<00:00:53.950> you<00:00:54.550> will<00:00:54.670> be<00:00:54.790> drawing

centered around your initial click
that's<00:00:58.090> particularly<00:00:58.570> handy<00:00:58.810> when<00:00:58.930> you're

hold the cursor down and you get an

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.730 
hold the cursor down and you get an

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
can also use the left and right cursors

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.620 
can also use the left and right cursors

we now have a new layer call shape layer
one<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:56.830> just<00:01:57.400> like<00:01:57.580> any<00:01:57.820> layer<00:01:58.090> you<00:01:58.390> can

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
one and just like any layer you can

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.700 
one and just like any layer you can
rename<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:59.020> i'll<00:01:59.590> rename<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.420> rounded

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
now that red fill is going out to the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
center line of the stroke and you see

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.330 
center line of the stroke and you see
it's<00:03:57.120> being<00:03:57.299> drawn<00:03:57.540> on<00:03:57.780> top<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.349> stroke<00:03:58.650> so
