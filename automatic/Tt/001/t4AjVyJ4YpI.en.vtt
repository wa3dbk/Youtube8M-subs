00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
this is very very good news for

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.950 
this is very very good news for
Borderlands<00:01:22.590> players<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.280> PC<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.150> figured

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
Borderlands players on PC and I figured

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080 
Borderlands players on PC and I figured
that<00:01:25.170> they<00:01:25.290> would<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.680> something<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.520> fix<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that they would do something to fix it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.730 
that they would do something to fix it
as<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> new<00:01:27.869> Borderlands<00:01:28.530> game

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
as there is a new Borderlands game

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.310 
as there is a new Borderlands game
coming<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.420> fall<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.140> course

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
coming out in the fall of course

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.499 
coming out in the fall of course
Borderlands<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> pre-sequel<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.150> don't

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
Borderlands the pre-sequel and I don't

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
Borderlands the pre-sequel and I don't
think<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.869> would<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.590> good<00:01:34.950> business<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
think it would be very good business to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.920 
think it would be very good business to
just<00:01:35.790> have<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.450> game<00:01:36.659> go<00:01:36.960> offline<00:01:38.150> 100%<00:01:39.150> on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
just have the game go offline 100% on

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.810 
just have the game go offline 100% on
the<00:01:40.140> PC<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.280> would<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.700> would

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the PC because that would that would

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.460 
the PC because that would that would
just<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.150> bad<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> people<00:01:43.170> still

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
just be bad and a lot of people still

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.770 
just be bad and a lot of people still
play<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.070> know<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.909> still<00:01:45.299> play<00:01:45.570> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
play this I know that I still play this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.350

for the time being let's just assume

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.030 
for the time being let's just assume
that<00:03:07.829> even<00:03:08.010> though<00:03:08.310> it<00:03:08.489> has<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.560> game

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
Borderlands they just wanted to make

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.530

sure<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:27.100> transition<00:04:27.940> over<00:04:28.510> to

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
sure that the transition over to

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.350 
sure that the transition over to
Steamworks<00:04:29.170> was<00:04:29.440> even<00:04:29.890> possible<00:04:30.850> at<00:04:31.120> all

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
Steamworks was even possible at all

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.480 
Steamworks was even possible at all
because<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:32.140> you<00:04:32.560> know<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.710> don't<00:04:33.130> I'm<00:04:33.310> not<00:04:33.340> a

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
because it you know I don't I'm not a

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.360 
because it you know I don't I'm not a
programmer<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.240> I<00:04:34.360> can't<00:04:34.660> even<00:04:34.870> pretend<00:04:35.830> to

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
programmer and I can't even pretend to

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.310 
programmer and I can't even pretend to
be<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.550> programmer<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.450> don't<00:04:37.840> know<00:04:37.990> how<00:04:38.170> it

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
be a programmer I don't know how it

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.140 
be a programmer I don't know how it
works<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.280> guess<00:04:39.520> they<00:04:39.670> just<00:04:39.850> wanted<00:04:40.090> to

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
works so I guess they just wanted to

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.880 
works so I guess they just wanted to
make<00:04:40.240> sure<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.660> worked<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.140> they're<00:04:41.680> putting

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
make sure it worked and they're putting

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.410 
make sure it worked and they're putting

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
it through the wringer getting its

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.390 
it through the wringer getting its
testing<00:04:43.900> on<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.320> make<00:04:44.470> sure<00:04:44.680> that<00:04:44.830> everything

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
would have detracted about I'd say a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.010 
would have detracted about I'd say a
solid<00:05:27.340> 60<00:05:27.730> percent<00:05:28.180> of<00:05:28.330> the<00:05:28.419> game<00:05:28.600> value
