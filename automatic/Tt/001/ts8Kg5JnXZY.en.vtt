00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.180
 the leica the 810 is coming 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.700
 a big package therefore why that 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.259
 we'll see if we open it 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.359
 because the laser gauge is not straight 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.640
 small 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.289
 There is a protective cover which one 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.779
 very nice to use as a belt pouch 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.999
 can and the poor bend the that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.190
 falling beyond prevented 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:37.860
 are extra packed a charger and 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:40.710
 a usb cable in the d 810 is powered by a battery 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.900
 operated the four additional plugs 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.790
 also allow them to do that internationally 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.790
 device and charge 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.310
 Furthermore, there is a 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.530
 short instructions and on cd one 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.990
 detailed instructions for the operation of the 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.990
 Head of the TD 810 in the packaging 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.070
 Let's look at the basic functions of the 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.470
 d 810 once more accurate 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.380
 First, a look on the back 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.540
 there is the foldout sport with the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.410
 I measure comfortably out of the corners 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.160
 Can via the central red button 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.900
 I turn on the laser gauge 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.759
 It takes a bit until all functions 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.869
 loaded are similar to one 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.430
 computer then me the mess 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.250
 Function available 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.680
 I know your goal is to click 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.570
 the central red button and one 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.259
 another click completes this measurement 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.380
 the result will be displayed directly to me 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.770
 I can use the button functions 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.840
 get the functions on the desktop 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.149
 in the small display i can over the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.979
 touchscreen with my finger the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.479
 choose functions to measure 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.960
 in the outdoor area, I can a camera 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.030
 bring about the camera in me 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.729
 display the target I can see that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.240
 aim at the enlargement 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.429
 I can touch the target in the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.260
 get magnification 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.269
 That's not so easy the goal 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.120
 then keep an eye on everyone 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:21.590
 Things go away with larger magnifications 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.799
 is it for leica offers a tripod of the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.680
 leica also offers the d 810 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:31.099
 photo function we are looking outside 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.959
 so we are in the outdoor area and 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.409
 want the camera functions of the new d 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.719
 Test 810 and I'm about ten 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.609
 meters from the facade 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:43.760
 and when i go over the display the 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.799
 facade anvisiere because of the low 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.389
 focal length of the camera, I only see one 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.109
 Part of cut only here below right 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:53.510
 the big window means the whole 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.040
 facade to photograph it with 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.290
 security is insufficient due to 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.650
 low focal length but at points 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.139
 It is possible to document damage 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.359
 completely sufficient that the like has 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.849
 more d can messi 810 I got mine 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.919
 thought much more interesting 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.450
 more exciting for me it is like working 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.790
 he is mobile with the smartphone and cats 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.579
 Together I'll get mine 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.500
 smartphone and staring at cats mobile 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.419
 same already with the program city 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.139
 wants to mobilize cats with the leica disco 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.870
 connect 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.489
 I have to turn on the bluetooth function 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.540
 activate the leica 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:32.090
 about functions and settings 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.500
 I choose the bluetooth function calls 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.120
 the function also wants the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.889
 connection options and confirm these 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.840
 back in the display will me the bluetooth 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.890
 displayed signs bluetooth 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.110
 activated 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.100
 Now I can now mobilize with the leica 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.800
 start the more 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.180
 The device is found directly with me 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.660
 One click I connect the two 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.950
 The Russian signal together 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.930
 shows me that the connection 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.690
 was successful in mine 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.300
 project structure I extend mine 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.230
 leave room for another room 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:10.100
 children's room in sketch oversize mark 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:12.050
 I the cornerstones of the room and choose 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.390
 then the components from the to measure 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.109
 are already the first stretch 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.310
 Demands the leykam is the track and 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.870
 the result will be with the 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.240
 Equals sign after network mobile 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.610
 transferred and processed there directly 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.040
 already inquired for the next route 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.160
 how he gets measured and the result 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.200
 transferred and cats processed mobile 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.150
 this is fast and easy 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.510
 easy to measure 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.150
 To conclude, a short summary of the D 810 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.130
 is a bit bigger than usual but is 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.360
 good in the hand 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.960
 He offers many innovative features 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.810
 such as the touchscreen display 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.670
 and the camera function but really 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.400
 sinn makes the whole thing only with cats mobile 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.420
 because cats mobile leads the measured 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:03.510
 values together into a perfect machining allowance 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:07.490
 the d 810 and cats mobile works that way 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.490
 easy and fast to measure today
