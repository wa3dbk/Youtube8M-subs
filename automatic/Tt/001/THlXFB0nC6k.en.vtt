00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
you see um are when you go up like that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.270 
you see um are when you go up like that
one<00:01:08.430> right<00:01:08.460> there<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.930> means<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.500> breaking

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
one right there that means it's breaking

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.340 
one right there that means it's breaking
when<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.580> down<00:01:11.729> like<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.930> means<00:01:13.200> it's

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
when it's down like that that means it's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.109 
when it's down like that that means it's
off<00:01:13.549> but<00:01:14.549> make<00:01:14.790> sure<00:01:14.820> um<00:01:16.159> these<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
off but make sure um these like the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.480 
off but make sure um these like the
opposite<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.890> need<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
opposite that one and that one need to

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.870 
opposite that one and that one need to
be<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> same<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.570> can't<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:23.130> then

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
be the same they can't be up and then

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.280 
be the same they can't be up and then
that<00:01:24.330> one<00:01:24.479> down<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.380> will<00:01:25.500> make<00:01:25.670> like

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
that one down because it will make like

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.770 
that one down because it will make like
noises<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> ruin<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.640> real<00:01:29.909> over<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> period

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
noises and ruin your real over a period

noises and ruin your real over a period
of<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:35.869> hold<00:01:36.869> on

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.990 

if<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:42.950> get<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.219> perfect<00:01:43.430> like<00:01:43.969> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
if you get it perfect like the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.630 
if you get it perfect like the
centrifugal<00:01:44.600> braking<00:01:45.170> system<00:01:45.619> this<00:01:46.399> thing

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
centrifugal braking system this thing

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.899 
centrifugal braking system this thing
will<00:01:46.789> cast<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.270> mile<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:49.280> brought<00:01:49.610> it<00:01:49.789> up<00:01:49.850> to

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
will cast a mile and I brought it up to

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.120 
will cast a mile and I brought it up to
okeechobee<00:01:50.299> a<00:01:50.689> couple<00:01:51.049> times<00:01:51.289> and<00:01:51.799> I<00:01:51.979> go

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
okeechobee a couple times and I go

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.819 
okeechobee a couple times and I go
fishing<00:01:52.520> with<00:01:53.119> this<00:01:53.329> every<00:01:53.570> single<00:01:53.810> day<00:01:54.020> I've

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
fishing with this every single day I've

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.809 
fishing with this every single day I've
only<00:01:55.009> really<00:01:55.909> backlash<00:01:56.450> like<00:01:57.369> most<00:01:58.369> three

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
only really backlash like most three

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.219 
only really backlash like most three
times<00:01:59.149> may<00:02:00.110> be<00:02:00.140> four<00:02:01.119> but<00:02:02.119> um<00:02:02.329> this<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.200> a

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
times may be four but um this is a

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.270 
times may be four but um this is a
really<00:02:03.619> good<00:02:03.799> real<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:05.619> it's<00:02:06.619> light<00:02:06.979> it's

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
really good real and it's light it's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.460 
really good real and it's light it's
only<00:02:07.939> seven<00:02:08.299> point<00:02:08.509> two<00:02:08.569> ounces<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.140> I<00:02:09.259> said

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
only seven point two ounces like I said

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.490 
only seven point two ounces like I said
before<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:10.280> if<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.519> get<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.849> really<00:02:11.200> light<00:02:12.200> rod

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
before and if you get a really light rod

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.610 
before and if you get a really light rod
with<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.690> have<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.110> carbon<00:02:15.440> light

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
with it like I have the carbon light

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.059 
with it like I have the carbon light
7-foot<00:02:16.190> medium<00:02:16.549> heavy<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.500> that's<00:02:18.500> very

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
7-foot medium heavy and that's very

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.410 
7-foot medium heavy and that's very
light<00:02:19.430> also<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.120> light<00:02:21.079> +<00:02:21.440> light<00:02:21.709> equals<00:02:22.130> very

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
light also so light + light equals very

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.110 
light also so light + light equals very
sensitive<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.680> plus<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:25.160> carbon<00:02:25.489> light<00:02:25.670> rod

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
sensitive and plus the carbon light rod

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.559 
sensitive and plus the carbon light rod
is<00:02:26.420> very<00:02:27.380> powerful<00:02:28.660> even<00:02:29.660> when<00:02:29.870> it's<00:02:30.019> light<00:02:30.459> so

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
is very powerful even when it's light so

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.059 
is very powerful even when it's light so
um<00:02:32.569> it<00:02:33.380> is<00:02:34.040> worth<00:02:34.250> every<00:02:34.459> cent<00:02:35.239> I<00:02:35.450> think<00:02:36.069> like

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
um it is worth every cent I think like

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.520 
um it is worth every cent I think like
most<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:38.090> them<00:02:38.180> because<00:02:38.599> it's<00:02:38.840> very<00:02:39.319> high

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
most of them because it's very high

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.550 
most of them because it's very high
performance<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.459> its<00:02:40.910> really<00:02:41.810> good<00:02:42.049> quality

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
performance and its really good quality

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.039 
performance and its really good quality
but<00:02:43.370> even<00:02:43.790> though<00:02:43.940> it<00:02:44.090> has<00:02:44.209> only<00:02:44.540> five<00:02:44.810> ball

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
but even though it has only five ball

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.379 
but even though it has only five ball
