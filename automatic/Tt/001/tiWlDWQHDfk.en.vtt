00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it's kind of a touchy where you place

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.770 
it's kind of a touchy where you place
your<00:00:34.830> archers<00:00:35.310> because<00:00:35.700> sometimes<00:00:36.210> you'll

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
your archers because sometimes you'll

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.080 
your archers because sometimes you'll
try<00:00:37.080> them<00:00:37.290> place<00:00:37.560> them<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.430> close<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
try them place them very very close to

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.080 
try them place them very very close to
the<00:00:39.120> mortar<00:00:39.540> yet<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.890> end<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.250> spawning<00:00:41.700> just

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the mortar yet they end up spawning just

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.900 
the mortar yet they end up spawning just
a<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.780> bit<00:00:43.130> outside<00:00:44.130> of<00:00:44.190> where<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.670> want

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
a little bit outside of where you want

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
a little bit outside of where you want
them<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> then<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.960> mortar<00:00:46.260> takes

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
them to be and then the mortar takes

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.990 
them to be and then the mortar takes
them<00:00:46.740> out<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.310> going<00:00:47.400> to<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.910> an

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
them out and you're going to see in an

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.450 
them out and you're going to see in an
upcoming<00:00:48.210> single<00:00:48.810> player<00:00:49.110> mission<00:00:49.470> where<00:00:50.070> we

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
upcoming single player mission where we

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
upcoming single player mission where we
we<00:00:51.090> end<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.420> doing<00:00:51.450> that<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.080> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.410> lose

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
we end up doing that and I think we lose

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.070 
we end up doing that and I think we lose
two<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.130> three<00:00:53.460> archers<00:00:53.790> before<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
two or three archers before we get the

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.680 
two or three archers before we get the
exact<00:00:55.470> placement<00:00:55.830> anyway<00:00:56.700> so<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.030> got<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
exact placement anyway so we got the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.120 
exact placement anyway so we got the
archers<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.230> complete<00:00:58.560> here<00:00:58.830> and<00:00:59.010> they're

archers are complete here and they're

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.220 
archers are complete here and they're
gonna<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.400> in<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.820> activate<00:01:00.570> those<00:01:00.900> bombs

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
apparently in the main entrance but we

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
apparently in the main entrance but we
don't<00:01:03.060> care<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.780> we're<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.409> there

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
don't care because we're not going there

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.709 
don't care because we're not going there
okay<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.580> got<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:05.820> archer<00:01:06.119> tower<00:01:06.330> at<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 
okay so we got an archer tower at the

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:08.209 
okay so we got an archer tower at the
top<00:01:06.899> of<00:01:06.929> the<00:01:07.109> base<00:01:07.289> we<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.649> take<00:01:07.829> out<00:01:08.009> with<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
top of the base we can take out with a

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.279 
top of the base we can take out with a
bunch<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.549> archers<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.420> sent<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.780> I

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
bunch of archers I think it's sent in I

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.069 
bunch of archers I think it's sent in I
don't<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.560> five<00:01:10.829> six<00:01:11.219> seven<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.509> and<00:01:12.840> we

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
don't know five six seven or so and we

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.169 
don't know five six seven or so and we
have<00:01:13.259> one<00:01:13.590> remaining<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.399> sent<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.820> pretty

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
have one remaining so we sent in pretty

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.569 
have one remaining so we sent in pretty
much<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> exact<00:01:16.200> amount<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.340> needed

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
much the exact amount that we needed

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.819 
much the exact amount that we needed
then<00:01:18.179> we're<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.869> send<00:01:19.079> in<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.289> barbarian

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
then we're going to send in a barbarian

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.399 
then we're going to send in a barbarian
as<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> distraction<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.119> wall<00:01:21.359> breaker<00:01:21.719> to

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
as a distraction and a wall breaker to

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
as a distraction and a wall breaker to
break<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.920> wall<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.520> side<00:01:23.789> so<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.420> we

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
break that wall on that side so that we

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.620 
break that wall on that side so that we
can<00:01:24.869> swarm<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.759> remainder<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.450> base

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
can swarm the the remainder of the base

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
can swarm the the remainder of the base
with<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.200> barbarians<00:01:28.679> we're<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> do

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
with some barbarians we're going to do

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.149 
with some barbarians we're going to do
the<00:01:29.249> same<00:01:29.460> thing<00:01:29.759> over<00:01:29.999> on<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.689> other<00:01:30.960> side

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
the same thing over on this other side

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.590 
the same thing over on this other side
we're<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.460> get<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.819> wall<00:01:33.119> breaker<00:01:33.420> in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
we're going to get a wall breaker in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.809 
we're going to get a wall breaker in
there<00:01:33.719> unfortunately<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.799> don't<00:01:35.399> like<00:01:35.609> where

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
there unfortunately I don't like where

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.550 
there unfortunately I don't like where
the<00:01:35.909> wall<00:01:36.090> breaker<00:01:36.420> broke<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> wall<00:01:37.170> because

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the wall breaker broke the wall because

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.340 
the wall breaker broke the wall because
it<00:01:37.710> broke<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.159> wall<00:01:38.399> going<00:01:39.149> into<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> elixir

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it broke the wall going into the elixir

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.200 
it broke the wall going into the elixir

these barbarians take out the town hall

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.300 
these barbarians take out the town hall
and<00:02:23.100> then<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.390> go<00:02:24.690> proceed<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.800> cannon

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
and then a go proceed to that cannon

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.860 
and then a go proceed to that cannon
down<00:02:26.490> at<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> bottom<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.360> base<00:02:27.570> i

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
down at the bottom of the base i

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.720 
down at the bottom of the base i
meanwhile<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.920> balloon<00:02:29.190> takes<00:02:29.490> out<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
other canon but like I said you could

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.890 
other canon but like I said you could

probably spam in a few more I mean I

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.480 
probably spam in a few more I mean I
think<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.200> have<00:02:34.230> room<00:02:34.560> for<00:02:34.860> what<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.220> balloons

thousand elixir I think we did fairly

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.290 
thousand elixir I think we did fairly
