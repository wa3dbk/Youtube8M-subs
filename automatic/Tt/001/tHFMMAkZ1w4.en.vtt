00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
who one day here's a little creek and a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.630 
who one day here's a little creek and a
pop<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:20.060> their<00:00:21.170> instrument<00:00:22.310> panel<00:00:23.310> or<00:00:23.400> in<00:00:23.519> your

dash and all of a sudden your truck

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.330 
dash and all of a sudden your truck
starts<00:00:27.330> blowing<00:00:27.630> nothing<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.470> hot<00:00:28.650> air<00:00:28.680> when

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
starts blowing nothing but hot air when

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.659 
starts blowing nothing but hot air when
you<00:00:29.429> switch<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.849> cold<00:00:30.710> it<00:00:31.710> just<00:00:31.769> blows<00:00:32.430> hot

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you switch it to cold it just blows hot

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.760 
you switch it to cold it just blows hot
air<00:00:32.700> your<00:00:33.510> AC<00:00:34.380> canister<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> cold<00:00:36.770> there's

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
air your AC canister is cold there's

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.540 
air your AC canister is cold there's
moisture<00:00:38.040> build-up<00:00:38.760> everywhere<00:00:40.460> but<00:00:41.460> it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
moisture build-up everywhere but it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.540 
moisture build-up everywhere but it
still<00:00:41.820> blows<00:00:42.090> nothing<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> hot<00:00:42.780> air

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
still blows nothing but a hot air

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.330 
still blows nothing but a hot air
basically<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.700> guess<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> blend<00:00:45.960> or

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
basically I guess this is the blend or

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.630 
basically I guess this is the blend or
actuator<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.690> it's<00:00:48.690> found<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:49.230> behind<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
actuator and it's found up behind the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.689 
actuator and it's found up behind the
dash<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.980> pull<00:00:53.190> out<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.370> dash

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
dash so you have to pull out the dash

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.830 
dash so you have to pull out the dash
you<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.289> take<00:00:55.500> everything<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.840> pull

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you have to take everything out and pull

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
you have to take everything out and pull
the<00:00:58.050> dash<00:00:58.230> forward<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.489> don't<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.820> need

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the dash forward you don't really need

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.479 
the dash forward you don't really need
to<00:01:00.149> take<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.829> pull<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.100> forward

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
to take it out you can pull it forward

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.450 
to take it out you can pull it forward
and<00:01:03.199> then<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.890> behind<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.369> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
and then this is up and behind and you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.950 
and then this is up and behind and you
got<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> find<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.360> I'll<00:01:06.450> try<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.840> get

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
got to find this and I'll try and get

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.780 
got to find this and I'll try and get

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
stick that goes through there and it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
stick that goes through there and it
turns<00:01:21.179> there's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> motor<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.200> inside<00:01:22.649> here<00:01:22.979> I'm

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
turns there's a motor up inside here I'm
