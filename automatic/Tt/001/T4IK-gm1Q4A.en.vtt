ER<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.680> moving<00:00:22.949> maybe<00:00:23.340> maybe<00:00:23.970> it

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
ER and like really moving maybe maybe it

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
ER and like really moving maybe maybe it
would<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.359> been<00:00:24.420> easier<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.230> style<00:00:25.529> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
would have been easier but the style it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.060 
would have been easier but the style it
was<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.310> slow<00:00:26.990> and<00:00:27.990> for<00:00:28.380> somebody<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.830> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
was like slow and for somebody that is

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.370 
was like slow and for somebody that is
so<00:00:29.369> upright<00:00:29.640> we<00:00:30.449> worked<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.990> worked<00:00:31.170> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
so upright we worked and worked and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.709 
so upright we worked and worked and
worked<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.740> we<00:00:31.859> never<00:00:32.070> sat<00:00:32.399> down<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.059> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
worked and we never sat down so I and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.770 
worked and we never sat down so I and
for<00:00:34.500> performance<00:00:35.010> wise<00:00:35.219> he's<00:00:35.670> not<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.270> known

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
for performance wise he's not a known

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.799 
for performance wise he's not a known
performer<00:00:37.530> too<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.399> really<00:00:39.059> wanted<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.450> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
performer too so I really wanted that to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.630 
performer too so I really wanted that to
be<00:00:39.840> what<00:00:40.079> came<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:40.950> it<00:00:41.070> did<00:00:41.219> so

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
be what came out and I think it did so

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
be what came out and I think it did so
yes<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.780> awesome<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.320> usually

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
yes that was awesome and it's usually

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.920 
yes that was awesome and it's usually
harder<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> choreographer<00:00:45.180> who<00:00:45.420> has<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
harder on the choreographer who has to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.350 
harder on the choreographer who has to
pass<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.770> his<00:00:46.980> style<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> working

first day that Dave came in I go you are

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.209 
first day that Dave came in I go you are
a<00:00:59.609> genius<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.270> he<00:01:00.480> came<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.199> prepared<00:01:01.649> he

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
a genius like he came in so prepared he

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.680 
a genius like he came in so prepared he
had<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> whole<00:01:02.699> dance<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.629> know

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
had the whole dance on which I know

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.420

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
isn't really Dave style I think he likes

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.609 
isn't really Dave style I think he likes

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
to go in and freestyle but having

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830 
to go in and freestyle but having
someone<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.100> him<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:09.180> know<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.570> ballet

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
someone like him you know a ballet

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
someone like him you know a ballet
dancer<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.530> was<00:01:10.650> really<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> he<00:01:11.369> came

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
dancer it was really good that he came

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.600 
dancer it was really good that he came
prepared<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.299> also<00:01:12.689> he<00:01:12.900> made<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.590> he<00:01:14.460> was

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
prepared and also he made it so he was

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789 
prepared and also he made it so he was
leaning<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:15.060> me<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.570> therefore<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.470> was<00:01:16.650> in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
leaning on me and therefore I was in

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.710 
leaning on me and therefore I was in
front<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.280> lot<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.790> think<00:01:17.820> could<00:01:18.180> mask<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
front a lot and I think could mask a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.929 
front a lot and I think could mask a
little<00:01:19.020> bit<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> groove<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.159> he<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.790> came

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
little bit of the groove so he just came

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.499 
little bit of the groove so he just came
in<00:01:21.090> i<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.330> out<00:01:21.360> Dave<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.259> your<00:01:22.920> smart<00:01:23.509> phone

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
in i go out Dave like your smart phone

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.630 
in i go out Dave like your smart phone
is<00:01:24.630> he<00:01:24.960> seemed<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.950> much<00:01:26.009> fun<00:01:26.159> with
