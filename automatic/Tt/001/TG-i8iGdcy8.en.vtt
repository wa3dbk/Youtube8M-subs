00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.190 

during<00:00:31.640> this<00:00:31.730> experience<00:00:32.240> one<00:00:32.840> of<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.020> things

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
during this experience one of the things

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.570 
during this experience one of the things
they<00:00:33.350> really<00:00:33.560> learns<00:00:33.920> about<00:00:34.160> was<00:00:34.460> the

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
they really learns about was the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.950 
they really learns about was the
challenges<00:00:35.030> that<00:00:35.060> people<00:00:35.300> would<00:00:35.540> face<00:00:35.750> when

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
challenges that people would face when

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.710 
challenges that people would face when
going<00:00:36.110> to<00:00:36.320> milk<00:00:36.560> we<00:00:37.100> are<00:00:37.160> used<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:37.490> the<00:00:37.670> mac<00:00:38.030> FLL

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
going to milk we are used to the mac FLL

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.140 
going to milk we are used to the mac FLL
and<00:00:38.900> FTC<00:00:39.320> fields<00:00:39.980> but<00:00:40.610> this<00:00:40.670> one<00:00:40.820> was<00:00:40.940> very

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
and FTC fields but this one was very

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.660 
and FTC fields but this one was very
different<00:00:41.810> with<00:00:41.960> many<00:00:42.170> ridges<00:00:42.590> these<00:00:43.490> may

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
different with many ridges these may

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.460 
different with many ridges these may
just<00:00:43.850> have<00:00:43.940> to<00:00:44.090> prototype<00:00:44.630> our<00:00:44.840> robot<00:00:45.170> around

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
just have to prototype our robot around

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.740 
just have to prototype our robot around
it<00:00:45.710> through<00:00:46.100> much<00:00:46.250> trial<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:46.700> error<00:00:46.910> however

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
it through much trial and error however

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.210 
it through much trial and error however
this<00:00:47.900> made<00:00:48.080> me<00:00:48.200> think<00:00:48.230> people<00:00:48.980> were<00:00:49.070> actually

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
this made me think people were actually

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.500 
this made me think people were actually
going<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:49.790> moon<00:00:49.970> don't<00:00:50.150> have<00:00:50.360> these

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
going to moon don't have these

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.299 
going to moon don't have these
advantages<00:00:50.960> they<00:00:51.440> have<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.680> build<00:00:51.860> something

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
advantages they have to build something

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.920 
advantages they have to build something
that<00:00:52.340> they<00:00:52.580> know<00:00:52.820> will<00:00:53.059> work<00:00:53.390> once<00:00:53.660> against

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
that they know will work once against

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.669 
that they know will work once against
their

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
their

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.319 
their
during<00:00:56.679> this<00:00:56.829> one<00:00:57.070> watch<00:00:57.280> times<00:00:57.640> when<00:00:57.969> the<00:00:58.149> v's

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
during this one watch times when the v's

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.060 
during this one watch times when the v's
difficulties<00:00:59.050> were<00:00:59.170> getting<00:00:59.469> over<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.859> ridge

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
difficulties were getting over the ridge

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.490 
difficulties were getting over the ridge
which<00:01:00.820> are<00:01:01.030> using<00:01:01.449> rocker<00:01:01.659> pokies<00:01:02.170> like<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
which are using rocker pokies like the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.429 
which are using rocker pokies like the
Mars<00:01:02.679> rover<00:01:03.390> treads<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.470> big<00:01:06.369> wheels<00:01:07.439> with

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
Mars rover treads and big wheels with

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.469 
Mars rover treads and big wheels with
the<00:01:08.590> big<00:01:08.799> wheels<00:01:09.130> didn't<00:01:09.640> have<00:01:10.119> enough

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
the big wheels didn't have enough

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.510 
the big wheels didn't have enough
traction<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:11.080> get<00:01:11.350> over<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.710> plastic<00:01:12.250> bridge

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
traction to get over the plastic bridge

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
traction to get over the plastic bridge
so

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.459 

another<00:01:20.789> task<00:01:21.060> plan<00:01:21.600> for<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:21.960> being<00:01:22.200> able<00:01:22.409> to

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
another task plan for was being able to

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.080 
another task plan for was being able to
pick<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> element<00:01:23.310> loops<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.850> field

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
pick up the element loops on the field

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.179 
pick up the element loops on the field
we<00:01:24.630> came<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.079> a<00:01:25.109> cloth<00:01:25.499> where<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.069> would

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
we came up with a cloth where it would

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.559 
we came up with a cloth where it would
grab<00:01:26.429> the<00:01:26.460> base<00:01:26.789> of<00:01:26.999> one<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.270> element

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569 
grab the base of one of the element

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.899 
grab the base of one of the element
leaps<00:01:27.719> and<00:01:28.079> throw<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.500> over<00:01:28.740> into<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> basket<00:01:29.280> or

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
leaps and throw it over into a basket or

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.690 
leaps and throw it over into a basket or
a<00:01:29.969> two-prong<00:01:30.840> arm<00:01:31.200> which<00:01:31.829> would<00:01:32.009> ever<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.399> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
a two-prong arm which would ever get to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
a two-prong arm which would ever get to
element<00:01:33.119> loops<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.479> one<00:01:33.630> time<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.649> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
element loops at one time and then the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.529 
element loops at one time and then the
last<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.340> came<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.549> with<00:01:35.850> was<00:01:36.179> a<00:01:36.209> sort<00:01:36.509> of

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
last one we came up with was a sort of

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.719 
last one we came up with was a sort of
bin<00:01:36.899> or<00:01:37.229> dust<00:01:37.590> pan<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.859> be<00:01:38.130> able<00:01:38.219> to<00:01:38.369> scoop<00:01:38.640> them

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
bin or dust pan to be able to scoop them

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.260 
bin or dust pan to be able to scoop them
up<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.479> sort<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.899> an<00:01:40.020> arm<00:01:40.289> guiding<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
up and have sort of an arm guiding it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.910 
up and have sort of an arm guiding it
we<00:01:43.270> found<00:01:43.510> that<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.960> way<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.380> robot<00:01:44.770> was

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
we found that the way the robot was

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.590 
we found that the way the robot was
important<00:01:45.400> because<00:01:45.580> if<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.090> was<00:01:46.210> too<00:01:46.420> heavy

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
important because if it was too heavy

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.360 
important because if it was too heavy
that<00:01:47.200> wouldn't<00:01:47.470> be<00:01:47.530> able<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.830> go<00:01:48.010> over<00:01:48.280> the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
that wouldn't be able to go over the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.080 
that wouldn't be able to go over the
bridge<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:50.320> also<00:01:50.470> had<00:01:50.800> to<00:01:51.010> have<00:01:51.190> senator

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
bridge and we also had to have senator

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.240 
bridge and we also had to have senator
gummy<00:01:52.360> in<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.660> right<00:01:52.870> place<00:01:53.200> otherwise<00:01:53.710> it

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
gummy in the right place otherwise it

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.250 
gummy in the right place otherwise it
would<00:01:54.370> get<00:01:54.550> stuck<00:01:54.850> another<00:01:55.510> thing<00:01:55.840> we<00:01:55.870> found

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
would get stuck another thing we found

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.060 
would get stuck another thing we found
was<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.700> if<00:01:58.210> our<00:01:58.480> arm<00:01:58.780> got<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.890> hobby

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
was that that if our arm got to hobby

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.950 
was that that if our arm got to hobby
was<00:02:00.370> collecting<00:02:00.550> with<00:02:01.150> all<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.420> loops<00:02:01.630> so<00:02:01.840> we

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
was collecting with all the loops so we

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.740 
was collecting with all the loops so we
were<00:02:02.020> collecting<00:02:02.370> then<00:02:03.370> we're<00:02:04.030> gonna<00:02:04.240> lift<00:02:04.540> it

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
were collecting then we're gonna lift it

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.150 
were collecting then we're gonna lift it
so<00:02:05.020> we<00:02:05.080> had<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.320> cure

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.200 

so<00:02:09.160> one<00:02:09.340> engineering<00:02:09.760> approach<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.150> we

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
so one engineering approach that we

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.420 
so one engineering approach that we
decided<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.660> use<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.990> our<00:02:11.080> robot<00:02:11.470> was<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.100> idea

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
decided to use in our robot was the idea

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.360 
decided to use in our robot was the idea
of<00:02:12.670> modular<00:02:13.120> design<00:02:13.500> now<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:14.650> hardware<00:02:15.040> that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
of modular design now in hardware that

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.670 
of modular design now in hardware that
looks<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.790> our<00:02:16.000> robot<00:02:16.390> has<00:02:16.600> been<00:02:16.900> built<00:02:17.440> with

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
looks like our robot has been built with

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.540 
looks like our robot has been built with
one<00:02:17.920> chassis<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:18.550> each<00:02:18.970> arm<00:02:19.690> or<00:02:20.200> each<00:02:20.590> drive

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
one chassis and each arm or each drive

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.880 
one chassis and each arm or each drive
train<00:02:21.910> or<00:02:22.060> each<00:02:22.180> sensor<00:02:22.630> just<00:02:23.440> attaches<00:02:23.860> to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
train or each sensor just attaches to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.490 
train or each sensor just attaches to
that<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.340> software<00:02:25.060> it<00:02:25.930> looks<00:02:26.170> like<00:02:26.350> our

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
that and software it looks like our

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.080 
that and software it looks like our
journey<00:02:26.770> has<00:02:26.920> been<00:02:27.040> split<00:02:27.310> up<00:02:27.340> into<00:02:27.670> five

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
journey has been split up into five

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.630 
journey has been split up into five
different<00:02:28.330> areas<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:28.870> each<00:02:29.470> area<00:02:29.800> has<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
different areas and each area has a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.360 
different areas and each area has a
starting<00:02:31.090> point<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.450> ending<00:02:32.140> point<00:02:32.350> so<00:02:33.190> what

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
starting point and ending point so what

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.830 
starting point and ending point so what
happens<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:33.820> between<00:02:33.910> whether<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.510> completes

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
happens in between whether it completes

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.960 
happens in between whether it completes
the<00:02:34.900> task<00:02:35.050> or<00:02:35.290> not<00:02:35.410> it'll<00:02:35.890> always<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.850> that

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
the task or not it'll always get to that

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.700 
the task or not it'll always get to that
end<00:02:37.180> point<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.960> that<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.260> next<00:02:38.500> part

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
end point and so that the next part

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.770 
end point and so that the next part
starts<00:02:39.400> from<00:02:39.610> where<00:02:39.850> that<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.210> ends<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.630> so

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
starts from where that one ends and so

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.450 
starts from where that one ends and so
it<00:02:40.900> coach<00:02:41.080> makes<00:02:41.380> one<00:02:41.620> big<00:02:41.860> circuit

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.990 

for<00:02:45.420> front<00:02:45.750> wheels<00:02:45.960> use<00:02:46.320> level<00:02:46.800> expert<00:02:47.310> cases

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
for front wheels use level expert cases

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.040 
for front wheels use level expert cases
as<00:02:48.330> balloon<00:02:49.140> tires<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.360> for<00:02:51.360> back<00:02:51.630> powered

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
as balloon tires and for back powered

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.750 
as balloon tires and for back powered
really<00:02:52.440> use<00:02:52.740> treads<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.460> increased

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
really use treads for the increased

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
really use treads for the increased
stability<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.080> traction<00:02:56.180> for<00:02:57.180> navigation

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.410 

we<00:03:15.769> have<00:03:15.890> had<00:03:16.069> robotic<00:03:16.430> missions<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.150> the<00:03:17.180> Moon

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
we have had robotic missions to the Moon

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.240 
we have had robotic missions to the Moon
