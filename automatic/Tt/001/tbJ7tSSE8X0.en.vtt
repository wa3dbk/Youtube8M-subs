hates pigs for some reason and actually

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.889 
hates pigs for some reason and actually
if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.860> hit<00:00:56.039> him<00:00:56.239> and<00:00:57.239> go<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.480> survival<00:00:57.840> mode

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
if you hit him and go in survival mode

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.599

then he'll start kicking you and he does

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
then he'll start kicking you and he does
not<00:00:59.760> like<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.149> when<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.329> hit<00:01:00.480> him<00:01:00.620> which<00:01:01.620> i

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
not like it when you hit him which i

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380 
not like it when you hit him which i
think<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.039> pretty<00:01:02.280> cool<00:01:02.430> cuz<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.180> kind<00:01:03.329> of

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
think is pretty cool cuz it's kind of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.910 
think is pretty cool cuz it's kind of
like<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.539> spider<00:01:03.840> how<00:01:04.140> they<00:01:04.379> they're<00:01:04.739> only

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
like a spider how they they're only

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.730 
like a spider how they they're only
hostile<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:06.090> ever<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.020> hit<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
hostile if they ever if you hit them and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
hostile if they ever if you hit them and
yeah<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> thought<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.210> cool<00:01:09.450> so

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
yeah I thought that was pretty cool so

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.870 
yeah I thought that was pretty cool so
you<00:01:10.500> cannot<00:01:10.710> use<00:01:10.770> pigs<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> distract<00:01:11.700> him

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you cannot use pigs to distract him

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
you cannot use pigs to distract him
unfortunately<00:01:12.720> he<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.290> goes<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.680> rampage

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
unfortunately he just goes on a rampage

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.070 
unfortunately he just goes on a rampage
and<00:01:14.460> as<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> health<00:01:15.630> appears

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and as you can see the health appears

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.990 
and as you can see the health appears
above<00:01:16.350> his<00:01:16.470> head<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> health<00:01:17.700> doesn't

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
above his head but the health doesn't

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700 
above his head but the health doesn't
really<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.360> anything<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.110> thing

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
really do anything it's just a thing

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
really do anything it's just a thing
that<00:01:19.860> pops<00:01:20.040> up<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.400> hit<00:01:20.580> him<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.240> doesn't

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that pops up when you hit him it doesn't

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.730 
that pops up when you hit him it doesn't
really<00:01:21.570> show<00:01:21.689> his<00:01:21.930> health<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.320> don't<00:01:22.380> think

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
really show his health and I don't think

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.520 
really show his health and I don't think
you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.070> kill<00:01:23.400> him<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.450> reason<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:24.990> could

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you can kill him for some reason I could

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.980 
you can kill him for some reason I could
never<00:01:25.850> actually<00:01:26.850> kill<00:01:27.360> him<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.600> never<00:01:27.780> actually

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
never actually kill him I never actually
