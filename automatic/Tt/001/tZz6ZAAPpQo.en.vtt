 this beta 4 is on your device

 you already have a lower beta than aires 7 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.890
 then the beta 1 2 or 3 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.030
 just go to general settings 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.520

 you have ajo s6 you have to follow this mine 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.610
 video tutorial 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.729
 clicking here you can add to the video 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:16.759
 to install ios and 7 beta 4 the iphone 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.360
 cheap is almost certain here is a picture 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.009
 of the fully assembled device 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.200
 later to the smaller version of the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.899
 ipad and ipad mini and the economic version 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.429
 iPhone is now sure that it is then 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.580
 I also want to present the iPhone 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.380
 cheap ie an iphone with 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.869
 less high performance compared 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.479
 to the normal iPhone but with a price 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.840
 obviously inferior and a photo 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.880
 published by the Chinese waigo exhibition site 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.590
 for the first time a picture of this 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.170
 plastic iphone completely 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.660
 assembled and coincided on the cover 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.390
 back the wording design by apple 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.700
 in california and china assemblies 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.720
 without forgetting the logos of the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.610
 certifications including c è e fcc è 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.009
 the last overwhelming proof is that 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.599
 the image does not differ made from 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:07.759
 all other images rumors 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:10.789
 then published in recent weeks 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.980
 finally we can say that at 99.9 for 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.720
 one hundred economic iPhone is reality 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.810
 probably the economic iPhone yes 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.840
 it will call iphone 5 c this indeed 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.250
 image unearthed from a French site 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.280
 shows the numerous plastic casings 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.020
 which are supposed to be the packages in 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.910
 which will come 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.340
 they are not cheap and 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.320
 later obviously sold with 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.470
 on engraved in addition to the apple logo also 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.910
 the acronym iphone 5 c but because it is really 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.100
 the letter c 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.610
 it is not known however precise e 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.090
 considering the iphone 3gs s stood 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.120
 for speed the iphone 4s was going to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.280
 sir the laces of this iphone 5 ci 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.860
 could mean chips ie 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.230
 cheap obviously no apple 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.960
 however confirmed many sources 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.920
 believe this image to be truthful not 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.480
 we just have to wait for official news 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.900
 probably the release date 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.090
 of the iPhone 5 if the iPhone light will be 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.400
 on 6 September 2013 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 according to an accredited source indeed 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.320
 apple should launch its new ones 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.930
 smartphone on Friday 6 September 2013 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.910
 we are talking about the long-awaited iphone 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.280
 5 if inexpensive iphone 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.230
 unfortunately it is not yet certain to 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.570
 one hundred percent that the source from which it is 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.300
 output the news is reliable but the 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.800
 German site to fans claims that this 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.780
 it is serious and reliable 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.400
 the days when apple will enter on 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.860
 market the new smartphones is already 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.330
 fixed day one day in which 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.070
 we will be able to buy the apple product 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.630
 should be set for 6 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.790
 September of 2013 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.340
 the source confirms the presence of two 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.530
 different devices and this is not the case 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.110
 wants to refer to two colors 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.570
 different but just two devices 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.910
 different physicists so that's a lot 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.620
 likely to be iphone 5 if iphone 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.180
 cheap 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.610
 furthermore apple has stated that 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.560
 will release ios 7 during the next 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.060
 autumn and this event has always been 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.690
 crossed with the launch of the new one 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.050
 iphone 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.590
 if the rumor was confirmed 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.750
 marketing on September 6th 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.880
 should be anticipated by 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.130
 official presentation around 28th 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.320
 August 29th therefore the advance respect 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.850
 last year in fact the iPhone 5 is 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.850
 was launched on September 28th 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.790
 of fingerprint sensor will be 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.760
 implemented in the iPhone 5 s 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.240
 probably yes aires shows it 7 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.670
 beta 4 yesterday with the release of ios and 7 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.710
 beta 4 new confirmations come from 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.430
 firmware source code in 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.830
 accessibility options appears in fact 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.720
 biometric kit which some strings of 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.600
 text left in the code as a 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.640
 tutorials for developers say the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.190
 photo of a person holding the 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.419
 his iphone with his left hand or 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.830
 right while touching the home button 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.720
 taking advantage of his fingerprint 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.820
 this is another proof that much 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.669
 probably the fingerprint sensor 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.320
 digital we will see it since the iphone 5s 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.760
 What do you think about it 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.390
 let me know below with a 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.390
 comment
