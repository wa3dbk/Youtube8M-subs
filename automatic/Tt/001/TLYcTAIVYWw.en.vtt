00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
easy when he is am tackled by them which

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.090 
easy when he is am tackled by them which
a<00:00:57.329> bit<00:00:57.899> annoying<00:00:58.109> because<00:00:58.379> I'm<00:00:58.559> we've<00:00:58.980> been

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
a bit annoying because I'm we've been

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.770 
a bit annoying because I'm we've been
having<00:00:59.340> such<00:00:59.460> dreadful<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.000> expect<00:01:00.329> him<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
having such dreadful I expect him to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
having such dreadful I expect him to
battle<00:01:01.079> bit<00:01:01.230> more<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.829> he's<00:01:02.010> running<00:01:02.280> with

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
battle bit more when he's running with

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.740 
battle bit more when he's running with
the<00:01:02.399> ball<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.940> just<00:01:03.149> hold<00:01:03.329> off<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> players

very<00:01:04.049> very<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:04.530> which<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.010> good<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.220> he

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
very very well which is good because he

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.160

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
much like a utility striker and anyway

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.320 
much like a utility striker and anyway
and<00:02:44.440> going<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.250> negatives<00:02:45.670> passing<00:02:46.240> I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
and going on to the negatives passing I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.610 
and going on to the negatives passing I
felt<00:02:46.540> he's<00:02:46.660> passing<00:02:46.870> lay<00:02:47.080> down<00:02:47.320> he<00:02:47.440> won't

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
felt he's passing lay down he won't

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.780 
felt he's passing lay down he won't
really<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:48.010> good<00:02:48.220> for<00:02:48.370> Lincoln<00:02:48.640> play

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
really that good for Lincoln play

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.460 
really that good for Lincoln play
however<00:02:49.270> he<00:02:49.420> was<00:02:49.630> pretty<00:02:49.900> good<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.170> hold<00:02:50.320> a

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
however he was pretty good to hold a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.140 
however he was pretty good to hold a
player<00:02:50.709> but<00:02:51.130> in<00:02:51.280> his<00:02:51.459> past<00:02:51.640> at<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.880> end<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.060> it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
player but in his past at the end of it

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.720 
player but in his past at the end of it
all<00:02:52.209> it<00:02:52.840> wasn't<00:02:53.170> really<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.560> consistently<00:02:54.489> good

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
all it wasn't really a consistently good

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.430 
all it wasn't really a consistently good
and<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.390> balance<00:02:55.630> i<00:02:55.870> did<00:02:56.020> feel<00:02:56.170> like<00:02:56.320> his

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
and the balance i did feel like his

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.080 
and the balance i did feel like his
balance<00:02:56.680> lay<00:02:56.800> him<00:02:56.890> down<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.070> bit<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:57.970> bit

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
balance lay him down a bit it was a bit

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.550 
balance lay him down a bit it was a bit
this<00:02:58.209> point<00:02:58.420> we've<00:02:58.720> been<00:02:58.870> quite<00:02:59.080> strong<00:02:59.350> I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
this point we've been quite strong I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.990 
this point we've been quite strong I
felt<00:02:59.920> his<00:03:00.100> balance<00:03:00.340> would<00:03:00.550> be<00:03:00.580> a<00:03:00.700> bit<00:03:00.850> better

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
felt his balance would be a bit better

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.880 
felt his balance would be a bit better
hold<00:03:01.480> off<00:03:01.630> players<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.959> bit<00:03:02.140> more<00:03:02.320> but<00:03:02.680> they<00:03:02.770> may

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
hold off players a bit more but they may

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.590 
hold off players a bit more but they may
actually<00:03:03.010> got<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.550> fall<00:03:03.790> fairly<00:03:04.390> easily
