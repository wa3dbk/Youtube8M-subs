00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.240 
up there also is the other reason why I
like<00:05:10.270> to<00:05:10.420> use<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.720> green<00:05:10.990> oasis<00:05:11.470> because<00:05:11.710> once

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
like to use the green oasis because once

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.830 
like to use the green oasis because once
that's<00:05:12.550> wheat<00:05:12.910> you<00:05:13.060> can't<00:05:13.300> actually<00:05:13.630> grow

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
that's wheat you can't actually grow

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.610 
that's wheat you can't actually grow
things<00:05:14.140> into<00:05:14.410> it

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
things into it

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.140 
things into it
now<00:05:14.950> if<00:05:15.040> you<00:05:15.130> wanted<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.610> give<00:05:15.730> it<00:05:15.760> just<00:05:15.910> a

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
now if you wanted to give it just a

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.060 
now if you wanted to give it just a
little<00:05:16.180> bit<00:05:16.450> more<00:05:16.780> movement<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:17.680> could<00:05:17.890> bring

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
little bit more movement you could bring

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.220 
little bit more movement you could bring
in<00:05:18.220> something<00:05:18.490> like<00:05:18.820> this<00:05:19.030> willow<00:05:19.360> here<00:05:19.750> but

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
in something like this willow here but

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.410 
in something like this willow here but
be<00:05:20.410> careful<00:05:20.890> with<00:05:21.130> your<00:05:21.280> colors<00:05:21.760> because

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
be careful with your colors because

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.530 
be careful with your colors because
there<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:23.200> can<00:05:23.410> unless<00:05:23.800> I<00:05:24.040> was<00:05:24.670> using<00:05:24.970> say<00:05:25.510> I

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
there that can unless I was using say I

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.380 
there that can unless I was using say I
want<00:05:25.870> to<00:05:25.930> choose<00:05:26.200> this<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:27.190> string<00:05:27.520> here<00:05:27.880> to

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
want to choose this the string here to

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.540 
want to choose this the string here to
tie<00:05:28.660> these<00:05:28.720> like<00:05:29.380> to<00:05:29.560> tie<00:05:29.800> those<00:05:30.010> up<00:05:30.310> into

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
tie these like to tie those up into

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:31.800 
tie these like to tie those up into
there<00:05:30.820> to<00:05:30.850> hold<00:05:31.120> them<00:05:31.330> in<00:05:31.450> place

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
there to hold them in place

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.160 
there to hold them in place
that<00:05:32.620> then<00:05:32.920> would<00:05:33.280> work<00:05:33.520> in<00:05:33.760> with<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.660> willow

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
that then would work in with the willow

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.950 
that then would work in with the willow
if<00:05:35.230> in<00:05:36.160> doubt<00:05:36.220> though<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.180> best<00:05:37.420> way<00:05:37.660> forward

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
if in doubt though the best way forward

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.350 
if in doubt though the best way forward
is<00:05:38.170> to<00:05:38.230> leave<00:05:38.590> it<00:05:38.620> up<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:39.040> hope<00:05:39.790> my<00:05:40.000> friends

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
is to leave it up I hope my friends

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.730 
is to leave it up I hope my friends
given<00:05:40.660> like<00:05:40.840> something<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.230> other<00:05:41.380> thing<00:05:41.620> I'm

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
given like something the other thing I'm

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.170 
given like something the other thing I'm
going<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:42.040> do<00:05:42.160> is<00:05:42.280> because<00:05:42.580> he's<00:05:42.730> got<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:42.910> nice

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
going to do is because he's got a nice

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.110 
going to do is because he's got a nice
of<00:05:43.390> her<00:05:43.540> into<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.440> nice<00:05:44.650> countertop<00:05:45.430> I<00:05:45.669> thought

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
of her into a nice countertop I thought

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.880 
of her into a nice countertop I thought
that<00:05:46.300> I<00:05:46.330> would<00:05:46.570> do<00:05:46.690> something<00:05:46.990> like<00:05:47.169> this

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
that I would do something like this

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.970 
that I would do something like this
at<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.460> base<00:05:48.730> and<00:05:49.330> then<00:05:49.570> maybe<00:05:49.960> I<00:05:50.350> might<00:05:50.740> just

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
at the base and then maybe I might just

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.560 
at the base and then maybe I might just
take<00:05:51.160> one<00:05:51.430> or<00:05:51.550> two<00:05:51.700> of<00:05:51.760> those<00:05:51.880> flowers<00:05:52.210> off<00:05:52.419> and

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
take one or two of those flowers off and

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.790 
take one or two of those flowers off and
they<00:05:53.020> may<00:05:53.230> be<00:05:53.290> glue

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
they may be glue

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.770 
they may be glue
I<00:05:53.830> don't<00:05:54.460> know<00:05:54.639> yet<00:05:54.849> I've<00:05:54.970> got<00:05:55.090> a<00:05:55.120> way<00:05:55.300> to<00:05:55.360> I<00:05:55.509> get

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
I don't know yet I've got a way to I get

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.119
