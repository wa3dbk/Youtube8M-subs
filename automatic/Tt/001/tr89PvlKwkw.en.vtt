this week's ARP quarter-mile quiz comes
from<00:01:49.450> Mike<00:01:49.689> in<00:01:49.899> Mississippi<00:01:50.590> Mike<00:01:51.159> wants<00:01:51.579> to

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
from Mike in Mississippi Mike wants to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.090 
from Mike in Mississippi Mike wants to
know<00:01:51.850> which<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.479> more<00:01:52.689> efficient<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.350> blower<00:01:53.829> or

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
know which is more efficient a blower or

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.280 
know which is more efficient a blower or
a<00:01:54.359> turbocharger

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
a turbocharger

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.690 
a turbocharger
well<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.410> turbos<00:01:58.770> definitely<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.340> got<00:01:59.520> you

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
well the turbos definitely you got you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.160 
well the turbos definitely you got you
can<00:01:59.820> control<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> boost<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.690> because<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
can control the boost more because you

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.930 
can control the boost more because you
shut<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.590> wastegate<00:02:01.920> off<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.550> they<00:02:02.670> got<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
shut the wastegate off and they got to

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.570 
shut the wastegate off and they got to
get<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> handle<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.750> goes<00:02:03.990> that's<00:02:04.230> I<00:02:04.620> mean

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
get a handle on that goes that's I mean

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.310 
get a handle on that goes that's I mean
these<00:02:05.730> cars<00:02:05.970> that's<00:02:06.480> that's<00:02:06.840> why<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.140> run

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
these cars that's that's why they run

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
these cars that's that's why they run
into<00:02:07.470> 55<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.220> 60<00:02:08.610> down<00:02:08.789> there<00:02:08.970> once<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:09.330> get

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
into 55 or 60 down there once they get

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.650 
into 55 or 60 down there once they get
the<00:02:09.720> sauce<00:02:09.960> set<00:02:10.649> will<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.190> okay<00:02:11.550> but<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:12.600> know

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
the sauce set will be okay but you know

cranberry where this idea come from

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.630 
cranberry where this idea come from
well<00:02:43.260> basically<00:02:43.680> time<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.040> what<00:02:44.160> we<00:02:44.250> did<00:02:44.400> was

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
well basically time with what we did was

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.640 
well basically time with what we did was
we<00:02:44.670> wanted<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.270> black<00:02:45.600> coating<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.500> it's

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
we wanted a black coating because it's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.620 
we wanted a black coating because it's
kind<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.920> cool-looking<00:02:47.250> but<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.360> wanted

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
kind of cool-looking but we wanted

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.310 
kind of cool-looking but we wanted
something<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.900> was<00:02:49.050> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> be

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
something that was going to be

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.760 
something that was going to be
functional<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.070> we<00:02:50.910> charged<00:02:51.540> them<00:02:51.780> at<00:02:52.080> nitro

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
functional so we charged them at nitro

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.290 
functional so we charged them at nitro
plate<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.310> come<00:02:53.520> up<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.820> coating<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.239> I

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
plate to come up with a coating that I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.060 
plate to come up with a coating that I
had<00:02:54.420> actually<00:02:54.600> functional<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.680> what<00:02:55.830> we<00:02:55.920> did

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
had actually functional and what we did

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.760 
had actually functional and what we did
was<00:02:56.160> we<00:02:56.220> actually<00:02:57.180> reduced<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.690> heat<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
was we actually reduced the heat of the

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.410 
was we actually reduced the heat of the
fuel<00:02:59.010> by<00:02:59.220> six<00:02:59.489> percent<00:02:59.640> by<00:03:00.000> using<00:03:00.209> this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
fuel by six percent by using this

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.789 
fuel by six percent by using this
coating<00:03:00.750> which<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.019> pretty<00:03:01.260> big<00:03:01.440> deal<00:03:01.590> today

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
coating which is a pretty big deal today

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.340 
coating which is a pretty big deal today
especially<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.700> new<00:03:02.970> fuels<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.570> all

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
especially with the new fuels and all

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.350 
especially with the new fuels and all
the<00:03:04.500> alcohols<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.010> are<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> fuels<00:03:05.610> yeah

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the alcohols that are in the fuels yeah

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.270 
the alcohols that are in the fuels yeah
I<00:03:06.390> mean<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:07.110> love<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.709> look<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.130> black

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
I mean I love the look of the black

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.370 
I mean I love the look of the black
carburetor<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.209> it<00:03:09.360> isn't<00:03:09.600> always<00:03:09.840> doesn't
