00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:40.980 

okay<00:00:19.530> well<00:00:19.740> put<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.920> into<00:00:20.250> altitude<00:00:20.430> holes

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:51.020 

hey<00:00:41.590> now<00:00:41.860> it's<00:00:42.070> an<00:00:42.160> altitude<00:00:42.490> hold

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.100 

that's<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.210> sonar<00:00:52.690> on<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:53.110> snow<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.840> still

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
that's the sonar on the snow but still

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.290 
that's the sonar on the snow but still
works<00:00:56.410> not<00:00:56.980> as<00:00:57.010> good<00:00:57.340> as<00:00:57.490> if<00:00:57.670> it's<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.910> hot<00:00:58.090> a

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
works not as good as if it's a hot a

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:36.340 
works not as good as if it's a hot a
real<00:00:58.510> hard<00:00:58.750> surface<00:00:59.260> but<00:00:59.470> it<00:00:59.590> works

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.600 

hunting<00:01:37.350> around<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:37.920> bit<00:01:38.130> i'm<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.550> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
hunting around a little bit i'm going to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
hunting around a little bit i'm going to
have<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.910> a<00:01:38.940> little<00:01:39.150> bit<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.330> fine-tuning

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
have to do a little bit of fine-tuning

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.850 
have to do a little bit of fine-tuning
on<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.410> guess<00:01:42.320> okay<00:01:43.320> let's<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:43.680> do<00:01:43.830> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
on it I guess okay let's just do a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.780 
on it I guess okay let's just do a
little<00:01:44.570> flying<00:01:45.570> around<00:01:46.020> here<00:01:46.580> it's<00:01:47.580> very

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
little flying around here it's very

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.120 
little flying around here it's very
docile<00:01:48.410> slow-moving<00:01:51.920> actually<00:01:52.920> pretty

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
docile slow-moving actually pretty

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
docile slow-moving actually pretty
pretty<00:01:53.550> darn<00:01:53.820> easy<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.240> fly

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:36.730 

should<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.530> nice<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.770> smooth<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.399> fpv<00:02:05.819> fly

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:03:30.180 

nice<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.610> stable

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.830 

yeah<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.940> should<00:03:31.120> be<00:03:31.150> good<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.450> fpv<00:03:33.840> pretty

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
yeah it should be good for fpv pretty

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.160 
yeah it should be good for fpv pretty
darn<00:03:35.640> stable<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:36.790> slow<00:03:37.540> I<00:03:39.750> can<00:03:40.750> use<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:41.050> other

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
darn stable and slow I can use the other

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.930 
darn stable and slow I can use the other
one<00:03:41.410> when<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.650> want<00:03:41.890> to<00:03:41.980> go<00:03:42.100> fast<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.790> really

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
one when I want to go fast and really

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.280 
one when I want to go fast and really
boot<00:03:43.270> on<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:45.210> set<00:03:46.210> this<00:03:46.360> one<00:03:46.570> up<00:03:46.630> it's<00:03:47.020> flying

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
boot on it I set this one up it's flying

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.470 
boot on it I set this one up it's flying
on<00:03:47.470> 3s<00:03:47.980> right<00:03:48.220> now<00:03:48.400> but<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.640> set<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.000> up<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.330> it'll

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
on 3s right now but I set it up so it'll

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:57.750 
on 3s right now but I set it up so it'll
fly<00:03:49.690> on<00:03:49.900> 4s<00:03:50.350> as<00:03:50.590> well<00:03:55.920> it's<00:03:56.920> got<00:03:57.130> it's<00:03:57.520> got

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
fly on 4s as well it's got it's got

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.430 
fly on 4s as well it's got it's got
plenty<00:03:57.940> of<00:03:58.120> power<00:03:58.240> with<00:03:58.690> 3s<00:03:59.610> that's<00:04:00.610> for<00:04:00.790> sure

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
plenty of power with 3s that's for sure

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.990 
plenty of power with 3s that's for sure
but<00:04:02.440> it's

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.910 

definitely<00:04:08.840> got<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:08.990> little<00:04:09.110> more<00:04:09.350> punch<00:04:09.650> with

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
definitely got a little more punch with

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.500 
definitely got a little more punch with
the<00:04:10.550> 4s<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.240> got<00:04:11.720> some<00:04:11.930> for<00:04:13.060> rs.5000<00:04:14.060> milliamp

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
the 4s I got some for rs.5000 milliamp

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.650 
the 4s I got some for rs.5000 milliamp
packs<00:04:15.140> that<00:04:15.380> I<00:04:15.530> use<00:04:15.770> in<00:04:16.640> my<00:04:16.700> Skywalker<00:04:17.359> and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
packs that I use in my Skywalker and

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.330 
packs that I use in my Skywalker and
stuff<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.200> I<00:04:18.970> was<00:04:19.970> kind<00:04:20.120> of<00:04:20.239> hoping<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:21.340> for

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
stuff so I was kind of hoping that for

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.180 
stuff so I was kind of hoping that for
some<00:04:22.520> more<00:04:22.790> long-range<00:04:23.450> flying<00:04:24.230> I<00:04:24.500> can<00:04:24.710> put

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
some more long-range flying I can put

00:04:25.190 --> 00:05:09.760 
some more long-range flying I can put
them<00:04:25.280> in<00:04:25.400> this

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.170 

just<00:05:10.770> power<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.100> up<00:05:11.250> from<00:05:11.430> this<00:05:11.550> angle<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:12.030> see

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
just power it up from this angle and see

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.670 
just power it up from this angle and see
what<00:05:12.300> happens<00:05:12.660> oh<00:05:13.520> forgot<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.670> disarms<00:05:15.620> see<00:05:16.620> if

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
what happens oh forgot it disarms see if

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:27.820 
what happens oh forgot it disarms see if
we<00:05:16.770> can<00:05:16.920> arm<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.310> here

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:37.790 

no<00:05:28.830> problem

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.710 

again<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:38.830> don't<00:05:38.980> have<00:05:39.250> a<00:05:39.280> voltage<00:05:39.970> alarm<00:05:40.540> on

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
again I don't have a voltage alarm on

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.230 
again I don't have a voltage alarm on
this<00:05:40.900> yet<00:05:41.170> so<00:05:41.200> i<00:05:41.800> just<00:05:42.580> got<00:05:42.790> to<00:05:42.880> keep<00:05:42.970> an<00:05:43.120> eye<00:05:43.210> on

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
this yet so i just got to keep an eye on

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.180 
this yet so i just got to keep an eye on
my<00:05:43.480> batteries<00:05:45.330> don't<00:05:46.330> want<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:47.160> smoke<00:05:48.160> a

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
my batteries don't want to smoke a

00:05:48.190 --> 00:06:02.470 
my batteries don't want to smoke a
battery

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.540 

you
