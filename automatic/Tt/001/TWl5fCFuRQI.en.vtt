rails so in this how-to will show you
how<00:00:24.860> to<00:00:24.919> do<00:00:25.099> the<00:00:25.220> overdub<00:00:25.580> on<00:00:25.849> a<00:00:25.880> square<00:00:26.270> rail

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
how to do the overdub on a square rail

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.900 
how to do the overdub on a square rail
and<00:00:26.810> a<00:00:26.990> round<00:00:27.200> rail<00:00:27.410> personally<00:00:28.340> I<00:00:28.400> like<00:00:28.669> round

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
and a round rail personally I like round

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.909 
and a round rail personally I like round
rails<00:00:29.270> for<00:00:29.570> everything<00:00:30.050> way<00:00:30.230> more<00:00:30.500> I<00:00:30.529> feel

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
rails for everything way more I feel

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.139 
rails for everything way more I feel
like<00:00:31.040> when<00:00:31.279> you're<00:00:31.430> grinding<00:00:31.610> on<00:00:31.849> a<00:00:31.880> round

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
like when you're grinding on a round

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.240 
like when you're grinding on a round
rail<00:00:32.360> it's<00:00:32.870> easier<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.350> balance<00:00:33.470> side<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.040> side

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
rail it's easier to balance side to side

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.639 
rail it's easier to balance side to side
you<00:00:34.910> can<00:00:35.090> land<00:00:35.270> on<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:35.570> rail<00:00:35.719> more<00:00:36.170> leaned<00:00:36.410> in

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:36.649 
you can land on the rail more leaned in

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.380 
you can land on the rail more leaned in
and<00:00:36.680> whatnot<00:00:37.040> unlike<00:00:37.969> when<00:00:38.149> you're<00:00:38.270> on<00:00:38.360> a

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
and whatnot unlike when you're on a

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.450 
and whatnot unlike when you're on a
square<00:00:38.750> rail<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:39.500> land<00:00:39.710> two<00:00:39.950> leaned<00:00:40.190> in

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
square rail and you land two leaned in

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.700 
square rail and you land two leaned in
you're<00:00:41.390> basically<00:00:41.809> grinding<00:00:42.230> on<00:00:42.350> one<00:00:42.559> little

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
you're basically grinding on one little

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.110 
you're basically grinding on one little
corner<00:00:43.040> of<00:00:43.070> your<00:00:43.219> peg<00:00:43.460> because<00:00:43.610> the<00:00:43.969> whole

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
corner of your peg because the whole

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.880 
corner of your peg because the whole
rail<00:00:44.329> is<00:00:44.570> lifting<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.020> up<00:00:45.050> on<00:00:45.290> one<00:00:45.500> side<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.770> I

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
rail is lifting you up on one side and I

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.020 
rail is lifting you up on one side and I
just<00:00:45.920> don't<00:00:46.220> like<00:00:46.280> how<00:00:46.460> that<00:00:46.520> feels

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
just don't like how that feels

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.000 
just don't like how that feels
so<00:00:47.480> for<00:00:47.660> me<00:00:47.750> my<00:00:47.960> natural<00:00:48.350> grind<00:00:48.560> side<00:00:48.800> is<00:00:48.920> the

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
so for me my natural grind side is the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.310 
so for me my natural grind side is the
right<00:00:49.190> side<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:50.390> do<00:00:50.510> the<00:00:50.630> over<00:00:50.870> double<00:00:51.140> peg

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
right side so to do the over double peg

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.710 
right side so to do the over double peg
we're<00:00:51.650> gonna<00:00:51.740> approach<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.280> rail<00:00:52.430> from<00:00:52.760> the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
we're gonna approach the rail from the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.840 
we're gonna approach the rail from the
left<00:00:53.960> side<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.440> hop<00:00:54.680> over<00:00:55.040> to<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.430> right<00:00:55.579> side

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
left side and hop over to the right side

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.120 
left side and hop over to the right side
a<00:00:56.150> good<00:00:56.810> way<00:00:56.900> to<00:00:56.960> practice<00:00:57.200> over<00:00:57.620> double<00:00:57.980> peg

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
a good way to practice over double peg

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.650 
a good way to practice over double peg
round<00:00:58.250> feeling<00:00:58.730> without<00:00:58.850> actually<00:00:59.270> doing<00:00:59.480> the

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
round feeling without actually doing the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.990 
round feeling without actually doing the
over<00:00:59.870> double<00:01:00.140> peg<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.590> find<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.550> little<00:01:01.700> flat

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
over double peg is find a little flat

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.210 
over double peg is find a little flat
bar<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.630> just<00:01:03.050> plenty<00:01:03.290> hop<00:01:03.530> over<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.009> rail

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
bar and just plenty hop over the rail

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.490 
bar and just plenty hop over the rail
while<00:01:04.640> riding<00:01:04.939> parallel<00:01:05.509> to<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.899> and<00:01:06.290> try<00:01:06.439> to

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
while riding parallel to it and try to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.380 
while riding parallel to it and try to
hop<00:01:06.740> straight<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:07.399> land<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:07.909> know<00:01:08.000> straight

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
hop straight and land you know straight

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.240 
hop straight and land you know straight
next<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:08.869> rail<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:09.740> can<00:01:09.799> kind<00:01:10.070> of<00:01:10.100> get

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
next to the rail so you can kind of get

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.249 
next to the rail so you can kind of get
that<00:01:10.369> feeling<00:01:10.610> of<00:01:10.880> where<00:01:11.090> you're<00:01:11.270> landing<00:01:11.479> and

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
that feeling of where you're landing and

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.359 
that feeling of where you're landing and
you<00:01:12.320> know<00:01:12.409> once<00:01:12.649> you're<00:01:12.799> landing<00:01:13.009> in<00:01:13.250> that

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
you know once you're landing in that

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.069 
you know once you're landing in that
same<00:01:13.640> spot<00:01:14.000> every<00:01:14.270> single<00:01:14.420> time<00:01:14.750> you<00:01:14.780> can<00:01:15.049> just

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
same spot every single time you can just

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.050 
same spot every single time you can just
compensate<00:01:15.680> for<00:01:15.920> your<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:16.790> know<00:01:16.880> your

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
compensate for your you know your

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.520 
compensate for your you know your
bunnyhop<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:17.689> move<00:01:17.840> a<00:01:17.869> little<00:01:17.929> bit<00:01:18.170> over<00:01:18.380> to

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
bunnyhop and move a little bit over to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.620 
bunnyhop and move a little bit over to
the<00:01:18.619> side<00:01:18.829> or<00:01:19.069> does<00:01:19.189> not<00:01:19.340> have<00:01:19.520> this<00:01:19.670> far<00:01:19.939> but

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
the side or does not have this far but

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.239 
the side or does not have this far but
yeah<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:20.960> want<00:01:21.139> to<00:01:21.289> want<00:01:21.799> to<00:01:21.889> approach

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:22.249 
yeah you just want to want to approach

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.669 
yeah you just want to want to approach
the<00:01:22.399> rail<00:01:22.520> going<00:01:22.789> go<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.659> medium<00:01:24.049> speed<00:01:24.200> you're

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
the rail going go to medium speed you're

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.889 
the rail going go to medium speed you're
gonna<00:01:24.770> want<00:01:25.009> to<00:01:25.069> hop<00:01:25.280> bunny<00:01:26.179> hop<00:01:26.420> and<00:01:26.450> kind<00:01:26.780> of

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
gonna want to hop bunny hop and kind of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.230 
gonna want to hop bunny hop and kind of
when<00:01:27.170> I<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.319> it<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.619> bunny<00:01:27.829> hop<00:01:28.069> kind<00:01:28.850> of<00:01:29.030> going

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
when I do it I bunny hop kind of going

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.270 
when I do it I bunny hop kind of going
straight<00:01:29.479> alongside<00:01:29.869> with<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.499> rail<00:01:30.679> and

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
straight alongside with the rail and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.370 
straight alongside with the rail and
just<00:01:31.459> wiggle<00:01:31.670> my<00:01:31.969> bike<00:01:32.179> in<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.689> air<00:01:32.719> just<00:01:33.229> so

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
just wiggle my bike in the air just so

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.050 
just wiggle my bike in the air just so
you<00:01:33.439> don't<00:01:33.649> over<00:01:33.889> compensate<00:01:34.429> for<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.850> rail

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
you don't over compensate for the rail

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.599 
you don't over compensate for the rail
most<00:01:35.810> times<00:01:36.049> I<00:01:36.229> see<00:01:36.469> when<00:01:36.679> someone<00:01:37.009> misses<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
most times I see when someone misses the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
going to the over double peg at an angle

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.510 
going to the over double peg at an angle
that<00:01:42.469> they<00:01:42.590> don't<00:01:42.770> need<00:01:42.859> to<00:01:42.979> be<00:01:43.069> going<00:01:43.369> at

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
want to be leaned too far out to the

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.410 
want to be leaned too far out to the
side<00:02:04.279> that<00:02:04.639> you're<00:02:04.759> grinding<00:02:05.149> on<00:02:05.270> you're

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
side that you're grinding on you're

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.670 
side that you're grinding on you're
gonna

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
gonna

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.560 
gonna
want<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:05.860> be<00:02:05.950> leaned<00:02:06.190> over<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.090> side<00:02:07.300> just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
want to be leaned over to the side just

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.510 
want to be leaned over to the side just
so<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:08.229> case<00:02:08.470> you<00:02:08.619> do<00:02:08.800> lose<00:02:09.009> your<00:02:09.160> balance<00:02:09.280> you

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
so in case you do lose your balance you

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.370 
so in case you do lose your balance you
just<00:02:09.759> hop<00:02:09.880> over<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.210> the<00:02:10.360> same<00:02:10.660> side<00:02:10.690> and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
just hop over to the same side and

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.690 
just hop over to the same side and
that's<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:11.890> good<00:02:12.010> way<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.220> get<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.490> feel

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
that's a really good way to get the feel

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.620 
that's a really good way to get the feel
for<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.970> because<00:02:13.180> you're<00:02:13.300> probably<00:02:13.390> gonna

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
for it because you're probably gonna

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.080 
for it because you're probably gonna
jump<00:02:13.900> off<00:02:14.080> at<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.290> few<00:02:14.470> times<00:02:14.730> once<00:02:15.730> you're<00:02:15.880> set

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
jump off at a few times once you're set

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.460 
jump off at a few times once you're set
in<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.270> position<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.900> second<00:02:17.320> it

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
in that position for a second it

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.660 
in that position for a second it
basically<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.160> same<00:02:18.370> as<00:02:18.550> another

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
basically just the same as another

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.700 
basically just the same as another
regular<00:02:19.240> double<00:02:19.540> peg<00:02:19.690> grind<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.230> pricee<00:02:20.470> in

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
regular double peg grind the pricee in

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.840 
regular double peg grind the pricee in
the<00:02:20.830> photo<00:02:21.040> are<00:02:21.190> some<00:02:21.340> of<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.490> frames<00:02:21.730> that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
the photo are some of the frames that

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.090 
the photo are some of the frames that
I'm<00:02:22.510> doing<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.320> do<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.620> over<00:02:23.860> double

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
I'm doing it and I do the over double

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.500 
I'm doing it and I do the over double
peg<00:02:24.310> but<00:02:24.520> my<00:02:24.640> body<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.000> still<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.300> little<00:02:25.420> bit

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
peg but my body is still a little bit

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
peg but my body is still a little bit
leaned<00:02:25.810> over<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.320> other<00:02:26.470> side

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
leaned over to the other side

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.650 
leaned over to the other side
and<00:02:27.130> that's<00:02:27.550> kind<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.880> what<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.030> use<00:02:28.240> for<00:02:28.510> you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
and that's kind of what I use for you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.150 
and that's kind of what I use for you
know<00:02:28.750> that<00:02:28.959> little<00:02:29.170> bit<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.440> overcompensation

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
know that little bit of overcompensation

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.740 
know that little bit of overcompensation
to<00:02:30.400> keep<00:02:30.580> your<00:02:30.700> body<00:02:30.880> centered<00:02:31.180> on<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.600> rail

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
to keep your body centered on the rail

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.090 
to keep your body centered on the rail
so<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:31.990> can<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.470> down<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.709> you're<00:02:33.070> not

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
falling off to your other side too fast

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.710 
falling off to your other side too fast
gorgeous<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.850> don't<00:02:37.000> want<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.240> do<00:02:37.330> that<00:02:37.480> too

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
gorgeous you don't want to do that too

gorgeous you don't want to do that too
far<00:02:37.959> either<00:02:38.170> cuz<00:02:38.500> you'll<00:02:38.650> just<00:02:38.830> hop<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.130> the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
far either cuz you'll just hop on the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.290 
far either cuz you'll just hop on the
over<00:02:39.430> double<00:02:39.700> pegging<00:02:40.000> you'll<00:02:40.180> immediately

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
over double pegging you'll immediately

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.840 
over double pegging you'll immediately
jump<00:02:40.750> back<00:02:40.900> off<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.290> other<00:02:41.470> side<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.670> once

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
jump back off to the other side so once

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.340 
jump back off to the other side so once
you<00:02:42.940> initially<00:02:43.360> learn<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.720> over<00:02:43.930> double<00:02:44.200> peg

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
you initially learn the over double peg

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.860 
you initially learn the over double peg
ride<00:02:44.560> on<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.739> flat<00:02:45.010> bar<00:02:45.280> you<00:02:45.940> can<00:02:46.120> go<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.750> do<00:02:46.840> it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
ride on a flat bar you can go and do it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.080 
ride on a flat bar you can go and do it
down<00:02:47.080> rails<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.650> stuff<00:02:47.890> like<00:02:48.070> that<00:02:48.280> too<00:02:48.489> for

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
down rails and stuff like that too for

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.610 
down rails and stuff like that too for
me<00:02:49.180> personally<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.750> think<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.170> feels<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.530> little

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
me personally I think it feels a little

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.040 
me personally I think it feels a little
bit<00:02:50.800> better<00:02:50.950> doing<00:02:51.820> over<00:02:52.120> grinds<00:02:52.330> down<00:02:52.690> rails

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
bit better doing over grinds down rails

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.930 
bit better doing over grinds down rails
because<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.530> can<00:02:53.680> actually<00:02:53.950> dive<00:02:54.250> into<00:02:54.640> the

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
because you can actually dive into the

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.060 
because you can actually dive into the
trick<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.450> look<00:02:56.110> at<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> trick<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.680> analyze

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
trick and look at the trick and analyze

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.530 
trick and look at the trick and analyze
it<00:02:57.250> a<00:02:57.310> little<00:02:57.459> bit<00:02:57.610> more<00:02:57.790> while<00:02:58.060> you're<00:02:58.180> doing

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
it a little bit more while you're doing

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.090 
it a little bit more while you're doing
it<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:59.020> see<00:02:59.200> where<00:02:59.320> your<00:02:59.500> bike<00:02:59.680> is<00:02:59.860> more

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
it you can see where your bike is more

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.610 
it you can see where your bike is more
you<00:03:00.640> can<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:00.970> where<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.239> rails<00:03:01.480> at<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.410> rail

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
you can see where the rails at the rail

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.199 
you can see where the rails at the rail
goes<00:03:02.890> down<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.340> you're<00:03:03.459> still<00:03:03.670> bunny<00:03:03.850> popping

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
goes down and you're still bunny popping

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.570 
goes down and you're still bunny popping
straight<00:03:04.570> out<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.410> you<00:03:05.470> know<00:03:05.739> by<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.220> time<00:03:06.459> you

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
straight out so you know by the time you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.070 
straight out so you know by the time you
get<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.790> stair<00:03:07.060> number<00:03:07.360> two<00:03:07.570> or<00:03:07.690> three<00:03:07.720> down

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
get the stair number two or three down

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080 
get the stair number two or three down
you're<00:03:08.320> basically<00:03:08.739> level<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.340> rail<00:03:09.550> and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
you're basically level with the rail and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.850 
you're basically level with the rail and
it's<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> same<00:03:10.690> as<00:03:10.840> doing<00:03:11.110> it<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.350> a<00:03:11.380> flat<00:03:11.650> rail

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
it's the same as doing it on a flat rail

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.080 
it's the same as doing it on a flat rail
you<00:03:12.010> don't<00:03:12.160> really<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.549> bunnyhop<00:03:12.910> that

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
you don't really have to bunnyhop that

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.120 
you don't really have to bunnyhop that
high<00:03:13.239> or<00:03:13.299> anything<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.320> just<00:03:14.560> land<00:03:14.799> in<00:03:14.980> it

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
high or anything and you just land in it

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.160 
high or anything and you just land in it
but<00:03:15.280> you're<00:03:15.400> diving<00:03:15.640> too<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.330> you<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:16.870> aim

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
but you're diving too so you can aim

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.840 
but you're diving too so you can aim
that<00:03:17.350> front<00:03:17.650> peg<00:03:17.830> harder<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.280> kind<00:03:18.459> of<00:03:18.549> pin<00:03:18.730> it

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
that front peg harder and kind of pin it

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.949 
that front peg harder and kind of pin it
and<00:03:19.000> harder<00:03:19.360> like<00:03:19.510> when<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:19.690> were<00:03:19.780> talking

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
and harder like when we were talking

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.140 
and harder like when we were talking
about<00:03:20.140> being<00:03:21.040> leaned<00:03:21.280> over<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.640> little<00:03:21.910> bit<00:03:22.030> but

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
about being leaned over a little bit but

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.910 
about being leaned over a little bit but
still<00:03:22.239> going<00:03:22.570> down<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.140> just<00:03:23.350> it's<00:03:23.650> just<00:03:23.739> a

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
still going down it just it's just a

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.680 
still going down it just it's just a
little<00:03:24.130> bit<00:03:24.250> better<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.640> feeling<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.510> one<00:03:25.660> of

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
little bit better of a feeling so one of

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.330 
little bit better of a feeling so one of
the<00:03:25.810> main<00:03:25.989> scary<00:03:26.350> parts<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.920> over<00:03:27.100> double

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the main scary parts of the over double

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.620 
the main scary parts of the over double
peg<00:03:27.519> round<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.760> actually<00:03:28.060> getting<00:03:28.239> your<00:03:28.480> back

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
peg round is actually getting your back

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.140 
peg round is actually getting your back
peg<00:03:28.870> onto<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.350> rail<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.850> mean<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.060> way

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
peg onto the rail I mean it's a way

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.640 
peg onto the rail I mean it's a way
easier<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.570> see<00:03:31.720> your<00:03:31.840> front<00:03:32.019> peg<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.530> can

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
easier to see your front peg so you can

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.520 
easier to see your front peg so you can
usually<00:03:32.769> get<00:03:33.070> that<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.430> but<00:03:33.700> some<00:03:33.940> people

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
usually get that on but some people

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.330 
usually get that on but some people
overcompensate<00:03:35.530> even<00:03:35.769> me<00:03:35.890> once<00:03:36.070> in<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> while

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
overcompensate even me once in a while

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.440 
overcompensate even me once in a while
and<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.670> know<00:03:36.790> you'll<00:03:36.970> get<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.120> little<00:03:37.360> too

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
and you know you'll get a little too

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.759 
and you know you'll get a little too
kicked<00:03:37.690> out<00:03:37.840> in<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:37.989> back<00:03:38.170> and<00:03:38.320> your<00:03:38.410> backpack

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
kicked out in the back and your backpack

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.710 
kicked out in the back and your backpack
I'll<00:03:38.920> miss<00:03:39.070> it<00:03:39.100> once<00:03:39.820> in<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.000> while<00:03:40.150> I<00:03:40.180> can<00:03:40.480> make

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
I'll miss it once in a while I can make

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.960 
I'll miss it once in a while I can make
a<00:03:40.750> mistake<00:03:41.110> doing<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.440> over<00:03:41.650> grind<00:03:41.860> like<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.910> do

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
a mistake doing the over grind like I do

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.020 
a mistake doing the over grind like I do
in<00:03:43.209> here<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:44.709> know<00:03:44.799> landing<00:03:45.220> like<00:03:45.400> over<00:03:45.730> Smith

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
in here you know landing like over Smith

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.850 
in here you know landing like over Smith
or<00:03:46.209> something<00:03:46.570> your<00:03:46.720> peg<00:03:46.900> doesn't<00:03:47.230> get<00:03:47.380> all

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
or something your peg doesn't get all

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.930 
or something your peg doesn't get all
the<00:03:48.040> way<00:03:48.160> over<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.459> personally<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:48.910> think

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the way over and personally I think

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.340 
the way over and personally I think
that's<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.360> little<00:03:49.450> bit<00:03:49.570> better<00:03:49.810> than<00:03:49.989> actually

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
that's a little bit better than actually

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.259 
that's a little bit better than actually
missing<00:03:50.680> your<00:03:50.799> back<00:03:50.920> peg<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.670> long<00:03:51.880> as<00:03:52.030> you

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
missing your back peg as long as you

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:53.580 
missing your back peg as long as you
know<00:03:52.390> you're<00:03:52.570> comfortable<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.200> landing<00:03:53.500> on

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
know you're comfortable and landing on

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.050 
know you're comfortable and landing on
the<00:03:53.709> rail<00:03:53.890> or<00:03:53.920> whatever<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.549> can<00:03:54.670> just<00:03:54.820> jump

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
the rail or whatever you can just jump

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.030 
the rail or whatever you can just jump
out<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.480> or<00:03:55.660> ride<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.989> out<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.440> know<00:03:56.560> and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
out of it or ride it out you know and

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.740 
out of it or ride it out you know and
it's<00:03:57.310> not<00:03:57.459> that<00:03:57.579> big<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:57.880> a<00:03:57.940> deal<00:03:58.150> but<00:03:58.540> once<00:03:58.660> you

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
it's not that big of a deal but once you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.360 
it's not that big of a deal but once you
learn<00:03:58.870> over<00:03:59.200> double<00:03:59.440> peg<00:03:59.590> grinds<00:03:59.829> opens<00:04:00.160> up<00:04:00.280> a
