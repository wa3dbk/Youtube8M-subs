00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.639
 Californian valleys today I cook and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.639
 just as they say along the way I want 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.710
 show you your new gadgets 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.330

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.960

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.500
 it means telling this thing to me 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.099
 advised one of my followers 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.779
 thank you very much a very handy thing 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.619
 honestly tracy 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 but the judge says don't shake yes sorry 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.059
 to be honest here now i'm together well how 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.190
 I said so very convenient thing but I am 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.980
 I saw that it seemed like one was comfortable 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.590
 but in fact I have never had it yet 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.620
 I have not tried and now with you 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.309
 we will try it like this for 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.370
 avocado 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.199
 but this thing is generally super duper I 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 madly pretty too 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.370
 also saw in one store in 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.920
 doroguschy as he was called something there 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.620
 there forces something there I will not lie about anything 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.199
 I will not tell you why in the store with us 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.720
 on el paso here it cost 15 dollars 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
 we can have a look i'm talking about i want 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.979
 such it burns we are good my God I tell you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.740
 On Amazon I will order we ordered it on 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.250
 amazon for 4 dollars with what 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.369
 I came here such here and now I have more 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.380
 I will show this little one in 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.080
 There are two of these here 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.990
 things came 1 for lemon one 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.229
 small apparently for lime for 4 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 dollar and so let's start with 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.170
 avocado no let's start with lemon 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.770
 because we just need a lemon 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.409
 will be right away and so what we do is I cut off 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.920
 with a little lemon here and so on daddy 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.990
 i will tell you so let me stand 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.610
 like that you live so little 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.860
 and now I'm here, this is screwed into the spread and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:05.070
 spray turns it screwed into a lemon 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:10.380
 just like that I take and twist 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.270
 but see everything here when I saw mine 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.040
 says yes say you think she will 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.070
 splash I say I 'm sure it will 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.060
 splatter I'll show you how fast it is 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.950
 I have already tried 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.730
 now now we try our gadget for 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.730
 avocado 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.570
 cut avocados here so I share 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.459
 I think that this one here is this thing for 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.390
 I don't know the bones I don't want it now 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.790
 spoil because I don't want to now 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.610
 spoil because i need beautiful 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.760
 I will try some pieces of poison later 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.670
 and say take out the usual way 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.680
 bone checked already as they say 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:01.170
 up the way and now what can i 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.410
 now we take this spatula well 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:13.370
 apparently like this and 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.370
 oh piece stayed 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.900
 it turned out not and 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.410
 Well, in general, then nothing happened 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.820
 warmed up see not very beautiful 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.780
 I probably just too much 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:34.620
 ripe avocado or I just need a hand 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.910
 let's try to stuff one more because 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.840
 that i don't care how 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.840
 but more so now I will clean it 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:52.380
 say how much this I honestly do not 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:54.120
 I remember how much it cost 1 time I 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.070
 probably doing something wrong 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.840
 so probably it was necessary to squeeze it 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.910
 just yes maybe something all guys 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.570
 In short, that's what happened 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.660
 I probably need to get my hands on it 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:14.910
 business because you see a little bit like 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:18.239
 I bored crushed this whole thing 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:23.910
 principle principle like this and 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:26.010
 now it's for a second now we have it 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.170
 ready him to don when not to ink 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.980
 and surely everyone needs to know naturally 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:39.690
 sprinkle with lemon and you our charm if 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:43.950
 open it and what we see see as 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:47.040
 sound to hear real spray and very 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.220
 very very cool same husband says 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.320
 began he said not working because grid 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.450
 2 days of work and all nifiga 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.370
 on how much he and how much mine 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.530
 enjoyed but I don't know week 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.890
 probably for the time being this whole lemon me 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.720
 then again so well, so periodically 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.360
 pressed this lemon and again 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:09.450
 filled with juice and very well that's it 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:15.110
