00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.240 
description if you wanna learn more
about<00:00:39.989> anything<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.500> let's<00:00:40.680> get<00:00:40.860> started

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
about anything but let's get started

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.799 
about anything but let's get started
with<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.520> brief<00:00:41.940> guy<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.329> all<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> different

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
with a brief guy to all the different

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.420 
with a brief guy to all the different
redstone<00:00:43.260> pictures<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:44.070> current

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
redstone pictures and then current

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
redstone pictures and then current
update<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.059> let's<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.809> started<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.410> our

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
update so let's get started with our

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.110 
update so let's get started with our
first<00:00:46.649> feature<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.700> redstone

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
first feature which is the redstone

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.880 
first feature which is the redstone
comparator<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.110> redstone<00:00:49.410> comparator<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
comparator so the redstone comparator is

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.529 
comparator so the redstone comparator is
the<00:00:49.980> most<00:00:50.129> confusing<00:00:50.309> looking<00:00:51.090> for<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the most confusing looking for the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.180 
the most confusing looking for the
blocks<00:00:51.750> that's<00:00:52.110> why<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.469> decided<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.860> go<00:00:52.949> first

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
blocks that's why it decided to go first

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.410 
blocks that's why it decided to go first
and<00:00:53.460> basically<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.059> does<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
and basically what it does is it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
and basically what it does is it
compares<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> input<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.469> goes<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.800> through

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
compares the input that goes in through

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560 
compares the input that goes in through
this<00:00:56.039> way<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> two<00:00:56.910> inputs<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.329> side

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
this way with the two inputs on the side

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
this way with the two inputs on the side
bit<00:00:57.809> stronger<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.350> goes<00:00:58.500> out<00:00:58.680> there<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.010> it's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
bit stronger it goes out there if it's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
bit stronger it goes out there if it's
not<00:00:59.280> stronger<00:00:59.609> nothing<00:00:59.940> goes<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
not stronger nothing goes out as a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.119 
not stronger nothing goes out as a
separate<00:01:01.079> mode<00:01:01.320> where<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.980> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
separate mode where it just that it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.439 
separate mode where it just that it's
like<00:01:02.250> stronger<00:01:02.550> wake<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.210> or<00:01:03.420> nothing

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
like stronger wake up all or nothing

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
like stronger wake up all or nothing
like<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.170> takes<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.470> away<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.650> there

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
like this just takes it away from there

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.859 
like this just takes it away from there
and<00:01:05.100> yeah<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> weird<00:01:06.360> mode<00:01:06.630> but

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and yeah that's kind of weird mode but

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.300 
and yeah that's kind of weird mode but
this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.290> you'll<00:01:07.470> generally<00:01:07.740> sit<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.159> can

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
this is how you'll generally sit you can

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.010 
this is how you'll generally sit you can
compare<00:01:08.610> an<00:01:08.729> input<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> side<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.780> mess

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
compare an input on the side to a mess

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.570 
compare an input on the side to a mess
on<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.260> side<00:01:10.439> whatever<00:01:10.830> works<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.340> so

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
on the side whatever works for you so

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.730 
on the side whatever works for you so
that's<00:01:12.150> its<00:01:12.360> main<00:01:12.689> use<00:01:12.720> however<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.590> more

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that's its main use however the more

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
that's its main use however the more
likely<00:01:14.130> use<00:01:14.310> which<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> funny<00:01:15.090> up

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
likely use which is kind of funny up

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.630 
likely use which is kind of funny up
yeah<00:01:15.930> not<00:01:16.200> its<00:01:16.320> menus<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.130> fact<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.549> can

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
yeah not its menus as a fact that it can

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.249 
yeah not its menus as a fact that it can
actually<00:01:17.759> measure<00:01:18.090> what's<00:01:18.420> inside<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> chest

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
actually measure what's inside a chest

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
actually measure what's inside a chest
furnace<00:01:19.799> or<00:01:19.979> hoppers<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.549> right<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.420> can

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
furnace or hoppers so right now you can

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
furnace or hoppers so right now you can
see<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.049> amount<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> redstone<00:01:22.680> signal<00:01:23.159> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
see this amount of redstone signal is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.950 
see this amount of redstone signal is
being<00:01:23.580> pulled<00:01:23.759> by<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.150> chest<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.780> more

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
being pulled by this chest the more

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.450 
being pulled by this chest the more
items<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.350> haven't<00:01:25.650> said<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> chest<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> more

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
items you haven't said a chest the more

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.190 
items you haven't said a chest the more
redstone<00:01:26.670> signal<00:01:26.970> emits<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.659> we'll<00:01:28.020> put<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
redstone signal emits so we'll put a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.539 
redstone signal emits so we'll put a
couple<00:01:28.380> snacks<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.799> redstone<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> there<00:01:29.400> just

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
couple snacks of redstone in there just

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.100 
couple snacks of redstone in there just
for<00:01:29.700> good<00:01:29.790> measure<00:01:29.850> put<00:01:30.240> some<00:01:30.420> dirt<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.840> their

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
for good measure put some dirt and their

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.840 
for good measure put some dirt and their
Pro<00:01:31.350> some<00:01:31.590> let's<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.189> as<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.549> we

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
Pro some let's and as you can see we

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
Pro some let's and as you can see we
have<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.329> reached<00:01:33.540> number<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.439> need<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
have just reached number that we need to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
have just reached number that we need to
actually<00:01:35.040> open<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> door<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> can<00:01:36.270> see

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
actually open the door so as you can see

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.910 
actually open the door so as you can see
this<00:01:36.570> measures<00:01:36.990> chest<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this measures chest and it you can do

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.350 
this measures chest and it you can do
really<00:01:38.159> cool<00:01:38.280> stuff<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.880> doors<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
really cool stuff like have doors the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.090 
really cool stuff like have doors the
only<00:01:39.720> open<00:01:40.049> when<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> fill<00:01:40.470> up<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.650> chest<00:01:40.920> with

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
only open when you fill up a chest with

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.679 
only open when you fill up a chest with
certain<00:01:41.310> level<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:41.729> like<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> smell

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
certain level or like you have to smell

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
certain level or like you have to smell
a<00:01:42.750> certain<00:01:43.079> number<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> items<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.799> open<00:01:44.070> door

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
a certain number of items to open door

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.649 
a certain number of items to open door
there<00:01:44.640> are<00:01:44.759> some<00:01:44.880> really<00:01:44.970> cool<00:01:45.180> possibilities

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
there are some really cool possibilities

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.179 
there are some really cool possibilities
for<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.560> redstone<00:01:47.100> comparator

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
for and that's the redstone comparator

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
for and that's the redstone comparator
so<00:01:47.610> next<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.970> let's<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> daylight

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
so next up let's go on to the daylight

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.069 
so next up let's go on to the daylight
sensor<00:01:49.950> some<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.579> daylight<00:01:50.939> sensor<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.509> quite

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
sensor some the daylight sensor is quite

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.539 
sensor some the daylight sensor is quite
simple<00:01:52.320> block<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.560> explain<00:01:52.890> its<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.250> solar

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
simple block to explain its like a solar

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.429 
simple block to explain its like a solar
panel<00:01:53.759> up<00:01:54.060> when<00:01:54.360> there's<00:01:54.780> light<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> sky

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
panel up when there's light in the sky

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020 
panel up when there's light in the sky
like<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.040> right<00:01:56.280> now<00:01:56.310> outputs<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
like there is right now outputs a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
like there is right now outputs a
redstone<00:01:57.270> signal<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:57.869> there's<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
redstone signal when there's not like it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.289 
redstone signal when there's not like it
doesn't<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.340> course<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.759> gets<00:01:59.850> weaker<00:02:00.149> and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
doesn't of course it gets weaker and

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.760 
doesn't of course it gets weaker and
stronger<00:02:00.659> throughout<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> day<00:02:01.200> based<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.619> how

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
stronger throughout the day based on how

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
stronger throughout the day based on how
strong<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> Sun<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.820> that's<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> simple

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
strong the Sun is but that's the simple

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.580 
strong the Sun is but that's the simple
you<00:02:03.479> need<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.200> have<00:02:04.320> doors

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you need to know that you can have doors

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.469 
you need to know that you can have doors
but<00:02:04.799> open<00:02:05.100> during<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.399> daytime<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.240> have

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
but open during the daytime you can have

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.029 
but open during the daytime you can have
lights<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.960> opened<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.560> turn<00:02:07.890> on

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
lights that opened up that turn on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.260 
lights that opened up that turn on
during<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> night<00:02:08.520> time<00:02:08.670> again<00:02:09.000> I've<00:02:09.119> done<00:02:09.239> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
during the night time again I've done a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.309 
during the night time again I've done a
whole<00:02:09.360> video<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.020> check<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
whole video on that so check the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.750 
whole video on that so check the
description<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.830> wanna<00:02:10.979> learn<00:02:11.069> more<00:02:11.280> so

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
description if you wanna learn more so

description if you wanna learn more so
next<00:02:12.000> up<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:12.360> have<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.599> weighted<00:02:13.290> pressure

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
next up we have the weighted pressure

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.289 
next up we have the weighted pressure
place<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.459> weighted<00:02:14.760> fresh<00:02:14.909> plate<00:02:15.120> is

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
place so the weighted fresh plate is

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.640 
place so the weighted fresh plate is
kind<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.750> an<00:02:15.840> evolution<00:02:16.319> on<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:16.470> pressure

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
kind of an evolution on the pressure

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.289 
kind of an evolution on the pressure
plate<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.250> because<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.730> first<00:02:17.909> plate<00:02:18.090> just

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
plate that because the first plate just

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.910 
plate that because the first plate just
puts<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.689> signal<00:02:19.140> out<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.439> it<00:02:19.500> doesn't<00:02:19.709> put<00:02:19.890> a

puts a signal out or it doesn't put a
signal<00:02:20.250> out<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.700> weighted<00:02:21.030> fresh<00:02:21.180> plates<00:02:21.450> are

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
signal out the weighted fresh plates are

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.170

here is the heavy one the gold one about
I<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:26.819> 60<00:02:27.150> items<00:02:27.269> bookman<00:02:27.750> our<00:02:27.870> full

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
I think it's 60 items bookman our full

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.720 
I think it's 60 items bookman our full
signal<00:02:28.379> and<00:02:28.530> anything<00:02:29.040> between<00:02:29.159> bed<00:02:29.549> it's

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
signal and anything between bed it's

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.399 
signal and anything between bed it's
kind<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:29.970> rapport<00:02:30.239> tional<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.569> if<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:31.230> you<00:02:31.260> can

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
kind of rapport tional so if as you can

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.110 
kind of rapport tional so if as you can
see<00:02:31.530> here<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.549> they're<00:02:32.700> slowly<00:02:32.909> put

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
see here like like they're slowly put

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
see here like like they're slowly put
more<00:02:33.239> redstone<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.629> you<00:02:33.720> know<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.079> it

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
more redstone so you know one and it

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.960 
more redstone so you know one and it
slowly<00:02:34.409> pounds<00:02:34.829> this<00:02:34.950> more<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:35.370> let's

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
slowly pounds this more so let's

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.149 
slowly pounds this more so let's
approach<00:02:36.180> some<00:02:36.360> more<00:02:36.480> redstone<00:02:36.659> on<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.159> and

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159 
approach some more redstone on that and

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.080 
approach some more redstone on that and
as<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.340> can<00:02:38.430> see<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.700> redstone<00:02:38.970> signal

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
as you can see the redstone signal

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.119 
as you can see the redstone signal
slowly<00:02:39.629> travels<00:02:40.079> up<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.290> light<00:02:40.859> in<00:02:40.980> there

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
slowly travels up the light in there

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.009 
slowly travels up the light in there
also<00:02:41.849> when<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.180> step<00:02:42.390> on<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.720> adds<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
also when you step on it it adds the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.479 
also when you step on it it adds the
block<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.439> and<00:02:43.590> it's<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.129> a<00:02:44.190> good<00:02:44.370> way<00:02:44.400> to

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
block to it and it's just a good way to

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.160 
block to it and it's just a good way to
kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.940> expand<00:02:45.359> the<00:02:45.420> wrestling<00:02:45.690> signal<00:02:45.989> so

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
kind of expand the wrestling signal so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.899 
kind of expand the wrestling signal so
yes<00:02:46.769> based<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.129> an<00:02:47.220> item<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.609> put<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.819> there

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
yes based on an item you put on there

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.190 
yes based on an item you put on there
and<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.209> kind<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> way<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.049> like

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
and it's kind of a way so if you like

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.199 
and it's kind of a way so if you like
you<00:02:49.319> have<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> dropper<00:02:50.159> drop<00:02:50.340> items<00:02:50.489> out<00:02:50.849> you

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
you have a dropper drop items out you

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.550 
you have a dropper drop items out you
can<00:02:51.359> like<00:02:51.510> measure<00:02:51.720> hamlet's<00:02:52.170> job<00:02:52.230> for

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
can like measure hamlet's job for

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.229 
can like measure hamlet's job for
instance<00:02:52.889> or<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.639> can<00:02:53.819> have<00:02:53.909> a<00:02:53.940> player<00:02:54.180> like

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
instance or you can have a player like

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.640 
instance or you can have a player like
have<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.599> sacrifice<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:55.019> certain<00:02:55.440> number<00:02:55.530> of

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
have to sacrifice a certain number of

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.440 
have to sacrifice a certain number of
items<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:56.040> get<00:02:56.190> on<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> thing<00:02:56.549> or<00:02:56.790> even<00:02:57.269> better

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
items to get on the thing or even better

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.059 
items to get on the thing or even better
yet<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:58.019> can<00:02:58.109> discern<00:02:58.500> number<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.769> players

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
yet you can discern number of players

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.530 
yet you can discern number of players
need<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.639> be<00:02:59.730> on<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.909> pressure<00:03:00.090> plate<00:03:00.180> before

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
need to be on the pressure plate before

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.940 
need to be on the pressure plate before
a<00:03:00.720> doll<00:03:00.959> open<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.409> a<00:03:01.500> cool<00:03:01.650> thing<00:03:01.769> like<00:03:01.920> that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
a doll open it's a cool thing like that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.460 
a doll open it's a cool thing like that
this<00:03:02.639> is<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.849> same<00:03:03.030> thing<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.510> quite<00:03:03.750> 600

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
this is the same thing but it quite 600

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.259 
this is the same thing but it quite 600
items<00:03:04.799> to<00:03:04.889> put<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.069> full<00:03:05.220> signal<00:03:05.519> out<00:03:05.609> so<00:03:05.879> just

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
items to put a full signal out so just

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.759 
items to put a full signal out so just
in<00:03:06.450> case<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.780> want<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.019> go<00:03:07.170> crazy<00:03:07.379> of<00:03:07.650> your

fresh plates this is for you so next up
we<00:03:10.349> have<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.620> hoppers<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.459> hoppers<00:03:12.060> are<00:03:12.209> a

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
we have the hoppers so hoppers are a

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.940 
we have the hoppers so hoppers are a
pretty<00:03:12.659> cool<00:03:12.930> new<00:03:13.079> block<00:03:13.349> that<00:03:13.560> basically

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
pretty cool new block that basically

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.710 
pretty cool new block that basically
they<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.220> taken<00:03:14.790> anything<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:15.450> thrown

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
they just taken anything that's thrown

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.390 
they just taken anything that's thrown
into<00:03:16.049> them<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:16.379> as<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:16.590> see<00:03:16.769> all<00:03:16.919> of<00:03:17.129> this

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
into them so as you can see all of this

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.250 
into them so as you can see all of this
is<00:03:17.519> bouncing<00:03:17.879> rights<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.299> hopper<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:19.109> then

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
is bouncing rights the hopper and then

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.930 
is bouncing rights the hopper and then
you<00:03:19.500> know<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.739> moves<00:03:19.949> the<00:03:20.069> items<00:03:20.519> all<00:03:20.699> the<00:03:20.849> way

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
you know it moves the items all the way

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.400 
you know it moves the items all the way
through<00:03:21.120> its<00:03:21.299> can't<00:03:21.480> like<00:03:21.569> pipe<00:03:21.840> into<00:03:22.139> this

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
through its can't like pipe into this

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.080 
through its can't like pipe into this
hopper<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:23.099> hopper<00:03:23.310> then<00:03:23.549> moves<00:03:23.760> into<00:03:23.940> this

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
hopper this hopper then moves into this

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.909 
hopper this hopper then moves into this
chest<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.599> there's<00:03:24.870> all<00:03:25.079> my<00:03:25.199> redstone<00:03:25.440> just

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
chest and there's all my redstone just

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.099 
chest and there's all my redstone just
like<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.190> saw<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.489> let's<00:03:26.639> show<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.760> this<00:03:26.879> again

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
like I saw so let's show you this again

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.909 
like I saw so let's show you this again
because<00:03:28.109> something<00:03:28.410> goes<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:28.769> hopper

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
because something goes in this hopper

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.949 
because something goes in this hopper
and<00:03:29.190> then<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.730> ends<00:03:29.940> up<00:03:30.090> over<00:03:30.449> here<00:03:30.599> in<00:03:30.810> this

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
and then it ends up over here in this

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.990 
and then it ends up over here in this
chest<00:03:31.319> as<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.560> can<00:03:31.799> see<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.220> yeah<00:03:32.639> that's<00:03:32.790> a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
chest as you can see so yeah that's a

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.220 
chest as you can see so yeah that's a
that's<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.359> whole<00:03:33.480> before<00:03:33.780> you<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.049> put

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
that's the whole before you you put

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.930 
that's the whole before you you put
items<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.949> takes<00:03:35.220> them<00:03:35.459> through<00:03:35.760> and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
items in it it takes them through and

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.610 
items in it it takes them through and
takes<00:03:36.359> them<00:03:36.510> out<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.750> wherever<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.199> outbursts

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
takes them out to wherever the outbursts

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.650 
takes them out to wherever the outbursts
we're<00:03:37.919> checking<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.340> quite<00:03:38.519> cool<00:03:38.699> moving<00:03:39.540> on

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
we're checking is quite cool moving on

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.599 
we're checking is quite cool moving on
next<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.440> dropper<00:03:40.889> which<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.370> block

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
next to the dropper which is this block

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.009 
next to the dropper which is this block
just<00:03:41.849> hit<00:03:41.970> you<00:03:42.090> currently<00:03:42.329> see<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.629> behind<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
just hit you currently see it behind the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.250 
just hit you currently see it behind the
chest<00:03:43.199> let's<00:03:43.379> break<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.739> chest<00:03:43.949> for<00:03:44.099> a<00:03:44.160> second

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
chest let's break the chest for a second

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.990 
chest let's break the chest for a second
apparently<00:03:46.260> let's<00:03:46.440> not<00:03:46.739> okay<00:03:47.280> there<00:03:47.459> we<00:03:47.489> go<00:03:47.579> so

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
apparently let's not okay there we go so

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.369 
apparently let's not okay there we go so
yeah<00:03:48.120> as<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.329> can<00:03:48.389> see<00:03:48.599> this<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:48.959> dropper

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
yeah as you can see this is the dropper

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.500 
yeah as you can see this is the dropper
it<00:03:49.530> looks<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.829> bit<00:03:49.980> like<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.220> dispenser<00:03:50.910> except

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
it looks a bit like a dispenser except

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.059 
it looks a bit like a dispenser except
instead<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.139> know<00:03:52.199> being<00:03:52.500> having<00:03:52.949> the

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
instead of you know being having the

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.849 
instead of you know being having the
dispenser<00:03:53.549> k<00:03:53.730> look<00:03:54.000> it's<00:03:54.180> got<00:03:54.359> big<00:03:54.629> wide<00:03:55.590> mouth

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
dispenser k look it's got big wide mouth

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.589 
dispenser k look it's got big wide mouth
kind<00:03:56.159> of<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.489> basically<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.090> dropper<00:03:57.419> is<00:03:57.569> a

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
kind of and basically the dropper is a

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.420 
kind of and basically the dropper is a
dispenser<00:03:58.230> but<00:03:58.440> instead<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.799> dispensing

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
dispenser but instead of dispensing

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.220 
dispenser but instead of dispensing
items<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:00.389> instance<00:04:00.449> the<00:04:00.690> dispenser<00:04:01.049> puts

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
items so for instance the dispenser puts

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.319 
items so for instance the dispenser puts
arm<00:04:01.440> on<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:01.949> pours<00:04:02.310> out<00:04:02.489> lava<00:04:02.819> it<00:04:03.090> pours

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
arm on you it pours out lava it pours

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.390 
arm on you it pours out lava it pours
out<00:04:03.419> spawn<00:04:03.750> eggs<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.409> just<00:04:04.620> drops<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.010> item

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
out spawn eggs it just drops the item

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.969 
out spawn eggs it just drops the item
out<00:04:05.489> also<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.359> can<00:04:06.569> drop<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.959> into<00:04:07.139> a<00:04:07.349> chest<00:04:07.769> or

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:07.979 
out also it can drop it into a chest or

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:09.530 
out also it can drop it into a chest or
into<00:04:08.280> anything<00:04:08.609> like<00:04:08.909> that<00:04:08.940> if<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.329> want<00:04:09.479> it

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
into anything like that if you want it

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.119 
into anything like that if you want it
to<00:04:09.659> so<00:04:10.049> for<00:04:10.199> instance<00:04:10.260> with<00:04:10.590> this<00:04:10.709> chest<00:04:10.979> hit

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
to so for instance with this chest hit

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.099 
to so for instance with this chest hit
like<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.430> was<00:04:11.549> before<00:04:11.669> when<00:04:12.569> I<00:04:12.629> pull<00:04:12.959> this

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
like it was before when I pull this

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.439 
like it was before when I pull this
button<00:04:13.530> it'll<00:04:14.519> pick<00:04:14.669> one<00:04:14.819> of<00:04:14.909> these<00:04:15.000> random

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
button it'll pick one of these random

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:16.939 
button it'll pick one of these random
items<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.989> it<00:04:16.139> will<00:04:16.229> pick<00:04:16.349> it<00:04:16.470> put<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.799> into

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
items and it will pick it put it into

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.560 
items and it will pick it put it into
this<00:04:17.010> chest<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.489> as<00:04:17.849> you<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.030> see<00:04:18.180> press<00:04:18.449> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
this chest so as you can see press the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.060 
this chest so as you can see press the
lever<00:04:18.690> down<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.079> now<00:04:19.440> let's<00:04:19.650> play<00:04:19.769> for<00:04:19.919> mr.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
lever down and now let's play for mr.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.039 
lever down and now let's play for mr.
nilesh<00:04:20.159> let's<00:04:20.669> do<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:20.880> again<00:04:20.969> and<00:04:21.269> now<00:04:21.930> we've

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
nilesh let's do it again and now we've

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.659 
nilesh let's do it again and now we've
got<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.169> piece<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.409> the<00:04:22.620> handle<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:23.400> kinda

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
got a piece of the handle so it's kinda

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:24.750 
got a piece of the handle so it's kinda
like<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.880> suspension<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.450> get

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
like the suspension that you get

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.220 
like the suspension that you get
the<00:04:24.910> mods<00:04:25.120> except<00:04:25.570> you<00:04:25.660> can<00:04:25.780> use<00:04:25.930> it<00:04:25.960> to<00:04:26.140> go

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
the mods except you can use it to go

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.500 
the mods except you can use it to go
directly<00:04:26.440> into<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:27.070> chess<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.970> also<00:04:28.090> means<00:04:28.360> that

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
directly into a chess it also means that

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.850 
directly into a chess it also means that
you<00:04:28.660> can<00:04:28.750> have<00:04:28.840> like<00:04:28.960> red<00:04:29.140> stone<00:04:29.350> systems<00:04:29.710> that

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
you can have like red stone systems that

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.960 
you can have like red stone systems that
work<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.220> way<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:30.580> I'll<00:04:30.700> show<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
work that way and I'll show you the

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.430 
work that way and I'll show you the
second<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.390> more<00:04:31.630> interesting<00:04:31.810> use<00:04:32.050> for<00:04:32.200> it<00:04:32.260> but

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
second a more interesting use for it but

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.800 
second a more interesting use for it but
next<00:04:32.620> up<00:04:32.800> let's<00:04:33.190> show<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.760> redstone<00:04:34.240> block<00:04:34.540> so

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
next up let's show the redstone block so

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.180 
next up let's show the redstone block so
the<00:04:35.080> redstone<00:04:35.380> block<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.710> kind<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.100> not

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
the redstone block is kind of not

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.160 
the redstone block is kind of not
working<00:04:36.400> right<00:04:36.580> now<00:04:36.850> but<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:37.330> idea<00:04:37.600> is<00:04:37.630> it's<00:04:37.930> a

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
working right now but the idea is it's a

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.720 
working right now but the idea is it's a
redstone<00:04:38.530> source<00:04:38.950> that's<00:04:39.220> removable<00:04:39.460> by

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
redstone source that's removable by

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.210 
redstone source that's removable by
Pistons<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:40.480> as<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.200> can<00:04:41.260> see<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.770> block

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
Pistons so as you can see this block

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.580 
Pistons so as you can see this block
itself<00:04:42.520> emits<00:04:43.000> redstone<00:04:43.480> on<00:04:43.660> all<00:04:43.930> sides<00:04:44.290> and

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
itself emits redstone on all sides and

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.470 
itself emits redstone on all sides and
it's<00:04:45.310> yeah<00:04:45.580> it's<00:04:45.610> like<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.820> redstone<00:04:46.120> charge

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
it's yeah it's like a redstone charge

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.910 
it's yeah it's like a redstone charge
that<00:04:46.750> can<00:04:46.870> be<00:04:46.990> moved<00:04:47.140> by<00:04:47.260> Pistons<00:04:47.620> right<00:04:47.800> now

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
that can be moved by Pistons right now

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.260 
that can be moved by Pistons right now
it<00:04:48.040> can't<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:48.430> it's<00:04:48.550> just<00:04:48.610> a<00:04:48.730> really<00:04:48.760> cool

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
it can't so it's just a really cool

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.820 
it can't so it's just a really cool
block<00:04:49.540> it's<00:04:49.930> got<00:04:50.110> an<00:04:50.170> interesting<00:04:50.320> texture<00:04:50.710> in

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
block it's got an interesting texture in

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.290 
block it's got an interesting texture in
my<00:04:50.890> opinion<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.400> kind<00:04:51.760> of<00:04:51.790> like<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:51.970> but

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
my opinion and I kind of like it but

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.450 
my opinion and I kind of like it but
yeah<00:04:52.630> that's<00:04:52.960> that's<00:04:53.380> its<00:04:53.650> purpose<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:54.310> just

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
yeah that's that's its purpose it just

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.680 
yeah that's that's its purpose it just
doesn't<00:04:54.610> cut<00:04:54.850> entirely<00:04:55.180> work<00:04:55.420> right<00:04:55.660> now

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
doesn't cut entirely work right now

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.840 
doesn't cut entirely work right now
because<00:04:55.930> Pistons<00:04:56.290> are<00:04:56.410> broken<00:04:56.710> so<00:04:56.740> next<00:04:57.400> up<00:04:57.640> we

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
because Pistons are broken so next up we

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.280 
because Pistons are broken so next up we
have<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.060> trap<00:04:58.480> Jess<00:04:58.720> so<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:59.020> idea<00:04:59.080> of<00:04:59.230> the

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
have the trap Jess so the idea of the

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.380 
have the trap Jess so the idea of the
trap<00:04:59.560> chest<00:04:59.800> is<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.370> Ashley<00:05:00.790> what<00:05:00.910> it<00:05:01.000> does<00:05:01.150> is

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
trap chest is the Ashley what it does is

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.140 
trap chest is the Ashley what it does is
when<00:05:01.930> it's<00:05:02.140> on<00:05:02.290> as<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.650> can<00:05:02.770> see<00:05:03.120> over<00:05:04.120> here

while it's on you can see it puts out

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.500 
while it's on you can see it puts out
redstone<00:05:06.370> signal<00:05:06.520> just<00:05:06.850> over<00:05:07.090> here<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.480> you

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
redstone signal just over here so you

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.880 
redstone signal just over here so you
can<00:05:07.780> then<00:05:07.900> you<00:05:08.230> know<00:05:08.320> power<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.680> were<00:05:08.830> a

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
can then you know power that were a

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.470 
can then you know power that were a
Peter<00:05:09.100> for<00:05:09.310> instance<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:09.760> yeah<00:05:10.180> you<00:05:10.240> can<00:05:10.450> have

Peter for instance and yeah you can have

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.090 
Peter for instance and yeah you can have
a<00:05:10.600> really<00:05:10.990> long<00:05:11.080> signal<00:05:11.320> coming<00:05:11.560> outfit<00:05:11.890> or

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
a really long signal coming outfit or

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.130 
a really long signal coming outfit or
you<00:05:12.430> can<00:05:12.580> have<00:05:12.730> tnc<00:05:13.150> underneath<00:05:13.480> it<00:05:13.630> again

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
you can have tnc underneath it again

self<00:05:22.840> yeah<00:05:23.530> filling<00:05:23.830> chest<00:05:24.130> because<00:05:24.490> every

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
self yeah filling chest because every

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.890 
self yeah filling chest because every
time<00:05:24.850> I<00:05:25.030> open<00:05:25.090> this<00:05:25.330> chest<00:05:25.570> I'm<00:05:25.780> getting

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
time I open this chest I'm getting

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.150 
time I open this chest I'm getting
enough<00:05:26.140> piece<00:05:26.290> of<00:05:26.410> wheat<00:05:26.590> because<00:05:26.800> there's<00:05:27.100> a

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
enough piece of wheat because there's a

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.920 
enough piece of wheat because there's a
drop<00:05:27.400> behind<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.910> so<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.480> job<00:05:28.630> is<00:05:28.690> being

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
drop behind it so the job is being

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
drop behind it so the job is being
powered<00:05:29.050> by<00:05:29.170> the<00:05:29.260> redstone<00:05:29.680> and<00:05:29.770> then

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
powered by the redstone and then

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.290 
powered by the redstone and then
dropping<00:05:30.250> piece<00:05:30.520> of<00:05:30.640> wheat<00:05:30.790> into<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.000> chest

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
dropping piece of wheat into the chest

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.300 
dropping piece of wheat into the chest
so<00:05:31.690> 10<00:05:31.930> piece<00:05:32.080> suite<00:05:32.350> 11<00:05:32.710> pieces<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:33.010> week<00:05:33.130> and

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
so 10 piece suite 11 pieces of week and

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.410 
so 10 piece suite 11 pieces of week and
as<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.490> can<00:05:33.580> see<00:05:33.610> it's<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:33.970> cool<00:05:34.120> way<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.210> do

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
as you can see it's a cool way to do

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.210 
as you can see it's a cool way to do
some<00:05:34.570> stuff<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.990> think<00:05:35.980> it's<00:05:36.100> quite

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
some stuff I think it's quite

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.860 
some stuff I think it's quite
interesting<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.790> this<00:05:37.360> is<00:05:37.450> what<00:05:37.600> my<00:05:37.690> favorite

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
interesting and this is what my favorite

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.570 
interesting and this is what my favorite
uses<00:05:38.110> them<00:05:38.320> because<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.710> know<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:39.340> chest

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
uses them because you know the chest

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.520 
uses them because you know the chest
fills<00:05:39.820> itself<00:05:40.120> as<00:05:40.300> Europe<00:05:40.480> so<00:05:40.900> as<00:05:41.140> long<00:05:41.380> as<00:05:41.440> you

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
fills itself as Europe so as long as you

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.170 
fills itself as Europe so as long as you
stop<00:05:41.680> you<00:05:41.830> from<00:05:41.890> spam<00:05:42.310> open<00:05:42.610> your<00:05:42.760> chest<00:05:42.970> it's

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
stop you from spam open your chest it's

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.520 
stop you from spam open your chest it's
a<00:05:43.300> good<00:05:43.480> way<00:05:43.570> to<00:05:43.630> limit<00:05:43.930> what<00:05:44.110> they<00:05:44.230> can<00:05:44.380> have

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
a good way to limit what they can have

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.680 
a good way to limit what they can have
at<00:05:44.740> least<00:05:44.830> in<00:05:45.040> my<00:05:45.160> opinion<00:05:45.220> so<00:05:45.640> moving<00:05:46.420> on<00:05:46.540> from

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
at least in my opinion so moving on from

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.540 
at least in my opinion so moving on from
this<00:05:46.840> we<00:05:47.050> have<00:05:47.200> the<00:05:47.350> two<00:05:47.620> new<00:05:47.800> mine<00:05:48.040> carts<00:05:48.400> and

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
this we have the two new mine carts and

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.730 
this we have the two new mine carts and
the<00:05:48.610> activator<00:05:49.180> else<00:05:49.450> so<00:05:49.660> let's<00:05:50.290> start<00:05:50.590> the

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
the activator else so let's start the

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.170 
the activator else so let's start the
hopper<00:05:50.920> because<00:05:51.340> this<00:05:51.580> will<00:05:51.730> blow<00:05:51.880> everything

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
hopper because this will blow everything

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.600 
hopper because this will blow everything
up<00:05:52.590> minecraft<00:05:53.590> hopper<00:05:53.890> it's<00:05:54.070> just<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.310> hopper

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
up minecraft hopper it's just a hopper

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.580 
up minecraft hopper it's just a hopper
except<00:05:55.150> it<00:05:55.330> will<00:05:55.390> absorb<00:05:55.540> anything<00:05:56.020> that<00:05:56.380> goes

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
except it will absorb anything that goes

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.380 
except it will absorb anything that goes
along<00:05:56.830> all<00:05:57.220> that<00:05:57.340> goes<00:05:57.460> into<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.790> so<00:05:57.940> if<00:05:58.210> it

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
along all that goes into it so if it

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.730 
along all that goes into it so if it
falls<00:05:58.540> on<00:05:58.630> top<00:05:58.780> it<00:05:58.960> will<00:05:59.170> still<00:05:59.380> land<00:05:59.530> in<00:05:59.650> it

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
falls on top it will still land in it

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.290 
falls on top it will still land in it
but<00:05:59.950> if<00:06:00.100> it<00:06:00.220> goes<00:06:00.400> on<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:00.850> minecart<00:06:01.240> track

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
but if it goes on to the minecart track

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.000 
but if it goes on to the minecart track
as<00:06:01.690> you<00:06:01.990> can<00:06:02.080> see<00:06:02.290> here<00:06:02.470> what<00:06:02.590> I'm<00:06:02.650> gonna<00:06:02.770> push

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
as you can see here what I'm gonna push

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.310 
as you can see here what I'm gonna push
it<00:06:03.120> yeah<00:06:04.120> she<00:06:04.360> absorbs<00:06:04.780> everything<00:06:05.050> on<00:06:05.230> the

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
it yeah she absorbs everything on the

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.230 
it yeah she absorbs everything on the
track<00:06:05.500> too<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.250> yeah<00:06:06.430> that's<00:06:06.550> quite<00:06:06.850> coping<00:06:07.150> it

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
track too so yeah that's quite coping it

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.880 
track too so yeah that's quite coping it
Candace<00:06:07.600> so<00:06:07.810> that's<00:06:08.260> kind<00:06:08.500> of<00:06:08.530> cool<00:06:08.680> like<00:06:08.860> that

Candace so that's kind of cool like that
it's<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.640> move<00:06:09.820> of<00:06:10.000> hopper<00:06:10.360> which<00:06:10.540> is<00:06:10.780> really

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
it's a move of hopper which is really

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.720 
it's a move of hopper which is really
nice<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.320> as<00:06:11.740> you<00:06:11.860> could<00:06:12.010> quite<00:06:12.190> be<00:06:12.340> built<00:06:12.550> so

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:12.730 
nice and as you could quite be built so

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.850 
nice and as you could quite be built so
so<00:06:13.300> let's<00:06:13.600> just<00:06:13.720> leave<00:06:13.810> that<00:06:13.870> there<00:06:13.990> next<00:06:14.770> up

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
so let's just leave that there next up

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.590 
so let's just leave that there next up
we<00:06:14.920> have<00:06:14.950> the<00:06:15.070> minecraft<00:06:15.460> tnt<00:06:15.700> I<00:06:16.030> think<00:06:16.450> you

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
we have the minecraft tnt I think you

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.030 
we have the minecraft tnt I think you
can<00:06:16.780> probably<00:06:16.930> guess<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.350> basic<00:06:17.770> idea<00:06:18.010> behind

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
can probably guess the basic idea behind

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.130 
can probably guess the basic idea behind
this<00:06:18.370> one<00:06:18.610> but<00:06:19.180> the<00:06:19.270> activator<00:06:19.630> rail<00:06:19.900> is<00:06:20.080> a

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
this one but the activator rail is a

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.260 
this one but the activator rail is a
redstone<00:06:20.830> powered<00:06:21.100> rail<00:06:21.310> but<00:06:21.490> activates<00:06:22.060> this

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
redstone powered rail but activates this

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.150 
redstone powered rail but activates this
TNC<00:06:22.720> and<00:06:22.870> also<00:06:23.140> turns<00:06:23.410> off<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:23.740> hopper<00:06:23.890> so

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
TNC and also turns off the hopper so

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.860 
TNC and also turns off the hopper so
let's<00:06:24.610> just<00:06:24.820> show<00:06:24.940> you<00:06:25.000> one<00:06:25.240> massive<00:06:25.570> boom

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
let's just show you one massive boom
