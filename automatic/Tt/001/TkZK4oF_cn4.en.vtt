00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:03.860 

so<00:00:02.159> after<00:00:02.310> trying<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.730> replicate<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.210> ppm

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
so after trying to replicate this ppm

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.720 
so after trying to replicate this ppm
problem<00:00:04.290> or<00:00:04.500> ppm<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:04.920> voice<00:00:05.130> problem<00:00:05.549> on

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
problem or ppm and voice problem on

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.519 
problem or ppm and voice problem on
there<00:00:06.029> as<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.569> trainer<00:00:06.899> on<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.200> different

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
there as a trainer on a different

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.299 
there as a trainer on a different
transmitter<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:09.200> thought<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.830> isn't<00:00:11.040> right

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
transmitter I thought this isn't right

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.789 
transmitter I thought this isn't right
you<00:00:11.849> should<00:00:12.200> behave<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> same<00:00:13.500> everywhere

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
you should behave the same everywhere

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.410 
you should behave the same everywhere
and<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.969> realized<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.480> might<00:00:15.630> be<00:00:16.190> volume<00:00:17.190> issue

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
and I realized it might be volume issue

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.560 
and I realized it might be volume issue
because<00:00:18.949> when<00:00:19.949> I'm<00:00:20.070> when<00:00:20.880> I<00:00:20.910> got<00:00:21.060> my<00:00:21.150> volume<00:00:21.330> up

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
because when I'm when I got my volume up

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.120 
because when I'm when I got my volume up
high<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.779> my<00:00:22.050> tx9<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.500> see<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.769> every<00:00:25.949> time

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
high on my tx9 you can see it every time

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.779 
high on my tx9 you can see it every time
he<00:00:26.250> does<00:00:26.400> something<00:00:26.580> with<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.000> audio<00:00:27.349> cleared

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
he does something with the audio cleared

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:37.660 
he does something with the audio cleared
let<00:00:29.789> me<00:00:29.880> save<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> day<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> display<00:00:31.619> is

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.130 

so<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:38.730> i<00:00:38.850> turn<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.120> volume<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.420> now<00:00:42.140> but

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
so if i turn the volume down now but

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.389 
so if i turn the volume down now but
it's<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.440> paper<00:00:44.160> said<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:45.390> still<00:00:45.690> hear<00:00:45.870> that

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
it's a paper said you still hear that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
see what spectrum

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.850 
see what spectrum
to<00:02:13.180> say<00:02:13.330> about<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.569> but<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.379> far<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.739> response

on our secrets from one of the pony
official<00:02:17.590> guides<00:02:17.769> was<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:19.209> does<00:02:19.360> what<00:02:19.510> it

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
official guides was it does what it

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.660 
official guides was it does what it
should<00:02:19.659> be<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.799> I<00:02:20.920> don't<00:02:20.980> think<00:02:21.129> it<00:02:21.340> does<00:02:21.459> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
should be which I don't think it does I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.949 
should be which I don't think it does I
think<00:02:21.970> there's<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.180> problem<00:02:22.360> with<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:22.629> radio

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
think there's a problem with this radio

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.039 
think there's a problem with this radio
and<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:24.730> could<00:02:24.940> be<00:02:24.970> an<00:02:25.090> inherent<00:02:25.450> flaw<00:02:25.599> in<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
and it could be an inherent flaw in the

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.470 
and it could be an inherent flaw in the
design<00:02:26.159> but<00:02:27.159> we<00:02:27.250> will<00:02:27.340> see<00:02:27.459> I'm<00:02:27.790> Arvid<00:02:28.209> upright

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
design but we will see I'm Arvid upright

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.489 
design but we will see I'm Arvid upright
yet<00:02:28.769> no<00:02:29.769> II<00:02:29.799> thanks<00:02:30.069> for<00:02:30.159> watching<00:02:30.400> again
