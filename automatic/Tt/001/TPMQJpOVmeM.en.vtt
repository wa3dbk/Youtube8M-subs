inside your kit and I've already started

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.959 
inside your kit and I've already started
this<00:00:33.840> process<00:00:34.160> for<00:00:35.160> us<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.610> can<00:00:35.820> move<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
this process for us so we can move a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.610 
this process for us so we can move a
little<00:00:36.120> bit<00:00:36.239> faster<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.380> you're<00:00:37.500> going

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
little bit faster but what you're going

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.190 
little bit faster but what you're going
to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.160> you're<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> use<00:00:39.200> this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to do is you're just going to use this

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.170 
to do is you're just going to use this
word<00:00:40.500> window<00:00:40.950> punch<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.520> we're<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.120> to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
word window punch and we're going to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.750 
word window punch and we're going to
flip<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.510> over<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.760> we're

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
flip it over just like this and we're

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.209 
flip it over just like this and we're
going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.360> push<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> all<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.469> way<00:00:46.649> up<00:00:46.890> till<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219

punch your first hole so that's what we

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.689 
punch your first hole so that's what we
already<00:00:51.180> did<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.690> you're<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> punch<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
almost to the edge but leave yourself a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
almost to the edge but leave yourself a
little<00:00:55.199> bit<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.469> room<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:56.910> continuing

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

straight you have the straight punch
line<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.520> problem<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.880> i<00:01:09.030> found<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
line and the problem that i found that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.990 
line and the problem that i found that
i'm<00:01:09.810> coming<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
i'm coming up with is that this the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.910 
i'm coming up with is that this the
original<00:01:12.090> word<00:01:12.570> window<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.799> you're

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.510 
original word window that you're
punching<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.610> actually<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.450> too

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
punching is actually a little bit too

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.630 
punching is actually a little bit too
shallow<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.600> penny<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.380> slide<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.070> all<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
shallow for the penny to slide so all I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
shallow for the penny to slide so all I
did<00:01:21.240> was<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.020> moved<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.350> down<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
did was I kind of moved it down just a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.710 
did was I kind of moved it down just a
hair<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
hair I don't know if you can see that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.530 
hair I don't know if you can see that
just<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.159> bit<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
just a little bit just to make it just a

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
just a little bit just to make it just a
little<00:01:27.570> bit<00:01:27.750> bigger<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.920> punch<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
little bit bigger you just punch that

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.969 
little bit bigger you just punch that
out<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.729> don't<00:01:29.970> worry<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.619> little

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
out and don't worry if this is a little

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.749 
out and don't worry if this is a little
uneven<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:33.119> back<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.380> um<00:01:34.759> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
going to stick to on the back of this I

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.410

find<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:10.330> easier<00:03:10.600> to<00:03:11.760> fold<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:12.970> blue<00:03:13.240> dot

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
find it's easier to fold this blue dot

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.150 
find it's easier to fold this blue dot
in<00:03:13.540> half<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.290> kind<00:03:14.560> of<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.770> sticks<00:03:15.010> around

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
in half so it kind of just sticks around

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.060 
in half so it kind of just sticks around
the<00:03:15.340> rim<00:03:15.550> of<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.390> button<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:17.830> you're

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
the rim of the button and then you're
