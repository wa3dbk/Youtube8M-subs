 the specific europe of europe 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.600

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.890
 By the way, the building has a lot to convey 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.940
 There are many good options too

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.180
 playing technique just the complete is there 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.180

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:03.910

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:12.040
