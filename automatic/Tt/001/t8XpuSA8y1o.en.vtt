00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.300
 collect with the cabbage and good the 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.950
 cabbage in the first when we are at 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.020
 diet and once I put myself on a diet that 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.690
 was commenting picked up a week and the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.210
 I really end up hating him I could not see 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.460
 nor in painting and this recipe taught me 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.469
 my friend ana cristina is new and no longer 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.999
 I can stop eating the chicken I love 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.699
 especially that it is a recipe well 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.230
 healthy well fast you 're going to see that 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.510
 until the children are going to eat the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.069
 chicken with this recipe and other things 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.729
 important is that the cabbage is 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:54.309
 family 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.960
 the broccoli of the cauliflower that are 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.640
 vegetables that are real related 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.289
 with cancer prevention had the 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.479
 prevent cancer in addition to that 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.819
 contains a lot of fiber, lots of water 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.540
 and very few calories so it's ideal 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.520
 to fill 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.230
 without eating much good that is my piece 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.250
 of cabbage what we are going to do is 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.250
 cut it into boxes 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.990
 they do not have to be small pieces 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.100
 just to fit in the pan 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.689
 if you will see in latin america please 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.460
 make sure you wash the cabbage very well 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.649
 Always disinfect your vegetables 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.290
 many many places this cereal with 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.259
 water takes good care over there I have 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.820

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.950
 I watch for videos that we cook with 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.170
 no oil so everything I put 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.679

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.679
 of water in the pan let's learn it 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:54.399
