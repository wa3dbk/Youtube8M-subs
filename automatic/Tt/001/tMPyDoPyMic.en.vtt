00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
have an emblem on them and we felt we

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.500 
have an emblem on them and we felt we
had<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.370> division<00:02:23.790> had<00:02:23.880> grown<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.450> point

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
had the division had grown to a point

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.170 
had the division had grown to a point
that<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.709> ought<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.190> our<00:02:26.340> own<00:02:26.459> emblem<00:02:26.940> for

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that we ought to have our own emblem for

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.420 
that we ought to have our own emblem for
the<00:02:27.270> accurate<00:02:27.690> division<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.709> NSX<00:02:29.220> is

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the accurate division and so the NSX is

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.390 
the accurate division and so the NSX is
a<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.820> perfect<00:02:30.480> card<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.440> beYOU<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.709> new<00:02:32.040> emblem

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
a a perfect card to beYOU a new emblem

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.780 
a a perfect card to beYOU a new emblem
and<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:34.110> very<00:02:34.530> first<00:02:34.800> sentence<00:02:35.160> X<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.550> that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and so the very first sentence X is that

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.580 
and so the very first sentence X is that
that<00:02:36.360> came<00:02:36.630> off<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.870> line<00:02:37.260> had<00:02:38.070> a<00:02:38.100> new<00:02:38.640> emblem

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
that came off the line had a new emblem

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.710 
that came off the line had a new emblem
that<00:02:40.590> was<00:02:40.770> quite<00:02:41.100> special<00:02:41.489> quite<00:02:42.000> unique<00:02:42.330> and

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that was quite special quite unique and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.560 
that was quite special quite unique and
we<00:02:43.380> hand-built<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.130> few<00:02:44.340> of<00:02:44.430> these<00:02:44.550> units<00:02:45.120> and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
we hand-built a few of these units and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.740 
we hand-built a few of these units and
at<00:02:46.110> some<00:02:46.530> point<00:02:46.770> in<00:02:46.860> time<00:02:46.910> mr.<00:02:47.910> Honda<00:02:48.330> sweet

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
at some point in time mr. Honda sweet

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.229 
at some point in time mr. Honda sweet
trio<00:02:48.989> Honda<00:02:49.470> saw<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.800> car<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.550> he<00:02:50.790> loved<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
trio Honda saw the car and he loved the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.110 
trio Honda saw the car and he loved the
car<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.690> course<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.800> he<00:02:52.950> saw<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.250> emblem<00:02:53.910> and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
car of course and he saw the emblem and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.330 
car of course and he saw the emblem and
he<00:02:54.270> thought<00:02:54.540> how<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.230> emblem<00:02:55.739> looks<00:02:55.980> fabulous

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
he thought how the emblem looks fabulous

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.330 
he thought how the emblem looks fabulous
but<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.390> accurate<00:02:57.870> part<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.350> Honda<00:02:58.800> wouldn't

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
but the accurate part of Honda wouldn't

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.670 
but the accurate part of Honda wouldn't
it<00:02:59.370> be<00:02:59.459> nice<00:02:59.790> through<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.600> calipers<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.500> have

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
it be nice through the calipers to have

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.400 
it be nice through the calipers to have
a<00:03:01.709> little<00:03:02.070> bull<00:03:02.610> crossbar<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.080> looked<00:03:04.260> a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
a little bull crossbar so it looked a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.070 
a little bull crossbar so it looked a
little<00:03:04.530> bit<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:05.010> an<00:03:05.489> H<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.510> was<00:03:06.660> part<00:03:06.989> of

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
little bit like an H so it was part of

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.800 
little bit like an H so it was part of
the<00:03:07.230> Honda<00:03:07.590> family<00:03:08.070> so<00:03:08.340> consequently<00:03:08.820> the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
the Honda family so consequently the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.160 
the Honda family so consequently the
emblem<00:03:10.620> got<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.010> little<00:03:11.370> bit<00:03:11.489> revised<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.959> we

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
emblem got a little bit revised so we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.110 
emblem got a little bit revised so we
went<00:03:13.350> from<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.590> caliper<00:03:13.950> with<00:03:14.340> with<00:03:14.940> no

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
went from a caliper with with no

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.170 
went from a caliper with with no
crossfire<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.930> caliper<00:03:16.430> with<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> crossbar

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
crossfire to a caliper with a crossbar

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.630 
crossfire to a caliper with a crossbar
and<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:19.170> ultimately<00:03:19.680> was<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.010> emblem<00:03:20.340> we

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
and that ultimately was the emblem we

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.180 
and that ultimately was the emblem we
used
