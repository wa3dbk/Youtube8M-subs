00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
welcome to pony craft in this tutorial I

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.820 
welcome to pony craft in this tutorial I
am<00:00:24.210> going<00:00:24.450> to<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.900> showing<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.350> how<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.560> build

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
am going to be showing you how to build

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.020 
am going to be showing you how to build
an<00:00:26.100> automatic<00:00:26.250> character<00:00:27.119> harvester<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.730> we

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:30.030 
an automatic character harvester so we

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.000 
an automatic character harvester so we
are<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> start<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.110> with<00:00:31.140> basic<00:00:31.800> cup

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
are going to start out with basic cup

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.549 
are going to start out with basic cup
tie<00:00:32.220> logic<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:33.780> first<00:00:34.050> thing<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.530> want

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
tie logic the first thing that you want

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.450 
tie logic the first thing that you want
to<00:00:34.860> know<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:36.480> cannot<00:00:36.870> place<00:00:37.110> blocks

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
to know is that you cannot place blocks

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.450 
to know is that you cannot place blocks
directly<00:00:38.460> adjacent<00:00:38.640> cap<00:00:39.390> toy<00:00:39.710> or<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.040> cacti

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
directly adjacent cap toy or the cacti

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
directly adjacent cap toy or the cacti
will<00:00:41.730> break<00:00:42.000> apart<00:00:44.090> it<00:00:45.090> doesn't<00:00:45.420> matter<00:00:45.540> how

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
will break apart it doesn't matter how

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.720 
will break apart it doesn't matter how
told<00:00:46.260> Kirk<00:00:46.590> tires<00:00:47.660> regardless<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.809> its<00:00:48.989> height

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
told Kirk tires regardless of its height

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.740 
told Kirk tires regardless of its height
it<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.909> still<00:00:51.150> break<00:00:51.330> apart<00:00:53.000> but<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.570> use

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
it will still break apart but we can use

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.399 
it will still break apart but we can use
this<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:54.960> our<00:00:55.110> advantage<00:00:56.659> of<00:00:57.659> course<00:00:58.080> you<00:00:58.230> can

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
this to our advantage of course you can

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.040 
this to our advantage of course you can
place<00:00:58.620> blocks<00:00:58.970> diagonally<00:00:59.970> adjacent<00:01:00.750> cab

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
place blocks diagonally adjacent cab

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.670 
place blocks diagonally adjacent cab
tight<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:02.989> we<00:01:03.989> use<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.559> our<00:01:04.620> advantage

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
tight but we use this to our advantage

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.260 
tight but we use this to our advantage
in<00:01:05.930> several<00:01:06.930> ways<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.580> way<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> I'm<00:01:09.060> going

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
in several ways the way that I'm going

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.100 
in several ways the way that I'm going
to<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.540> showing<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.580> relates<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:12.110> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
to be showing you relates to this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.020 
to be showing you relates to this
automatic<00:01:13.710> cuts<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.130> harvested<00:01:14.580> by<00:01:14.790> showing

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
automatic cuts are harvested by showing

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.380 
automatic cuts are harvested by showing
you<00:01:15.120> at<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> start<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.780> video<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> we're

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
you at the start of this video so we're

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
you at the start of this video so we're
going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.690> build<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.229> mock-up<00:01:19.470> design

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
going to build a little mock-up design

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.820 
going to build a little mock-up design
here<00:01:20.630> did<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> mean<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.960> break<00:01:22.290> that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.310 

of<00:01:27.490> course<00:01:27.790> you<00:01:27.970> can<00:01:28.150> build<00:01:28.360> them<00:01:28.570> much<00:01:28.750> larger

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
of course you can build them much larger

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.120 
of course you can build them much larger
than<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.350> what<00:01:32.590> we're<00:01:32.770> going<00:01:32.920> to<00:01:33.070> be

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
than this so what we're going to be

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.770 
than this so what we're going to be
doing<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.670> placing<00:01:33.970> a<00:01:34.890> block<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:37.060> above<00:01:37.390> and

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
doing is placing a block just above and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.310 
doing is placing a block just above and
across<00:01:38.230> from<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.560> cup<00:01:38.770> tie<00:01:39.010> like<00:01:39.250> so<00:01:40.320> this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
across from the cup tie like so this

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.830 
across from the cup tie like so this
block<00:01:41.650> is<00:01:41.680> going<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.280> cause<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.640> character<00:01:43.120> to

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
block is going to cause the character to

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.710 
block is going to cause the character to
break<00:01:44.230> off<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:45.060> yet<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.150> character<00:01:46.510> will

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
break off and yet the character will

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.590 
break off and yet the character will
still<00:01:46.930> grow<00:01:47.760> but<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.880> moment<00:01:49.180> it<00:01:49.270> was<00:01:49.390> of

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
still grow but the moment it was of

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.420 
still grow but the moment it was of
course<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.990> will<00:01:50.080> break<00:01:50.290> apart<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.010> spare

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
course it will break apart the spare

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.510 
course it will break apart the spare
piece<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:53.170> source<00:01:53.440> block<00:01:53.770> or<00:01:54.070> remain

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.680 

let's<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.700> make<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.030> little<00:01:58.270> bit<00:01:58.510> longer

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
let's just make this little bit longer

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.870 
let's just make this little bit longer
of<00:02:01.080> course<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.350> water<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.860> here<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.430> cacti

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
of course the water is here so the cacti

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.110 
of course the water is here so the cacti
flows<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:05.490> that's<00:02:06.490> just<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.970> little

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
flows to you and that's just a little

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.670 
flows to you and that's just a little
mock-up<00:02:07.510> design<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.170> you've<00:02:11.440> seen

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
mock-up design so now that you've seen

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.030 
mock-up design so now that you've seen
this<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.280> should<00:02:12.520> have<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:13.380> very<00:02:14.380> good<00:02:14.590> idea<00:02:14.709> of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
this you should have a very good idea of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.449 
this you should have a very good idea of
how<00:02:15.190> character<00:02:15.640> harvesters<00:02:16.209> work<00:02:17.340> given<00:02:18.340> the

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
how character harvesters work given the

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.440 
how character harvesters work given the
more<00:02:18.640> grand<00:02:18.940> s<00:02:19.120> qualms<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:20.940> yes<00:02:21.940> i<00:02:22.150> think<00:02:22.330> i'm

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
more grand s qualms and yes i think i'm

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.180 
more grand s qualms and yes i think i'm
just<00:02:22.600> going<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.930> transition<00:02:23.740> altar<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:26.190> yeah

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
just going to transition altar and yeah

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.820 
just going to transition altar and yeah
be<00:02:27.400> right<00:02:27.430> back<00:02:32.580> ok<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:33.640> i<00:02:33.940> embarked<00:02:34.570> i<00:02:34.930> am<00:02:35.650> now

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
be right back ok so i embarked i am now

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.560 
be right back ok so i embarked i am now
going<00:02:36.070> to<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.340> showing<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.790> how<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.030> build<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
going to be showing you how to build the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.449 
going to be showing you how to build the
automatic<00:02:38.080> after<00:02:38.440> harvest<00:02:38.890> will<00:02:39.010> let<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.250> saw

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
automatic after harvest will let you saw

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.690 
automatic after harvest will let you saw
it<00:02:39.519> start<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.150> video<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:42.160> we're<00:02:42.400> going<00:02:42.550> to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
it start of this video so we're going to

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.479 
it start of this video so we're going to
want<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.880> start<00:02:43.180> out<00:02:43.390> with<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.600> 9<00:02:43.870> by<00:02:44.080> 8<00:02:44.110> grip<00:02:44.590> i'm

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
want to start out with a 9 by 8 grip i'm

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.270 
want to start out with a 9 by 8 grip i'm
just<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.090> cut<00:02:46.360> this<00:02:46.480> out<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:51.130> we

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
just going to cut this out and here we

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.740 
just going to cut this out and here we
are<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:51.700> we<00:02:51.820> now<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.300> 9<00:02:52.480> by<00:02:52.690> 8<00:02:52.720> bed<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:54.750> we

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
are so we now have the 9 by 8 bed and we

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.340 
are so we now have the 9 by 8 bed and we
need<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.019> play<00:02:56.170> some<00:02:56.410> sand<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:56.980> it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.880 

so<00:03:02.350> let's<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:02.770> do<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.370> now<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:04.620> course<00:03:05.620> you

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
so let's just do that now of course you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.390 
so let's just do that now of course you
can<00:03:06.100> hear<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:07.800> capital<00:03:08.800> harvest<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.340> I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
can hear the capital harvest that I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.950 
can hear the capital harvest that I
shown<00:03:09.700> at<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.910> start<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.330> this<00:03:10.450> video<00:03:10.780> in

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
shown at the start of this video in

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.720 
shown at the start of this video in
progress<00:03:11.440> right<00:03:11.680> now<00:03:11.920> have<00:03:12.130> character

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
progress right now have character

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.500 
progress right now have character
dropping<00:03:13.150> into<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> water<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:18.300> we've<00:03:19.300> now

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
dropping into the water and we've now

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.180 
dropping into the water and we've now
finished<00:03:20.080> this<00:03:21.990> so<00:03:22.990> now<00:03:23.320> what<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.680> want<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.040> do

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
finished this so now what we want to do

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.590 
finished this so now what we want to do
is<00:03:24.430> play<00:03:24.880> some<00:03:25.300> water<00:03:25.540> blocks<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:28.330> course

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
is play some water blocks of course

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.820 
is play some water blocks of course
water<00:03:29.050> flows<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:29.890> eight<00:03:30.520> spaces<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.680> need<00:03:32.680> some

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
water flows for eight spaces I need some

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.870 
water flows for eight spaces I need some
dirt<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:36.250> we<00:03:36.370> go<00:03:38.340> and<00:03:39.340> that's<00:03:39.580> why

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
dirt and there we go and that's why

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:48.660 
dirt and there we go and that's why
we're<00:03:40.330> using<00:03:40.480> these<00:03:40.720> dimensions<00:03:46.980> so<00:03:47.980> we're

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
we're using these dimensions so we're

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.310 
we're using these dimensions so we're
just<00:03:48.700> going<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.120> do<00:03:49.360> this<00:03:49.570> for<00:03:50.260> each<00:03:50.410> lane<00:03:52.320> one

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
just going to do this for each lane one

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.870 
just going to do this for each lane one
more<00:03:53.530> to<00:03:53.710> go<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.160> there<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.210> are<00:03:56.460> so<00:03:57.460> the<00:03:57.670> water

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
more to go and there we are so the water

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.670 
more to go and there we are so the water
flow<00:03:58.300> will<00:03:58.510> stop<00:03:58.810> at<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.230> end<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.500> this

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
flow will stop at the end of this

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.199 
flow will stop at the end of this
harvester<00:04:00.930> but<00:04:01.930> we<00:04:02.680> want<00:04:02.890> the<00:04:03.010> Moscow<00:04:03.489> into

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
harvester but we want the Moscow into

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.470 
harvester but we want the Moscow into
one<00:04:04.420> general<00:04:04.810> collection<00:04:05.140> point<00:04:06.300> which<00:04:07.300> we're

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
one general collection point which we're

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.940 
one general collection point which we're
going<00:04:07.630> to<00:04:07.750> do<00:04:07.870> now<00:04:08.020> we're<00:04:08.200> going<00:04:08.350> to<00:04:08.440> dig<00:04:08.800> out

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
going to do now we're going to dig out

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.820 
going to do now we're going to dig out
this<00:04:09.100> lane<00:04:09.370> here

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.180 

and<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.850> could<00:04:14.060> just<00:04:14.270> leave<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.630> at<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:15.190> but

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
and you could just leave it at this but

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.130 
and you could just leave it at this but
we'd<00:04:16.820> rather<00:04:17.030> have<00:04:17.209> it<00:04:17.480> all<00:04:17.630> go<00:04:17.780> into<00:04:17.930> one

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
we'd rather have it all go into one

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.360 
we'd rather have it all go into one
place<00:04:18.260> wouldn't<00:04:18.709> way<00:04:19.390> so<00:04:20.390> we'll<00:04:20.660> make<00:04:20.870> it<00:04:20.900> so

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
place wouldn't way so we'll make it so

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
place wouldn't way so we'll make it so
this<00:04:22.370> is<00:04:22.580> too<00:04:22.850> deep<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.240> start<00:04:23.510> out<00:04:23.720> with<00:04:28.390> and

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
this is too deep to start out with and

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.930 
this is too deep to start out with and
now<00:04:30.050> we'll<00:04:30.620> place<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.890> water<00:04:31.250> source<00:04:31.640> block

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
now we'll place a water source block

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.920 
now we'll place a water source block
here<00:04:32.980> and<00:04:33.980> by<00:04:34.640> the<00:04:34.670> way<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.060> is<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.270> test<00:04:35.630> water

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
here and by the way this is a test water

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.390 
here and by the way this is a test water
that's<00:04:36.230> why<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.440> have<00:04:36.680> source<00:04:36.980> blocks<00:04:39.400> there

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
that's why I have source blocks there

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.310 
that's why I have source blocks there
are<00:04:40.580> no<00:04:40.790> actual<00:04:41.000> resources<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.990> this<00:04:42.140> world

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
are no actual resources on this world

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.960 
are no actual resources on this world
side<00:04:42.680> from<00:04:42.920> dirt<00:04:48.010> but<00:04:49.010> there<00:04:49.250> we<00:04:49.370> are<00:04:49.400> we<00:04:49.850> now

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
side from dirt but there we are we now

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.660 
side from dirt but there we are we now
have<00:04:50.000> that<00:04:50.330> done<00:04:50.770> of<00:04:51.770> course<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.310> looks<00:04:52.340> like

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
have that done of course it looks like

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.210 
have that done of course it looks like
it's<00:04:52.880> cascading<00:04:53.510> off<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.810> edge<00:04:53.930> but<00:04:54.260> that's

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
it's cascading off the edge but that's

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.830 
it's cascading off the edge but that's
irrelevant<00:04:55.400> if<00:04:55.910> you<00:04:56.060> look<00:04:56.240> one<00:04:56.420> more<00:04:56.450> deep

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
irrelevant if you look one more deep

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.910 
irrelevant if you look one more deep
then<00:04:57.110> you<00:04:57.290> wouldn't<00:04:57.560> get<00:04:57.650> that<00:04:57.710> effect<00:04:59.920> it

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
then you wouldn't get that effect it

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.410 
then you wouldn't get that effect it
looks<00:05:01.190> like<00:05:01.280> that<00:05:01.640> because<00:05:01.820> of<00:05:02.090> the<00:05:02.120> water

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
looks like that because of the water

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.860 
looks like that because of the water
lanes<00:05:02.840> but<00:05:03.260> we<00:05:03.710> can<00:05:03.890> just<00:05:04.010> ignore<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.870> so

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
lanes but we can just ignore that so

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.460 
lanes but we can just ignore that so
let's<00:05:06.290> move<00:05:06.500> on<00:05:06.940> we<00:05:07.940> now<00:05:08.120> need<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.450> place<00:05:09.290> the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
let's move on we now need to place the

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.190 
let's move on we now need to place the
cacti<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:09.980> course<00:05:10.540> I'm<00:05:11.540> just<00:05:11.780> going<00:05:11.990> to<00:05:12.050> do

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
cacti of course I'm just going to do

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.320 
cacti of course I'm just going to do
this<00:05:12.320> for<00:05:12.530> one<00:05:12.680> lane<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.190> then<00:05:13.330> transition

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
this for one lane and then transition

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.200 
this for one lane and then transition
out<00:05:15.310> because<00:05:16.310> the<00:05:16.490> rest<00:05:16.730> should<00:05:16.970> be

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
out because the rest should be

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.840 
out because the rest should be
self-explanatory<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:21.370> just<00:05:22.370> do<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.640> like

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
self-explanatory and just do it like

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.510 
self-explanatory and just do it like
this<00:05:23.150> and<00:05:23.650> here's<00:05:24.650> something<00:05:25.040> you<00:05:25.160> don't<00:05:25.310> want

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
this and here's something you don't want

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.190 
this and here's something you don't want
to<00:05:25.640> do<00:05:25.760> and<00:05:25.970> I've<00:05:26.090> seen<00:05:26.300> a<00:05:26.360> few<00:05:26.450> people<00:05:26.930> doing

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
to do and I've seen a few people doing

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.950 
to do and I've seen a few people doing
this<00:05:27.580> when<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.610> explain<00:05:29.090> it<00:05:29.240> to<00:05:29.360> them<00:05:29.450> in<00:05:29.570> text

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
this when I explain it to them in text

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.000 
this when I explain it to them in text
form<00:05:30.200> so<00:05:30.919> don't<00:05:31.280> do<00:05:31.400> it<00:05:31.430> like<00:05:31.669> that<00:05:31.730> as<00:05:33.010> that

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
form so don't do it like that as that

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.400 
form so don't do it like that as that
