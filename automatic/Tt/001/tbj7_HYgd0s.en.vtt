00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
one of the future upgrades I'll probably

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.689 
one of the future upgrades I'll probably
add<00:05:48.580> to<00:05:48.610> this<00:05:48.880> probably<00:05:49.630> for<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:49.930> different

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
add to this probably for the different

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.460
