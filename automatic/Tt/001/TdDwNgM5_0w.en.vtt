00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
the size of your cog and it spits out

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.160 
the size of your cog and it spits out
how<00:01:02.559> many<00:01:02.620> gear<00:01:03.100> inches<00:01:03.579> you<00:01:03.850> are<00:01:03.879> pushing<00:01:04.180> the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
how many gear inches you are pushing the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.170 
how many gear inches you are pushing the
higher<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.740> number<00:01:05.770> the<00:01:06.280> harder<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.030> is<00:01:07.119> to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
higher the number the harder it is to

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.330 
higher the number the harder it is to
push<00:01:07.570> but<00:01:08.170> your<00:01:08.350> bike<00:01:08.530> goes<00:01:08.770> farther<00:01:09.039> with

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
push but your bike goes farther with

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.760 
push but your bike goes farther with
each<00:01:09.580> pedal<00:01:09.850> stroke<00:01:10.270> the<00:01:10.899> lower<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.410> number

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
each pedal stroke the lower the number

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.800 
each pedal stroke the lower the number
the<00:01:11.950> easier<00:01:12.520> it<00:01:12.610> is<00:01:12.670> to<00:01:12.729> pedal<00:01:13.149> but<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.539> won't

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
the easier it is to pedal but you won't

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.529 
the easier it is to pedal but you won't
be<00:01:13.929> going<00:01:14.080> as<00:01:14.320> far<00:01:14.500> per<00:01:14.920> stroke<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:15.759> generally

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
be going as far per stroke so generally

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.810 
be going as far per stroke so generally
speaking<00:01:17.020> a<00:01:17.229> mid-range<00:01:17.740> gear<00:01:18.100> ratio<00:01:18.490> would<00:01:18.759> be

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
speaking a mid-range gear ratio would be

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.510 
speaking a mid-range gear ratio would be
about<00:01:19.149> 70<00:01:19.810> gear<00:01:20.080> inches<00:01:20.500> if<00:01:20.710> you're<00:01:21.220> trying<00:01:21.460> to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
about 70 gear inches if you're trying to

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.969 
about 70 gear inches if you're trying to
smash<00:01:21.880> on<00:01:22.060> a<00:01:22.119> flat<00:01:22.360> road<00:01:22.630> or<00:01:22.840> go<00:01:22.990> downhill<00:01:23.320> go

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
smash on a flat road or go downhill go

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:25.830 
smash on a flat road or go downhill go
something<00:01:24.550> go<00:01:24.820> with<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:24.970> higher<00:01:25.270> ratio<00:01:25.570> of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
something go with a higher ratio of

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.990 
something go with a higher ratio of
something<00:01:26.140> around<00:01:26.229> 80<00:01:26.590> gear<00:01:26.920> inches<00:01:27.369> or<00:01:27.610> maybe

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
something around 80 gear inches or maybe

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.149 
something around 80 gear inches or maybe
even<00:01:28.090> more<00:01:28.420> if<00:01:28.690> you're<00:01:29.259> climbing<00:01:29.710> hills<00:01:29.890> you

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
even more if you're climbing hills you

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.490 
even more if you're climbing hills you
want<00:01:30.369> a<00:01:30.430> lower<00:01:30.729> ratio<00:01:31.000> something<00:01:31.720> under<00:01:32.049> 70

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
want a lower ratio something under 70

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.260 
want a lower ratio something under 70
gear<00:01:32.770> inches<00:01:33.009> if<00:01:33.430> you<00:01:33.640> want<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.939> reach<00:01:34.119> a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
gear inches if you want to reach a

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.630 
gear inches if you want to reach a
higher<00:01:34.540> top<00:01:34.900> speed<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.650> easiest<00:01:36.130> way<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.369> do

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
higher top speed the easiest way to do

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.850 
higher top speed the easiest way to do
this<00:01:36.670> would<00:01:37.030> be<00:01:37.060> to<00:01:37.240> switch<00:01:37.869> out<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.320> rear<00:01:38.560> cog

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
this would be to switch out the rear cog

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.100 
this would be to switch out the rear cog
for<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:39.250> smaller<00:01:39.549> one<00:01:39.790> again<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.720> makes<00:01:40.930> it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
for a smaller one again this makes it

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.780 
for a smaller one again this makes it
more<00:01:41.259> difficult<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.799> pedal<00:01:42.220> but<00:01:42.369> your<00:01:42.520> top

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
more difficult to pedal but your top

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.270 
more difficult to pedal but your top
speed<00:01:43.060> will<00:01:43.479> be<00:01:43.659> higher<00:01:43.689> I<00:01:44.229> hope<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:45.100> that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
speed will be higher I hope that that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.039 
speed will be higher I hope that that
