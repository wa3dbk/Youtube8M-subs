them<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.020> was<00:01:55.170> something<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
them and that was something that I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.280 
them and that was something that I
hadn't<00:01:56.340> experienced<00:01:56.909> before<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.509> was

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
hadn't experienced before and was

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.249 
hadn't experienced before and was
refreshing<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.840> energizing<00:02:00.840> really<00:02:01.110> because

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
refreshing and energizing really because

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.380 
refreshing and energizing really because
we<00:02:01.439> felt<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.979> had<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:03.000> something<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
we felt that we had really something to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.899 
we felt that we had really something to
contribute<00:02:03.990> what<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.250> do<00:02:05.430> feel<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
contribute what we really do feel is

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.089 
contribute what we really do feel is
that<00:02:06.119> teachers<00:02:06.600> work<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.350> learn<00:02:07.500> best<00:02:07.799> from

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
that teachers work and learn best from

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.820 
that teachers work and learn best from
other<00:02:08.459> teachers<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.929> tried<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> include

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
other teachers so we tried to include

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.390 
other teachers so we tried to include
that

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.929 
that
the<00:02:11.579> main<00:02:11.760> feature<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.450> CPD<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.519> kind<00:02:14.790> of

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:14.939 
the main feature of CPD so the kind of

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.819 
the main feature of CPD so the kind of
strategies<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.689> would<00:02:15.959> use<00:02:16.170> would<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.620> to

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
strategies that we would use would be to

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.399 
strategies that we would use would be to
pair<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.640> teachers<00:02:18.209> so<00:02:18.900> that<00:02:19.079> they<00:02:19.230> would

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
pair up teachers so that they would

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.979 
pair up teachers so that they would
actually<00:02:19.849> observe<00:02:20.849> each<00:02:21.000> other<00:02:21.269> they<00:02:21.900> would

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
actually observe each other they would

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.750 
actually observe each other they would
monitor<00:02:22.319> what's<00:02:22.650> happened<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.430> would<00:02:23.549> learn

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
monitor what's happened they would learn

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.600 
monitor what's happened they would learn
to<00:02:23.790> give<00:02:24.120> feedback<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:25.620> also<00:02:25.769> have<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> whole

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
to give feedback we also have a whole

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.270 
to give feedback we also have a whole
range<00:02:26.879> of<00:02:27.060> other<00:02:27.180> activities<00:02:27.959> which<00:02:28.769> include

problems in a creative way really
developing<00:03:55.680> their<00:03:55.889> thinking<00:03:56.310> skills<00:03:56.699> and<00:03:57.680> we

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
developing their thinking skills and we

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.319 
developing their thinking skills and we
actually<00:03:59.040> came<00:03:59.250> up<00:03:59.310> with<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.639> idea<00:03:59.940> together

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
actually came up with the idea together

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.289 
actually came up with the idea together
that<00:04:00.690> we<00:04:00.780> would<00:04:01.079> produce<00:04:01.620> some<00:04:02.040> story<00:04:02.370> sacks

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
that we would produce some story sacks

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.059 
that we would produce some story sacks
I<00:04:03.329> think<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.810> pupils<00:04:04.199> gain<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.500> lot<00:04:04.769> from

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
I think the pupils gain a lot from

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.189 
I think the pupils gain a lot from
having<00:04:05.310> teachers<00:04:06.000> who<00:04:06.239> come<00:04:06.659> back<00:04:06.810> into<00:04:07.049> the

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
having teachers who come back into the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.960 
having teachers who come back into the
classroom<00:04:07.319> really<00:04:07.859> energized<00:04:08.310> by<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:08.729> work

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
classroom really energized by the work

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.180 
classroom really energized by the work
they've<00:04:09.209> been<00:04:09.239> doing<00:04:09.769> they've<00:04:10.769> had<00:04:10.919> a<00:04:10.949> lot<00:04:11.159> of

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
they've been doing they've had a lot of

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.309 
they've been doing they've had a lot of
opportunities<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:11.970> discuss<00:04:12.449> children's<00:04:13.139> work

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
opportunities to discuss children's work

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.550 
opportunities to discuss children's work
mini<00:04:13.680> refocus

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
mini refocus

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.680 
mini refocus
what<00:04:14.950> it<00:04:15.069> is<00:04:15.220> children<00:04:15.370> need<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.090> do<00:04:16.239> to

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
what it is children need to do to

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.620 
what it is children need to do to
improve<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.609> think<00:04:18.850> when<00:04:19.150> they<00:04:19.269> come<00:04:19.299> back

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
improve so I think when they come back

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.379 
improve so I think when they come back
into<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.019> class<00:04:20.230> the<00:04:20.980> children<00:04:21.549> really<00:04:21.820> pick

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
into the class the children really pick

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.200 
into the class the children really pick
up<00:04:22.480> a<00:04:22.630> sense<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:23.230> the<00:04:23.680> fact<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.070> their<00:04:24.430> their

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
up a sense of the fact that their their

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.300 
up a sense of the fact that their their
work<00:04:25.240> it's<00:04:25.780> really<00:04:25.840> valued<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.830> somebody's

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
work it's really valued that somebody's

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.520 
work it's really valued that somebody's
really<00:04:27.700> taking<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.389> time<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.960> reflect<00:04:29.260> and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
really taking the time to reflect and

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:37.379 
really taking the time to reflect and
analyze<00:04:30.100> how<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.850> help<00:04:31.300> them<00:04:31.540> move<00:04:31.780> forward<00:04:36.389> if

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
analyze how to help them move forward if

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.260 
analyze how to help them move forward if
our<00:04:37.660> teachers<00:04:38.200> learn<00:04:38.440> then<00:04:38.820> when<00:04:39.820> they<00:04:40.000> come

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
our teachers learn then when they come

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.790 
our teachers learn then when they come
back<00:04:40.450> from<00:04:40.690> learn<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.230> they<00:04:41.350> can<00:04:41.560> teach<00:04:41.770> us

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
back from learn and they can teach us

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.490 
back from learn and they can teach us
new<00:04:42.340> things<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:43.030> like<00:04:43.600> things<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.110> we

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
new things and like things that we

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.680 
new things and like things that we
haven't<00:04:44.680> learned<00:04:45.070> like<00:04:45.610> new<00:04:45.970> ways<00:04:46.240> of<00:04:46.480> doing

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
haven't learned like new ways of doing

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:47.400 
haven't learned like new ways of doing
things

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
things

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.310 
things
my<00:04:47.880> favorite<00:04:48.880> way<00:04:49.000> of<00:04:49.030> lunge<00:04:49.360> listening

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
my favorite way of lunge listening

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.670 
my favorite way of lunge listening
because<00:04:51.180> if<00:04:52.180> he<00:04:52.389> went<00:04:52.600> out<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:53.290> like<00:04:53.440> play

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
because if he went out to like play

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.469 
because if he went out to like play
football<00:04:53.979> yeah<00:04:54.310> and<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.000> were<00:04:55.120> like<00:04:55.300> you

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
football yeah and you were like you

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.570 
football yeah and you were like you
didn't<00:04:55.810> really<00:04:55.900> play<00:04:56.169> it<00:04:56.229> but<00:04:56.500> then<00:04:56.710> he<00:04:57.400> like

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
didn't really play it but then he like

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.420 
didn't really play it but then he like
really<00:04:57.880> wanted<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:58.479> play<00:04:58.630> it<00:04:58.889> and<00:04:59.889> then<00:05:00.220> if

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
really wanted to play it and then if

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.030 
really wanted to play it and then if
there's<00:05:00.820> someone<00:05:01.120> coaching<00:05:01.690> if<00:05:02.350> you<00:05:02.530> just<00:05:02.740> ask

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040

there's someone coaching if you just ask
them<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.850> then<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:04.150> listen<00:05:04.419> to<00:05:04.810> them<00:05:04.990> they

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560

learning<00:05:10.570> actually<00:05:11.110> touches<00:05:11.830> everybody

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
learning actually touches everybody

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.270 
learning actually touches everybody
that's<00:05:12.460> part<00:05:12.790> of<00:05:12.940> this<00:05:13.150> school<00:05:13.450> it's

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
that's part of this school it's

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.980 
that's part of this school it's
important<00:05:15.280> from<00:05:15.700> when<00:05:16.270> they<00:05:16.419> start<00:05:16.690> in<00:05:16.870> the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
important from when they start in the

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.980 
important from when they start in the
nursery<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:18.130> actually<00:05:19.030> talk<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:19.360> them<00:05:19.660> about

nursery to actually talk to them about

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.980 
nursery to actually talk to them about
your<00:05:20.200> learning<00:05:20.430> about<00:05:21.430> trying<00:05:21.940> to<00:05:22.030> find<00:05:22.300> the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
your learning about trying to find the

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.080 
your learning about trying to find the
most<00:05:23.320> successful<00:05:23.950> ways<00:05:24.130> that<00:05:24.460> children<00:05:24.880> learn

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
most successful ways that children learn

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.529 
most successful ways that children learn
and<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:26.500> actually<00:05:27.120> communicate<00:05:28.120> with<00:05:28.150> parents

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
and to actually communicate with parents

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.029 
and to actually communicate with parents
about<00:05:29.050> what<00:05:29.229> we<00:05:29.350> know<00:05:29.530> about<00:05:29.710> their

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
about what we know about their

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.890 
about what we know about their
children's<00:05:30.400> learning<00:05:30.610> but<00:05:31.360> also<00:05:31.600> to

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
children's learning but also to

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.690 
children's learning but also to
incorporate<00:05:32.620> what<00:05:32.770> they<00:05:32.979> know<00:05:33.220> about<00:05:33.370> their

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
incorporate what they know about their

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.880 
incorporate what they know about their
children's<00:05:34.090> learning<00:05:34.300> so<00:05:35.080> that<00:05:35.320> learning<00:05:35.560> is

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
children's learning so that learning is

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.159 
children's learning so that learning is
successful<00:05:36.580> throughout<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.180> school<00:05:37.450> what<00:05:38.050> we

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
successful throughout the school what we

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.710 
successful throughout the school what we
feel<00:05:38.410> is<00:05:38.680> is<00:05:38.950> that<00:05:39.700> you<00:05:40.030> have<00:05:40.180> a<00:05:40.210> culture<00:05:40.690> of

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
feel is is that you have a culture of

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.230 
feel is is that you have a culture of
learning<00:05:41.020> if<00:05:41.620> we<00:05:41.890> have<00:05:42.190> a<00:05:42.220> culture<00:05:42.760> of<00:05:42.940> self

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
learning if we have a culture of self

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.719 
learning if we have a culture of self
improving<00:05:43.930> then<00:05:44.470> what<00:05:44.680> we<00:05:44.830> need<00:05:45.039> to<00:05:45.430> include

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
improving then what we need to include

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.980 
improving then what we need to include
is<00:05:46.120> all<00:05:46.360> stuff<00:05:46.750> within<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.260> school<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.840> role
