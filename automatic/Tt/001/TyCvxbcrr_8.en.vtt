00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.520
 AB Jun is the perfect combination of A and B but it is unpredictable 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.960
 Everyone has their own personality, everyone is friendly. 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.100

 The experience of free participation next week is ceramic art try to make tea bowls. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.830
 Children's shoes that are interested in the material cost of clay will remember to bring two thousand yen next time. 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.020
 Good~ 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.020
 It is very expensive to feed the clay for two thousand yen. 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.880
 I just bought a game yesterday and I’m not talking to my mother. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.830
 Well, I also prepaid the pocket money yesterday to buy a game card. 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.040
 So are you both not ready to go to the next week’s experience? 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.780
 This is so good, let’s deliberately forget to bring the material fee together. 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.500
 How about learning to learn? 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.600

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.510
 No, right? 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.210
 If you dare to betray us, you will not play with you. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.790
 Do not accompany you to play the game without accompanying you to the toilet 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.800
 Do you understand? Understand, you know. 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.060
 Although I am sorry, the teacher can only do this. 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.050
 One week later 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.630
 Hey, you paid. 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.740
 Because the teacher must have prepared the clay 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.780
 It’s not good if you don’t pay the material fee. 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.040
 A type is handed over. 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 Good boy paper good child paper 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 Why are old jokes? 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.670
 material fee? Ah, I forgot it. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.190
 What to do, ah, trouble, die, type A, you pay for me. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.330
 What a joke? 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.170
 B type Jun completely forgot. 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.380
 Sure enough, what do we do? 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.380
 A type of Jun paid us also pay? 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.260
 In fact, do I have money to come to Jerusalem? 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.730
 Hello AB type, what are you going to do? 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.620
 I have already handed it over. 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.310
 Why did you pay it without a word? 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.060
 Have you not paid yet? 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.700
 What materials do you bring? 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.510
 Yes, the teacher, I brought the money. 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.780
 Ok, everyone is all right. 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.190
 B type Jun has not yet paid ~ 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.590
 This anime does not advocate the character of the person according to the blood type. 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.660
 If a friend does not keep his promise 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.590
 Don't blame the blood type 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.710
 It is very likely that he is more forgetful~
