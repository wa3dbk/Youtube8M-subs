00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:12.119
 I have since 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.559
 and the racer again thought about how I can solve the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.079
 The only solution that occurred to me was to move his stable 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.230
 the special in Japan is Vettel's team had been reports 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.360
 the possible problems of free-range the heavy use of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.020
 surfaces 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 Percent good a day 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.900
 which do not have the disorder of the sod hub at this attitude 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.720
 we can have the rising copper prices and that's the name 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.720
 decent 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.360
 a grown area he directly in stone at area 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.100
 it is at your disposal 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.310
 come into force in the fall of the European top-league hold and the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.730
 German implementation of the Legenden Haltungsverordnung 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.810
 however Germany 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.160
 important said and abolished April 2006 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.910
 That is, percent of female players holders will orient themselves in new ones 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.840
 Housing systems and free-range management is just the housing system that also for 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 consumer 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.540
 is estimated and what the highest prices achieved 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.459
 For ten days, I've played the stage a bit 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.010
 but now it is time after 40 years 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.190
 Schenk is one of those that destroys the grass or beats it 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.190
 with 14 days the stable is at the next place 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.609
 so in this particular case it is nothing comparable 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:35.179
 no job that is able to do it regularly so say every 14 days 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.249
 for example, to continue without it being a big hassle it is 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:40.199
 were 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.589
 especially here when it comes to free range of chickens 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:48.269
 we need the technology that creates the framework for us 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.139
 outside and we too as farmers can
