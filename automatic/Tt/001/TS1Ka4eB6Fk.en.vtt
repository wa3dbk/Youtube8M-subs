 so often but also for free this is there 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.589
 l probably the biggest competitors right now in abundance 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.299
 Chile and the New York Red Sox big course 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.319
 easy to recognize after the first 50 meters at the red bar of the cap 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.729
 she dives her first on the moments there so Dinko Jukic goes mad 

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.729
 however, he still lays down 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.599

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.180
 as RTL lose for the second time against an Austrian that is the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 big question 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.480
 still informs Russell Dinko Jukic but now looks year 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.480
 second 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.519

 the last 50 meters 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.060
 doth's leader, however, is almost sixth, but I hate him 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.049
 which also Dr 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.620

 also over 200 meters Delphin Dieter Burmeister does not look like it 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:40.269
 could Renault Smolensk was clearly ahead of whether the tour was almost not 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.229
 So before they know about 800 percent browser is the big one 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.999
 Question the car broke but thinks there 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:51.180
 Horst himself 200 meters dolphin in each case an ALG II the mastery 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:04:01.479
 very strong performance of Pen Tulio is fast as well so TT RS was certainly 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.479
 did not want to be fourth 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.359
 Moses here neither behind the Austrian 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.859
 take the placement Dinko Jukic took out Euro

 in new Austrian driver about time of 1 50 32 by almost one and a half 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.850
 Seconds he improved his own old record 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.919
 Almost a year he is with a strong finish displacing Dinko Jukic still on 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.340
 But third place 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.340
 the question Ober 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.569
 that was in the corner of the eye is not possible 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.389
 but still
