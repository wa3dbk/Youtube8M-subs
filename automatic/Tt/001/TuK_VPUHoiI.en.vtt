00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.000
 so good evening to all means 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.950
 I will make a short sketch like this 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.750
 means I would like to show the flute 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.230
 how does she lead in her work 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.390
 even everyone works will not highlight in general 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.750
 so visible 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.750
 to enter 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.279
 all this fat work is now being screened 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:31.570
 heads temperature 774 quietly 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:35.489
 droplet power 800 watts eight hundred 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.489
 toll beats bukhara water boiler 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.860
 dephlegmator regular from two in one 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.340
 connected as we see the cooling system 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.769
 pneumatic fittings like flutes 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:01:00.909
 which leads which is love here 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:01:02.290
 fitting fittings take for example here 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.680
 for example means 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.580
 pay attention from my fittings and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.200
 no fum tapes 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.800
 and nothing flows because I'm fittings 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.979
 I took these here, so they see here 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.720
 gasket put silicone residue 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:24.940
 fum-tapes you see silicone 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.220
 laying and all and no huge here 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.369
 of these skeins of fum tapes like they do 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.399
 Winner flash drunk Chinese fitting 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.490
 I do not know what brass or a little shorter 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:38.409
 cheap crap bought in china here 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.420
 This all hoses, too, bought in China 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.880
 Here are these fittings for ordering here. 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.979
 why I had ordered this fitting 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.119
 the maximum is twisted like this 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.970
 one and a half two turns 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:51.670
 more and more these are not twisting 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.049
 fittings as we see quite successfully 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.869
 Suitable for system 2 in one and quite 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.640
 successfully applied 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.860
 Well, the flute is straightforward in general, the trial process and 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.190
 super process 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:14.470
 candle downturn in the 3rd century before the little plates are played 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:19.620
 see how here is a lively bitch 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.800
 I will turn and caps in the cube 80 degrees 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:28.330
 heads are going to the well at 43 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.400
 little by little I take away a little here 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.520
 there is no rush 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.390
 I will add now in principle, as I understand it 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.520
 that regular not refluxer more or less 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.730
 copes but still not until the end 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.620
 To push it constantly jumps 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.900
 process to ensure that she was in 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.440
 equilibrium flasks all phlegm was returning 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:56.950
 back to the cube of this it does not achieve 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:03:01.230
 Well that's not get all continue our 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.780
 experiments so we continue the video here 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.400
 she took heads mean on heads here 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.180
 An interesting feature of this was 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.190
 sorry lanterns upper plate 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.850
 I would almost stop blaming 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.780
 that is, so here he divided the factions 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.900
 to pour in ceased 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.930
 the most interesting thing is that theoretically 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.459
 This dephlegmator copes but very 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.860
 high water consumption is therefore needed 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.709
 sleeve water there own well and you 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.350
 pofigu theoretically but here again 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.400
 cooling do the top flow here 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.610
 hose 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.620
 but by this we adjust by the way 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.470
 interesting feature we open it 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.280
 And it seems to be like an idea of ​​a reflux dish 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.620
 should quickly empty a 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.299
 the temperature on the contrary it is the beginning 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.150
 dephlegmator and fall why because 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:58.840
 faster wall cools a little bit now 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.620
 Reduce the temperature should be somewhere so so 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:08.380
 79 degrees was about 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.980
 what performance do we see before what 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:16.650
 post so showing 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:18.540
 but somewhere around 88 degrees he goes 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.100
 slowly increasing ie the body 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.560
 we will take a look already dug half a liter 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:31.440
 This is by the way generally not very small 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:33.660
 juice so the column works fine well 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.889
 Of course, you need to get used a little 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.729
 get used need in general of course beauty 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.900
 you can sit and meditate and it seems 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:49.260
 all owners of such columns do 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.370
 continue so here we look 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:57.479
 temperature 70 92 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:02.160
 dice 88 that's what dripped in less than 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:05.310
 hour 2 600 that is somewhere really well 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.210
 mourned the power is well really 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.780
 3 liters per hour but three-inch 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.360
 flute 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:16.889
 you can give so alcohol position is 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.620
 here it is somewhere in the area there 88 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:25.320
 eighty seven and a half thats mean 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.360
 cold cold that is principle in 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.840
 principle, if you do not mind the water again 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:35.310
 I repeat from 2 1 by the way it gave 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.910
 I’m ready to order one system 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.000
 flanch 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.760
 three inches to a little less well become 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.940
 us because I'm not very amateur 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.870
 tall distillation columns here deal 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.760
 not at altitude after all of heat and mass transfer 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.389
 let's not say in the separation surfaces 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:57.810
 so here the height is not needed in general 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:01.710
 something like this well, tails will go more 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:04.860
 I’ll show you a little 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.990
 experiment from scored 3 liters time 9 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.430
 let's see what performance y 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.370
 see him for an hour for how much 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:14.169
 I have half a liter of perekida 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.779
 somewhere calculation his body must be 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.509
 This is 4 Well, now let's see how much 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:25.569
 and dig half a pound to her already then 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:29.919
 clarity so look it took 10 minutes plus 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:34.270
 minus and here we were dripping half a liter too 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:36.639
 plus the principle of performance 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.699
 we understand yes we have about 3 liters in 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.770
 an hour here comes another body somewhere around me 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:45.930
 selective settlement will be medicinal 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.969
 big and then we'll see on the fence and 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.400
 so here I have selected 3 liters I had 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:56.439
 jar and somewhere here the detail is hang 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:58.870
 but by the smell already starting a little bit already 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.490
 begin to appear tails selection decided 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.759
 do not take 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:06.069
 so what can I say in the whole apparatus 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:09.599
 it turned out worthy to go out still gurgles 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:14.979
 a little bit there those remaining 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:18.009
 well it is not turned off and more steam goes steam 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:21.599
 water jacket here still saves 

00:07:18.009 --> 00:07:26.620
 the general warmth of the apparatus was decent 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:30.039
 I think I will reconnect a product I will hold a little 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:33.129
 barrels and already broke any 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:35.949
 the final opinion so the apparatus 

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:37.420
 Decent order support 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.660
 domestic manufacturer 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.660
 telef
