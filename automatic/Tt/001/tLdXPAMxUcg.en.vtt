00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.260
 quiet things are really better 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.880
 that we got into a little hole 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.830
 too big at first not with that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.920
 419 but since then the team is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.780
 10 4 good very very happy how 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.340
 things are coming out the team is 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.559
 playing better we are more competitive 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.200
 we lose parties of course we are not 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.380
 the best team in the nba but but 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.140
 different totally a different way 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.210
 of losing a different way of playing 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.910
 good especially at the beginning 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.290
 from the last 14,000 of matches that 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.160
 there are no changes I am not being a holder 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.360
 all that time but I think I said 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.610
 until someone says otherwise or 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.949
 until that day of handovers and rumors 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.170
 get your raptors player and what 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.540
 that I said recently trying to be the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.710
 best professional of the nba I'm going to do 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.090
 my work in each training in each 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 party so that my team that now 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.590
 same in the data win and that nothing else 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.150
 if I can not control anything else that 's what 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530
 only I can control and I already have 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.250
 today I am very happy with how he has 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.020
 things went out and from day 11 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.830
 I think that right now my head only 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.780
 we were 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.580
 continue here I think it's more than the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.800
 I respect what I have in this league there and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.170
 good and now that I do not miss the 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.310
 head is something that the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.930
 situation first season there 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.630
 will paint well but then to go to Spain 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.090
 that's why I'm not very happy here is the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.810
 super respected by rivals for 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.150
 coaches for everything that is what 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.920
 important as well with much 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.140
 quiet when the time comes 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.220
 Well, we'll start to think, it's also not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.720
 true that now we have a month still 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.190
 that there will be many more rumors of 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.990
 probably fit the theme that 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.190
 my contract does not end and it is not for the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.310
 fact of playing well or badly is by the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.440
 fact of the situation and the departure and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.960
 we'll see what I think is more than ever 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.880
 a day and well then that keep doing 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.280
 my job and that kind of rumors of 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.660
 things because it has nothing to do with me 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.550
 I can not control it, it's something that 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.550
 He tried to put apart the most
