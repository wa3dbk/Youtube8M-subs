00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.089
 Hello, my name is Marcelinho, I'm working on the newest disney movie. 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.500
 coiled today let's draw the bus when the fox is pakistan let's 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.249
 begin 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.009
 the first thing we're going to do is draw a ball 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.339
 then we'll pass a line right in the middle 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.100
 just to get an idea of ​​proportions 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.190
 We're going to make another ball. 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.630
 here's gonna be a wolf with the archer 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.630
 a little pig left 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.690
 percent on the first 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.580
 outside 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.040
 At first the ball we'll start 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.590
 to draw his nose 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.309
 then we'll draw the right eye pascal 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.459
 without forgetting that he should stay on the other side of the nose 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.839
 it will look like the sunset just above the horizon 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 of the five 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.750
 now it's time to think about the rumor of pascoal 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.410
 the pivot of this year of good humor as it would be good if I had a gift 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.260
 for him 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.700
 shaking 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.100
 so I'll raise his eyebrows as if I'm 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.700
 smiling happy 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 we make the eyebrow 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.409
 silva 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.679
 and then in the right eye we draw a similar shape only that smaller 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.650
 now the details 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.790
 remember that this calmer but competent weapon 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.170
 as you draw from the south 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.860
 let's draw the upper eyelid 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.860
 and here when drilling lower 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.410
 here they will meet 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.410
 at the point where the upper eyelid touches the eye 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.040
 so we arrived 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.900
 the mysterious part of the drawing 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.359
 which is the placement of the coconut trees 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.799
 it's mysterious 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.799
 because the way we draw the pupils 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.709
 drawing begins to create life 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.950
 I'm going to put a small nostril but we'll put one because the other is 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.149
 completely doomed the other side 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:29.329
 and we have to think of three dimensions 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.500
 I want you to go back to the regional circle to 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.589
 what goes 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.959
 look like a shark's fin 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.099
 he is 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.900
 kind of kicked so I'll start drawing the mouth after the nose 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.709
 government aid 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.449
 the smile ii 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.449
 the mouth between the boxes 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.879
 I'll finally draw the chin. 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.259
 crossing the regional ball as 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:05.909
 and partner 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.939
 to return to the reginal cake and draw as if it were an angle downward 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:14.759
 smoke 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.619
 Chameleons have a leftover skin falling off what they did 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.729
 so 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.429
 folks 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.429
 ends up going down in the head 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:34.889
 and this is how it is designed pascoal 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.279
 I hope you enjoyed it as much as I was there. Do not forget. 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:41.279
 if we discount the last season 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:50.549
 for
