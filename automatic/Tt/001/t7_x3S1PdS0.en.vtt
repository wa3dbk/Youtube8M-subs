00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 what spirits bern of this murder of 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.940
 minecraft pocket edition today is on 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.859
 channel of amy petals to take you in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.990
 really very interesting way 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.540
 I'm talking about the armor status mode 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.059
 marco and is already guessed from the title this 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.400
 way introduces us to the species of feeling 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.400
 so to speak the statistics of ours 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.949
 weapons or armor we wear as well 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.359
 we keep the gui selected below 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.580
 the fact that you see below is a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.670
 species of zero near the pad 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.060
 apple store fresh with here too 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.219
 of 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.719
 so when we're going to wear 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.270
 our armor was made immediately 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.309
 see credit just worn there 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.980
 will show nothing when we click 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.620
 refresh true update of things 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.110
 as the network will come out all the 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.520
 statistics of ours of ours 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.590
 armor they had in fact worn 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.710
 on the net the diamond bodice indicates 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.699
 which has a life of 529 of ours 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.660
 shorts about 226 of our pd in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.520
 78 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 obviously this also works for the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.769
 to weapons over type maybe a sword does 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.549
 fear the real facts select the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.320
 sword that at the bottom 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.060
 we click refresh as it had 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.900
 flash updated tonight as well 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.130
 indicates the value is the life we ​​say of the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.170
 our sword but obviously when 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.909
 we're going to use it against maybe a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 mobo when we go type digging 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.140
 obviously it will decrease our way maybe 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.990
 I want to find some animals for 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 show precisely functioning work 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.860
 every time we wound refrain that a 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.810
 kind of if I dig his net 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.360
 of the green refresh football update 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.770
 indeed decreased durability a 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.390
 fashion is not interesting a little thing 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.119
 ugly and refresh button 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.950
 it would be nice if you would reason 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.110
 alone every time we buy a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.909
 action the network now I went to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.680
 crash let's refresh like 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.770
 you see we lost some durability 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.020
 of the mature and notebook on the right path 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.970
 maybe some updates come 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.430
 something very nice when maybe 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.979
 I don't even know if it's possible that if 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.719
 days alone every time safe nose 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.219
 that you can still do spray then 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.930
 vast world you enjoyed and remember 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.790
 I write songs from the written centuries of 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.759
 leave a nice like if you have I believe 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.759
