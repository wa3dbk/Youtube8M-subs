00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.349
 fantasy point of trees this is one of 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.970
 the most beautiful fantasy spots because 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.750
 we have a series of small trees 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.710
 what are they going 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.170
 online and completely decorate the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.830
 stitch this sample I made it with 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:42.840
 multiples of 7 or I made three reasons 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:46.980
 every little tree see this little tree is a 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.430
 reason that reason has seven points and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 the two edge the first one that is passed 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 without knitting the last one that is always going to 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.310
 woven by both the law and the 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.270
 reverse 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.489
 therefore in this sample I will 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:10.130
 I have three reasons 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:14.060
 that is, I made 23 points 21 of the three 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.899
 reasons and add both the first and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.329
 the last one the sample is not reversible 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:23.750
 it goes out only by the right all 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.670
 these saplings leave by the right 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.460
 being very nice in any 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.710
 application that you want to give 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.280
 after having meshed or assembled 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.200
 the stitches once I started the stitch 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.090
 forward all these races so that 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.940
 you see how pretty the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.610
 stitch then now step by step let's go 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.740
 to start explaining they have to 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.259
 keep in mind that it is targeted has 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:54.180
 only four races that are the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.110
 that are repeated throughout the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.490
 woven the first 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.360
 we passed the edge point and then 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.670
 we make two setbacks one right one setback 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:17.330
 two setbacks after five points in a point 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:19.220
 right 2345 that's all 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.330
 in the first race that is repeated 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:28.360
 always then we are doing the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.360
 first race that are two babies 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:40.050
 and 1 2 3 4 and 5 in right point 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.280
 two points backwards 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.819
 and 5 points 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.090
 on the right point that is the first 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.600
 race the last point as I told you is 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.900
 the edge the edge is always done in a 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.959
 right point in this point 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.099
 we go for the second race the second 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.099
 career as it is 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.370
 we make the edge 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.970
 and we do the opposite we do now 5 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.970
 reverse 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.360
 1 2 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.360
 3 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.780
 45 points in reverse point 2 points in the 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.239
 right point you are going to see how it is going 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.239
 leaving stitch 5 backwards 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.680
 that's why this stitch is so easy 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.019
 and so pretty two backwards 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.730
 we do both rights and the five 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.730
 setbacks 1 1 2 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.170
 45 reverse 2 rights 1 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.620
 two rights the last point goes in a 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.110
 right point let's go for the third 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.110
 race that we do in the third 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.870
 eye race we passed the edge 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.650
 then we make two points in 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.650
 backhand point 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.050
 after that we make two points together 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.790
 in right point the points together in 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.150
 right stitch a lacing 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:24.470
 a right 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:28.640
 a loop and we passed a point without knitting 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.370
 we weave the next one in right point and 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:36.050
 we passed the thread that we did not weave 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:39.800
 on top of the thread that we wove from there 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.870
 it is fitting perfectly and there it ends 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.820
 design 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.780
 we repeat it because remember that 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.200
 We have three designs in this sample 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.600
 then we are going to make two setbacks 12 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.460
 setbacks more true later to 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.620
 continuation of the two setbacks we do 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.620
 two points together at a right point 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:07.670
 a loop from left to right a 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.450
 right point a loop and then 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:14.210
 we passed a point putting the needle 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.340
 between the point not like that but because of 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:19.340
 Half of the point is passed to the needle 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:22.610
 on the right we weave the one that follows in a 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:27.129
 right point and we passed the point that no 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:30.099
 knit over and there if we let go 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:35.050
 there I finished the following design we go back 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:39.220
 and we make the third two points backwards 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:44.640
 to start or not two reverse points 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.640
 two points together at a right point 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:54.360
 a loop 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:58.570
 a woven in a right a loop and 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:02.770
 we finished with we passed the point without 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.880
 we knit we knit the next point we 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.330
 we return and we pass the nonwoven point 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.960
 over the tissue and we ended up with a 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:16.770
 right point to point 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:20.190
 ok now we go for the last race the 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.590
 fourth and last race 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:26.400
 from our fantasy point of trees 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:29.390
 as it becomes very simple in that we do 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:32.280
 the edge point and we make it 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.100
 exactly the same as race number 2 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:44.360
 What are they 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:48.639
 5 reverse 2 345 reverse 2 rights 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.639
 5 points in reverse point 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:59.470
 25 points in reverse point 2 rights 1 and 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:02.530
 2 5 points in right point all the 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:05.020
 race the second and the fourth is 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:07.260
 exactly the same does not have any 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.260
 modification 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:14.160
 and two in right point and we finish the 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:16.580
 fourth and last race at one point 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.580
 straight 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.979
 and how will it be 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.620
 I am opening all the little trees 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:26.670
 the stitch to be seen by all 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.100
 Little trees 

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.590
 at this point fantasy trees are going 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:34.170
 seeing very nice register in the 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.570
 channel tell me how did you think 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:40.140
 stitch can be applied in sweaters 

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:42.450
 even on cushions it looks very pretty in 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:45.360
 bedspreads for adults as well as for 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:48.950
 baby in shawls is targeted lends 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.950
 for many applications
