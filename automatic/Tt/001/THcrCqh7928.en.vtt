00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
perhaps you can play with it on by the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.580 
perhaps you can play with it on by the
pool<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.340> picnic<00:00:35.730> table<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.270> whatnot<00:00:36.590> buy

this<00:00:37.649> thing<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.399> mean<00:00:39.360> Holly<00:00:39.540> get<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.110> Amazon

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
this thing I mean Holly get it on Amazon

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.810 
this thing I mean Holly get it on Amazon
for<00:00:41.070> probably<00:00:42.020> less<00:00:43.020> than<00:00:43.079> $30<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.670> good

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
for probably less than $30 it's good

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.380 
for probably less than $30 it's good
investment<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.680> also<00:00:46.680> like<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.059> sits

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
investment I also like the one that sits

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.840 
investment I also like the one that sits
up<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.930> its<00:00:49.379> tail<00:00:49.680> although<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.760> course

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
up on its tail although of course

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
up on its tail although of course
there's<00:00:51.239> controversy<00:00:51.870> regarding<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
there's controversy regarding that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.180 
there's controversy regarding that
position<00:00:53.780> although<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:55.050> not<00:00:55.230> actually<00:00:56.100> an

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
position although it is not actually an

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.229 
position although it is not actually an
authentic<00:00:58.010> situation<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> t-rex<00:00:59.699> or

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
authentic situation of a t-rex or

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
authentic situation of a t-rex or
displayed<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:01.170> X<00:01:01.350> resting<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.250> its<00:01:02.430> tail<00:01:02.609> as

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
displayed here X resting on its tail as

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.500 
displayed here X resting on its tail as
it<00:01:02.969> walks

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it walks

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.550 
it walks
it's<00:01:03.690> rather<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:05.519> posed<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.330> way<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.530> I

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
it's rather just posed that way but I

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.440 
it's rather just posed that way but I
like<00:01:07.650> how<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.280> one's<00:01:08.490> body<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:09.119> full<00:01:09.330> as

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
like how that one's body is more full as

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.640 
like how that one's body is more full as
you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.900> with<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.229> one<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.430> does<00:01:11.880> have

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
you can see with this one it does have

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.980 
you can see with this one it does have
somewhat<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.830> narrow<00:01:14.130> body<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.939> think<00:01:15.390> it

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
somewhat of a narrow body I think it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.550 
somewhat of a narrow body I think it
looks<00:01:16.290> kind<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.860> like<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> starving<00:01:17.790> t-rex<00:01:18.560> but

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
looks kind of like a starving t-rex but

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.510 
looks kind of like a starving t-rex but
a<00:01:19.830> t-rex<00:01:20.490> nonetheless<00:01:21.290> of<00:01:22.290> course<00:01:22.619> many<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.369> us

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
a t-rex nonetheless of course many of us

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.490 
a t-rex nonetheless of course many of us
are<00:01:23.670> quite<00:01:23.939> familiar<00:01:24.299> with<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.960> Jurassic

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
are quite familiar with the Jurassic

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.640 
are quite familiar with the Jurassic
Park<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> drastic<00:01:26.640> world<00:01:26.790> t-rex<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.720> that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
Park and drastic world t-rex and that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.190 
Park and drastic world t-rex and that
primarily<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.880> pop<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:30.659> base<00:01:30.869> this

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
primarily is what pop will base this

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.200 
primarily is what pop will base this
model<00:01:31.680> off<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.740> know<00:01:34.890> I

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
model off of but I like that you know I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.760 
model off of but I like that you know I
mean<00:01:36.210> yeah<00:01:36.360> maybe<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.840> skull<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.290> slightly

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
mean yeah maybe the skull is slightly

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.130 
mean yeah maybe the skull is slightly
larger<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.939> comparison<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.869> other<00:01:39.990> models

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
larger in comparison to the other models

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.830 
larger in comparison to the other models
that<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.530> found<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.680> archeological<00:01:43.680> finds

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
that we found or the archeological finds

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
that we found or the archeological finds
but<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.110> by<00:01:46.320> much<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.920> good<00:01:50.130> model

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
but not by much and this is a good model

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.139 
but not by much and this is a good model
to<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.350> scale<00:01:52.860> with<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
to get it's in scale with a lot of the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.240 
to get it's in scale with a lot of the
other<00:01:54.270> pop<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.810> units<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.100> them

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
other pop of units so you can put them

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.190 
other pop of units so you can put them
next<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.729> another<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.170> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
next to one another and kind of have a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.179 
next to one another and kind of have a
real<00:01:58.939> comparison<00:01:59.939> which<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.380> now<00:02:02.040> this

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
real comparison which I like now this

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.850 
real comparison which I like now this
one<00:02:02.340> comes<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.880> brown<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.360> well<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.530> so

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
one comes in brown as well I just so

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.469 
one comes in brown as well I just so
happen<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.490> green<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.119> jaw

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
happen to have the green one the jaw

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.510 
happen to have the green one the jaw
articulates<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.380> course<00:02:07.649> like<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> lot<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
articulates of course like a lot of the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.840 
articulates of course like a lot of the
other

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
other

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.510 
other
those<00:02:09.060> everything<00:02:09.390> else<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.810> set<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.010> stiff

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
those everything else is set and stiff

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.360 
those everything else is set and stiff
it's<00:02:12.180> quite<00:02:12.630> solid<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.800> if<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.070> look<00:02:14.220> around

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
it's quite solid and if you look around

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.400 
it's quite solid and if you look around
in<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> body<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.300> color<00:02:15.630> scheme<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
in the body just the color scheme the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.580 
in the body just the color scheme the
painting<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.550> looks<00:02:17.850> great<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.720> scales<00:02:19.230> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
painting it looks great the scales and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.280 
painting it looks great the scales and
stuff<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.130> skin<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.540> see<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> muscle

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
stuff the skin you can see the muscle
