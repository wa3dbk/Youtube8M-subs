00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Well, what do we want to take advantage of? 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.420
 also to show the world in the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.179
 today's journey is part of the stage 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.070
 from where Alberto got the 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.509
 leadership of this cycling tour spain 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.130
 the part of the attack on the hill of the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.490
 unicubic sickle records from the motorcycle 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.020
 jesus guzmán some images to make a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.760
 compilation of the whole cycling round 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 Spain that they have asked us to see 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.779
 you exclusively on how it came about 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.369
 the race and they are watching precisely 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.840
 the moment when Alberto started 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.090
 the camera goes in front of the motorcycle and by 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.289
 that there are no backward images and this 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.340
 it's the moment he's looking towards 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.100
 back he sees that he is opening 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.059
 differences and that was the doubt that that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.890
 many people that we have spoken with 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.840
 He told us what I did 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.190
 increase and I did not have one hundred meters says with 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.050
 these changes of pace that I have here 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.280
 I could not solve it but I here 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.780
 He explained to me that he thought everything 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.030
 that was too risky not to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.010
 he wanted to go from so far with him and has 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.289
 opted to lean a bit on his team 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 there is no forming that triplet with 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.360
 alejandro valverde and with menchov with 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.460
 Denis Menchov the Russian runner of 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.550
 set katusha alberto that bit 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.900
 little was advancing runners in the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.700
 final stretch of the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.340
 to climb the harbor and there we pedro 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.900
 was forging what was then a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.500
 history that changed this cyclist round 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.120
 Spain that fullgas that commented on this 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.400
 counter that day like yesterday only 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.590
 we listen to bennati accelerate to 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.180
 butt to butt because above all 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.070
 because there was a break of 20 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.930
 runners among them there were three of 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.730
 saxo bank and those instructions I gave 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.580
 counter to link with them in the 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.500
 final part of this hung from the sickle and 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.450
 then good then try to maintain that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.160
 pulse with respect to the joaquim leader 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.660
 rodríguez there we are already seeing the part 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 of the descent we have seen how the people 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.420
 of movistar other runners watched 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.729
 backwards as saying an I saw the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.650
 that the whole stretch of the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.960
 down in the joaquin group that was going 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.030
 accumulating runners and then also 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.380
 then there you have the time 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.610
 the one Alberto had already connected with 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.570
 group that marched ahead and their 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.680
 colleagues were working so that 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.470
 have just left this gorge and 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.150
 then already linked with the image that 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.729
 we started in live when I was 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.440
 pulling his partner sergio paulinho the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.540
 Portuguese runner from saxo set 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.280
 good bank because that's the story that 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.649
 we could not see 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.480
 from that stage and that I think with these 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.490
 images because it has stayed a little 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 clarified and sure that the images are 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.520
 nice to also save because as 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.590
 said Pedro, they will not count a little 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.870
 history of what has been the end of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.000
 this cyclist tour to spain 2012 where 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.000
 Alberto continues with this red exercise
