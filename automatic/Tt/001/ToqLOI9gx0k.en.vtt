00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:44.939 
down and eat the egg said she has

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.260 
down and eat the egg said she has
released<00:04:45.330> because<00:04:45.689> they<00:04:46.050> are<00:04:46.229> mouth<00:04:46.530> brooders

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.330 
in there for about 28 days and 21 to 28
days<00:04:56.129> and<00:04:56.400> then<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.270> can<00:04:57.560> either<00:04:58.560> strip<00:04:59.159> her

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
days and then you can either strip her

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.040 
days and then you can either strip her
or<00:04:59.580> you<00:04:59.699> can<00:04:59.849> just<00:05:00.000> wait<00:05:00.270> for<00:05:00.539> her<00:05:00.629> to<00:05:00.659> spit

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
or you can just wait for her to spit

or you can just wait for her to spit
them<00:05:01.199> out<00:05:01.319> naturally<00:05:01.949> but<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.699> depends<00:05:03.060> on<00:05:03.240> how

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
them out naturally but it depends on how

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.809 
them out naturally but it depends on how
many<00:05:03.479> wanted<00:05:04.139> to<00:05:04.800> have<00:05:05.330> living<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.509> know<00:05:06.539> um

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
many wanted to have living you know um

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:14.350 
many wanted to have living you know um
and<00:05:09.139> signals<00:05:10.139> can<00:05:10.259> have<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.710> about<00:05:12.860> 3<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:14.189> about

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
and signals can have to about 3 to about

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.499 
and signals can have to about 3 to about
40<00:05:15.360> 45<00:05:16.259> fry<00:05:16.740> in<00:05:16.979> their<00:05:17.159> mouth<00:05:17.400> at<00:05:17.729> a<00:05:17.789> time<00:05:18.120> and

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
40 45 fry in their mouth at a time and

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.200 
40 45 fry in their mouth at a time and
this<00:05:19.199> depends<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.889> lot<00:05:20.159> on<00:05:20.219> size<00:05:20.759> and<00:05:21.060> stuff

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
this depends a lot on size and stuff

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.589 
this depends a lot on size and stuff
like<00:05:21.360> that<00:05:21.419> so<00:05:22.169> for<00:05:22.379> example<00:05:22.969> well<00:05:23.969> childress

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
like that so for example well childress

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.980 
like that so for example well childress
uh<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.590> think<00:05:25.770> they're<00:05:26.250> still<00:05:26.430> mouth<00:05:26.729> brooders

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
uh I think they're still mouth brooders

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.990 
uh I think they're still mouth brooders
but<00:05:27.990> they<00:05:28.440> are<00:05:28.560> really<00:05:28.919> easy<00:05:29.279> to<00:05:29.520> read<00:05:29.789> because

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
but they are really easy to read because

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.809
