seam open in preparation for my zip i'm
pinyon<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:42.040> this<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.160> a<00:02:43.190> non<00:02:43.459> invisible<00:02:44.000> zip

pinyon now this is a non invisible zip

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.909 
pinyon now this is a non invisible zip
because<00:02:45.079> I<00:02:45.139> like<00:02:45.290> working<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.739> those

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:45.919 
because I like working with those

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.250 
because I like working with those
they're<00:02:46.669> easier<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.090> work<00:02:47.239> with

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
they're easier to work with

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.690 
they're easier to work with
and<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.530> prefer<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:48.860> work<00:02:49.069> with<00:02:49.250> those<00:02:49.430> and

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
and I prefer to work with those and

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.250 
and I prefer to work with those and
they're<00:02:49.790> easy<00:02:50.030> to<00:02:50.239> cover<00:02:50.420> up<00:02:50.599> with<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.870> fabric

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
they're easy to cover up with the fabric

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.199 
they're easy to cover up with the fabric
so<00:02:51.470> they're<00:02:51.620> virtually<00:02:51.920> invisible<00:02:52.250> but<00:02:53.120> I'm

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
so they're virtually invisible but I'm

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:04.569 
so they're virtually invisible but I'm
just<00:02:53.420> pinning<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.959> in<00:02:54.140> place<00:03:03.310> then<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.400> want

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
just pinning that in place then you want

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.550 
just pinning that in place then you want
to<00:03:04.610> get<00:03:04.790> your<00:03:05.120> zipper<00:03:05.720> foot<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.049> which<00:03:06.319> looks

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
to get your zipper foot on which looks

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.059 
to get your zipper foot on which looks
like<00:03:06.799> that<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:08.079> run<00:03:09.079> down<00:03:09.349> either<00:03:09.680> side<00:03:09.860> of

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
like that and run down either side of

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.330 
like that and run down either side of
the<00:03:10.549> zip<00:03:10.760> as<00:03:11.000> close<00:03:11.269> as<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.510> can<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:12.220> hold<00:03:13.220> it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
the zip as close as you can to hold it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:24.850 
the zip as close as you can to hold it
in<00:03:13.430> place

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.950 

this<00:03:25.700> is<00:03:25.850> what<00:03:26.120> we<00:03:26.240> should<00:03:26.480> look<00:03:26.660> like<00:03:26.720> right

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
to gather up all this fabric so it's my

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.290 
to gather up all this fabric so it's my
correct<00:03:35.480> waist<00:03:35.780> measurement<00:03:36.970> now<00:03:37.970> you've<00:03:38.150> got

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
correct waist measurement now you've got

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.840 
correct waist measurement now you've got
to<00:03:38.390> be<00:03:38.480> really<00:03:38.960> careful<00:03:39.200> here<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:40.130> not<00:03:40.550> snap

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
to be really careful here to not snap

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.120 
to be really careful here to not snap
your<00:03:41.060> threat<00:03:41.360> if<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:41.990> pull<00:03:42.230> it<00:03:42.380> too<00:03:42.590> hard<00:03:42.620> or

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
your threat if you pull it too hard or

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.650 
your threat if you pull it too hard or
too<00:03:43.190> quickly<00:03:43.520> you<00:03:43.820> can<00:03:43.940> snap<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.300> thread<00:03:44.510> and

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
too quickly you can snap the thread and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.390 
too quickly you can snap the thread and
then<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:44.840> have<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.170> pull<00:03:45.830> all<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:46.040> thread<00:03:46.280> out

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
then you have to pull all the thread out

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.780 
then you have to pull all the thread out
and<00:03:46.670> re<00:03:46.970> stitch<00:03:47.360> those<00:03:47.600> together<00:03:47.810> lines<00:03:48.350> again

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
and re stitch those together lines again

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.060 
and re stitch those together lines again
and<00:03:49.790> I've<00:03:49.880> just<00:03:50.090> put<00:03:50.959> in<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.140> pin<00:03:51.380> here<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.950> I'm

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070

and I've just put in a pin here and I'm
locking<00:03:52.310> off<00:03:52.550> these<00:03:52.730> edges<00:03:53.180> by<00:03:53.420> threading

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
locking off these edges by threading

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.760 
locking off these edges by threading
that<00:03:54.440> thread<00:03:54.950> around<00:03:55.070> and<00:03:56.350> measuring<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.620> make

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
that thread around and measuring to make

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.980 
that thread around and measuring to make
sure<00:03:58.070> that<00:03:58.490> I've<00:03:58.760> pulled<00:03:59.150> it<00:03:59.300> in<00:03:59.420> enough<00:03:59.720> or

00:03:59.980 --> 00:03:59.990 
sure that I've pulled it in enough or

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.270 
sure that I've pulled it in enough or
not<00:04:00.050> too<00:04:00.740> much<00:04:00.920> just<00:04:01.370> gonna<00:04:02.209> iron<00:04:02.450> my

waistband<00:04:04.280> in<00:04:05.030> half<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.840> then<00:04:06.050> flip<00:04:06.410> an<00:04:06.560> iron

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
waistband in half and then flip an iron

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.520 
waistband in half and then flip an iron
up<00:04:07.010> those<00:04:07.430> raw<00:04:07.790> edges<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.840> makes<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.200> easier

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
up those raw edges this makes it easier

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.130 
up those raw edges this makes it easier
when<00:04:09.770> I'm<00:04:10.040> trying<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.430> pin<00:04:10.550> my<00:04:10.670> waistband<00:04:11.180> to

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
when I'm trying to pin my waistband to

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.860 
when I'm trying to pin my waistband to
the<00:04:12.230> waist<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.590> my<00:04:12.709> skirt<00:04:13.450> this<00:04:14.450> is<00:04:14.510> what<00:04:14.780> it

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
the waist of my skirt this is what it

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.240 
the waist of my skirt this is what it
should<00:04:14.900> look<00:04:15.080> like<00:04:15.230> it's<00:04:15.590> like<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.739> big<00:04:15.980> bit<00:04:16.160> of

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
should look like it's like a big bit of

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.979 
should look like it's like a big bit of
bias<00:04:16.430> binding<00:04:16.760> really<00:04:17.269> there's<00:04:17.660> two<00:04:17.840> bits

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
bias binding really there's two bits

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.759 
bias binding really there's two bits
tucked<00:04:18.290> up<00:04:18.470> folded<00:04:19.459> in<00:04:19.549> half<00:04:20.380> then<00:04:21.380> I<00:04:21.410> want<00:04:21.709> to

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
tucked up folded in half then I want to

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.500 
tucked up folded in half then I want to
flip<00:04:22.040> that<00:04:22.100> over<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.760> it's<00:04:22.910> good<00:04:23.060> side<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.360> good

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
flip that over so it's good side to good

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.840 
flip that over so it's good side to good
side<00:04:23.720> pin<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.770> hop<00:04:24.980> on<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.250> sewing<00:04:25.460> machine

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
side pin it hop on the sewing machine

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.790 
side pin it hop on the sewing machine
and<00:04:26.090> just<00:04:26.570> sew<00:04:26.780> that<00:04:26.960> down<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.440> makes<00:04:27.680> it

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
and just sew that down this makes it

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.340 
and just sew that down this makes it
easier<00:04:28.419> then<00:04:29.419> trying<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:29.690> hand<00:04:29.870> stitch<00:04:30.020> it<00:04:30.260> in

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
easier then trying to hand stitch it in

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.930 
easier then trying to hand stitch it in
place<00:04:30.380> then<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:30.919> get<00:04:31.100> that<00:04:31.310> edge<00:04:31.550> that<00:04:31.820> we've

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
place then I get that edge that we've
