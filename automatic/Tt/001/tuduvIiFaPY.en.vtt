down to my G Drive it's in there I'm

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.240 
down to my G Drive it's in there I'm
going<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.959> right<00:02:39.110> click<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.739> I'm<00:02:40.069> going

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
going to right click on this I'm going

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.880 
going to right click on this I'm going
to<00:02:40.480> put<00:02:41.480> winzip<00:02:42.170> extract<00:02:42.980> here<00:02:44.590> allow<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.650> to

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
to put winzip extract here allow it to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:03:09.640 
to put winzip extract here allow it to
extract

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.860 

so<00:03:10.220> we<00:03:10.340> extracted<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:10.940> program<00:03:11.360> implemented

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
so we extracted a program implemented

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.539 
so we extracted a program implemented
everything<00:03:12.140> is<00:03:12.260> still<00:03:12.560> showing<00:03:12.890> that<00:03:13.129> it<00:03:13.280> zip

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
everything is still showing that it zip

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.160 
everything is still showing that it zip
so<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:13.819> don't<00:03:14.120> know<00:03:14.209> how<00:03:14.420> can<00:03:14.659> what<00:03:14.810> does<00:03:14.989> it

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
so I don't know how can what does it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.089 
so I don't know how can what does it
without<00:03:15.319> mine<00:03:15.650> it<00:03:15.739> was<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:15.860> little<00:03:16.010> bit

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
without mine it was a little bit

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.170 
without mine it was a little bit
different<00:03:16.430> they<00:03:16.489> dumped<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:16.909> a<00:03:16.940> file

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
different they dumped it in a file

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.789 
different they dumped it in a file
folder<00:03:17.209> we're<00:03:17.989> just<00:03:18.110> going<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.349> check<00:03:18.500> how<00:03:18.739> it

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
folder we're just going to check how it

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.380 
folder we're just going to check how it
is<00:03:18.950> hopefully<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.700> will<00:03:19.760> go<00:03:19.909> ahead<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.180> pop<00:03:20.330> up

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
is hopefully it will go ahead and pop up

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.199 
is hopefully it will go ahead and pop up
let<00:03:21.170> me<00:03:21.230> come<00:03:21.379> over<00:03:21.409> to<00:03:21.590> my<00:03:21.650> thumb<00:03:21.680> drive<00:03:22.209> we're

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
let me come over to my thumb drive we're

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.520 
let me come over to my thumb drive we're
going<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.390> pop<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.720> out<00:03:26.110> we're<00:03:27.110> going<00:03:27.200> to<00:03:27.260> walk

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
going to pop it out we're going to walk

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.270 
going to pop it out we're going to walk
over<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:28.129> the<00:03:28.519> connection<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.510> board

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
over to the connection on the board

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.559 
over to the connection on the board
so<00:03:31.280> basically<00:03:31.579> we're<00:03:31.790> over<00:03:31.970> here<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.450> know

PDF file on the how-to on this and let
that<00:03:51.260> take<00:03:51.530> control<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.190> actually<00:03:52.609> it's<00:03:52.849> going

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
that take control so actually it's going

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 
that take control so actually it's going
to<00:03:53.060> do<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.359> update<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:54.230> stand<00:03:54.500> by<00:03:54.650> read<00:03:54.920> the

to do the update you stand by read the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:04.830 
to do the update you stand by read the
PDF<00:03:55.159> we'll<00:03:55.579> be<00:03:55.670> back<00:03:55.849> in<00:03:56.000> a<00:03:56.060> minute

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:28.660 

you

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.040 

so<00:04:29.670> it's<00:04:29.970> done<00:04:30.150> with<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.390> update<00:04:30.720> when<00:04:30.960> it

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
so it's done with the update when it

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.300 
so it's done with the update when it
finished<00:04:31.380> it's<00:04:31.530> going<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.800> have<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.040> unplug

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
the USB which we just did and then it

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.500 
the USB which we just did and then it
reboots<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.800> screen<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.910> basically<00:04:36.030> let's

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
reboots the screen so basically let's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.220 
reboots the screen so basically let's
see<00:04:36.660> if<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:36.960> was<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.530> iPod<00:04:38.010> fix<00:04:38.310> or<00:04:38.550> just

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
see if that works I'm plugged in let's

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.100 
see if that works I'm plugged in let's
plug<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.030> phone<00:04:48.180> in<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.510> see<00:04:48.600> what<00:04:48.750> happens

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
the iPhone 5 gives me a charging beep

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.090 
the iPhone 5 gives me a charging beep
that<00:04:53.400> might<00:04:53.610> be<00:04:53.760> a<00:04:53.790> good<00:04:54.030> thing<00:04:54.180> it<00:04:54.360> might<00:04:54.480> not

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
that might be a good thing it might not

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:02.270 
that might be a good thing it might not
so<00:04:56.100> if<00:04:56.190> I<00:04:56.250> go<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.430> USB<00:05:00.260> no<00:05:01.260> device<00:05:01.590> detected<00:05:02.130> so

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
so if I go to USB no device detected so

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.950 
so if I go to USB no device detected so
okay<00:05:02.550> so<00:05:02.580> obviously<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:03.240> doesn't<00:05:03.420> detect<00:05:03.750> it

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
okay so obviously it doesn't detect it
