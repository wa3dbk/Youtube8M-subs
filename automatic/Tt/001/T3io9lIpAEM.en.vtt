excited<00:00:03.950> to<00:00:04.339> do<00:00:04.549> and<00:00:04.819> I<00:00:05.209> think<00:00:05.419> it's<00:00:05.539> a<00:00:05.600> good

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:05.749 
excited to do and I think it's a good

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:08.080 
excited to do and I think it's a good
one<00:00:05.870> because<00:00:06.140> it's<00:00:06.799> about<00:00:07.069> what<00:00:07.789> you're<00:00:07.879> doing

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
one because it's about what you're doing

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.369 
one because it's about what you're doing
wrong<00:00:08.210> with<00:00:08.389> kickflips<00:00:08.780> because<00:00:09.080> I<00:00:09.139> feel<00:00:09.290> like

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:09.379 
wrong with kickflips because I feel like

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:10.659 
wrong with kickflips because I feel like
even<00:00:09.559> if<00:00:09.740> people<00:00:10.009> learn<00:00:10.160> how<00:00:10.190> to<00:00:10.339> do<00:00:10.460> kick

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:10.669 
even if people learn how to do kick

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:12.490 
even if people learn how to do kick
flips<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.030> then<00:00:11.150> proceed<00:00:11.509> forward<00:00:11.900> not<00:00:12.469> only

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
flips and then proceed forward not only

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.619 
flips and then proceed forward not only
floats<00:00:12.889> whatever<00:00:13.190> they<00:00:14.089> end<00:00:14.269> up<00:00:14.389> kind<00:00:14.540> of

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
floats whatever they end up kind of

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.390 
floats whatever they end up kind of
losing<00:00:15.049> cake<00:00:15.349> flips<00:00:15.620> and<00:00:15.769> losing<00:00:16.070> how<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.220> do

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
losing cake flips and losing how to do

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.100 
losing cake flips and losing how to do
it<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.700> right<00:00:16.850> way<00:00:17.090> but<00:00:17.720> it's<00:00:17.780> one<00:00:17.960> of<00:00:18.050> the

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
what you're probably doing wrong because

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.460 
what you're probably doing wrong because
if<00:00:32.630> you're<00:00:32.840> doing<00:00:32.930> something<00:00:33.170> wrong<00:00:33.320> with

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
if you're doing something wrong with

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.360 
if you're doing something wrong with
capable<00:00:33.740> sense<00:00:33.890> they're<00:00:34.040> not<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.220> way<00:00:34.310> you

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
capable sense they're not the way you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.850 
capable sense they're not the way you
want<00:00:34.640> them<00:00:34.730> I<00:00:35.140> guarantee<00:00:36.140> one<00:00:36.410> of<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.590> issues

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
want them I guarantee one of the issues

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.800 
want them I guarantee one of the issues
is<00:00:37.010> one<00:00:37.160> of<00:00:37.250> these<00:00:37.370> five<00:00:37.580> issue<00:00:38.360> number<00:00:38.780> one

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
is one of these five issue number one

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.840 
is one of these five issue number one
it's<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.770> main<00:00:39.920> issue<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.310> most<00:00:40.640> people

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
it's the main issue that most people

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.790 
it's the main issue that most people
deal<00:00:41.000> with<00:00:41.210> and<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:42.020> think<00:00:42.200> it<00:00:42.290> is<00:00:42.380> not<00:00:42.530> popping

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
deal with and I think it is not popping

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800 
deal with and I think it is not popping
hard<00:00:43.040> enough<00:00:43.220> and<00:00:43.400> flicking<00:00:43.820> fast<00:00:44.150> enough<00:00:44.450> and

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
hard enough and flicking fast enough and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.300 
hard enough and flicking fast enough and
I<00:00:45.020> think<00:00:45.200> this<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.500> pretty<00:00:45.710> much<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.070> key<00:00:46.220> to

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
I think this is pretty much the key to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.850 
I think this is pretty much the key to
doing<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:46.610> good<00:00:46.730> capab<00:00:47.030> in<00:00:47.180> general<00:00:47.770> focusing<00:00:48.770> a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
doing a good capab in general focusing a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.130 
doing a good capab in general focusing a
lot<00:00:48.980> on<00:00:49.040> this<00:00:49.430> make<00:00:50.270> your<00:00:50.390> kickflips<00:00:50.720> a<00:00:50.900> lot

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
lot on this make your kickflips a lot

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.110 
lot on this make your kickflips a lot
better<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:52.160> seems<00:00:52.370> like<00:00:52.550> it's<00:00:52.700> obvious

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
better and it seems like it's obvious

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.490 
better and it seems like it's obvious
like<00:00:53.270> okay<00:00:53.510> of<00:00:53.660> course<00:00:53.840> I'm<00:00:53.930> going<00:00:54.020> to<00:00:54.079> pop<00:00:54.260> and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
like okay of course I'm going to pop and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.680 
like okay of course I'm going to pop and
flick<00:00:54.710> pass<00:00:54.890> but<00:00:55.280> it's<00:00:55.460> a<00:00:55.700> very<00:00:56.180> conscious

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
flick pass but it's a very conscious

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.479 
flick pass but it's a very conscious
effort<00:00:56.810> when<00:00:57.140> you<00:00:57.230> go<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.470> pop<00:00:57.739> make<00:00:58.220> sure<00:00:58.340> your

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
effort when you go to pop make sure your

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.860 
effort when you go to pop make sure your
right<00:00:58.670> foot<00:00:58.850> is<00:00:58.970> hitting<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.300> ground<00:00:59.480> hard

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
right foot is hitting the ground hard

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.690 
right foot is hitting the ground hard
let's<00:01:00.230> if<00:01:00.380> your<00:01:00.500> regular<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.100> make<00:01:01.579> sure

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
let's if your regular and make sure

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.149 
let's if your regular and make sure
you're<00:01:01.820> flicking<00:01:02.000> really<00:01:02.540> fast<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.260> the

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
you're flicking really fast and the

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.739 
you're flicking really fast and the
board<00:01:04.339> work<00:01:04.489> with<00:01:04.639> you<00:01:04.789> and<00:01:05.059> I'm<00:01:05.359> telling<00:01:05.509> you

00:01:05.739 --> 00:01:05.749 
board work with you and I'm telling you

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:07.749 
board work with you and I'm telling you
this<00:01:05.929> will<00:01:06.139> drastically<00:01:06.740> change<00:01:07.159> kickflips

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
this will drastically change kickflips

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.249 
this will drastically change kickflips
if<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.030> actually<00:01:08.359> put<00:01:08.509> effort<00:01:08.749> and<00:01:09.139> thought

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
if you actually put effort and thought

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.940 
if you actually put effort and thought
into<00:01:09.950> doing<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.460> well

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
into doing it well

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.739 
into doing it well
okay<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.009> issue<00:01:13.280> number<00:01:13.579> two<00:01:13.759> is<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:14.479> your

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:14.749 
okay so issue number two is that your

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:20.560 
okay so issue number two is that your
feet<00:01:14.899> positioning<00:01:15.350> is<00:01:15.439> probably<00:01:15.709> pretty<00:01:15.859> wet

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.120 

I<00:01:20.600> think<00:01:21.049> it's<00:01:21.140> the<00:01:21.229> same<00:01:21.409> basis<00:01:21.740> of<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:21.920> nollie

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
I think it's the same basis of a nollie

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.740 
I think it's the same basis of a nollie
I<00:01:22.430> think<00:01:22.700> your<00:01:22.790> back<00:01:22.970> foot<00:01:23.150> is<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.360> same<00:01:23.540> place

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
I think your back foot is the same place

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.420 
I think your back foot is the same place
and<00:01:24.020> I<00:01:24.080> think<00:01:24.140> your<00:01:24.380> front<00:01:24.650> is<00:01:24.890> just<00:01:24.950> slightly

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
and I think your front is just slightly

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.030 
and I think your front is just slightly
to<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.729> left<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.270> curved<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.170> little<00:01:27.380> bit<00:01:27.530> so

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
to the left and curved a little bit so

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.499 
to the left and curved a little bit so
when<00:01:28.130> you<00:01:28.220> go<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.369> pop<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.850> flick<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.420> do

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
when you go to pop and flick you do

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.490 
when you go to pop and flick you do
everything<00:01:29.810> that<00:01:29.990> you<00:01:30.080> would<00:01:30.170> for<00:01:30.290> an<00:01:30.380> ollie

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
everything that you would for an ollie

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.960 
everything that you would for an ollie
but<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:31.070> last<00:01:31.250> thing<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.520> flick<00:01:31.729> off<00:01:31.850> the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
but the last thing you flick off the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.389 
but the last thing you flick off the
corner<00:01:32.330> makes<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.080> board<00:01:33.259> flip<00:01:33.439> goes<00:01:34.159> high

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
corner makes the board flip goes high

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.370 
corner makes the board flip goes high
but<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.270> make<00:01:35.479> sure<00:01:35.659> that<00:01:35.990> your<00:01:36.140> feet<00:01:36.320> are

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
but you make sure that your feet are

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.469 
but you make sure that your feet are
right<00:01:36.770> from<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.070> get-go<00:01:37.340> so<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.240> don't<00:01:38.420> to

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
right from the get-go so you don't to

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.639 
right from the get-go so you don't to
worry<00:01:38.630> about<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:38.930> later<00:01:39.080> on

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
worry about that later on

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.200 
worry about that later on
okay<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.009> issue<00:01:40.310> number<00:01:40.670> three<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:43.220> that

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
okay so issue number three is that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.700 
okay so issue number three is that
you're<00:01:44.450> probably<00:01:44.600> flicking<00:01:44.960> down<00:01:45.140> instead<00:01:45.649> of

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
you're probably flicking down instead of

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.649 
you're probably flicking down instead of
out<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.670> that's<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.880> huge<00:01:47.060> mistake<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.479> lot<00:01:47.570> of

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
out and that's a huge mistake a lot of

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.090 
out and that's a huge mistake a lot of
people<00:01:47.840> make<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.289> lot<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.619> flip<00:01:48.740> jerks<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.009> I

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
people make on a lot of flip jerks and I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.529 
people make on a lot of flip jerks and I
even<00:01:49.280> fall<00:01:49.490> victim<00:01:49.789> to<00:01:49.819> it<00:01:49.970> for<00:01:50.119> certain<00:01:50.360> ones

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
even fall victim to it for certain ones

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.450 
even fall victim to it for certain ones
for<00:01:51.140> switch<00:01:51.350> flips<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.860> was<00:01:51.979> a<00:01:52.009> little<00:01:52.190> harder

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
for switch flips it was a little harder

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.680 
for switch flips it was a little harder
for<00:01:52.490> me<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.670> figure<00:01:52.970> out<00:01:53.090> how<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.210> get<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.509> flick

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
for me to figure out how to get to flick

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.960 
for me to figure out how to get to flick
out<00:01:53.869> instead<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:54.470> down<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:54.979> donkey<00:01:55.640> kicking

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
out instead of down but donkey kicking

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.160 
out instead of down but donkey kicking
does<00:01:56.119> not<00:01:56.300> get<00:01:56.450> your<00:01:56.569> board<00:01:56.810> where<00:01:56.899> you<00:01:56.929> want

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
does not get your board where you want

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.870 
does not get your board where you want
it<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.380> be<00:01:57.560> doesn't<00:01:58.280> get<00:01:58.369> an<00:01:58.460> upper<00:01:58.700> ledge

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
it to be doesn't get an upper ledge

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.609 
it to be doesn't get an upper ledge
especially<00:01:59.509> doesn't<00:02:00.140> give<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.289> up<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.440> the<00:02:00.530> air

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
especially doesn't give it up in the air

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.480 
especially doesn't give it up in the air
at<00:02:00.770> all<00:02:00.830> actually

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
at all actually

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.430 
at all actually
so<00:02:02.450> yeah<00:02:02.569> just<00:02:02.869> make<00:02:02.990> sure<00:02:03.110> you're<00:02:03.259> flicking

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
so yeah just make sure you're flicking

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.010 
so yeah just make sure you're flicking
out<00:02:03.740> off<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.159> nose<00:02:04.610> instead<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.509> off<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.780> side

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
out off the nose instead of off the side

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.180 
out off the nose instead of off the side
somewhere<00:02:06.380> like<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.619> would<00:02:06.770> for<00:02:06.950> maybe<00:02:07.130> a

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
somewhere like you would for maybe a

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.249 
somewhere like you would for maybe a
light<00:02:07.460> flipper<00:02:07.789> you<00:02:08.750> know<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:08.840> don't<00:02:09.080> know<00:02:09.140> what

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
light flipper you know I don't know what

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.449 
light flipper you know I don't know what
you<00:02:09.560> would<00:02:09.619> do<00:02:09.739> off<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.890> side<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.160> don't<00:02:10.340> think

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
you would do off the side I don't think

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.410 
you would do off the side I don't think
you're<00:02:10.549> supposed<00:02:10.670> to<00:02:10.759> do<00:02:10.880> anything<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.209> that

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
you're supposed to do anything like that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.410 
you're supposed to do anything like that
so<00:02:11.690> flick<00:02:12.380> out<00:02:12.560> not<00:02:13.280> down<00:02:13.670> okay<00:02:14.060> so<00:02:14.120> issue

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so flick out not down okay so issue

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.660 
so flick out not down okay so issue
number<00:02:14.750> four<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:16.160> that<00:02:16.310> your<00:02:16.430> legs<00:02:16.610> are

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
number four is that your legs are

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.490 
number four is that your legs are
probably<00:02:16.730> pretty<00:02:17.000> weak<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.450> that's<00:02:18.260> kind<00:02:18.470> of

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
probably pretty weak and that's kind of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.930 
probably pretty weak and that's kind of
annoying<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:18.920> hear<00:02:19.220> because<00:02:19.430> people<00:02:19.730> want<00:02:19.850> to

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
annoying to hear because people want to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.970 
annoying to hear because people want to
think<00:02:20.150> oh<00:02:20.299> I<00:02:20.420> can<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.900> strong<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.560> tough<00:02:21.739> and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
think oh I can be strong and tough and

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.560 
think oh I can be strong and tough and
work<00:02:22.130> out<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:22.579> a<00:02:22.610> good<00:02:22.790> kickflip<00:02:23.120> not

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
work out to do a good kickflip not

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.300 
work out to do a good kickflip not
really<00:02:23.900> certain<00:02:24.380> muscles<00:02:24.799> are<00:02:24.920> developed

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
really certain muscles are developed

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.800 
really certain muscles are developed
when<00:02:25.519> doing<00:02:25.760> certain<00:02:25.910> tricks<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.480> key<00:02:26.600> clubs

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
when doing certain tricks and key clubs

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.729 
when doing certain tricks and key clubs
have<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> certain<00:02:27.230> muscle<00:02:27.350> on<00:02:27.500> your<00:02:27.620> right<00:02:27.709> leg

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
have a certain muscle on your right leg

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.410 
have a certain muscle on your right leg
that<00:02:28.040> develops<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.519> don't<00:02:28.790> know<00:02:28.850> which<00:02:28.970> one<00:02:29.180> but

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
that develops I don't know which one but

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.330 
that develops I don't know which one but
I<00:02:29.690> definitely<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.530> feel<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.280> know

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
I definitely can feel it and I know

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.000 
I definitely can feel it and I know
something's<00:02:31.790> there<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.709> practice<00:02:33.709> kick<00:02:33.859> looks

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
something's there so practice kick looks

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.099 
something's there so practice kick looks
a<00:02:34.220> lot<00:02:34.579> and<00:02:34.940> that's<00:02:35.150> kind<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.570> only<00:02:35.930> way<00:02:36.049> to

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
a lot and that's kind of the only way to

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:37.720 
a lot and that's kind of the only way to
do<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> really<00:02:36.890> really<00:02:36.920> solid<00:02:37.220> kickflip<00:02:37.579> and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
do a really really solid kickflip and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.250 
do a really really solid kickflip and
learn<00:02:37.880> how<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.000> do<00:02:38.150> them<00:02:38.239> really<00:02:38.420> well<00:02:38.630> but

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
learn how to do them really well but

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.539 
learn how to do them really well but
what's<00:02:39.410> funny<00:02:39.620> is<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:39.950> know<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.220> seems<00:02:40.400> like

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
what's funny is I know that seems like

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.569 
what's funny is I know that seems like
very<00:02:40.730> obvious<00:02:41.450> direction<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> lot<00:02:43.459> of

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
very obvious direction but a lot of

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.250 
very obvious direction but a lot of
people<00:02:43.760> who<00:02:43.850> can<00:02:44.000> do<00:02:44.120> not<00:02:44.810> only<00:02:44.930> triplet

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
people who can do not only triplet

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.650 
people who can do not only triplet
manual<00:02:45.650> nine<00:02:45.980> hundreds<00:02:46.310> out<00:02:46.459> or<00:02:46.760> like<00:02:47.030> for

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
manual nine hundreds out or like for

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
with is issue number five

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.630 
with is issue number five
that<00:03:03.049> is<00:03:03.170> using<00:03:03.500> your<00:03:03.620> back<00:03:03.860> foot<00:03:04.129> to<00:03:04.159> stop<00:03:04.549> the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
that is using your back foot to stop the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.240 
that is using your back foot to stop the
rotation<00:03:04.819> now<00:03:05.689> your<00:03:05.840> front<00:03:06.079> foot<00:03:06.170> not<00:03:07.010> even

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
rotation now your front foot not even

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.619 
rotation now your front foot not even
really<00:03:07.489> both<00:03:07.670> feet<00:03:07.909> I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:08.450> mainly

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
really both feet I think it's mainly

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.600 
really both feet I think it's mainly
your<00:03:08.959> back<00:03:09.140> foot<00:03:09.379> when<00:03:09.829> you<00:03:09.920> go<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.069> pop<00:03:10.340> and

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
your back foot when you go to pop and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.569 
your back foot when you go to pop and
you<00:03:10.879> flick<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.989> looks<00:03:12.200> fast<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.980> feel<00:03:13.430> like

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
you flick and it looks fast I feel like

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:14.710 
you flick and it looks fast I feel like
the<00:03:13.700> best<00:03:13.909> way<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.120> know<00:03:14.390> that<00:03:14.420> you're<00:03:14.659> doing

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
the best way to know that you're doing

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.750 
the best way to know that you're doing
it<00:03:14.870> correctly<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.280> your<00:03:16.400> back<00:03:16.579> foot

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
it correctly is to have your back foot

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.720 
it correctly is to have your back foot
stopping<00:03:17.209> it<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.900> usually<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:19.280> you<00:03:19.400> can<00:03:19.549> do<00:03:19.640> it

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
stopping it and usually if you can do it

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.699 
stopping it and usually if you can do it
well<00:03:19.879> enough<00:03:19.909> you<00:03:20.390> can<00:03:20.540> stop<00:03:20.900> as<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.560> going

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
well enough you can stop as it's going

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.880 
well enough you can stop as it's going
up<00:03:22.209> but<00:03:23.209> you<00:03:23.989> don't<00:03:24.079> necessarily<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.799> do

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
up but you don't necessarily have to do

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:25.929 
up but you don't necessarily have to do
that<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.099> have<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> good<00:03:25.400> people<00:03:25.700> if<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.819> just

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
have to make sure it stops it period and

the best skateboard you can possibly be
because<00:04:12.860> I<00:04:12.920> think<00:04:12.980> if<00:04:13.190> you<00:04:13.280> ask<00:04:13.400> any<00:04:13.610> of<00:04:13.700> the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
because I think if you ask any of the

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.250 
because I think if you ask any of the
higher-ups<00:04:14.030> there's<00:04:14.510> definitely<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.900> huge

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
higher-ups there's definitely a huge

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.800 
higher-ups there's definitely a huge
thought<00:04:15.770> process<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.190> goes<00:04:16.340> into<00:04:17.000> being<00:04:17.600> who

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
thought process that goes into being who

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.599 
thought process that goes into being who
they<00:04:17.840> are<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.440> why<00:04:18.890> certain<00:04:19.070> people<00:04:19.400> skate

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
they are and why certain people skate

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.160 
they are and why certain people skate
for<00:04:19.730> just<00:04:19.880> as<00:04:20.000> long<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.390> aren't<00:04:21.019> like<00:04:21.140> that

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
for just as long and aren't like that

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.440 
for just as long and aren't like that
but<00:04:21.799> just<00:04:21.950> kind<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.430> never<00:04:22.640> really<00:04:22.910> exceed<00:04:23.420> a
