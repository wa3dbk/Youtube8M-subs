00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi everyone then today we 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.440
 is found for a new video on 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.910
 is going to make a beautiful cake two girls so 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.559
 on the occasion of my birthday 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.070
 girl i'm going to make you a cake 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.100
 princess so first of all I'm going to you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.070
 give the icing recipe so for 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.910
 to make a final icing I'm already going 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.519
 do it right away it will take me 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.679
 really a big cake to decorate so 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.329
 I put four egg whites and that's it 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.690
 so in a salad bowl 4 egg white 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.230
 I will add half a lemon juice 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.660
 little trick to have the most of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.390
 juice you take your lemon and you 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 rub against the table like that it's okay 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.850
 flatten it inside and make you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.789
 sink a little more view in fact that's it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.469
 and after you will need sugar 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.360
 ice cream 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.250
 here and to make it thick 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.250
 and then food coloring 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.260
 so here is my icing done I put it 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.680
 from the side with a food film on it 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.800
 and I will put the dye in the end for 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 see if there is more reuze or +22 blue 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.730
 because I'm going to make two cakes there 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 we will attack the cake you take a 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.970
 base of cakes of your choice me I 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.550
 am going to make a base of a cake at 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.910
 yogurt and add three tablets of 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.410
 chocolate and tablespoons 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.720
 nutella to make a good cake at 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.140
 chocolate here so I'm going to prepare my 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 paw 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.360
 so this is the yoghurt cake that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.360
 I had already put before the base 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.720
 and then you make the cake of your 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 choice 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 so here I am going to prepare my paw to 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.060
 just now that's so small 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.030
 quick summary I put two 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.890
 jars of natural yoghurt then my 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.310
 measurements are the yogurt pots so 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.320
 I put two jars of sugar yogurts 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.140
 semolina 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.900
 Then I put 3 e 6 jars of yogurts 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.100
 of flour 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.980
 then I melted four 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.540
 chocolate bars and r added since 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.800
 good tablespoon of nutella 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.650
 then I put a little bit 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.160
 of oil and I melted so my 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.080
 chocolate with 50 g of butter and I 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.500
 mixed everything that added a packet 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.660
 icing sugar and a packet of yeast 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.250
 chemical here I think I have everything 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.989
 says by one small thing it is 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.190
 it is absolutely necessary to mix well 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.870
 aerating the dough 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.370
 it'll give him a little more 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 swelling it's very very very 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.470
 important for the hub of the cake 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.630
 so for the recap of my dough 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.230
 cake 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.050
 so it will then take a mold like 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.840
 charlotte where akulov so something 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.760
 well round so that after its phase the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.830
 princess dress once tumbled 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.750
 so here I think I have to this loss 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.200
 and seeing that they are a lot of students for 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.989
 school I will do 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.940
 Princess cake I think I 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.819
 do not know yet we'll see how many 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.959
 parts so I'm going buttered and sifted a 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.000
 little flour for not that it hangs 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.680
 so my cake is over we are going 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.560
 wait for them to cool for 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.769
 unmold and make flat so we go 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.780
 cut place for when the 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.890
 returns his phase the dress of the doll 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:49.209
 in the meantime I put in my in my 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.459
 icing the blue dye and I did 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.200
 with sugar paste actually you 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.030
 go find it in all stores 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.950
 it's sugar paste 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.400
 you go or so you can take 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.140
 almond paste to mold the body of 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.480
 your fake bar it will take you 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.450
 will need a barbie body without them 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.780
 legs in fact that's fine 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.980
 mold him and labit on me so I 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.510
 made from sugar paste you can 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.459
 do this and gum this bread there 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.310
 what is it called almond paste 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.690
 so here's to dress him up because 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.030
 that of course she will not go topless 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.190
 on the cake so here I went quickly 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.900
 and a little bustier and we will wait 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.440
 that the cake dries and I show you the 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.200
 So here I have some molds and my 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.020
 cake and I cut the bulge too bad 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.380
 we will eat and here I will go 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.870
 so at the stage make the hole in the middle 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.870
 to get the body of my barbie 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:53.949
 so that's my barbie cupcake is 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.900
