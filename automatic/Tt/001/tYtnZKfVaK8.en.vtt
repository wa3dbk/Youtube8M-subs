 hello how about friends I'll do a poc tutorial in india but only for 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.879
 Latinos since the blessed game only the English understand 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.710
 Americans and another path with the exception of Latinos who know 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.519
 English is just to clarify some details and teach some tricks of the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
 game that still some do not know good let's start 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.519
 today we will see how to get orange blue suits and the basics that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.460
 it would be the gray to start if they want to take out the gray suits they just need 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.680
 measurements that are obtained during the battles in arena later go to the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.670
 jarocho that is in the part superior and it will leave a series of jugs him the common 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.469
 is that they can only use the first one they will only have the jug and if they have 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.630
 lucky you will get a gray suit or a blue suit 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.630
 if they have one 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.030
 there will be synthesis of the interface 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.620
 put the gray suit on the menu and the two gray suits on the catalyst but 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.740
 that are not the same suits will give them a 50% chance that they will get one 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.700
 blue another way would be to combine the gray suit plus two items with two status 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.880
 would give 70% to get a blue one 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.140
 and how to get an item with two good ponds is simple go to the item 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 llop and buy three items but have a status 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.280
 so they need to do it again 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.460
 once they have the three gray suits or the two items only combine 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 but I recommend using the items with the ponds since it would give us more 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540
 probability that a blue suit will come out 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.650
 how to get an orange suit 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.340
 it's the same procedure but now they need a blue suit and two items with 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 three 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.370
 a secret to increase the probability would be an item that has a synthesis 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.370
 of value 42 plus another item with two 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.760
 good for the latter would be to combine your blue suit plus the two items with three 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.129
 statuettes 70% 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.759
 that would be everything and I hope it helps them something
