because<00:01:20.280> they're<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.030> kind<00:01:21.600> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
because they're all going to get kind of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.900 
because they're all going to get kind of
ground<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.350> together<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:23.070> then<00:01:23.610> I'm<00:01:23.730> going<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
in to my food processor as well and then

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.740 
in to my food processor as well and then
just<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.900> give<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.010> liquid

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
just to give it a little bit of liquid

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.810 
just to give it a little bit of liquid
it<00:01:45.750> might<00:01:45.930> have<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:46.200> add<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.010> rounds

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820

lemon and just to balance off the
flavors<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.030> gonna<00:02:03.480> add<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:04.020> tiny<00:02:04.500> bit

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
flavors of it I'm gonna add a tiny bit

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.890 
flavors of it I'm gonna add a tiny bit
of<00:02:05.130> honey<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.630> seems

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
of honey I know it seems

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.139 
of honey I know it seems
counterintuitive<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> honey<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.910> going

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
counterintuitive but the honey is going

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
counterintuitive but the honey is going
to<00:02:09.209> kind<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.509> balance<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.259> sourness<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
to kind of balance the sourness of the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.660 
to kind of balance the sourness of the
lemon<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.950> then<00:02:13.950> we're<00:02:14.099> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> blend<00:02:14.430> that

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
lemon and then we're going to blend that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.710 
lemon and then we're going to blend that
up<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.300> see<00:02:16.110> how<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.260> looks

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
up and see how it looks
