00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.870 
Photoready I don't see any difference in
function<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.370> just<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
function as in just because this is a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.940 
function as in just because this is a
cream<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> liquid<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.710> both

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
excellent primers I didn't see any

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.619 
excellent primers I didn't see any
difference<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.700> function<00:00:42.180> now<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.450> course

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
difference in the function now of course

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.299 
difference in the function now of course
is<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> difference<00:00:43.200> between<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.590> pods<00:00:43.829> because

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
is a difference between the pods because

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.650 
is a difference between the pods because
they're<00:00:44.460> two<00:00:44.579> different<00:00:44.730> companies<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.360> two

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
they're two different companies and two

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.080 
they're two different companies and two
different<00:00:45.960> ingredients<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:48.000> be

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
different ingredients but don't be

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.330 
different ingredients but don't be
scared<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.960> says<00:00:49.110> primer<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
scared because it says primer and it's a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.000 
scared because it says primer and it's a
liquid<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.780> think<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
liquid that it and think it's not a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.200 
liquid that it and think it's not a
prime<00:00:53.840> something<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.969> what's<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> word

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
prime something to what's the word

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.840 
prime something to what's the word
something<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> set<00:00:58.199> your<00:00:58.579> canvas<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.730> other

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
something to set your canvas in other

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
something to set your canvas in other
words<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> were<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.199> artist<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.859> you

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
words like if you were an artist and you

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.520 
words like if you were an artist and you
were<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> prime<00:01:02.879> your<00:01:02.910> board<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
were going to prime your board if it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
were going to prime your board if it
said<00:01:04.799> liquid<00:01:05.129> primer<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.939> that's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.240> cream

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
said liquid primer and that's a cream

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.539 
said liquid primer and that's a cream
primer<00:01:06.810> they're<00:01:07.260> both<00:01:07.470> primers<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.280> just

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
primer they're both primers they just

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.800 
primer they're both primers they just
look<00:01:08.760> different<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.360> that's<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> way<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
look different so that's the way to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.190 
look different so that's the way to
think<00:01:10.020> about<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.360> I<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.780> liked<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
think about it and I really liked the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.499 
think about it and I really liked the
Victoria's<00:01:13.619> Secret<00:01:13.650> one<00:01:14.070> it's<00:01:14.250> $14<00:01:14.970> retail

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
Victoria's Secret one it's $14 retail

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
Victoria's Secret one it's $14 retail

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
but it's for fluid ounces which is a lot

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.510 
but it's for fluid ounces which is a lot
when<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.509> about<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
when you think about it it's like a

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.070 
when you think about it it's like a
little<00:01:20.520> over<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.509> thirds<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
little over it's like two thirds of a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
little over it's like two thirds of a
cup<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:23.720> priming<00:01:24.720> fluid<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.860> need

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
cup of priming fluid and you don't need

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.039 
cup of priming fluid and you don't need
a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.100> maybe<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.700> two<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:26.970> three<00:01:27.119> sprays<00:01:27.659> and

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
a lot maybe like two or three sprays and

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.370 
a lot maybe like two or three sprays and
once<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.909> dries<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.810> sets<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.229> you'll

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
once that like dries and sets in you'll

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.800 
once that like dries and sets in you'll
have<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> sticky<00:01:32.189> feeling<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.759> your<00:01:32.909> face<00:01:33.180> from

you have multi tonal dimension to your

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.490 
you have multi tonal dimension to your
face<00:04:52.490> then<00:04:53.120> it<00:04:53.240> kind<00:04:53.479> of<00:04:53.540> unifies<00:04:54.050> that

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
face then it kind of unifies that

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.530 
face then it kind of unifies that
dimension<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.370> I<00:04:55.430> see<00:04:55.729> that<00:04:55.910> because<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.240> have

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
dimension and I see that because I have

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.350 
dimension and I see that because I have
a<00:04:56.570> lot<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.810> birthmarks<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:58.090> scarring<00:04:59.090> and

a lot of birthmarks and scarring and

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
dark dark circles on my face and it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.670 
dark dark circles on my face and it
definitely<00:05:03.919> brings<00:05:04.460> it<00:05:04.700> all<00:05:04.790> together<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:06.320> yes

more<00:05:18.440> than<00:05:18.620> once<00:05:18.889> i<00:05:19.220> definitely<00:05:20.090> would<00:05:20.240> make

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
more than once i definitely would make

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.780

the<00:05:20.570> investment<00:05:21.080> into<00:05:21.350> this<00:05:21.530> victoria<00:05:22.370> secret

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
the investment into this victoria secret

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.750 
the investment into this victoria secret
spray<00:05:23.690> as<00:05:23.930> a<00:05:23.990> primer<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.919> not<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> setting

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
spray as a primer and not a setting

spray as a primer and not a setting
spray<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.330> i<00:05:27.140> think<00:05:27.500> that<00:05:27.650> this<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:27.860> a<00:05:28.039> really

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
spray and i think that this is a really

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.370 
spray and i think that this is a really
good<00:05:28.990> foundation<00:05:29.990> primer<00:05:30.229> I<00:05:30.680> just<00:05:31.550> like<00:05:31.760> it

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
good foundation primer I just like it

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.960 
good foundation primer I just like it
yep<00:05:33.380> and<00:05:33.620> that's<00:05:33.740> number<00:05:33.890> two<00:05:34.220> because<00:05:34.550> it<00:05:34.820> has

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
yep and that's number two because it has

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.580 
yep and that's number two because it has
the<00:05:35.150> color<00:05:35.300> correction<00:05:35.780> number<00:05:35.990> one<00:05:36.169> doesn't

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
the color correction number one doesn't

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.800 
the color correction number one doesn't
and<00:05:36.770> this<00:05:37.130> retails<00:05:37.490> for<00:05:37.580> about<00:05:37.729> maybe<00:05:38.390> ten<00:05:38.780> or

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
and this retails for about maybe ten or

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.659 
and this retails for about maybe ten or
twelve<00:05:39.200> dollars<00:05:39.560> mess<00:05:39.770> ones<00:05:39.979> 14<00:05:40.400> so<00:05:40.520> they're

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
twelve dollars mess ones 14 so they're

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:42.760 
twelve dollars mess ones 14 so they're
both<00:05:40.789> a<00:05:40.940> bit<00:05:41.090> pricey<00:05:41.300> not<00:05:42.169> to<00:05:42.440> your<00:05:42.530> cheap

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770
