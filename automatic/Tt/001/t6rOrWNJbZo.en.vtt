so the first question is is that a real

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.310 
so the first question is is that a real
bike<00:00:07.200> can<00:00:07.379> you<00:00:07.470> actually<00:00:07.649> ride<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:10.170> is

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320

bike can you actually ride it this is
the<00:00:10.410> neutron<00:00:10.830> bike<00:00:11.599> everybody<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
the neutron bike everybody in the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.230 
the neutron bike everybody in the
industry<00:00:12.929> said<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:13.679> unbuildable<00:00:14.240> we

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
industry said it was unbuildable we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.420 
industry said it was unbuildable we
decided<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.690> take<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.080> challenge<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.920> we

number is that the materials we use for
this<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.750> diverse<00:00:40.050> we've<00:00:40.260> got

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
this are a little bit diverse we've got

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.430 
this are a little bit diverse we've got
a<00:00:40.440> fiberglass<00:00:41.160> body<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.059> frame<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:43.170> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
a fiberglass body the frame is is a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.639 
a fiberglass body the frame is is a
chromoly<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.399> aluminum<00:00:44.969> frame<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.410> wheels

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
chromoly and aluminum frame the wheels

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.160 
chromoly and aluminum frame the wheels
are<00:00:46.950> our<00:00:47.190> steel<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> aluminum<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.539> think<00:00:48.989> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
are our steel and aluminum I think it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.290 
are our steel and aluminum I think it
weighs<00:00:49.350> somewhere<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> 300-pound<00:00:51.059> range

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
weighs somewhere in the 300-pound range

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
weighs somewhere in the 300-pound range
which<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:51.930> pretty<00:00:52.289> light<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.829> motorcycle

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
which is pretty light for a motorcycle

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.229 
which is pretty light for a motorcycle
but<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.059> start<00:00:54.360> around<00:00:54.620> 55,000<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.949> up<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.340> 65

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
but they start around 55,000 go up to 65

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.529 
but they start around 55,000 go up to 65
70,000<00:00:58.170> somewhere<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.500> range<00:00:59.270> if<00:01:00.270> we

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
70,000 somewhere in that range if we

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.020 
70,000 somewhere in that range if we
didn't<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.170> anything<00:01:01.530> else<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:02.039> on<00:01:02.430> we

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
didn't have anything else going on we

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.100 
didn't have anything else going on we
can<00:01:03.180> build<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.510> these<00:01:03.570> things<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.930> about<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
can build one of these things in about a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.880 
can build one of these things in about a
week<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:06.020> would<00:01:07.020> say<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.500> biggest<00:01:07.710> challenge

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
week I would say the biggest challenge

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.700 
week I would say the biggest challenge
in<00:01:08.460> making<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.060> vehicle<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:09.750> probably<00:01:10.560> be

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
in making this vehicle would probably be

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.469 
in making this vehicle would probably be
either<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> body<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> wheels<00:01:12.060> they're

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
either the body or the wheels they're

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.760 
either the body or the wheels they're
both<00:01:12.720> pretty<00:01:12.960> complicated

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
both pretty complicated

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460 
both pretty complicated
the<00:01:14.250> wheels<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:14.939> hubless<00:01:15.420> they're<00:01:15.659> 24<00:01:16.229> inch

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the wheels are hubless they're 24 inch

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.789 
the wheels are hubless they're 24 inch
by<00:01:16.680> 12<00:01:16.979> inch<00:01:17.159> hubless<00:01:18.150> wheels<00:01:18.439> nobody<00:01:19.439> makes<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
by 12 inch hubless wheels nobody makes a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.039 
by 12 inch hubless wheels nobody makes a
bearing<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.340> large<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.570> body<00:01:21.810> was

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
bearing that large and then the body was

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.450 
bearing that large and then the body was
a<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.320> bit<00:01:22.439> tricky<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> get<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> lines

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
a little bit tricky to get all the lines

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
a little bit tricky to get all the lines
to<00:01:23.759> work<00:01:23.909> together<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> still<00:01:24.630> turn<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.650> make

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to work together and still turn but make

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.850 
to work together and still turn but make
it<00:01:25.860> look<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.520> doesn't<00:01:26.700> turn<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:28.530> bike

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it look like it doesn't turn this bike

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
it look like it doesn't turn this bike
has<00:01:29.009> got<00:01:29.189> such<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> futuristic<00:01:30.299> look<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
has got such a futuristic look to it and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.679 
has got such a futuristic look to it and
then<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.790> gasoline<00:01:33.390> engine

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
then to have that that gasoline engine

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.740 
then to have that that gasoline engine
sound<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.229> just<00:01:34.500> didn't<00:01:34.829> match<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.750> we

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
sound they just didn't match so we

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.330 
sound they just didn't match so we
decided<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> switch<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.650> over<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.130> went

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
decided to switch it over and we went

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.859 
decided to switch it over and we went
electric<00:01:38.759> cut<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> lot<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.360> weight<00:01:39.509> off<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
electric cut a lot of weight off of the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.170 
electric cut a lot of weight off of the
bike<00:01:40.079> made<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.829> lot<00:01:40.950> more<00:01:41.159> maneuverable<00:01:42.119> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
bike made it a lot more maneuverable a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.109 
bike made it a lot more maneuverable a
lot<00:01:42.360> easier<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.780> handle<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.759> like<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.820> say<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
lot easier to handle and like I say the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.580 
lot easier to handle and like I say the
bikes<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.479> really<00:01:45.780> built<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.049> cross-country

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
bikes not really built for cross-country

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.889 
bikes not really built for cross-country
riding<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.000> can<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.270> sixty<00:01:48.750> eighty

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
riding so if you can get sixty eighty

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.719 
riding so if you can get sixty eighty
miles<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> charge<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.579> you're

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
miles out of a charge that's all you're

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.920 
miles out of a charge that's all you're
gonna<00:01:50.820> want<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> ride<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> day<00:01:51.600> anyway

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
gonna want to ride in a day anyway

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.530 
gonna want to ride in a day anyway
if<00:01:53.930> we<00:01:54.320> were<00:01:54.610> living<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.880> hundred<00:01:56.180> years<00:01:56.420> from

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
if we were living a hundred years from
