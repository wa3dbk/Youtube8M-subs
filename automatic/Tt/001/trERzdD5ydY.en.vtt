00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.830
 Loser who today is a good day for us on the one with my old video 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.310
 Handheld 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.269
 and I found out that my cool master case 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.839
 up here has made an entry for a 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.639
 external hard drives 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.550
 There you can be a normal 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.269
 he is a father 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.759
 Hard drive a piece can 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.679
 without and the 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.630
 if you do not connect with cable but at this point 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.850
 where normally the connections for electricity 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:31.649
 and 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.440
 Isartal cents are there 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.490
 Housing directly the appropriate connections that you just let in 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.620
 slip 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.410
 neat piece of this quarter of the trend 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.210
 that may be to use Momentum wanted to backup a complete disk to it 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.739
 and that's where I found an interesting movie called DD 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.270
 It is already available for Victor Hugo and you to install documents 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.880
 and indeed one can secure his whole hard disk in the request the search and the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.260
 idea 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.980
 then comes the places 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.530
 which is the drive from where sure 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.560
 At the moment this means that the mandate could not hold ground at the moment 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.600
 dusted 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.670
 stk on this extra drive that is that the title also drives in mine 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.810
 calculator 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.310
 and that means that's the goat and granted that maybe the b 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.210
 now synonymous already with the drive distribution of Ubuntu 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.600
 and by giving that one so sudo 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.340
 the responsible i 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.660
 Spaces this equals / f stste blanks OT 11 Violence / 2 the choice 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.130
 is 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.170
 / and then per year runtime 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 that would be the ten their premiere of this drive 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.050
 there would have to look what worries 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.430
 the target drive is in the crowd a complete hard drives sure OK 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.990
 one to one 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.689
 the precise drive in the case this hard drive must of course just as much 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.290
 free space has Bibi 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.410
 original hard disk occupied 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.110
 So I'll try it now 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.890
 let me know again maybe then I can escape from this one 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.880
 just as dusty before mine 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.699
 own normal disks 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.399
 I'm curious 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:15.229
 You can also ask for solutions to finally no one dares 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.079
 the video is out of hand here 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 before since 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:24.659
 give it up to these 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.539
 bikini 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:29.329
 Ubuntu good - Photo Bentley 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.439
 Index php 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.099
 great as a small one 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.279
 can you do that there 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.519
