hello<00:00:10.070> my<00:00:10.640> name<00:00:10.820> is<00:00:10.970> Nicholas<00:00:11.390> Negroponte<00:00:11.570> ape

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
hello my name is Nicholas Negroponte ape

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.320 
hello my name is Nicholas Negroponte ape
and<00:00:13.010> I'm<00:00:13.130> going<00:00:13.309> to<00:00:13.370> talk<00:00:13.730> to<00:00:14.000> you<00:00:14.150> about

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
and I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.830 
and I'm going to talk to you about
blurring<00:00:15.320> the<00:00:15.890> limits<00:00:16.369> of<00:00:16.610> bits<00:00:17.060> and<00:00:17.420> atoms

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
blurring the limits of bits and atoms

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.040 
blurring the limits of bits and atoms
I'm<00:00:18.619> very<00:00:18.950> fond<00:00:19.220> of<00:00:19.460> saying<00:00:19.790> that<00:00:20.119> perspective

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
I'm very fond of saying that perspective

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.909 
I'm very fond of saying that perspective
is<00:00:21.230> worth<00:00:21.500> 50<00:00:22.099> points<00:00:22.130> of<00:00:22.640> IQ<00:00:22.849> and<00:00:23.710> we<00:00:24.710> also

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
is worth 50 points of IQ and we also

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.069 
is worth 50 points of IQ and we also
know<00:00:25.340> that<00:00:25.369> you<00:00:25.700> really<00:00:26.029> don't<00:00:26.270> understand

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079 
know that you really don't understand

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.990 
know that you really don't understand
something<00:00:27.439> unless<00:00:28.040> you<00:00:28.099> look<00:00:28.520> at<00:00:28.669> it<00:00:28.790> from

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
something unless you look at it from

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.229 
something unless you look at it from
multiple<00:00:29.180> points<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.989> view<00:00:30.050> and<00:00:30.910> perhaps<00:00:31.910> the

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
multiple points of view and perhaps the

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.310 
multiple points of view and perhaps the
to<00:00:32.689> me<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.260> most<00:00:33.860> debilitating<00:00:35.320> expression

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
to me the most debilitating expression

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.230 
to me the most debilitating expression
is<00:00:37.329> problem-solving<00:00:38.329> the<00:00:38.960> best<00:00:39.320> way<00:00:39.710> to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
is problem-solving the best way to

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.690 
is problem-solving the best way to
understand<00:00:41.240> a<00:00:41.450> scene<00:00:41.780> cut<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.580> from<00:00:43.580> the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
understand a scene cut is from the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.640 
understand a scene cut is from the
soundtrack<00:00:44.330> it's<00:00:44.570> not<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.900> pixels<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:45.500> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.930 
soundtrack it's not the pixels it's the
sound<00:00:46.300> because<00:00:47.300> we<00:00:47.540> in<00:00:47.780> film<00:00:48.200> or<00:00:48.560> we<00:00:49.190> start<00:00:49.670> the

sound before we go to the picture and
there's<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.160> cut<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:52.840> we<00:00:53.840> know<00:00:54.110> that<00:00:54.500> if<00:00:54.650> the

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
there's a cut and we know that if the

what's<00:02:55.109> going<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.409> happen<00:02:56.569> when<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.900> border

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
what's going to happen when that border

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.659 
what's going to happen when that border
is<00:02:58.799> not<00:02:59.639> quite<00:03:00.000> as<00:03:00.180> meaningful<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.549> I'd

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
is not quite as meaningful so what I'd

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:08.330 
is not quite as meaningful so what I'd

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
and then you make it a little bit better

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.129 
and then you make it a little bit better
and<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.209> improve<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:37.379> on<00:03:39.139> the

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
even break rules and that's fine but the

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.349 
even break rules and that's fine but the
real<00:03:51.239> question<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:52.079> does<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.889> society<00:03:53.819> have<00:03:54.120> to

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
real question is does a society have to

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.520 
real question is does a society have to
go<00:03:54.569> through<00:03:54.959> all<00:03:55.169> of<00:03:55.229> those<00:03:55.829> steps<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:58.319> then

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
go through all of those steps to then

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.800 
go through all of those steps to then
worry<00:03:58.799> about<00:03:58.889> being<00:03:59.370> a<00:03:59.459> creative<00:03:59.969> society<00:04:00.599> and

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
worry about being a creative society and

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.869 
worry about being a creative society and
I<00:04:01.409> would<00:04:01.620> argue<00:04:01.650> because<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.699> digital

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
I would argue because of the digital

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.709 
I would argue because of the digital
world<00:04:03.689> the<00:04:03.959> answer<00:04:04.409> is<00:04:04.620> no<00:04:04.949> that<00:04:05.759> you<00:04:05.939> can<00:04:06.419> in
