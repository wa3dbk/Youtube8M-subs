crate at first because it was the one I

crate at first because it was the one I
had<00:00:51.870> downstairs<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.770> used<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.699> his

had downstairs and used it for his
breakfast<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> start<00:00:55.289> building<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
breakfast just to start building a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.040 
breakfast just to start building a
positive<00:00:56.160> association<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> crate<00:00:57.149> but

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
positive association with the crate but

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
positive association with the crate but
the<00:00:58.170> normal<00:00:58.500> Craig<00:00:58.770> he<00:00:58.890> sleeps<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.460> smaller

the normal Craig he sleeps in a smaller

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
the normal Craig he sleeps in a smaller
you<00:01:00.750> want<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.140> crate<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.649> be<00:01:01.770> small<00:01:02.070> enough

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you want your crate to be small enough

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.179 
you want your crate to be small enough
so<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.850> he<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:04.199> much<00:01:04.379> only<00:01:04.619> stand<00:01:05.010> up

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so that he can pretty much only stand up

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:24.109 
so that he can pretty much only stand up
and<00:01:05.369> turn<00:01:05.489> around<00:01:05.549> in

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
included this clip here because I just

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.690 
included this clip here because I just
wanted<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.770> show<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.340> dog<00:01:27.490> had
