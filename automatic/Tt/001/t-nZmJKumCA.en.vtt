00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:31.930
 this is the white page enclosure 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.630
 let's now repeat it in slow motion 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.320
 It is in pitch d 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.720
 Sun 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.930
 although in the requinto it seems that the 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.270
 I'm playing in two because I'm using 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.850
 the field on the second fret 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.440
 and I'm putting remembered as 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.510
 the figure of don the guitar is today 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.780
 using the positions of 2 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.210
 on the guitar without cap 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:04.269
 the numbers you touch are the 3 that the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.060
 third rope to the air 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.329
 along with the trio of the first on 12 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.329
 the second 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.039
 we repeat the 3 on air 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.039
 and we add the 5 with mime 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:31.570
 33 of the first 3 of the third tal and 3 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.409
 and 5 of the first 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.630
 and this is repeated several times I will 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:50.470
 start 3 3 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:56.610
 35 33 53 now we go to 1 and 10 3 of 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.610
 the third and we repeat the 5 with the 1 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.460
 with 3 from the third 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 Y 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:14.600
 and that's the phrase after three of the 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.100
 third 8 and 2 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.239
 Y 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:26.989
 10 with 13 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.989
 8 with 21 with 10 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.400
 3 of the third 8 with the 2 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:48.260
 12 10 8 and 7 5 and 4 3 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.110
 ok after 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.110
 the same sequence but with the effect of 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.780
 that it has a technical name that 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.390
 legal call 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.130
 and that the only thing he does is when I play 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.560
 the 3 100 12 when placing the 5 touched the 5 and 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.040
 he cleared it and although it sounds 3 without 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.040
 touch him 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:27.060
 and I go to 1 and 10 and the same effect 3 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.060
 10 and 1 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.040
 do not 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.209
 and touching 51 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.209
 I do the effect 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:50.530
 then 8 with 12 3 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:56.160
 1 and lift the precise finger on the 12 without 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:07.660
 touch it always repeating the 3 air 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:11.230
 and the last sentence is 12 10 8 7 5 4 and 3 and 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.319
 we finished with 3 of the sixth 3 of the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:18.829
 first 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.829
 and that is the white page requinto
