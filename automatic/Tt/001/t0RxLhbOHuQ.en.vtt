new model Atlanta bringing out of 34 and
this<00:00:33.180> basically<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:34.110> Poland's<00:00:34.530> answer<00:00:34.950> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
this basically it's Poland's answer to

this basically it's Poland's answer to
that<00:00:35.760> market<00:00:36.540> sector<00:00:37.160> so<00:00:38.160> we'll<00:00:38.280> give<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
that market sector so we'll give you a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.590 
that market sector so we'll give you a
quick<00:00:38.640> look<00:00:38.820> around<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.180> potent<00:00:39.510> we'll

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
quick look around this potent we'll

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.240 
quick look around this potent we'll
start<00:00:39.809> obviously<00:00:39.960> here<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.770> cockpit

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
start obviously here in the cockpit

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760 
start obviously here in the cockpit
Geron<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.000> gone<00:00:42.149> for<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.719> small<00:00:43.290> dinette<00:00:43.739> area

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
Geron have gone for a small dinette area

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.860 
Geron have gone for a small dinette area
here<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> table<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> center<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.780> eating

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
here as a table in the center for eating

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.479 
here as a table in the center for eating
around<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:46.920> they've<00:00:47.070> done<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.340> they've

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
around and what they've done is they've

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.889 
around and what they've done is they've
put<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.640> sunbed<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.390> back<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> boat

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
put a sunbed on the back of the boat

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.990 
put a sunbed on the back of the boat
that's<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> small<00:00:49.590> boot<00:00:49.829> area<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.399> then

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that's got a small boot area and then

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880 
that's got a small boot area and then
the<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:51.660> rest<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> backless<00:00:52.559> dinette

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the back rest of the backless dinette

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.500 
the back rest of the backless dinette
will<00:00:53.010> actually<00:00:53.370> slope<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.879> either<00:00:54.090> direction

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
will actually slope in either direction

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.840 
will actually slope in either direction
so<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.989> diver<00:00:55.170> extends<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> Sun<00:00:55.829> bed<00:00:56.010> or<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so the diver extends the Sun bed or it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.790 
so the diver extends the Sun bed or it
gives<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.090> more<00:00:57.270> seating<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.140> over

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
gives you more seating just here over

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.650 
gives you more seating just here over
here<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.579> starboard<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.059> there's<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.480> wet

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
here on the starboard side there's a wet

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
here on the starboard side there's a wet
bar<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.109> fridge<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.280> small<00:01:02.430> sink

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
bar with a fridge in it and a small sink

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.969 
bar with a fridge in it and a small sink
and<00:01:03.210> ahead<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.769> helm

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and ahead of that there's the helm

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.200 
and ahead of that there's the helm
position<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.820> quite<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.000> nice

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
position and then it's quite a nice

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.480 
position and then it's quite a nice
l-shaped<00:01:06.990> seating<00:01:07.200> area<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.740> alongside<00:01:07.979> there

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
l-shaped seating area up alongside there

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.890 
l-shaped seating area up alongside there
so<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:08.850> you're<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.210> running<00:01:09.270> people<00:01:09.780> can

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
so when you're up and running people can

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
so when you're up and running people can
join<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> helm<00:01:10.590> enjoy<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.400> view<00:01:11.640> as

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
join you at the helm enjoy the view as

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.190 
join you at the helm enjoy the view as
you're<00:01:12.210> heading<00:01:12.420> down<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.659> coast<00:01:12.840> now<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
you're heading down the coast now a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.570 
you're heading down the coast now a
couple<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.590> caveats<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.130> explain<00:01:14.369> about

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
couple of caveats to explain about

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.980 
couple of caveats to explain about
performance<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.180> boat<00:01:15.420> first<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.840> all

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
performance on this boat first of all

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.749 
performance on this boat first of all
because<00:01:16.740> she's<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> lake<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
because she's here on the lake the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.249 
because she's here on the lake the
engines<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> particularly<00:01:18.630> low<00:01:18.869> emission

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
engines are a particularly low emission

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
engines are a particularly low emission
version<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:19.979> required<00:01:20.189> by<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
version which are required by the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
version which are required by the
authorities<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.140> they're<00:01:22.320> slightly

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
authorities here and so they're slightly

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.780 
authorities here and so they're slightly
down<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:22.890> power<00:01:23.189> compared<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:23.700> you'd

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
down on power compared to what you'd

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.580 
down on power compared to what you'd
normally<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> boat<00:01:24.630> based<00:01:25.229> on<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
normally have on a boat based on the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.130 
normally have on a boat based on the
coast<00:01:25.799> also<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.939> boat<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> testbed<00:01:27.810> for

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
coast also this boat is a testbed for

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
coast also this boat is a testbed for
the<00:01:28.619> electronics<00:01:29.009> companies<00:01:29.400> absolutely

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the electronics companies absolutely

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.700 
the electronics companies absolutely
loaded<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> electronics<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.500> that's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
loaded with the electronics so that's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.319 
loaded with the electronics so that's
flowing<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.490> boat<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> little<00:01:32.790> bit<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.180> well

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
flowing the boat a little bit as well

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
flowing the boat a little bit as well
but<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.780> said<00:01:34.170> although<00:01:34.740> she<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.070> slightly

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
but that said although she is slightly

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.710 
but that said although she is slightly
slow<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> plane<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.390> perhaps<00:01:36.509> we

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
slow on to the plane then perhaps we

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.190 
slow on to the plane then perhaps we
might<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.189> she<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.340> topping<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.150> at<00:01:39.329> 30<00:01:39.689> 31

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
might like she is topping out at 30 31
