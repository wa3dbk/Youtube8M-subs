 m 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.990
 prod and assigning part carried out by

 here we go on an expedition in the jura 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.850
 to go and find the places of the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.100
 swore when we realize 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.420
 so we're going to see so we go back up the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.540
 River UNSS and ford Duke 6 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 bolozon a deficit that is very beautiful has 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.960
 then put in the car because 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.340
 politics so we will directly dam 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.930
 of vouglans will go up the lake 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.920
 we'll go to the pyle bridge to see 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.500
 the beach and therefore the port and that the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.120
 small boats then we will eat and 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.000
 we will go to castrÃ©s de gruissan for 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.500
 the three things we are going to represent 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.170
 place is nice viaduct quite that 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.580
 bruno and jean christmas and his girlfriend and 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.930
 then a nice little trip on the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.700
 tourist routes of the turnaround is 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.400
 magnificent 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.330
 to those other three to the owls go 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:36.420
 me what is it to him it's 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.420
 bridge stack there it's great it's you 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.460
 it's the expectations here was a wheel 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.460
 toothed at the bottom of the water 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.540
 it's just a little train going on 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.540
 go 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:36.460
 these are the basics or not 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.650
 I return is that trees one 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.660
 small road that leaves on the left side 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.600
 you it's the butte but behind it is 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.090
 a more plan behind that we're at the foot 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.160
 but we can not go further 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.690
 not allowed 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.000
 and then we can see the patina a little 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.430
 special I think where it's not 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.450
 dirty it's because it's very steep and 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.760
 after that a year curved and it has to 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.330
 take the fleet to replicate the patina 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.330
 like that 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.640
 the rock cuts on the sides of 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.890
 start jean christmas picture the camera way 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.890
 the reception basin of the flotilla 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:34.530
 the basin that receives the water that falls from 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.530
 lavaux I think it's 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.590
 still there is a road that runs along and 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.560
 then the cliff so we finally know 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.060
 a road that runs along the edge of the lake 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.870
 see we 'll put a little character right 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.439
 with a camera 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.009
 you see here I would say it's bruno 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.000
 on the side of the road 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.259
 we are not a little medals at the 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.599
 panic around since May on the beach 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.909
 naturist who in front we take four 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.009
 characters time and plays fine for them 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:04.479
 clothes with a gray audi and a small 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.439
 yellow car we put them there just at 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.939
 lakeside we say it was us who 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:14.439
 exactly it does not hurt that it's too much 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:16.900
 early the metal sinkers then the 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.830
 ghosts of the engulfed village all the 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.270
 cemetery is one of the types and 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.539
 the cheeky audois is at the bridge of the 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.629
 pyle 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.069
 that's what we're going to reproduce and 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.840
 in the restaurant at passion to what the 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:26.229
 to do at first to 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.889
 arrange 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.729
 and then we will find all the 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.849
 places we will reproduce 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.819
 and then it goes down to the lake so here they are 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.990
 to the boat louisiana and now 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.529
 it's meal time because we have 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.529
 very very hungry
