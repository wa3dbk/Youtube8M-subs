00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
also been hooking my device into a

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.009 
also been hooking my device into a
external<00:04:09.760> monitor<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.419> kind<00:04:10.569> of<00:04:10.659> using<00:04:10.900> it

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
external monitor and kind of using it

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.360 
external monitor and kind of using it
that<00:04:11.169> way<00:04:11.379> so<00:04:13.439> really<00:04:14.439> not<00:04:14.530> a<00:04:14.590> big<00:04:14.769> deal<00:04:14.829> as<00:04:15.159> far

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
that way so really not a big deal as far

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.860 
that way so really not a big deal as far
as<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:15.549> being<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:15.939> smaller<00:04:16.180> device<00:04:16.509> that<00:04:16.780> can

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
as it being the smaller device that can

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.259 
as it being the smaller device that can
actually<00:04:17.019> use<00:04:17.380> it<00:04:17.410> around<00:04:18.099> the<00:04:18.370> house<00:04:18.549> i'm<00:04:19.150> not

2995 you same four gigs of ram all that
good<00:04:34.900> stuff<00:04:34.949> so<00:04:35.949> we're<00:04:36.099> seeing<00:04:36.280> very<00:04:36.580> similar

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
that this is a smaller lighter maybe not
