based<00:00:54.200> upon<00:00:54.470> what<00:00:54.650> they've<00:00:54.800> done<00:00:54.890> but<00:00:55.040> it's

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
based upon what they've done but it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.880 
based upon what they've done but it's
hard<00:00:55.520> to<00:00:55.579> really<00:00:55.850> sort<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.290> measure<00:00:57.290> all<00:00:57.650> these

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
hard to really sort of measure all these

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.050 
hard to really sort of measure all these
things<00:00:58.220> you<00:00:58.400> know<00:00:58.489> how<00:00:58.670> do<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:58.790> really

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
things you know how do you really

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.340 
things you know how do you really
measure<00:00:59.239> you<00:00:59.540> know<00:00:59.630> what<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.810> golfing<00:01:00.140> do

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
measure you know what a golfing do

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.620 
measure you know what a golfing do
versus<00:01:00.650> versus<00:01:01.550> a<00:01:01.579> dog<00:01:01.850> whatever<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.480> there

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
versus versus a dog whatever and there

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.289 
versus versus a dog whatever and there
are<00:01:02.750> some<00:01:02.960> metrics<00:01:03.250> but<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:04.399> not<00:01:04.579> always

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
are some metrics but it's not always

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.460 
are some metrics but it's not always
that<00:01:05.509> easy<00:01:05.659> anyway<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.110> can<00:01:06.229> read<00:01:06.350> the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
that easy anyway you can read the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.520 
that easy anyway you can read the
research<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.280> bottom<00:01:07.610> line<00:01:07.790> is<00:01:08.350> one<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.470> the

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
research the bottom line is one of the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.230 
research the bottom line is one of the
ways<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:09.770> they<00:01:10.159> test<00:01:10.430> is<00:01:10.640> is<00:01:10.790> sort<00:01:10.970> of<00:01:11.090> what

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
ways that they test is is sort of what

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.200 
ways that they test is is sort of what
the<00:01:11.650> vocabulary<00:01:12.650> range<00:01:12.979> is<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.940> they've<00:01:14.060> done

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
the vocabulary range is and they've done

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.330 
the vocabulary range is and they've done
this<00:01:14.390> with<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:14.900> know<00:01:14.990> some<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.620> the<00:01:15.710> Apes<00:01:15.979> and
