00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.660
 mushroom and then hoisted them good 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.180

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.090
 umh chair pro 1.7 points 7 goes down here 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.369
 is in the description I know what to do 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.720
 the 1.7 point 8 beta but do not pull the 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.640
 mods have been until the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
 I'll load it and if not then I'll 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.910
 I 'll stay with this carnal as 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.970
 we realized in the description of 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.220
 video is the mold the half adam or is it 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.200
 a new one because it is added as dynamite 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.600
 it is practically an English an honor very 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.949
 very interesting that that is exposed to only 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.050
 in the world that is in the 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.239
 depths or is it in those in the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.589
 lower layers by a 50 blanket 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.320
 approximately that's where we can 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.730
 find that kind of gold this good at 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.410
 Finally, I explain to you how is the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.870
 is a download mother because it is a mod and 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.309
 it's a texture pack going down here 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.449
 this link is not very complicated 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.370
 it's just that in the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.140
 description of the engine and in the forum and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.909
 they will give an account of where the link is 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.949
 of the texture but in the end I explain 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.210
 if they do not know where they are then good 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.540
 already once we have the texture and the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.670
 mode the typical pichi here the spam of d 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.110
 from the creator and well this is the side 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.030
 half this is not the new thing that is 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.710
 add dynamite is orange I say 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.780
 is in the last layers in the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.190
 last or that is already the diamond a 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.930
 little bit below here the world does not 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.610
 then how is it equal like those of 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.960
 you just have to put a 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.940
 oven burns and you're not going to be 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.310
 giving the two ingots more than half 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.920
 this is good to do this I think that 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.170
 this that adds is an armor of this 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.910
 new gold and also a very very sword 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.800
 very fucking and the good thing is it's parents who 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.240
 If you have a knot like that, you spend that 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.590
 it's something that I love about motorcycles 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.540
 I like that it is not spent on things 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.460
 so good that we need to 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.550
 create the armor first have a 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.509
 diamond that hickson a cash clover 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.080
 You can find all the diamonds 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.240
 necessary for this but good 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.680
 we need a diamond armor 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.560
 and what we are going to do is simply 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.300
 how to coat the not from the new new 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.650
 because they are the good half we already know 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.380
 how to make the boots we are simply 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.750
 diamond boots and some are five are 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.670
 five again now this one to do the 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.610
 chase lawsuit are simply five others 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.709
 and 63 of diamond to do the 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.330
 diamond helmet equal carnal this one 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.820
 we surround with half and it's going to be the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.590
 in the hand helmets and then the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.010
 same pants is not very complicated 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.170
 we simply require about 20 of 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.269
 half and good to do them for 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.880
 we need a blaze wand first 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.420
 Rhodes to that elite as he compensated for 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.820
 of network as I said is for blazer rod 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.070
 water waters with the wand example x 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.530
 root and with meme good we are a hablÃ©is 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.870
 ruth is a rod of blaze this as 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.910
 creates is a normal wooden wand and the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.950
 we surround this gold bullion with cigars 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.720
 is going to give us that which is the light leds and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.450
 that once we have that we need 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.750
 22 more than half in order to create the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.000
 in half so then good 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.250
 which is what this adds is for good 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.459
 this is what the mature fincher would look like 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.519
 here vinci naranjita web then good 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.680
 the sword the only thing he does is that everything 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.390
 what touches osama without maps no no no to 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.130
 floor or nothing only the mountains are going 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.530
 to explode ok it will generate a 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.329
 small a small radio also the 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.190
 explosion down blocks not then 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.780
 well this one as always here in the 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.090
 so the good ones are no longer the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.920
 main victims and I tell them 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.570
 they simply tap and explode 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.550
 and the rest too or like a 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.860
 radio about three by three around 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.240
 in the way that attacking this one is going 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.160
 also to destroy as if it were a 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.970
 kind of flu explosion but good 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.680
 with a single scrubbing is exploited is not 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.180
 the mobile phone dies or I tell them what 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.040
 important here what I liked is that 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.660
 if the sword is being spent something that 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.700
 I love that they do the mods so 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.960
 so then nothing is simple is 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.480
 simple the mod kernel is new is very 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.380
 complicated now yes we are going to what is 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.670

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.910
 red box

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.129
 Well, download those two things and 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.750

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.069
 how to make this chaos if they have left 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.569
