00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.410
 no 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.590
 yes there are two distinct operations that 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.800
 this morning we ran six 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.210
 measures on coordinated activities 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.180
 by the attorney of Catanzaro 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.180
 the first concerns an attempted murder of 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.820
 a photographer who took place right in the center a 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.600
 catanzaro during the timetable at a time 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.550
 daytime and where this person was 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.710
 within its business for 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.000
 the rumors almost deathly with delle 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.540
 stab wounds 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 we have reconstructed the story that 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.660
 presumably concerned some 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.039
 drug sales not paid with 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:05.000
 collection brutalities implemented by a 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.590
 Italian through Moroccans 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.009
 the operation on the average spa is one 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.729
 continuation of the Persian operation are 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.080
 a series of feedback to statements 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.470
 of collaborators of justice that we are 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.390
 still implementing in time and in this 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.330
 In case we believe we have shed light 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.540
 on two other two murders 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.310
 in particular one that took place in 2008 e 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.780
 that involved murder of a citizen 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.909
 brown for which they had already been 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.890
 arrested and people and today 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.170
 we assure we say to justice a 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:42.400
 new accomplice and then a murder that was 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.650
 perpetrated in 2003 against torcasio 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.590
 giuseppe and also this story was 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.079
 rebuilt with 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.850
 and we have brought to justice 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:59.450
 let's say this crime is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.789
 a famous lamezia terme trader 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.009
 managing a notorious in that city 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.009
 restaurant is a very busy bar 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.019
 the activity of the mobile team continues 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.019
 on the media with satisfactory results 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:23.090
 we hope that other initiatives are underway 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:26.569
 to be able to get results soon 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.040
 in lamezia after some regrets that there 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.769
 allowed to make a series of 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.600
 operation operations jellyfish operation 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.560
 perseo who 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.200
 have already had the first results 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.260
 also in the abbreviated trial i 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.510
 ordinary prejudices I have got to 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.760
 say in a meeting that concerned you 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.090
 just the collaborators of justice who 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.360
 at the mass we recorded later 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.240
 some of the most important regrets 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.950
 of of the capocosca 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.310

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.590

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.130
 good activity on Lamezia continues not 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.130
