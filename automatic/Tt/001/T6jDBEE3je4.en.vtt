00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.520 
Tommy Tallarico from video games live
we've<00:02:36.900> had<00:02:37.080> shows<00:02:37.320> live<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.890> e3<00:02:39.380> let's<00:02:40.380> figure

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
we've had shows live at e3 let's figure

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.010 
we've had shows live at e3 let's figure
it<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.710> put<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> little<00:02:41.130> plug<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.550> there<00:02:45.020> but

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
it I put the little plug in there but

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.600 
it I put the little plug in there but
yeah<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.440> takes<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.770> while<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:46.980> load<00:02:47.280> as<00:02:47.490> you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
yeah so it takes a while to load as you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.340 
yeah so it takes a while to load as you
can<00:02:47.760> tell<00:02:48.000> I<00:02:48.360> don't<00:02:48.690> know<00:02:48.959> if<00:02:49.050> that's<00:02:49.260> just

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
can tell I don't know if that's just

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.270 
can tell I don't know if that's just
because<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.980> have<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.590> have<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.040> wireless

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
because I have this I have a wireless

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.940 
because I have this I have a wireless
router<00:02:53.610> connected<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.510> my<00:02:54.660> Rison<00:02:55.320> FiOS<00:02:55.590> router

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
router connected to my Rison FiOS router

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.890 
router connected to my Rison FiOS router
so<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.790> don't<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.180> that's<00:02:57.360> why<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.750> kind

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
so I don't know if that's why it's kind

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.640 
so I don't know if that's why it's kind
of<00:02:57.989> slow<00:02:58.260> or<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.880> that's<00:03:00.060> just<00:03:00.239> how<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:00.900> but

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
of slow or if that's just how it is but

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.620 
of slow or if that's just how it is but
you'll<00:03:02.160> see<00:03:02.400> it's<00:03:02.610> it's<00:03:03.000> loading<00:03:03.390> it's

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
you'll see it's it's loading it's

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.000 
you'll see it's it's loading it's
connected<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.330> corner<00:03:06.690> it's<00:03:07.020> got<00:03:07.830> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
connected and in the corner it's got the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:23.840 
connected and in the corner it's got the
wireless<00:03:08.220> signal

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.150 

so<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:24.940> takes<00:03:25.210> a<00:03:25.330> bit<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.510> time<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.930> load<00:03:26.160> but

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
so it takes a bit of time to load but

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.120 
so it takes a bit of time to load but
it's<00:03:27.340> getting<00:03:27.640> there<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:29.110> they<00:03:30.100> just

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.969 

it's<00:04:15.750> kind<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:15.959> interesting<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.560> Nintendo

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
it's kind of interesting that Nintendo

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.710 
it's kind of interesting that Nintendo
made<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.820> 3ds<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.419> guess<00:04:18.570> just

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
made it so the 3ds I guess just

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.670 
made it so the 3ds I guess just
recognizes<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.590> name<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.160> Wi-Fi<00:04:20.489> network

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
recognizes the name of the Wi-Fi network

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.950 
recognizes the name of the Wi-Fi network
and<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:24.810> works<00:04:25.080> which<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.639> kind<00:04:26.639> of<00:04:26.699> cool<00:04:26.850> now

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.629 

the<00:04:30.960> thing<00:04:31.139> is<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.470> doesn't<00:04:31.500> if<00:04:32.160> you<00:04:32.310> actually

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
the thing is it doesn't if you actually

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.460 
the thing is it doesn't if you actually
take<00:04:32.789> your<00:04:32.820> 3ds<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.479> a<00:04:33.509> Best<00:04:33.780> Buy<00:04:33.870> Nintendo's
