question we've been getting a lot lately
is<00:00:46.839> what<00:00:47.350> do<00:00:47.440> you<00:00:47.530> guys<00:00:47.680> mean<00:00:47.920> by<00:00:48.100> exoskeleton

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
is what do you guys mean by exoskeleton

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.299 
is what do you guys mean by exoskeleton
frame<00:00:49.300> well<00:00:49.870> take<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.110> look<00:00:50.230> at<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.650> Wildcat<00:00:51.160> as

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
frame well take a look at the Wildcat as

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.560 
frame well take a look at the Wildcat as
a<00:00:51.339> whole<00:00:51.640> when<00:00:51.790> you<00:00:51.910> look<00:00:52.089> at<00:00:52.239> this<00:00:52.360> you<00:00:52.420> see

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
a whole when you look at this you see

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.750 
a whole when you look at this you see
all<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.260> frame<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.800> it's<00:00:53.980> exposed<00:00:54.460> and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
all this frame and it's exposed and

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.610 
all this frame and it's exposed and
that's<00:00:54.940> what<00:00:55.150> we<00:00:55.239> mean<00:00:55.420> by<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.659> exoskeleton

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
that's what we mean by the exoskeleton

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.890 
that's what we mean by the exoskeleton
but<00:00:56.769> what<00:00:56.949> is<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.400> exoskeleton<00:00:58.329> frame<00:00:58.629> made

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
but what is that exoskeleton frame made

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.680 
but what is that exoskeleton frame made
up<00:00:59.050> it's<00:00:59.620> made<00:00:59.800> of<00:00:59.949> an<00:01:00.070> hsla<00:01:00.850> material<00:01:01.540> that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
up it's made of an hsla material that

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.049 
up it's made of an hsla material that
gets<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.199> high<00:01:02.410> strength<00:01:02.949> low<00:01:03.190> alloy<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.879> the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
gets a high strength low alloy is the

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.630 
gets a high strength low alloy is the
technical<00:01:04.420> when<00:01:05.379> you<00:01:05.470> spell<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.740> all<00:01:05.979> out<00:01:06.009> what

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
technical when you spell it all out what

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.609 
technical when you spell it all out what
does<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:06.970> mean<00:01:07.210> it's<00:01:07.690> an<00:01:07.869> it's<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.380> type<00:01:08.590> of

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
does that mean it's an it's a type of

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.010 
does that mean it's an it's a type of
material<00:01:09.250> similar<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.789> chromoly<00:01:10.330> it's<00:01:10.840> in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
material similar to a chromoly it's in

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.930 
material similar to a chromoly it's in
the<00:01:11.050> chromoly<00:01:11.560> family<00:01:12.160> so<00:01:12.310> what<00:01:12.490> that<00:01:12.520> means

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
the chromoly family so what that means

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.820 
the chromoly family so what that means
is<00:01:13.119> that<00:01:13.180> we<00:01:13.509> were<00:01:13.570> able<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.869> use<00:01:14.170> lighter

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
is that we were able to use lighter

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.169 
is that we were able to use lighter
weight<00:01:15.039> material<00:01:15.490> because<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.789> has<00:01:15.940> higher

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
weight material because it has higher

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.180 
weight material because it has higher
strength<00:01:16.570> properties<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:17.649> know<00:01:17.800> to<00:01:17.860> get<00:01:18.070> the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
strength properties you know to get the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.980 
strength properties you know to get the
same<00:01:18.399> strength<00:01:18.789> as<00:01:18.970> maybe<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.420> cold<00:01:19.720> rolled

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
same strength as maybe a cold rolled

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.930 
same strength as maybe a cold rolled
type<00:01:20.500> thing<00:01:20.740> that's<00:01:20.950> why<00:01:21.160> you<00:01:21.220> use<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:21.850> a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
type thing that's why you use it it's a

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.090 
type thing that's why you use it it's a
very<00:01:22.179> sophisticated<00:01:22.500> material<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.649> that's

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
very sophisticated material and that's

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.219 
very sophisticated material and that's
with<00:01:24.340> all<00:01:24.369> these<00:01:24.880> tubes<00:01:25.210> in<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.600> top<00:01:26.200> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
with all these tubes in the top the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.560 
with all these tubes in the top the
canopy<00:01:26.950> are<00:01:27.070> made<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.520> you<00:01:28.210> know<00:01:28.240> also

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
canopy are made of you know also

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.650 
canopy are made of you know also
noteworthy<00:01:29.470> is<00:01:29.979> how<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.520> exoskeleton<00:01:30.970> ties

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
noteworthy is how this exoskeleton ties

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.810 
noteworthy is how this exoskeleton ties
into<00:01:31.990> itself<00:01:32.440> it's<00:01:32.770> if<00:01:33.190> you<00:01:33.340> look<00:01:33.520> there's

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
into itself it's if you look there's

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.700 
into itself it's if you look there's
lots<00:01:34.060> of<00:01:34.270> joints<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:34.840> it's<00:01:35.170> spreading<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
lots of joints and it's spreading the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.920 
lots of joints and it's spreading the
loads<00:01:35.950> out<00:01:36.189> you<00:01:36.460> know<00:01:36.579> so<00:01:36.790> this<00:01:37.360> exoskeleton

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
loads out you know so this exoskeleton

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.840 
loads out you know so this exoskeleton
ties<00:01:38.500> all<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.890> way<00:01:39.009> into<00:01:39.189> the<00:01:39.369> front<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.729> the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
ties all the way into the front of the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.819 
ties all the way into the front of the
vehicle<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.689> when<00:01:40.840> you're<00:01:40.960> hitting<00:01:41.170> bump<00:01:41.619> or

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
vehicle so when you're hitting bump or

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.410 
vehicle so when you're hitting bump or
whatever<00:01:42.189> it's<00:01:42.610> distributing<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.390> load

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
whatever it's distributing the load

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.389 
whatever it's distributing the load
through<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.930> entire<00:01:44.259> frame<00:01:44.680> it's<00:01:44.890> not<00:01:45.070> just

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
through the entire frame it's not just

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.340 
through the entire frame it's not just
the<00:01:45.520> front<00:01:45.820> clip<00:01:46.119> taking<00:01:46.570> all<00:01:46.689> that<00:01:46.869> load<00:01:47.140> it's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
the front clip taking all that load it's

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.870 
the front clip taking all that load it's
trying<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.680> spread<00:01:47.950> it<00:01:48.130> all<00:01:48.250> out<00:01:48.310> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
trying to spread it all out and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.030 
trying to spread it all out and
distribute<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.869> makes<00:01:50.350> your<00:01:50.470> frame<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> lot

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
distribute it makes your frame a lot

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.370 
distribute it makes your frame a lot
more<00:01:51.220> durable<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.759> lot<00:01:51.939> stronger<00:01:52.299> that's<00:01:53.020> part

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
more durable a lot stronger that's part

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.139 
more durable a lot stronger that's part
of<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> beauty<00:01:53.619> of<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.130> exoskeleton<00:01:54.909> frame
