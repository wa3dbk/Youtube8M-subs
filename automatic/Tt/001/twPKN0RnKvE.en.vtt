00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello friends today we are going to teach you 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.530
 make a big fast apple is 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.120
 fast because you'll only need two 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.030
 minutes to do it since it 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.680
 cook in the microwave in this case the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.680
 flour that is normally used to make 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.689
 the crumble is replaced by cookies 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.669
 giving a different touch but very 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.669
 similar to the original apple stay 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.629
 the ingredients we need to 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.760
 make our big apple fast 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.920
 of microwaves are first two 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.890
 microwave containers suitable for 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.960
 Microwave one per person 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.160
 this is about silicone it's worth any 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.620
 but as long as it is suitable for 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.650
 microwave we need an apple this 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.809
 is to put but it can be a little to taste 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.940
 we need four cookies of this type 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.070
 of the marias 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.140
 we need 40 grams of butter and 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.730
 we need 3 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.730
 brown we begin 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.410
 The first thing we have done has been to strip 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.630
 the apple and we are cutting it in 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.280
 portions in squares do not have to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.960
 be regular because then they leave 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.400
 practically to that action and what 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.940
 we do when we already have all the 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.940
 cut apple is to put us as a base of 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.130
 our big 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.360
 we put them and we will distribute it by parts 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.360
 the same in the two molds 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.840
 once you distribute the pieces of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.330
 apples our molds what we do 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.790
 is to distribute the sugar in both 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.540
 half the amount of brown sugar 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.540
 that we had 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.630
 Wow 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.720
 and crumble the cookies on top will 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.720
 two for each mold we slide them well 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.360
 this cookies what they do is 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.550
 work like the flour that is 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.200
 use to make the normal trampoline 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.470
 does the same effect on cookies in 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.510
 the flour and is the one that will work as such 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.930
 in this big and fast that we do in 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.930
 microwave 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.020
 finally before putting them and our 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.730
 large microwave must be distributed 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.090
 the butter that we start in 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.170
 squares we put it half above 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.170
 and half in each mold 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.330
 and the last thing that will remain will be 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.450
 put it in the microwave at 800 watts of 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.280
 large power of two minutes and only in 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.900
 those two minutes we'll have a dessert 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.200
 delicious indeed then we see how 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.200
 remains 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.959
 once the two minutes have passed in the 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.389
 microwave we already have a dessert 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.999
 delicious prepared as you see the 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.430
 butter has melted and cookies 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.859
 it's quite soft that mixed with the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.200
 sugar and the apple when taking the 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.510
 We assure you that the flavor is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.030
 sensational also if what you want is 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.620
 the diet min a touch of cinnamon can you 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.139
 throw him because the flesh of the apple 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.239
 they go pretty well if you liked this 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.290
