quarter<00:02:19.510> notes<00:02:19.719> like<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.049> assay<00:02:20.319> for<00:02:20.349> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
quarter notes like this assay for the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.550 
quarter notes like this assay for the
verse<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:22.000> do<00:02:22.209> that

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
verse just do that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.339 
verse just do that
no<00:02:24.220> pressure<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.209> plus<00:02:25.480> there's<00:02:25.690> not<00:02:25.870> an

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
no pressure and plus there's not an

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.710 
no pressure and plus there's not an
actual<00:02:27.250> guitar<00:02:27.670> part<00:02:28.150> that<00:02:28.330> we're<00:02:28.510> following

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
actual guitar part that we're following

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.320 
actual guitar part that we're following
so<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.290> gives<00:02:29.380> tons<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.220> tons<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.550> room<00:02:30.760> for

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
so it gives tons and tons of room for

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.530 
so it gives tons and tons of room for
