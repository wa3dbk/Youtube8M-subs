much new face for sharing with me and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.890 
much new face for sharing with me and
this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.910> it's<00:00:14.910> called<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.210> missing<00:00:15.540> link<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
this is it's called the missing link and

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.250 
this is it's called the missing link and
anti-aging<00:00:16.770> technology<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.869> is

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
anti-aging technology and what it is is

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.880 
anti-aging technology and what it is is
a<00:00:19.760> three-part<00:00:20.760> system<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:22.859> of

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
a three-part system and it's kind of

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.460 
a three-part system and it's kind of
neat<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.090> first<00:00:24.300> thing<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.990> you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
neat so the first thing you do is you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.160 
neat so the first thing you do is you
get<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.279> start<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.640> clean<00:00:26.910> skin<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.840> I'm<00:00:28.019> not

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
get you start on clean skin and I'm not

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.169 
get you start on clean skin and I'm not
completely<00:00:28.529> clean<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.670> want<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.150> a

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
completely clean but I want to have a

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.519 
completely clean but I want to have a
little<00:00:30.449> bit<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> makeup<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.230> camera

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
little bit of makeup on for the camera

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.240 
little bit of makeup on for the camera
so<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.279> use<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> hyaluronic<00:00:33.390> acid<00:00:33.750> based<00:00:34.410> spray

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.619 

moisturize<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> next<00:00:39.239> thing<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
moisturize and the next thing you do is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.680 
moisturize and the next thing you do is
you'll<00:00:40.140> put<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.620> little<00:00:40.950> bit<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
you'll put on a little bit of the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
you'll put on a little bit of the
conductivity<00:00:42.690> gel<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.559> very<00:00:43.980> similar<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
conductivity gel this is very similar to

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.950 
conductivity gel this is very similar to
what<00:00:44.850> they<00:00:45.000> use<00:00:45.180> when<00:00:45.480> getting<00:00:45.690> an<00:00:45.780> ultrasound

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
what they use when getting an ultrasound

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.209 
what they use when getting an ultrasound
and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> device<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.770> new<00:00:49.770> face<00:00:50.010> by

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
and then the device is this new face by

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.939 
and then the device is this new face by
Carol<00:00:50.610> Cole<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.420> battery-operated<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
Carol Cole it's battery-operated so you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.970 
Carol Cole it's battery-operated so you
turn<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.600> what<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.050> does<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.559> it

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
turn it on and then what it does is it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.889 
turn it on and then what it does is it
has<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.370> conductivity<00:00:56.910> through<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.660> nodes

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
has the conductivity through the nodes

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.139 
has the conductivity through the nodes
and<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.770> apply<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.399> face<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
helps lift and firm the skin so I'll

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.340 
helps lift and firm the skin so I'll
just<00:01:02.910> give<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.210> quick<00:01:03.480> demonstration<00:01:03.719> of

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
just give you a quick demonstration of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
just give you a quick demonstration of
how<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.100> I'm<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.299> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
how you do this I'm going to get a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.859 
how you do this I'm going to get a
little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.590> back<00:01:08.159> tivity<00:01:08.520> Jo<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.150> then

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
little bit of a back tivity Jo and then

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.260 
little bit of a back tivity Jo and then
I<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.439> apply<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.820> I'll<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.000> start

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
I will apply it and I'll just start

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.690 
I will apply it and I'll just start
right<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.659> along<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.260> jawline<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.430> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
right here along the jawline and so it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.999 
right here along the jawline and so it
does<00:01:14.880> come<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.210> an<00:01:15.509> instructional<00:01:16.049> DVD<00:01:16.259> that

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
does come with an instructional DVD that

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.890 
does come with an instructional DVD that
helps<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.270> bit<00:01:18.420> more<00:01:18.600> detail

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
helps so it's a little bit more detail

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.800 
helps so it's a little bit more detail
than<00:01:19.080> me<00:01:19.259> I've<00:01:19.920> got<00:01:20.130> my<00:01:20.280> new<00:01:20.460> face<00:01:20.700> on<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.630> just

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
than me I've got my new face on you just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.200 
than me I've got my new face on you just
apply<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.500> face<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.759> hold<00:01:24.090> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
apply it to the face and you hold it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.749 
apply it to the face and you hold it
there<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.900> there's<00:01:25.530> an<00:01:25.799> advanced<00:01:26.220> technique

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
there and there's an advanced technique

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.510 
there and there's an advanced technique
where<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.689> hold<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.920> press<00:01:29.369> it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
where you would hold it and press it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580 
where you would hold it and press it
through<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> face<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.540> basically<00:01:31.200> what<00:01:31.470> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
through the face and basically what you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.010 
through the face and basically what you
do<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> go<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.850> know<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> forehead<00:01:33.689> so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
do is you go you know to the forehead so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
do is you go you know to the forehead so
if<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.200> wanted<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> brow<00:01:35.009> lift<00:01:35.040> if<00:01:35.790> you

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
if you wanted like a brow lift if you

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.999 
if you wanted like a brow lift if you
wanted<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> jaw<00:01:37.020> lift<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:37.829> go

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
wanted like a jaw lift you would go

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.460 
wanted like a jaw lift you would go
along<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.400> jawline<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> idea<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.290> behind

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
along the jawline and the idea is behind

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.859 
along the jawline and the idea is behind
the<00:01:40.770> technology<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:42.000> continue<00:01:42.420> use

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
the technology that would continue use

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.889 
the technology that would continue use
you<00:01:43.560> would<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> medical<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.299> salon

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
you would get like a medical or a salon

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.950 
you would get like a medical or a salon
type<00:01:46.259> result<00:01:46.860> well<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:48.329> gonna<00:01:48.540> keep<00:01:48.750> playing

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
type result well I'm gonna keep playing
