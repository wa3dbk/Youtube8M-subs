00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.471
 In this video I will show a different way how to use 

00:00:03.471 --> 00:00:04.750
 reversal bars. 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.450
 Completely different, not the way it is accepted 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.450
 do. 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.330
 When you see some upward upward movement, 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.830
 then a bearish reversal bar is formed, taken 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.200
 use such a bearish reversal bar to trade 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.440
 in his direction. 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.770
 In this case, to open a position in short at the close 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.300
 bar, or when the price goes below this bar. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.550
 However, when you understand the big picture on the graph, 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.460
 when you realize that the movement will be up, then 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.070
 the appearance of such a bear reversal bar can 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.140
 to be a good opportunity for you to open a position in 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 long 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.460
 In the right place on the chart. 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.620
 For example, here on this graph you can see 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 a row of bear reversal bars. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.190
 Here, here, another reversal bar and here's one reversal 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.190
 bar. 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.690
 None of them led to any downward 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
 movement. 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.729
 Instead, we see that those who opened on them 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.240
 In shorts, very quickly turned out to be in loss and were forced 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.700
 stop your shorts from your shorts. 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 Which leads to the fact that the market continues to move. 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.720
 above, since closing in the footsteps of the shortsists causes 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.720
 purchases. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.110
 Accordingly, the market is pushing it up. 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.830
 As you can see, there were two bear reversals here 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.830
 the bar. 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.860
 After that, my long on the next bar was opened, 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.140
 when this bar failed to show any downward movement 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.470
 serious 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.810
 Literally it sank down slightly and then I opened long. 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.380
 The same could be done here. 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.960
 After this bearish reversal bar, when 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.050
 this bar tried to seem to go lower but nothing 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.159
 did not work and he closed tightly. 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.110
 However, accordingly, it should be done with the right 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.900
 understanding the situation is not just because let's say 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.950
 here the bearish reversal bar appeared. 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.189
 Here is a completely different situation. 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.810
 In other words, when you see a bullish chart 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.159
 context and some kind of bearish reversal bar appears, 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.930
 then under the right conditions you can use this 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.659
 bearish reversal bar to enter the long. 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.189
 Because these reversal bars are not able to deploy 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:19.189
 trend. 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.060
 Not able to lead to downward movement and 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.359
 are just a false signal for bears to enter 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.370
 short 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.310
 Accordingly, they will close the foot. 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.109
 You can earn on their loss. 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.260
 Think about this concept, watch. 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.130
 I think you will notice how in some cases her 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.189
 can be well used. 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.989
 With you was Dmitry Boytsov. 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.400
 My blog www.dboytsov.me Put 5 and comment on the video. 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.650
 Thank.
