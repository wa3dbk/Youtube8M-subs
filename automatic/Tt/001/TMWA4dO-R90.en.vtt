00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
used to using the back button is that ok

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.619 
used to using the back button is that ok
and<00:02:52.170> now<00:02:52.290> it's<00:02:52.470> turning<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.629> obviously

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
and now it's turning on and obviously

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.089 
and now it's turning on and obviously
the<00:02:54.750> big<00:02:54.930> thing<00:02:55.109> about<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.920> back

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
the big thing about this one is the back

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.129 
the big thing about this one is the back
button<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.639> have<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.299> will<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.019> get

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.819 
wise it's so natural looking colors and
that's<00:03:37.709> why<00:03:38.269> i<00:03:39.269> will<00:03:39.750> pop<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> sim<00:03:40.260> card<00:03:40.290> in<00:03:40.620> here
