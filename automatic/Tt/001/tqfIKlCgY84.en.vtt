gaming<00:00:51.960> gear<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.219> well<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> i<00:00:54.750> think

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
gaming gear for this as well so i think

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 
gaming gear for this as well so i think
i'm<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.550> off<00:00:56.760> camera

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
i'm going to go and do this off camera

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.330 
i'm going to go and do this off camera
because<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.719> requires<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.469> sort<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.920> fiddly

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
because it requires some sort of fiddly

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
because it requires some sort of fiddly
like<00:00:59.609> i'll<00:00:59.940> give<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> look<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.719> what

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
like i'll give you a look this is what

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
like i'll give you a look this is what
it<00:01:00.989> looks<00:01:01.199> like<00:01:01.370> straight<00:01:02.370> out<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> packet

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
it looks like straight out of the packet

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.010 
it looks like straight out of the packet
i<00:01:03.510> think<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.850> left<00:01:05.850> side<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.780> your

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
i think that is the left side of your

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.700 
i think that is the left side of your
controller<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> yeah<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.560> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
controller so yeah as you can see it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
controller so yeah as you can see it's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
on a little bit strange with the scarf

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
on a little bit strange with the scarf
because<00:01:42.750> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.140> get<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.619> paddles<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.280> the

because if you get the paddles on the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.120 
because if you get the paddles on the
back<00:01:44.520> obviously<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:46.100> make<00:01:47.100> sure

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.139 
back obviously you have to make sure
that<00:01:47.810> your<00:01:48.810> grips<00:01:49.680> aren't<00:01:49.979> covering<00:01:50.310> them<00:01:50.490> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that your grips aren't covering them so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639
