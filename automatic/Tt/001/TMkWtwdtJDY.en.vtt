settings that I will be using in
competitive<00:00:22.830> play<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.279> as<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.789> can<00:00:23.910> see<00:00:23.970> here

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
competitive play and as you can see here

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.480 
competitive play and as you can see here
this<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.930> current<00:00:25.199> camera<00:00:25.800> settings<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
this is the current camera settings you

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.339 
this is the current camera settings you
get<00:00:26.730> default<00:00:27.180> straight<00:00:27.630> off<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> bat<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.289> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
get default straight off the bat on the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.550 
get default straight off the bat on the
demo<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.300> pretty<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.260> default

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
demo and pretty much this is the default

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.500 
demo and pretty much this is the default
camera<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.949> believe<00:00:32.309> it's<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> tele<00:00:33.149> but

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
camera I believe it's like a tele but

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.270 
camera I believe it's like a tele but
not<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> tally<00:00:34.050> broadcast<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.100> this

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
not a tally broadcast and it's like this

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.190 
not a tally broadcast and it's like this
at<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> custom<00:00:35.910> camera<00:00:36.180> height<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.600> ei<00:00:36.930> have

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
at a custom camera height as ei have

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.110 
at a custom camera height as ei have
said<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.610> personally<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.670> don't<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:38.910> it's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
said it personally I don't think it's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
said it personally I don't think it's
too<00:00:39.300> bad<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:40.079> there<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.350> improvements<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
too bad but there are improvements that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.709 
too bad but there are improvements that
it<00:00:41.129> needs<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.700> most<00:00:42.180> competitive

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it needs and in most competitive

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.180 
it needs and in most competitive
tournaments<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.469> camera<00:00:43.829> settings<00:00:44.100> are

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
tournaments the camera settings are

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
tournaments the camera settings are
different<00:00:44.309> regardless<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.660> EA<00:00:46.200> set

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
different regardless to what the EA set

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.970 
different regardless to what the EA set
it<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> anyway<00:00:47.070> as<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> default<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.719> want<00:00:48.899> to

to<00:01:10.020> 17<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:10.979> camera<00:01:11.280> height<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.610> think<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.909> was

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
to 17 for camera height I think it was

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149 
to 17 for camera height I think it was
18<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.450> did<00:01:12.689> eventually<00:01:12.810> change<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.979> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
18 I did eventually change it to and I

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.160 
18 I did eventually change it to and I
changed<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> camera<00:01:14.760> zoom<00:01:14.909> down<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.210> 4<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.659> 18

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
changed the camera zoom down to 4 so 18

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.870 
changed the camera zoom down to 4 so 18
on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.409> camera<00:01:16.619> height<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> 4<00:01:17.220> on<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.520> camera

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
on the camera height and 4 on the camera

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460 
on the camera height and 4 on the camera
zoom<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.240> that's<00:01:18.360> pretty<00:01:18.630> much<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.049> tele

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
zoom and that's pretty much it so tele

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.890 
zoom and that's pretty much it so tele
broadcasts<00:01:20.040> 18<00:01:20.670> camera<00:01:21.000> height<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.360> fall<00:01:21.750> on

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
broadcasts 18 camera height and fall on

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
broadcasts 18 camera height and fall on
the<00:01:21.990> zoom<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.100> already<00:01:23.460> tell<00:01:23.759> how

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the zoom and as you can already tell how

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
the zoom and as you can already tell how
much<00:01:24.270> more<00:01:24.509> players<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.320> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
much more players we can see is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
much more players we can see is
absolutely<00:01:25.740> crazy<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.390> such<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
absolutely crazy it is that such a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.600 
absolutely crazy it is that such a
better<00:01:27.960> camera<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.710> angle<00:01:29.490> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
better camera you know angle and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.069 
better camera you know angle and
perspective<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.270> be<00:01:30.360> honest<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.720> look<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
perspective to be honest and look at the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.749 
perspective to be honest and look at the
six<00:01:31.409> players<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.829> sight<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> attack

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
six players in sight of the attack

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
six players in sight of the attack
rather<00:01:33.000> than<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.840> opposed<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.290> like

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
rather than about well opposed to like

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.319 
rather than about well opposed to like
three<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.310> obviously<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.880> competitive

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
three so obviously for competitive

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.060 
three so obviously for competitive
player<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.110> easier<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> whip<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> over

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
player is so much easier to whip it over

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
player is so much easier to whip it over
the<00:01:38.250> other<00:01:38.280> side<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> pitch<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the other side of the pitch and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.310 
the other side of the pitch and
especially<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.509> you're<00:01:39.600> playing<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.990> what

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
especially if you're playing on what

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.440 
especially if you're playing on what
seems<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.159> small<00:01:41.460> monitor<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.090> mean

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
seems to be in this small monitor I mean

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600 
seems to be in this small monitor I mean
I'm<00:01:42.570> playing<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.960> 32<00:01:43.350> inch<00:01:43.439> TV<00:01:43.890> so

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
I'm playing on the 32 inch TV so

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.039 
I'm playing on the 32 inch TV so
obviously<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.390> life<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.930> quite

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
obviously it's you know life is quite

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.600 
obviously it's you know life is quite
easy<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.470> me<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.799> terms<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.100> seeing<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.430> lot<00:01:47.579> of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
easy for me in terms of seeing a lot of

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
easy for me in terms of seeing a lot of
the<00:01:47.759> things<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.049> terms<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
the things but you know in terms of the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.020 
the things but you know in terms of the
camera<00:01:49.560> angles<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.220> still<00:01:50.430> need<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> extra

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
camera angles you still need that extra

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780 
camera angles you still need that extra
bit<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.590> room<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:52.950> things<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:53.670> you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
bit of room to see things and if you

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.249 
bit of room to see things and if you
change<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> custom<00:01:54.509> camera<00:01:54.810> angles<00:01:55.110> like

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
change the custom camera angles like

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
change the custom camera angles like
that<00:01:55.470> it'll<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.250> affect<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.549> gameplay<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
that it'll just affect the gameplay so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
that it'll just affect the gameplay so
much<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.689> terms<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.409> just<00:01:58.680> seeing<00:01:58.920> everything

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
much in terms of just seeing everything

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.080 
much in terms of just seeing everything
on<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> pitch

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
on the pitch

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.580 
on the pitch
it'll<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.390> you'll<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.630> able<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.079> see<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.500> many

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it'll be you'll be able to see so many

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.679 
it'll be you'll be able to see so many
chances<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.250> maybe<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.149> would<00:02:03.299> not<00:02:03.540> have

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
chances that maybe you would not have

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.710 
chances that maybe you would not have
seen<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.170> would

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
seen if you would

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.480 
seen if you would
custom<00:02:05.050> in<00:02:05.290> your<00:02:05.410> camera<00:02:05.680> angles<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.250> saw

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
custom in your camera angles and you saw

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.130 
custom in your camera angles and you saw
that<00:02:06.670> ball<00:02:06.880> than<00:02:07.120> I<00:02:07.180> made<00:02:07.360> to<00:02:07.450> Ibrahimovic<00:02:07.990> was

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
that ball than I made to Ibrahimovic was

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.600 
that ball than I made to Ibrahimovic was
something<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.680> probably<00:02:08.920> only<00:02:09.490> would

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
something that I probably only would

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.330 
something that I probably only would
have<00:02:09.670> done<00:02:09.880> on<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.960> this<00:02:11.650> camera<00:02:11.980> setting<00:02:12.250> of

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
have done on the this camera setting of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.310 
have done on the this camera setting of
course<00:02:12.520> and<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:13.810> know<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.960> got<00:02:14.110> another

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
course and you know I got another

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.110 
course and you know I got another
example<00:02:14.800> here<00:02:14.920> coming<00:02:15.190> up<00:02:15.280> very<00:02:15.460> very<00:02:15.760> shortly

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
example here coming up very very shortly

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120 
example here coming up very very shortly
and<00:02:16.510> as<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:17.050> can<00:02:17.140> see<00:02:17.200> here<00:02:17.530> we<00:02:17.650> have<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.830> break

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and as you can see here we have a break

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.920 
and as you can see here we have a break
with<00:02:18.340> Matuidi<00:02:18.790> down<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.270> wing<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.690> at<00:02:19.810> this

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
with Matuidi down the wing and at this

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.660 
with Matuidi down the wing and at this
point<00:02:20.140> in<00:02:20.290> time<00:02:20.500> I'm<00:02:20.710> actually<00:02:20.890> looking<00:02:21.490> at

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
point in time I'm actually looking at

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.790 
point in time I'm actually looking at
where<00:02:21.910> Cavani<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.480> right<00:02:22.690> now<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.900> see<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.620> to

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
where Cavani is right now to see and to

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.860 
where Cavani is right now to see and to
spot<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.370> open<00:02:24.670> header<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.240> also<00:02:25.480> hope

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
spot the open header that we also hope

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.470 
spot the open header that we also hope
he<00:02:26.050> will<00:02:26.200> convert<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.670> basically<00:02:28.120> can<00:02:28.270> see

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
he will convert as you basically can see

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360 
he will convert as you basically can see
that<00:02:28.780> Cavani<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.440> arrow<00:02:29.710> is<00:02:29.950> pointing<00:02:30.250> to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
that Cavani that arrow is pointing to

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.250 
that Cavani that arrow is pointing to
the<00:02:30.460> space<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:30.790> he<00:02:31.240> will<00:02:31.390> run<00:02:31.630> into<00:02:31.900> and<00:02:32.170> if

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the space that he will run into and if

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.480 
the space that he will run into and if
you<00:02:32.350> were<00:02:32.440> playing<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.920> normal<00:02:33.310> default

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
you were playing on the normal default

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.130 
you were playing on the normal default
camera<00:02:34.000> angle<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.390> would<00:02:34.540> not<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.960> been

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
camera angle you would not have been

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.450 
camera angle you would not have been
able<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.650> much<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.340> it'd<00:02:36.430> have

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
able to see much of that so it'd have

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.310 
able to see much of that so it'd have
made<00:02:36.640> life<00:02:36.910> on<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.209> FIFA<00:02:37.510> pitch<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.170> this

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
made life on the FIFA pitch but for this

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.810 
made life on the FIFA pitch but for this
part<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> tutorial<00:02:39.130> we're<00:02:39.670> actually

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
part of the tutorial we're actually

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.340 
part of the tutorial we're actually
moving<00:02:40.060> on<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.570> Xbox<00:02:40.810> one<00:02:41.140> wireless

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
moving on to the Xbox one wireless

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.010 
moving on to the Xbox one wireless
controller<00:02:41.890> settings<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.520> know<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.360> didn't<00:02:43.930> have

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
controller settings I know I didn't have

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.330 
controller settings I know I didn't have
to<00:02:44.140> read<00:02:44.320> that<00:02:44.500> out<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.770> course<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.040> wireless

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
to read that out of course the wireless

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.949 
to read that out of course the wireless
controller<00:02:45.640> part<00:02:45.910> but<00:02:46.090> for<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.450> settings<00:02:46.840> for

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
controller part but for the settings for

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.540 
controller part but for the settings for
the<00:02:47.080> most<00:02:47.260> part<00:02:47.500> they're<00:02:47.890> all<00:02:48.040> set<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
the most part they're all set to the

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.850 
the most part they're all set to the
preset<00:02:49.060> of<00:02:49.209> classic<00:02:49.959> and<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.350> means<00:02:50.620> there

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
preset of classic and that means there

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.760 
preset of classic and that means there
are<00:02:50.980> no<00:02:51.220> altars<00:02:51.640> to<00:02:51.670> whatever<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:52.600> are<00:02:52.770> you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
are no altars to whatever there are you

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.020 
are no altars to whatever there are you
know<00:02:53.860> button<00:02:54.160> mapping<00:02:54.490> on<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.700> controller

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
know button mapping on the controller

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.670 
know button mapping on the controller
every<00:02:55.390> single<00:02:55.630> button<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.930> exactly<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.500> same

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
every single button is exactly the same

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080 
every single button is exactly the same
as<00:02:56.800> default<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.340> basically<00:02:57.670> haven't<00:02:57.850> changed

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
as default so basically haven't changed

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.880 
as default so basically haven't changed
anything<00:02:58.300> on<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.990> now<00:02:59.380> we're<00:02:59.530> moving<00:02:59.680> on

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
anything on that and now we're moving on

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.260 
anything on that and now we're moving on
to<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.100> most<00:03:00.250> crucial<00:03:00.520> part<00:03:00.910> this<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.060> the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
to the most crucial part this is the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:02.730 
to the most crucial part this is the
gameplay<00:03:01.480> assistance<00:03:02.140> settings<00:03:02.530> we<00:03:02.709> have

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
gameplay assistance settings we have

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.590 
gameplay assistance settings we have
auto<00:03:03.070> switching<00:03:03.520> on<00:03:03.670> airballs

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
auto switching on airballs

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.760 
auto switching on airballs
this<00:03:04.750> basically<00:03:05.110> means<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:05.470> aloni

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
this basically means that aloni

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.040 
this basically means that aloni
automatically<00:03:06.459> switched<00:03:06.700> your<00:03:06.820> players<00:03:07.150> when

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
automatically switched your players when

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.540 
automatically switched your players when
the<00:03:08.170> ball<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.560> flying<00:03:08.709> over<00:03:09.190> in<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.430> air

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
the ball is flying over in the air

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.340 
the ball is flying over in the air
towards<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.239> player<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:10.750> it'll<00:03:10.900> automatically

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
towards a player so it'll automatically

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.960 
towards a player so it'll automatically
switch<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.709> switch<00:03:12.040> it<00:03:12.190> for<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:12.760> that's

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
switch you switch it for that so that's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.370 
switch you switch it for that so that's
in<00:03:13.150> terms<00:03:13.180> of<00:03:13.540> you<00:03:13.660> know<00:03:13.750> hitting<00:03:13.959> it<00:03:14.110> over<00:03:14.290> the

resistant is going to be off I've had it
on<00:03:31.150> sometimes<00:03:31.510> but<00:03:31.959> I<00:03:31.989> don't<00:03:32.200> really<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.530> a

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
on sometimes but I don't really see a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.990 
on sometimes but I don't really see a
difference<00:03:32.830> that<00:03:33.220> much<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.610> terms<00:03:33.640> of<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
difference that much in terms of the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.910 
difference that much in terms of the
passing<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.450> mean<00:03:34.570> obviously<00:03:34.900> you<00:03:35.110> tap<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.680> or

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
passing I mean obviously you tap a or

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.710 
passing I mean obviously you tap a or
assist<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.370> for<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.880> whether<00:03:37.390> you<00:03:37.570> want

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
assist it for you and whether you want

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.900 
assist it for you and whether you want
to<00:03:37.810> do<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.019> long<00:03:38.230> pass<00:03:38.470> or<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.739> short<00:03:38.980> pass<00:03:39.160> it

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
to do it long pass or a short pass it

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.100 
to do it long pass or a short pass it
doesn't<00:03:40.150> really<00:03:40.299> matter<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:40.720> off<00:03:40.900> is

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
doesn't really matter but off is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.110 
doesn't really matter but off is
probably<00:03:41.530> preferred<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.250> guess<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.670> some<00:03:42.880> sort

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
probably preferred I guess in some sort

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.460 
probably preferred I guess in some sort
of<00:03:43.150> way<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.360> mean<00:03:43.480> obviously<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:44.080> want<00:03:44.230> a<00:03:44.260> time

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
of way I mean obviously you want a time

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.479 
of way I mean obviously you want a time
that<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.709> might<00:03:44.830> judge<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.220> weight<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.459> your

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
that you might judge the weight of your

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.640 
that you might judge the weight of your
passes<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.150> so<00:03:46.600> that's<00:03:46.780> what<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.049> from

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
passes and so that's what I do from

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.440 
passes and so that's what I do from
there<00:03:47.860> onwards<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.459> basically<00:03:49.060> everything

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
there onwards and basically everything

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.210 
there onwards and basically everything
else<00:03:49.660> from<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.500> gameplay<00:03:50.680> assistant

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
else from the gameplay assistant

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.289 
else from the gameplay assistant
settings<00:03:51.519> are<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:52.000> same

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
settings are the same

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.600 
settings are the same
I<00:03:52.510> do<00:03:53.110> sometimes<00:03:53.500> like<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:53.980> switch<00:03:54.220> up<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
I do sometimes like to switch up the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.820 
I do sometimes like to switch up the
analog<00:03:55.150> sprints<00:03:55.540> I<00:03:55.690> sometimes<00:03:55.930> are<00:03:56.230> on<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.769> I

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
analog sprints I sometimes are on and I

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.259 
analog sprints I sometimes are on and I
don't<00:03:57.010> really<00:03:57.310> see<00:03:57.519> much<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.940> difference

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
don't really see much of a difference

00:03:58.269 --> 00:03:59.970 
don't really see much of a difference
within<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.720> but<00:03:58.900> I<00:03:58.930> know<00:03:59.049> it'll<00:03:59.440> have<00:03:59.709> some

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
within it but I know it'll have some

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.770 
within it but I know it'll have some
sort<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.220> benefit<00:04:00.640> if<00:04:00.820> you<00:04:01.060> get<00:04:01.360> used<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.690> it

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
sort of benefit if you get used to it

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.810 
sort of benefit if you get used to it
because<00:04:01.959> of<00:04:02.230> the<00:04:02.320> way<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.860> you<00:04:03.160> can<00:04:03.459> control

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
because of the way that you can control

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.280 
because of the way that you can control
your<00:04:03.970> sprint<00:04:04.330> you<00:04:04.480> know<00:04:04.600> like<00:04:04.840> never<00:04:05.110> before

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
your sprint you know like never before

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.110 
your sprint you know like never before
you<00:04:05.590> basically<00:04:05.950> get<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:06.430> know<00:04:06.519> sprint<00:04:06.940> down

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
you basically get you know sprint down

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.330 
you basically get you know sprint down
the<00:04:07.299> wing<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.780> full<00:04:08.140> pelt<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.650> basically

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
the wing just full pelt and basically

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.280 
the wing just full pelt and basically
just<00:04:09.610> ease<00:04:10.150> off<00:04:10.420> the<00:04:10.450> right<00:04:10.750> trigger<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.200> it

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
just ease off the right trigger and it

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.630 
just ease off the right trigger and it
will<00:04:11.410> slow<00:04:11.709> your<00:04:11.920> player<00:04:12.130> down<00:04:12.370> gradually

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
will slow your player down gradually

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.430 
will slow your player down gradually
rather<00:04:13.150> than<00:04:13.360> coming<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.780> complete<00:04:14.140> stop

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
rather than coming to a complete stop

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.540 
rather than coming to a complete stop
when<00:04:14.830> you<00:04:14.950> let<00:04:15.310> go

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
when you let go

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.640 
when you let go
of<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.970> right<00:04:16.150> trigger<00:04:16.360> it's<00:04:17.230> not<00:04:17.410> that

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
of the right trigger it's not that

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.289 
of the right trigger it's not that
useful<00:04:17.890> in<00:04:18.190> certain<00:04:18.340> situations<00:04:18.670> but<00:04:19.209> then

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
useful in certain situations but then

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.180 
useful in certain situations but then
again<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.600> can<00:04:19.810> be<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.230> don't<00:04:20.620> normally<00:04:21.070> play

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
again it can be and don't normally play

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.620 
again it can be and don't normally play
with<00:04:21.370> analog<00:04:21.700> Sprint<00:04:21.970> on<00:04:22.060> but<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.240> tried<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.540> for

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
with analog Sprint on but I tried it for

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.210 
with analog Sprint on but I tried it for
this<00:04:22.690> demo<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.140> everything<00:04:23.530> seemed<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:24.160> know

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
this demo and everything seemed you know

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.250 
this demo and everything seemed you know
to<00:04:24.340> be<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.670> same<00:04:24.910> if<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.660> would<00:04:25.990> have<00:04:26.080> just

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
to be the same if you would have just

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.900 
to be the same if you would have just
turned<00:04:26.350> it<00:04:26.500> off<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.800> first<00:04:26.920> place<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.820> I'm

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
turned it off in the first place so I'm

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.910 
turned it off in the first place so I'm
not<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.150> know<00:04:28.240> kind<00:04:28.450> of<00:04:28.480> advising<00:04:29.440> that<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.800> be

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
not you know kind of advising that to be

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.470 
not you know kind of advising that to be
you<00:04:30.070> know<00:04:30.190> switched<00:04:30.490> on<00:04:30.730> because<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.210> doesn't

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
you know switched on because it doesn't

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.640 
you know switched on because it doesn't
really<00:04:31.600> make<00:04:31.810> that<00:04:31.840> much<00:04:31.990> of<00:04:32.230> a<00:04:32.290> difference

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650
