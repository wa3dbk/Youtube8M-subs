 personally versed in movie updates and 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.910
 music but it can be accurately defined as 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.680
 the most patient 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.019
 especially in relation to one of 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.509
 the most promising would seem 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.400
 painting forbidden dances which 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.800
 threatened to make the cinema of the country 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 premiere held in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.160
 Almaty shopping and entertainment 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.710
 center gathered numerous 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.930

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.479
 film making 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 ranging from producers to director and 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.740
 screenwriter ending professional 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.049
 dancers after anxious waiting 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.540
 filled with performances of Kazakhstan 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.670
 stars and dancers with words of gratitude and 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 calls not to judge too harshly it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.110
 creation guests stalked in several 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.600
 multiplex halls will not mention 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.549
 all the pros and cons of the movie but be warned 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 that one should not expect any dancing in 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.990
 first 60 minutes but in the last 40 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.119
 minutes of active movements will be 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.549
 plenty of these picture liked 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.829
 because it is so colossal 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.290
 Target me seems baked dancing 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.170
 This is a unique product you need to 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.770
 It formed from components and here 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.049
 Now it seems to me that 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.369
 then the director is a choreographer 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.560
 it happened that 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.359
 perform the general producer she 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.270
 also danced to dance once 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.039
 it happened that here is the whole underground 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.439
 Dance Kazakhstan Almaty in 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.239
 Particularly it seems to me and Kyrgyz too he 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.500
 all here I was very happy for 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.810
 appearance of such a company 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.390
 That was you know what I guys raised 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.599
 the bar guys did something like that 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.700
 possible and very gentle viewer 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.830
 You probably looked at the trailer more than once 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.160
 read reviews and already heard 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.720

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.790

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.670
 rush, are full of all sorts of reviews 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.799
 starting from the inept playing of the temple actors 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.110
 the plot of rambling dialogues 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.810
 finishing dynamic choreography 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.030
 excellent shots and outrageous images 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.610
 it turned out the movie or not everyone is for himself 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.750
 decides for himself but for the courage and risk of guys 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.750
