00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.459 

the<00:00:11.040> flagship<00:00:11.910> model<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.570> quad-core<00:00:12.809> CPUs

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
the flagship model of the quad-core CPUs

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.000 
the flagship model of the quad-core CPUs
from<00:00:13.710> AMD<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.400> one<00:00:14.610> here<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.260> 975<00:00:16.260> model

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
from AMD this one here is the 975 model

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.330 
from AMD this one here is the 975 model
as<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:18.029> see<00:00:18.270> here<00:00:19.109> there's<00:00:19.619> not<00:00:19.980> much

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
as you can see here there's not much

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.790 
as you can see here there's not much
that<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:21.029> changing<00:00:21.510> from<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> stats<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.619> we

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
that is changing from the stats so we

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.439 
that is changing from the stats so we
look<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> specifications<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.269> it's<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
look at the specifications here it's a

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.660 
look at the specifications here it's a
3.6<00:00:25.199> gigahertz<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:25.920> there's<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> speed<00:00:26.460> bump

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
3.6 gigahertz so there's a speed bump

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
3.6 gigahertz so there's a speed bump
there<00:00:26.970> from<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> previous<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> 970<00:00:28.740> was

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
there from the previous one the 970 was

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.939 
there from the previous one the 970 was
a<00:00:28.890> 3.5<00:00:29.179> it<00:00:30.179> still<00:00:30.449> has<00:00:30.660> eight<00:00:30.960> Meg's<00:00:31.320> total<00:00:31.830> of

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
a 3.5 it still has eight Meg's total of

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.819 
a 3.5 it still has eight Meg's total of
cash<00:00:32.219> six<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> level<00:00:33.239> three<00:00:33.680> still<00:00:34.680> an

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
cash six of it is level three still an

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.780 
cash six of it is level three still an
m3<00:00:35.700> socket<00:00:36.360> CPU<00:00:36.899> using<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> 45<00:00:38.309> nanometer

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
m3 socket CPU using the 45 nanometer

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.830 
m3 socket CPU using the 45 nanometer
architecture<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.670> basically<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:42.390> CPU

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
architecture and basically the CPU

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.660 
architecture and basically the CPU
itself<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.350> virtually<00:00:43.950> identical<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
itself is virtually identical to the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.420 
itself is virtually identical to the
previous<00:00:45.200> 970<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.829> hundred<00:00:47.160> megahertz

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
previous 970 but one hundred megahertz

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.770 
previous 970 but one hundred megahertz
more<00:00:47.910> still<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.600> 125<00:00:49.469> watt<00:00:50.270> CPU<00:00:51.270> using<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
more still a 125 watt CPU using the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.619 
more still a 125 watt CPU using the
Deneb<00:00:52.050> core<00:00:52.440> basically<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.789> I've<00:00:54.059> swapped

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
Deneb core basically so I've swapped

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.750 
Deneb core basically so I've swapped
CPUs<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.410> had<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> 970<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.579> system

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
CPUs I had the 970 in this system

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.619 
CPUs I had the 970 in this system
previously<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.719> put<00:00:57.960> in<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.579> 975

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
previously and I put in this 975

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.439 
previously and I put in this 975
quad-core<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.609> my<00:01:02.609> expectations<00:01:03.329> are

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
quad-core and my expectations are

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
quad-core and my expectations are
basically<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> should<00:01:04.650> give<00:01:04.799> us<00:01:04.949> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
basically that it should give us a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.710 
basically that it should give us a
hundred<00:01:05.489> megahertz<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:06.090> performance

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
hundred megahertz more performance

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.010 
hundred megahertz more performance
roughly<00:01:07.140> from<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> 970<00:01:08.250> now<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.240> question<00:01:09.840> is

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
roughly from the 970 now the question is

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
roughly from the 970 now the question is
why<00:01:10.590> would<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.770> buy<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:10.979> quad-core<00:01:11.310> at<00:01:11.850> 3.6

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
why would you buy a quad-core at 3.6

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.200 
why would you buy a quad-core at 3.6
gigahertz<00:01:13.080> instead<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> 6<00:01:14.250> core<00:01:14.520> CPU<00:01:15.000> for

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
gigahertz instead of a 6 core CPU for

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.480 
gigahertz instead of a 6 core CPU for
example<00:01:15.750> well<00:01:16.680> we're<00:01:16.799> gonna<00:01:16.920> take<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> look<00:01:17.340> at

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
example well we're gonna take a look at

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
example well we're gonna take a look at
that<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.880> second<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.689> when<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.900> comes<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
that in a second but when it comes to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.270 
that in a second but when it comes to
gaming<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.630> doing<00:01:21.630> your<00:01:22.049> everyday<00:01:22.350> stuff<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
gaming and doing your everyday stuff you

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.920 
gaming and doing your everyday stuff you
really<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.670> need<00:01:23.759> 6<00:01:24.090> cores<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.659> for

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
really don't need 6 cores right for

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
really don't need 6 cores right for
courses<00:01:25.350> enough<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.860> see<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
courses enough and you can see here if I

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.060 
courses enough and you can see here if I
with<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.299> 4<00:01:27.570> cores<00:01:27.960> temperatures<00:01:28.920> are

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
with these 4 cores temperatures are

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.399 
with these 4 cores temperatures are
terrific<00:01:29.369> 29<00:01:30.180> degrees<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.780> low<00:01:31.579> 46<00:01:32.579> degrees<00:01:32.939> at

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
terrific 29 degrees on low 46 degrees at

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.840 
terrific 29 degrees on low 46 degrees at
maximum<00:01:34.409> load<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.890> mean<00:01:35.250> nothing<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> touch

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
maximum load I mean nothing can touch

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.670 
maximum load I mean nothing can touch
that<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.689> awesome<00:01:36.869> temperatures

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
that that is just awesome temperatures

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.460 
that that is just awesome temperatures
here<00:01:38.040> running<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.490> as<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:39.150> can<00:01:39.329> see<00:01:39.570> doing

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
here running it as you can see doing

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.490 
here running it as you can see doing
some<00:01:40.820> burnin<00:01:41.820> tests<00:01:42.299> make<00:01:42.509> sure<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.079> CPU

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
some burnin tests make sure that the CPU

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.069 
some burnin tests make sure that the CPU
is<00:01:43.560> able<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> keep<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:45.899> even

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
is able to keep up and it's not even

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.030 
is able to keep up and it's not even
sweating<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.460> looking<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.270> some<00:01:49.049> more<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
sweating so looking at some more of the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.889 
sweating so looking at some more of the
specs<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.880> system<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:51.479> see<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.810> the

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
specs of my system you can see there the

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
specs of my system you can see there the
memory<00:01:52.229> timings<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.280> video<00:01:53.549> card<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.030> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
memory timings and the video card that I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.609 
memory timings and the video card that I
have<00:01:54.470> installed<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.490> machine<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.619> now

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
have installed in the machine and now

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.539 
have installed in the machine and now
we're<00:01:58.770> gonna<00:01:58.860> look<00:01:59.009> at<00:01:59.159> some<00:01:59.340> temperature

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
we're gonna look at some temperature

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.270 
we're gonna look at some temperature
readings<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.360> again<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.200> back<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:02.100> at

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
readings so again going back here at

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.730 
readings so again going back here at
idle<00:02:02.939> mode<00:02:03.149> we're<00:02:03.420> roughly<00:02:04.079> about<00:02:04.229> thirty

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
idle mode we're roughly about thirty

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.219 
idle mode we're roughly about thirty
degrees<00:02:05.219> Celsius<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.119> give<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.479> take<00:02:06.630> two

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
degrees Celsius here give or take two

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.809 
degrees Celsius here give or take two
degrees<00:02:07.649> depending<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> ambient

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
degrees depending on the ambient

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.350 
degrees depending on the ambient
temperature<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.530> changes<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.220> room

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
temperature and the changes in the room

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.130 
temperature and the changes in the room
that's<00:02:12.690> still<00:02:12.930> pretty<00:02:13.230> low<00:02:13.910> overclocking

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
that's still pretty low overclocking

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.660 
that's still pretty low overclocking
previously<00:02:16.140> with<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.470> 970<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.190> was<00:02:17.370> able<00:02:17.520> to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
previously with the 970 I was able to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.300 
previously with the 970 I was able to
get<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.090> 4.2<00:02:18.690> gigahertz<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.100> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
get the 4.2 gigahertz with this one I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.070 
get the 4.2 gigahertz with this one I
got<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.790> 4.3<00:02:21.450> gigahertz

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
got the 4.3 gigahertz

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.260 
got the 4.3 gigahertz
so<00:02:22.290> nothing<00:02:22.710> out<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.190> ordinary<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.790> no

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
so nothing out of the ordinary there no

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.960 
so nothing out of the ordinary there no
surprise<00:02:24.920> being<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.010> black<00:02:26.220> addition<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.910> is

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
surprise being a black addition this is

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.540 
surprise being a black addition this is
easily<00:02:27.390> overclockable<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> nice<00:02:28.890> 700

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
easily overclockable so a nice 700

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.250 
easily overclockable so a nice 700

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
megahertz gain from the defaults is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.680 
megahertz gain from the defaults is
pretty<00:02:31.530> sweet<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.030> all<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.090> had<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.540> was

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
pretty sweet and all I had to do was

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.570 
pretty sweet and all I had to do was
increase<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.170> multiplier<00:02:34.320> and<00:02:35.070> a<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.490> bit

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
increase the multiplier and a little bit

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
increase the multiplier and a little bit
the<00:02:35.700> bus<00:02:35.880> speed<00:02:36.150> there<00:02:36.330> went<00:02:36.540> up<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.780> 205<00:02:37.260> from

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the bus speed there went up to 205 from

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.790 
the bus speed there went up to 205 from
200<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.940> about<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.990> voltage<00:02:40.410> was

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
200 that's just about it the voltage was

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.970 
200 that's just about it the voltage was
increased<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.460> about<00:02:41.700> 1.4<00:02:42.630> 7-5<00:02:43.230> but<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
increased to about 1.4 7-5 but the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.610 
increased to about 1.4 7-5 but the
memory<00:02:44.340> was<00:02:44.760> left<00:02:45.030> identical<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.470> can

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
memory was left identical and you can

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.290 
memory was left identical and you can
see<00:02:46.800> there<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.130> maximum<00:02:47.700> load<00:02:47.970> temperature

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
see there the maximum load temperature

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.900 
see there the maximum load temperature
and<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.170> idle<00:02:49.920> temperatures<00:02:50.430> have<00:02:50.880> increased

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
and the idle temperatures have increased

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.260 
and the idle temperatures have increased
a<00:02:51.570> little<00:02:51.930> bit<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.230> would<00:02:52.470> say<00:02:52.620> about<00:02:53.060> five<00:02:54.060> to

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
a little bit I would say about five to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.690 
a little bit I would say about five to
ten<00:02:54.510> degrees<00:02:54.930> Celsius<00:02:54.959> depending<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.010> the

ten degrees Celsius depending on the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.720 
ten degrees Celsius depending on the
load<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.540> overall<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.800> get<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.980> great<00:02:59.280> results

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
load but overall you get a great results

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.750 
load but overall you get a great results
at<00:02:59.850> 4.3<00:03:00.660> gigahertz<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.320> can't<00:03:01.590> complain<00:03:01.980> now

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
at 4.3 gigahertz you can't complain now

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.730 
at 4.3 gigahertz you can't complain now

you that are wondering now when I talk

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.930 
you that are wondering now when I talk
about<00:03:55.019> calculations<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:55.920> speed<00:03:56.280> here<00:03:56.850> you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
about calculations and speed here you

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.240 
about calculations and speed here you
can<00:03:57.090> see<00:03:57.330> at<00:03:57.510> default<00:03:57.840> clock<00:03:58.320> speeds<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:59.010> takes

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
can see at default clock speeds it takes

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.490 
can see at default clock speeds it takes
about<00:03:59.430> nineteen<00:04:00.060> point<00:04:00.630> two<00:04:00.690> seconds<00:04:01.320> to

calculate<00:04:01.950> pi<00:04:02.160> to<00:04:02.220> 1<00:04:02.580> million<00:04:02.790> decimals<00:04:03.390> if<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
calculate pi to 1 million decimals if I

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.860 
calculate pi to 1 million decimals if I
overclock<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.650> sixteen<00:04:05.400> point<00:04:05.700> three<00:04:05.870> seconds

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
overclock it sixteen point three seconds

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.640 
overclock it sixteen point three seconds
so<00:04:07.019> that's<00:04:07.860> three<00:04:08.100> seconds<00:04:08.600> in<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:10.170> game

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
so that's three seconds in the game

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.800 
so that's three seconds in the game

still<00:05:01.150> they're<00:05:01.690> four<00:05:02.400> cores<00:05:03.400> running<00:05:04.080> pretty

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
still they're four cores running pretty

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.320 
still they're four cores running pretty
