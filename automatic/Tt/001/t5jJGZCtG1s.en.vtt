Recording Revolution com did a recording
workshop<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.590> Nashville<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.340> one<00:00:20.910> of

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
workshop here in Nashville and one of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.159 
workshop here in Nashville and one of
the<00:00:21.060> cool<00:00:21.210> parts<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> workshop<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.019> the

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
the cool parts of the workshop is the

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:23.419 
the cool parts of the workshop is the
second<00:00:22.589> day<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:22.890> spend<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.249> whole<00:00:23.369> day

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
second day we just spend the whole day

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.609 
second day we just spend the whole day
mixing<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> tracks<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.900> recorded<00:00:24.929> the<00:00:25.470> first

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
mixing the tracks we recorded the first

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.919 
mixing the tracks we recorded the first
day<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.980> Graham<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.179> kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.509> swap<00:00:27.720> off

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
day and Graham and I kind of swap off

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.479 
day and Graham and I kind of swap off
mixing<00:00:28.349> different<00:00:28.470> parts<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> song<00:00:29.220> and

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
mixing different parts of the song and

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.399 
mixing different parts of the song and
teaching<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.659> ways<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.989> we<00:00:31.079> go<00:00:31.230> about

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:31.409 
teaching the ways that we go about

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.380 
teaching the ways that we go about
mixing<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.610> really<00:00:32.820> cool<00:00:32.970> is<00:00:33.239> these

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
mixing and what was really cool is these

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.180 
mixing and what was really cool is these
workshops<00:00:33.900> in<00:00:34.050> any<00:00:34.200> time<00:00:34.470> I<00:00:34.500> sit<00:00:34.860> down<00:00:34.890> with

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
workshops in any time I sit down with

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
workshops in any time I sit down with
any<00:00:35.399> engineer<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.060> watch<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.450> work<00:00:36.600> I

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
any engineer and watch them work I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.750 
any engineer and watch them work I
always<00:00:37.230> learn<00:00:37.410> something<00:00:37.620> new<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.130> I<00:00:38.610> feel

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
always learn something new and I feel

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
always learn something new and I feel
like<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:38.940> an<00:00:39.120> ongoing<00:00:39.420> never-ending

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
like that's an ongoing never-ending

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.960 
like that's an ongoing never-ending
process<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:40.980> love<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.370> about<00:00:41.580> recording

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
process and I love that about recording

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.390 
process and I love that about recording
because<00:00:42.240> it<00:00:42.390> leaves<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:43.740> possibilities

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
because it leaves and the possibilities

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.830 
because it leaves and the possibilities
are<00:00:44.430> endless<00:00:44.550> as<00:00:45.060> far<00:00:45.240> as<00:00:45.330> things<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.660> can

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
are endless as far as things you can

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.870 
are endless as far as things you can
discover<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.830> new<00:00:47.160> techniques<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.820> new

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
discover and in new techniques and new

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.850 
discover and in new techniques and new
ways<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.240> getting<00:00:48.510> cool<00:00:48.690> new<00:00:48.840> sounds<00:00:49.290> so

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
ways of getting cool new sounds so

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
ways of getting cool new sounds so
something<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.370> Graham<00:00:50.670> did<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> mix<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
something that Graham did in the mix I

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.910 
something that Graham did in the mix I
thought<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.290> pretty<00:00:52.470> interesting<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.800> it

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
thought was pretty interesting and it

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.680 
thought was pretty interesting and it
had<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.280> with<00:00:53.310> parallel<00:00:53.850> processing<00:00:54.510> now

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
had to do with parallel processing now

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.150 
had to do with parallel processing now
I've<00:00:54.780> talked<00:00:55.020> about<00:00:55.140> parallel<00:00:55.650> processing

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
I've talked about parallel processing

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.620 
I've talked about parallel processing
before<00:00:56.280> especially<00:00:56.610> parallel<00:00:57.240> compression

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
before especially parallel compression

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.240 
before especially parallel compression
and<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.380> you're<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.590> familiar<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:58.980> that

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and if you're not familiar with that

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.930 
and if you're not familiar with that
that's<00:00:59.490> simply<00:00:59.790> taking<00:01:00.240> a<00:01:00.440> signal<00:01:01.440> and

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
that's simply taking a signal and

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.039 
that's simply taking a signal and
duplicating<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.060> and<00:01:03.210> processing<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> twice

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
duplicating it and processing it twice

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.530 
duplicating it and processing it twice
so<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.920> example<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:05.400> sitting<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.970> with

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so for example we're sitting here with

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.560 
so for example we're sitting here with
these<00:01:06.960> drum<00:01:07.500> tracks<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> just<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.300> simple

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
these drum tracks it's just a simple

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.510 
these drum tracks it's just a simple
kick<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.409> kick<00:01:10.440> drum<00:01:10.800> mics<00:01:11.010> snare<00:01:11.370> and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
kick to kick drum mics snare and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
kick to kick drum mics snare and
overheads<00:01:11.940> they<00:01:12.360> were<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.690> no<00:01:12.780> Tom's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
overheads they were actually no Tom's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
overheads they were actually no Tom's
played<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.590> particular<00:01:13.830> song<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.540> we've

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
played on this particular song and we've

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.180 
played on this particular song and we've
got<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.930> all<00:01:16.050> eq'd<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.650> compressed<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
got them all eq'd and compressed and

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.190 
got them all eq'd and compressed and
running<00:01:17.460> through<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> drum<00:01:18.120> buss<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
running through a drum buss as you can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.290 
running through a drum buss as you can
see<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.970> sounds<00:01:21.240> like

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
see here now this is what it sounds like

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.210 
see here now this is what it sounds like
with<00:01:21.570> just<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.229> those<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> little<00:01:23.130> bit

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
with just just those with a little bit

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.950 
with just just those with a little bit
eq<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.610> compression<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.090> mics<00:01:24.750> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
eq and compression on the mics and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:37.250 
eq and compression on the mics and
nothing<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.560> drum<00:01:25.770> buss<00:01:36.049> okay<00:01:37.049> pretty

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
nothing on the drum buss okay pretty

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.630 
nothing on the drum buss okay pretty
some<00:01:37.470> pretty<00:01:37.770> straightforward<00:01:38.220> stuff<00:01:38.370> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
some pretty straightforward stuff and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940 
some pretty straightforward stuff and
it's<00:01:39.510> nice<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.990> punchy<00:01:40.350> everything<00:01:40.650> sounds

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
it's nice it's punchy everything sounds

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.800 
it's nice it's punchy everything sounds
good<00:01:41.159> we're<00:01:41.549> happy<00:01:41.580> with<00:01:41.940> that<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.510> one<00:01:42.659> thing

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
good we're happy with that but one thing

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.110 
good we're happy with that but one thing
you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.020> do<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.530> maximize<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.370> is<00:01:44.610> do

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
you can do to really maximize that is do

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.399 
you can do to really maximize that is do
something<00:01:45.479> called<00:01:45.659> parallel<00:01:46.049> compression

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
something called parallel compression

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.410 
something called parallel compression
and<00:01:46.740> typically<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.580> way<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.729> do<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.330> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and typically the way I do that is I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.870 
and typically the way I do that is I
take<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.840> drum<00:01:49.140> bus<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.159> just<00:01:50.400> duplicate

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
take this drum bus and I just duplicate

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.810 
take this drum bus and I just duplicate
it<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:52.049> I've<00:01:52.140> got<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.290> second<00:01:52.799> bus<00:01:53.549> with

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it so that I've got a second bus with

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.850 
it so that I've got a second bus with
the<00:01:53.909> exact<00:01:54.270> same<00:01:54.540> signal<00:01:55.229> feeding<00:01:55.500> into<00:01:55.740> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the exact same signal feeding into it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.899 
the exact same signal feeding into it
and<00:01:55.950> then<00:01:56.040> I'll<00:01:56.130> compress<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> pretty

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and then I'll compress that pretty

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.820 
and then I'll compress that pretty
heavily<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.479> blend<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> two<00:01:58.260> together<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
heavily and blend the two together and

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.260 
heavily and blend the two together and
Graham<00:01:59.400> did<00:01:59.610> something<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.970> slightly

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
Graham did something a slightly

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.670 
Graham did something a slightly
different<00:02:00.570> than<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> thought<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.530> cool

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
different than I thought was really cool

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.500 
different than I thought was really cool
and<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:01.890> wanted<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.159> share<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.460> today<00:02:02.580> he

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
and I wanted to share with you today he

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.600 
and I wanted to share with you today he
instead<00:02:03.900> of<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.200> duplicating<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.010> bus<00:02:05.340> as

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
instead of just duplicating this bus as

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.630 
instead of just duplicating this bus as
you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.979> instead<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.039> duplicating

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you can see here instead of duplicating

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.339 
you can see here instead of duplicating
it<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.879> having<00:02:09.090> another<00:02:09.330> bus<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.170> has

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it and having another bus that just has

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.649 
it and having another bus that just has
the<00:02:10.530> same<00:02:10.769> another<00:02:11.700> aux<00:02:11.909> track<00:02:12.209> with<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> same

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
the same another aux track with the same

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.809 
the same another aux track with the same
bus<00:02:12.959> feeding<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.530> he<00:02:13.980> created<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.400> brand-new

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
bus feeding it he created a brand-new

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.330 
bus feeding it he created a brand-new
aux<00:02:15.060> track<00:02:15.360> with<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> different<00:02:16.230> bus<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:17.099> that

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
aux track with a different bus and that

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.800 
aux track with a different bus and that
bus<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.700> Pia<00:02:17.970> drums

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
bus is Pia drums

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.750 
bus is Pia drums
we<00:02:18.900> zoom<00:02:19.110> back<00:02:19.140> out<00:02:19.440> you'll<00:02:19.680> see<00:02:19.739> there<00:02:20.640> were

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
we zoom back out you'll see there were

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.120 
we zoom back out you'll see there were
only<00:02:20.940> feeding<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.720> bus<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.620> kick<00:02:22.860> mics

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
only feeding this bus the to kick mics

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.040 
only feeding this bus the to kick mics
and<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.580> snare<00:02:23.880> mic<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.420> we're<00:02:24.930> actually

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
and the snare mic and we're actually

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.510 
and the snare mic and we're actually
feeding<00:02:25.440> them<00:02:25.560> pre-fader<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.280> they<00:02:26.370> don't

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
feeding them pre-fader so they don't

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.490 
feeding them pre-fader so they don't
follow<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.880> faders<00:02:27.270> down<00:02:27.450> here<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.930> we

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
follow the faders down here and we

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.930 
follow the faders down here and we
started<00:02:28.890> doing<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.280> was<00:02:29.400> thinking<00:02:29.700> okay

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
started doing that I was thinking okay

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.550 
started doing that I was thinking okay
this<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.480> is<00:02:30.810> interesting<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.290> doesn't<00:02:31.410> make

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
this this is interesting it doesn't make

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.229 
this this is interesting it doesn't make
sense<00:02:31.590> not<00:02:31.980> sure<00:02:32.099> why<00:02:32.220> we're<00:02:32.400> doing<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.730> but

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
sense not sure why we're doing it but

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.300 
sense not sure why we're doing it but
the<00:02:33.360> idea<00:02:33.690> there<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.020> now<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.069> kick

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the idea there is now you just have kick

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.420 
the idea there is now you just have kick
and<00:02:35.459> snare<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.940> their<00:02:36.480> own<00:02:36.660> track<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:38.400> can

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
and snare on their own track and you can

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.040 
and snare on their own track and you can
heavily<00:02:38.940> compress<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.660> get<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> lot<00:02:39.930> of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
heavily compress that and get a lot of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.479 
heavily compress that and get a lot of
that<00:02:40.140> real<00:02:40.650> raw<00:02:41.720> kind<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.780> organic<00:02:43.489> thick

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
that real raw kind of organic thick

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.059 
that real raw kind of organic thick
sound<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.209> compression<00:02:46.110> without<00:02:46.800> messing

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
sound of compression without messing

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.620 
sound of compression without messing
with<00:02:47.220> your<00:02:47.430> overheads<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.060> lot<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.360> times<00:02:48.510> if

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
with your overheads a lot of times if

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.880 
with your overheads a lot of times if
you<00:02:48.690> do<00:02:48.840> parallel<00:02:49.110> compression<00:02:49.500> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you do parallel compression the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.289 
you do parallel compression the
overheads<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.610> cymbals<00:02:50.970> are<00:02:51.090> getting

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
overheads and the cymbals are getting

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.240 
overheads and the cymbals are getting
sent<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.720> second<00:02:52.049> compressor<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.010> even

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
sent to that second compressor so even

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.530 
sent to that second compressor so even
though<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.430> might<00:02:53.549> sound<00:02:53.790> cool<00:02:54.120> there's<00:02:54.390> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
though it might sound cool there's that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.750 
though it might sound cool there's that
really<00:02:54.780> pumpy<00:02:55.530> breezy<00:02:55.980> stuff<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.400> happens

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
really pumpy breezy stuff that happens

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.670 
really pumpy breezy stuff that happens
with<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:56.970> cymbals<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:57.930> way<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.350> cymbals

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
with the cymbals so this way the cymbals

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.620 
with the cymbals so this way the cymbals
remain<00:02:58.950> fairly<00:02:59.190> completely<00:02:59.790> uncompressed<00:03:00.390> on

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
remain fairly completely uncompressed on

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.780 
remain fairly completely uncompressed on
the<00:03:00.840> regular<00:03:01.350> drum<00:03:01.620> buss<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.040> then<00:03:02.580> we<00:03:02.640> can

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
the regular drum buss and then we can

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.000 
the regular drum buss and then we can
blend<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.630> heavily<00:03:04.080> compressed<00:03:04.410> kick<00:03:04.769> and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
blend in the heavily compressed kick and

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.009 
blend in the heavily compressed kick and
snare<00:03:05.280> bus<00:03:05.580> with<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:06.690> here's<00:03:06.870> what<00:03:06.989> that

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
snare bus with that so here's what that

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.680 
snare bus with that so here's what that
kick<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.319> snare<00:03:07.590> bus<00:03:07.830> sounds<00:03:08.130> like<00:03:08.280> by<00:03:08.430> itself

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.360 

as<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.750> can<00:03:15.900> see<00:03:16.110> here<00:03:16.319> we<00:03:16.410> just<00:03:16.560> got<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.830> bf76

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
as you can see here we just got the bf76

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.729 
as you can see here we just got the bf76
plugin<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.030> smashing<00:03:18.780> away<00:03:19.019> at<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.410> again

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
plugin just smashing away at it again

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.289 
plugin just smashing away at it again
it's<00:03:19.890> not<00:03:19.980> supposed<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.370> sound<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.819> great<00:03:21.120> by

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
it's not supposed to sound that great by

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.530 
it's not supposed to sound that great by
itself<00:03:22.609> but<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.730> essentially<00:03:24.000> get<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.390> get

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
itself but you essentially get you get

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.030 
itself but you essentially get you get
more<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:24.870> snap<00:03:25.140> of<00:03:25.350> the<00:03:25.410> kick<00:03:25.590> drum<00:03:25.829> and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
more of the snap of the kick drum and

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.000 
more of the snap of the kick drum and
you<00:03:26.100> get<00:03:26.430> the<00:03:26.549> body<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> snare<00:03:29.930> okay<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.950> if

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
you get the body of the snare okay so if

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.680 
you get the body of the snare okay so if
we<00:03:32.160> go<00:03:32.670> back<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:32.940> listen<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.329> original

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
we go back and listen to the original

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.180 
we go back and listen to the original
track<00:03:33.900> it's<00:03:34.140> pretty<00:03:34.350> dry<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.799> sounds<00:03:35.040> good

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
track it's pretty dry and it sounds good

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.199 
track it's pretty dry and it sounds good
but<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.459> doesn't<00:03:35.579> have<00:03:35.790> as<00:03:35.910> much<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.180> that

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
but it doesn't have as much of that

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.150 
but it doesn't have as much of that
attack<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.780> body<00:03:37.049> as<00:03:37.350> this<00:03:37.650> compressed

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
attack in that body as this compressed

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.360 
attack in that body as this compressed
track<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:43.260> now<00:03:43.380> if<00:03:43.470> we<00:03:43.530> play<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:44.040> I'm<00:03:44.220> gonna

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
track so now if we play that I'm gonna

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.370 
track so now if we play that I'm gonna
blend<00:03:44.700> in<00:03:44.940> this<00:03:45.150> second<00:03:45.600> compressed<00:03:46.019> track

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
blend in this second compressed track

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.890 
blend in this second compressed track
and<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:47.069> can<00:03:47.220> hear<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:48.420> difference<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.810> it

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
and you can hear the difference that it

00:03:48.900 --> 00:04:01.380 
and you can hear the difference that it
makes

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.699 

notice<00:04:02.390> how<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.569> brought<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.140> body<00:04:03.470> and

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
notice how it brought in this body and

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.290 
notice how it brought in this body and
this<00:04:03.770> warmth<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.340> kind<00:04:04.550> of<00:04:04.610> this<00:04:04.730> resonance

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
this warmth and kind of this resonance

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.840 
this warmth and kind of this resonance
sound<00:04:05.770> that<00:04:06.770> just<00:04:06.950> made<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.250> drums<00:04:07.490> seem

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
sound that just made the drums seem

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.820 
sound that just made the drums seem
bigger<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.450> fuller<00:04:08.660> but<00:04:09.350> you'll<00:04:09.500> notice<00:04:09.740> the

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
bigger and fuller but you'll notice the

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.140 
bigger and fuller but you'll notice the
hi-hat<00:04:10.220> which<00:04:10.400> we're<00:04:10.550> just<00:04:10.700> picking<00:04:10.940> up<00:04:11.030> in

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
hi-hat which we're just picking up in

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.940 
hi-hat which we're just picking up in
the<00:04:11.209> overhead<00:04:11.570> mics<00:04:11.780> still<00:04:12.200> remains<00:04:12.500> nice<00:04:12.740> and

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
the overhead mics still remains nice and

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.320 
the overhead mics still remains nice and
clean<00:04:13.160> you<00:04:13.190> can<00:04:13.430> still<00:04:13.640> hear<00:04:13.760> everything<00:04:14.150> it's

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
clean you can still hear everything it's

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.790 
clean you can still hear everything it's
not<00:04:14.420> getting<00:04:14.810> affected<00:04:15.320> by<00:04:15.410> that<00:04:15.590> heavy

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
not getting affected by that heavy

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.560 
not getting affected by that heavy
compression<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:17.000> just<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.180> cool<00:04:17.390> way<00:04:17.419> to

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
compression and it's just a cool way to

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.840 
compression and it's just a cool way to
blend<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.169> solo<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.130> sounds<00:04:19.430> good<00:04:19.579> but<00:04:19.760> in

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
blend it and solo it sounds good but in

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.670 
blend it and solo it sounds good but in
the<00:04:19.910> mix<00:04:20.120> as<00:04:20.269> well<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.900> works<00:04:21.200> really<00:04:21.410> nicely

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
the mix as well it works really nicely

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.440 
the mix as well it works really nicely
to<00:04:21.890> help<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.280> jumps<00:04:22.550> cut<00:04:22.760> through<00:04:23.060> and<00:04:23.240> sound

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
to help the jumps cut through and sound

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:34.150 
to help the jumps cut through and sound
nice<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:23.810> big<00:04:32.560> listen<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.740> without<00:04:33.830> this

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
nice and big listen to it without this

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.620 
nice and big listen to it without this
secondary<00:04:34.669> parallel<00:04:35.270> bus<00:04:37.450> sounds<00:04:38.450> pretty

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
secondary parallel bus sounds pretty

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.260 
secondary parallel bus sounds pretty
good<00:04:38.780> now<00:04:38.960> we<00:04:39.020> add<00:04:39.200> the<00:04:39.380> other<00:04:39.500> one<00:04:39.650> back<00:04:39.800> in

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.400 

just<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.390> little<00:04:44.540> more<00:04:44.690> aggressive<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.230> if

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
just a little more aggressive and if

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.540 
just a little more aggressive and if
nothing<00:04:45.560> else<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.950> gives<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.190> some<00:04:46.370> extra

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
nothing else it gives you some extra

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.730 
nothing else it gives you some extra
tone<00:04:46.910> to<00:04:47.300> mess<00:04:47.570> with<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:47.960> your<00:04:48.080> mix<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:48.470> see<00:04:48.650> if

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
tone to mess with in your mix and see if

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.800 
tone to mess with in your mix and see if
that<00:04:48.890> fits<00:04:49.130> and<00:04:49.370> yes<00:04:49.940> that<00:04:50.150> is<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.300> hollow<00:04:50.570> notes

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
that fits and yes that is a hollow notes

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.920 
that fits and yes that is a hollow notes
cover<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.830> we<00:04:52.010> recorded<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:52.760> that's<00:04:53.720> all<00:04:53.840> you

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
cover that we recorded so that's all you

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.780 
cover that we recorded so that's all you
get<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.140> hear<00:04:54.290> for<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.500> day<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:55.190> that's<00:04:55.520> my<00:04:55.730> tip

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
get to hear for the day so that's my tip

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.130 
get to hear for the day so that's my tip
for<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.120> day<00:04:56.150> mess<00:04:56.600> around<00:04:56.750> with<00:04:56.990> different

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
for the day mess around with different

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.840 
for the day mess around with different
ways<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.590> doing<00:04:57.890> parallel<00:04:58.220> compression<00:04:58.580> and

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
ways of doing parallel compression and

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.360 
ways of doing parallel compression and
and<00:04:59.720> don't<00:05:00.050> be<00:05:00.169> afraid<00:05:00.440> to<00:05:00.800> try<00:05:01.070> new<00:05:01.340> things

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
and don't be afraid to try new things

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.550 
and don't be afraid to try new things
and<00:05:01.790> to<00:05:01.910> learn<00:05:02.120> new<00:05:02.300> things<00:05:02.330> if<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.169> get<00:05:03.320> stuck

and to learn new things if you get stuck

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.380 
and to learn new things if you get stuck
in<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:03.770> rut<00:05:04.010> of<00:05:04.280> I<00:05:04.490> know<00:05:04.850> everything<00:05:05.300> there

in that rut of I know everything there

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.850 
in that rut of I know everything there
is<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.510> know<00:05:05.630> I<00:05:05.930> don't<00:05:06.470> have<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.770> learn

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
is to know I don't have to learn

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.469 
is to know I don't have to learn
anything<00:05:07.100> new<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.700> get<00:05:07.820> better<00:05:07.940> recordings

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
anything new to get better recordings

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.090 
anything new to get better recordings
there's<00:05:08.990> always<00:05:09.320> something<00:05:09.800> new<00:05:09.830> out<00:05:10.070> there

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
there's always something new out there

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.530 
there's always something new out there
that<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.400> can<00:05:10.550> try<00:05:10.790> that<00:05:11.030> you<00:05:11.120> can<00:05:11.240> put<00:05:11.419> into

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
that you can try that you can put into

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.000 
that you can try that you can put into
your<00:05:11.690> arsenal<00:05:12.169> to<00:05:12.200> get<00:05:12.380> better<00:05:12.590> sounding

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010 
your arsenal to get better sounding

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.800 
your arsenal to get better sounding
mixes<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.850> think<00:05:14.060> Graham<00:05:14.270> cochrane<00:05:14.690> for

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
mixes and I think Graham cochrane for

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:15.940 
mixes and I think Graham cochrane for
example<00:05:15.140> is<00:05:15.229> one<00:05:15.380> of<00:05:15.440> those<00:05:15.530> guys<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.740> you

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
example is one of those guys that you

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.010 
example is one of those guys that you
should<00:05:16.040> watch<00:05:16.340> and<00:05:16.640> i<00:05:17.330> learn<00:05:17.510> all<00:05:17.720> sorts<00:05:17.750> of

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
should watch and i learn all sorts of

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.360 
should watch and i learn all sorts of
stuff<00:05:18.229> from<00:05:18.320> him<00:05:18.470> all<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.770> time<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.280> doesn't

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
stuff from him all the time that doesn't

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.219 
stuff from him all the time that doesn't
make<00:05:19.610> me<00:05:19.850> less<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.180> an<00:05:20.270> engineer<00:05:20.690> if<00:05:20.870> anything

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
make me less of an engineer if anything
