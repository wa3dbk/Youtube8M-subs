00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 well it's everyone know I 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.959
 not to people find themselves for the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.359
 best class of dish as episode 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.350
 iv with the mk48 so it's a rifle 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.760
 gunner to change a little bit 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.870
 since my game offers all the time 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.490
 machine guns and pistols 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.630
 machine gunners or assault rifles so 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.590
 we will change a little bit because I 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.540
 know it's starting to break you a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.920
 few rights then know anyway 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 that part rather nice 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.359
 since there is still a small 45 of 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.560
 ratio is a small nuclear so I have 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.660
 want to say it's always fun 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.619
 and by the way if you want to me 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.000
 to please you know what he you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.890
 remains to make a little green thumb that's 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.619
 free and cheap so here do not hesitate 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 not be crazy then of course the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.340
 balance box link will be in the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.510
 description plain useless to rape me 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.350
 for that to become the class since 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.210
 every time everyone not violent 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.829
 enjoy it by the way it's the only one 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.540
 type of videos the best places where 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.860
 my descriptions are pretty much he 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.329
 is not that shit in no 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.590
 really enjoy it for once 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.590
 I put something pretty informative 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.789
 of water then this is the m2a 48 I will you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.770
 just say why also at 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.910
 passage as did the movie brother that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.960
 I can do the most simply 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.579
 because that's because he still has a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.379
 good rate of fire not a rate of 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.090
 soft bananas like thursday and a very 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.219
 good power and by far as close 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.989
 it is still very very advantageous 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.159
 knowing that with a little jeans I you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.180
 advise the reserve teaser because 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.979
 him certainly because simply to 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.659
 shit I mean interest to have put to 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.820
 a high level vision nothing in it I 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.409
 not all inclusive but still with a 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 laser finder you will see more hype 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.310
 and especially that the thing has no recoil 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 so it's a nicer year in 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.070
 more of that there's no worries you can 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.180
 make a coarse far as is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.710
 no more hindsight so it's still 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.259
 more friendly it is indeed the big one 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.180
 nag so feel this is so 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.740
 I did not discuss the masses of the video 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.170
 since you have eyes to see 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.150
 I would like to simply ask you 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.310
 if you not find what I perso 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.570
 me yes I think black ops the I 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.920
 do not know about you if you do not tire a 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.390
 little bit because I flat like the 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.189
 perso and starts to break the nuts 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.360
 I always have a lot more I do not know 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.710
 not how many hours of play you have 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.180
 usually on average we can say 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.530
 I would like four days of play and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.840
 frankly I did everything because 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.579
 than the first to have 800 double xp 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.509
 20 in a conference of the cottage elsewhere 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.500
 it's one of the only ones where I find it 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.340
 so much forget what I mean 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.570
 every week with almost a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.780
 double xp for no reason I do not know 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.369
 not the bear has all released dlc ps3 xbox etc 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.100
 he put a double xp double xp 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.110
 put it back it was nice but well done 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.610
 the day there a little fast 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.620
 torch what finally Thursday a master has 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.970
 not even gt masters I believe in five 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.170
 days of play and it's a bit of a pity 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.550
 it's a scorer and call of duty 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.410
 you agree we are still 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.570
 often at the end of the stuff a little before 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.220
 the end before that precisely there is a 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.360
 other coming out and suddenly ben there that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.010
 did three choices three 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.360
 months after the game's release that the game 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.590
 was a little torch and I really 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.690
 no geek and masses so that's 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.740
 really a little pity besides enough 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.760
 accurate I was really easy to pass 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.960
 I believe that after fifty levels of 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.540
 neck five animals it's not masses 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.980
 neither where these 25 since good timing 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.180
 donald 70 levels so here it's true 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.170
 we're a little shit I do not know 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.280
 what to do suddenly 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.140
 suddenly it's time, moreover 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.459
 bullet I 'm not going to give you on 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.830
 little games like battlefield and 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.090
 truck n sees some potato like 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.739
 that's nice that makes it pass the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.630
 time since my call of duty but no 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.040
 we get a little bit I always have the same 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.890
 part it's more it's very interesting 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.870
 even for rape is so called mootoo at 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.730
 passage I of course also wanted you 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.110
 talk more than that anyway it's a 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.840
 little basis to reduce the output of iron 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.400
 man 3 if some went to see who 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.360
 sting they tell me in my 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.489
 comments since I really want 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.620
 to know until Rome 23 and the air 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.300
 just to be a fucking kills I do not 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.760
 do not know because one of my friends 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.739
 said it was crap and another 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.570
 to our friend told me it was 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.860
 really a little killing so I do not 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.910
 do not know tell me then there or not this 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.140
 accelerated fall since simply 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.959
 at this passage was useless which I you 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.950
 say it anyway so ten months in the 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.900
 comments what you think about it but 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.260
 personal ironman kebs to something that have the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.790
 potato 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.320
 even though the theme had a little disappointed more 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.580
 that hey it was not very interesting he 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.290
 there was end here seen everyone 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.970
 knew I do not know anymore when the guy this 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.170
 what's his name is iron man y 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.250
 had more stories then 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.989
 by the mayor send the guy who is the 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.340
 fart for 40 minutes and we finish 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.410
 August it's a deadline on wye ron 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.940
 mann on 1h40 of the film of the coup I find 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.470
 not that very interesting but the time 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.549
 was still abused I found 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.049
 really too stylish 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.459
 it's not beautiful and the 3 to the air when 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.500
 even you are pretty good so I do not 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.790
 know not said a word all that iron when 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.709
 even this is the place is the potato 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.170
 even though of course it's not my hero's 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.430
 superhero I mean my superhero 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.690
 favorite besides said me too 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.209
 that she's worth superhero prefers 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.170
 since me frankly the superhero 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.880
 that I find that there is too much of the 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.530
 battle so precisely a batman since 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.459
 batman who has the most style because 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.760
 he's a superhero who does not have 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.470
 power 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.970
 so I mean it's a guy 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.709
 pretty muscular anyway a guy to me 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.940
 even more of the potato since a 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.829
 super hero who has no power it's 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.930
 when a guy rather comfortable and more 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.430
 like batman it's still 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.599
 pretty stilic falls of the night that puts a 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.010
 cloak that is something to him 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.269
 smiles in plastic and leaves to pass 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.350
 mouth to everybody so I have to 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.840
 admit it is still pretty stylish 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.039
 with his batmobile to someone a 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.389
 Arab car that is a reactor 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.030
 nuclear at odos and still still 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.310
 more proud so frankly for me 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.509
 batman century is a I like the 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.490
 less I think it's not very 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.020
 interesting sector is in itself it's 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.310
 too stylish the garden board but who gets 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.560
 turn into play in green that's cool 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.759
 but I do not know about you but the fact 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.259
 it's actually girls and two sons 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.729
 there are not many action scenes in 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.289
 did you see that it beats all 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.400
 world of the coup I do not know what you in 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.190
 think but I find it a little bit 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.750
 sambre little month everything so that's true 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.889
 that I'm not my kiff of my little 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.910
 me everything that was meant in the 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.979
 comments even carrier of the mother 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.050
 Judy every time do not hesitate so 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.370
 Here the passage is exceeded more than 35 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.990
 a thousand subscribers it's cool it's a pleasure 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.130
 soon I do not know at all 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.419
 thirty six thousand soon maybe the 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.099
 40 michelin do not know this appointment 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.419
 from the street it is very pleasant 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.770
 listen I do not know what to tell you 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.630
 good so I know that 's fucking when 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.860
 even some versions that only look 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.120
 the more I totally understand since I 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.590
 know that well I'm always doing the 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.090
 same video I know I thank when 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.590
 even enormously what will follow me again 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.940
 I will never thank you enough 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.460
 know that if he still makes videos 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.380
 it's mainly for you 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.490
 so here you should know in passing that in 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.840
 this part I still had rather 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.099
 a lot of pussy because I have not 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.690
 you hide it since I still 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.280
 taken quite a few times I was a 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.320
 red so still a little luck 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.659
 I will not hide it from you so here we go
