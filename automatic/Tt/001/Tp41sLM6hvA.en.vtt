but<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.530> can<00:00:43.680> see<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> goes<00:00:44.340> down<00:00:44.579> around

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
but you can see that it goes down around

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.529 
but you can see that it goes down around
your<00:00:45.570> crank<00:00:45.930> pulley<00:00:46.170> way<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:47.539> around

here is your tensioner it has a three
hole<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.400> where<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.790> put

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
hole in it right here where you can put

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.340

belt loosens up so you can take the belt

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.840 
belt loosens up so you can take the belt
off<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> alternator<00:01:28.340> slowly<00:01:29.340> let<00:01:29.820> your

off the alternator slowly let your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.310 
off the alternator slowly let your
handle<00:01:30.450> back

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:45.310 

and<00:01:37.320> pull<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.860> out

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
to take a loop like this I'm going to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.610 
to take a loop like this I'm going to
put<00:02:08.600> it<00:02:08.690> down<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.610> around<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:12.080> air

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
put it down and around the air

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.790 
put it down and around the air
