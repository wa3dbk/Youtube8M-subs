in<00:00:03.799> this<00:00:04.370> pipeline<00:00:04.670> tutorial<00:00:05.450> we<00:00:05.959> will<00:00:06.080> do

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
in this pipeline tutorial we will do

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.980 
in this pipeline tutorial we will do
some<00:00:06.499> 3d<00:00:06.830> painting<00:00:07.339> in<00:00:07.519> Photoshop<00:00:08.120> after

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
some 3d painting in Photoshop after

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.630 
some 3d painting in Photoshop after
bringing<00:00:09.320> the<00:00:09.650> character<00:00:10.130> in<00:00:10.280> from<00:00:10.610> iclone

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
bringing the character in from iclone

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.430 
bringing the character in from iclone
first<00:00:13.640> you<00:00:13.850> need<00:00:14.030> to<00:00:14.120> export<00:00:14.570> a<00:00:14.720> body<00:00:14.960> part<00:00:15.230> for

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 
first you need to export a body part for

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.159 
first you need to export a body part for
my<00:00:15.560> cloning<00:00:15.860> in<00:00:16.189> this<00:00:16.730> case<00:00:17.029> we<00:00:17.539> want<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:17.869> work

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:18.169 
my cloning in this case we want to work

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.079 
my cloning in this case we want to work
with<00:00:18.320> Dylan<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:18.919> give<00:00:19.460> them<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:19.699> facial

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.089 
with Dylan and give them a facial

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.019 
with Dylan and give them a facial
makeover<00:00:20.480> so<00:00:21.470> we<00:00:21.619> remove<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.160> hair<00:00:22.429> to<00:00:22.849> better

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
makeover so we remove the hair to better

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:35.119 
makeover so we remove the hair to better
see<00:00:23.329> our<00:00:23.449> results<00:00:23.929> later<00:00:24.140> on

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:35.129 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.759 

then<00:00:36.129> we<00:00:36.789> save<00:00:37.030> Dillon<00:00:37.510> as<00:00:37.690> a<00:00:37.750> new<00:00:38.140> customized

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
then we save Dillon as a new customized

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.490 
then we save Dillon as a new customized
character<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.550> drag<00:00:40.210> him<00:00:40.420> into<00:00:40.629> 3d<00:00:41.050> exchange

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
character and drag him into 3d exchange

00:00:41.500 --> 00:01:02.620 
character and drag him into 3d exchange
war

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.980 

there<00:01:03.470> we<00:01:03.980> will<00:01:04.130> select<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.640> face<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.210> export

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
there we will select the face and export

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.160 
there we will select the face and export
the<00:01:06.170> mesh<00:01:06.440> as<00:01:06.710> an<00:01:07.040> obj<00:01:07.610> file<00:01:07.940> as<00:01:08.210> well<00:01:08.900> as<00:01:09.050> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
the mesh as an obj file as well as the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:27.660 
the mesh as an obj file as well as the
texture<00:01:09.500> Maps

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.970 

once<00:01:28.670> inside<00:01:29.120> Photoshop<00:01:29.810> we<00:01:30.470> will<00:01:30.590> create<00:01:30.860> a

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
once inside Photoshop we will create a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.910 
once inside Photoshop we will create a
new<00:01:31.430> file<00:01:31.760> and<00:01:32.060> create<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.480> 3d<00:01:33.050> layer<00:01:33.290> by

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
new file and create a 3d layer by

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.120 
new file and create a 3d layer by
selecting<00:01:33.980> the<00:01:34.670> 3d<00:01:34.700> tab<00:01:35.330> new<00:01:36.260> layer<00:01:36.470> from<00:01:36.740> 3d

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
selecting the 3d tab new layer from 3d

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.770 
selecting the 3d tab new layer from 3d
file<00:01:37.370> and<00:01:37.700> choosing<00:01:38.390> Dylan<00:01:38.900> saved<00:01:39.320> obj<00:01:40.040> face

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
file and choosing Dylan saved obj face

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.240 
file and choosing Dylan saved obj face
one<00:01:41.780> thing<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.140> mention<00:01:42.320> is<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.740> not<00:01:43.040> many

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
one thing to mention is that not many

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.730 
one thing to mention is that not many
people<00:01:43.460> know<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.479> can<00:01:44.660> now<00:01:44.810> do<00:01:44.870> 3d<00:01:45.470> paint

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
people know that you can now do 3d paint

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.040 
people know that you can now do 3d paint
in<00:01:45.950> Photoshop<00:01:48.880> here<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.090> will<00:01:50.600> just<00:01:50.870> examine

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
in Photoshop here I will just examine

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.160 
in Photoshop here I will just examine
the<00:01:51.500> face<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.280> navigation<00:01:52.970> tools<00:01:53.240> make<00:01:53.990> sure

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
the face the navigation tools make sure

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.740

everything<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:54.950> order

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.140 

you<00:02:03.260> may<00:02:03.380> also<00:02:03.620> open<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.250> map<00:02:04.430> image<00:02:04.820> in<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
you may also open the map image in the

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.750 
you may also open the map image in the
new<00:02:05.330> document<00:02:05.540> window<00:02:06.050> in<00:02:06.770> order<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.220> work<00:02:07.550> on

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
both the 3d model and the map image at

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:33.870 
both the 3d model and the map image at
the<00:02:10.429> same<00:02:10.640> time

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880

either the 3d image or the 2d window if
you<00:03:34.670> asked<00:03:35.030> me<00:03:35.210> it's<00:03:35.900> actually<00:03:36.020> easier<00:03:36.770> to

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
next I start to manually add my design

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.670 
next I start to manually add my design
the<00:04:20.760> demon<00:04:21.209> kind<00:04:21.389> of<00:04:21.510> looks<00:04:21.660> familiar<00:04:21.840> huh<00:04:22.260> if

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
the demon kind of looks familiar huh if

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.490 
the demon kind of looks familiar huh if
it<00:04:23.580> does<00:04:23.790> then<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.450> were<00:04:24.660> probably<00:04:24.990> born

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
it does then you were probably born

00:04:25.500 --> 00:05:40.959 
it does then you were probably born
before<00:04:25.970> 1973

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:40.969 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.969 

to<00:05:41.969> make<00:05:42.150> things<00:05:42.360> symmetrical<00:05:43.050> I'm<00:05:43.259> going<00:05:43.830> to

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
to make things symmetrical I'm going to

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.279 
to make things symmetrical I'm going to
take<00:05:44.219> that<00:05:44.400> same<00:05:44.759> effect<00:05:45.180> and<00:05:45.389> flip<00:05:45.780> it<00:05:45.930> 90

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
take that same effect and flip it 90

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.589 
take that same effect and flip it 90
degrees<00:05:46.650> counterclockwise<00:05:47.150> for<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.360> left

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599
