00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
but that's what it should it should make

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.340 
but that's what it should it should make
a<00:00:31.790> some<00:00:32.790> type<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.000> equipment<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.660> makes<00:00:34.200> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
a some type of equipment that makes it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.229 
a some type of equipment that makes it
so<00:00:34.530> than<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.829> do<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.460> take<00:00:35.670> less<00:00:35.820> damage<00:00:35.850> from

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239

Holland's how much reduced a 15-percent

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.810 
Holland's how much reduced a 15-percent
i<00:00:42.210> believe<00:00:42.750> yeah<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> cheese<00:00:44.280> shells<00:00:44.520> Oh

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
i believe yeah i know a cheese shells Oh

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090 
i believe yeah i know a cheese shells Oh
a<00:00:45.000> high<00:00:45.239> percent<00:00:45.660> does<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.680> count<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
a high percent does that count for the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.180 
a high percent does that count for the
heat<00:00:47.219> ones<00:00:47.460> as<00:00:47.670> well<00:00:47.700> no

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.230 

they<00:00:54.190> do<00:00:54.250> say<00:00:54.700> oh<00:00:55.410> they're<00:00:56.410> gonna<00:00:57.240> rebalance

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
they do say oh they're gonna rebalance

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.510 
they do say oh they're gonna rebalance
heat<00:00:58.480> soon<00:00:58.890> probably<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.100> next<00:01:00.250> patch

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
heat soon probably the next patch

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.370 
heat soon probably the next patch
they're<00:01:01.060> making<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.600> way<00:01:01.720> right<00:01:02.020> on<00:01:02.050> board

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
they're making it the way right on board

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.580 
they're making it the way right on board
space<00:01:03.040> armor<00:01:03.840> negates<00:01:04.840> it<00:01:04.990> almost<00:01:05.290> completely

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
space armor negates it almost completely

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.410 
space armor negates it almost completely
so<00:01:08.590> that's<00:01:08.710> gonna<00:01:08.890> suck<00:01:09.130> for<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.580> tier<00:01:10.000> 10<00:01:10.240> to

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
so that's gonna suck for the tier 10 to

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:29.290 
so that's gonna suck for the tier 10 to
have<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.980> right<00:01:11.980> now<00:01:12.250> one<00:01:12.520> way<00:01:12.760> right<00:01:13.090> through

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:40.230

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.580 
there's nothing really got around it I
think<00:03:45.860> that's<00:03:45.950> what<00:03:46.099> I<00:03:46.190> hid<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:47.260> was<00:03:48.260> looking<00:03:48.500> at

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
think that's what I hid I was looking at

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.710 
think that's what I hid I was looking at
it<00:03:48.620> earlier<00:03:49.069> I<00:03:49.130> was<00:03:49.370> curious<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.150> see<00:03:50.450> if<00:03:50.569> he

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
it earlier I was curious to see if he

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.449 
it earlier I was curious to see if he
can<00:03:50.840> shoot<00:03:51.319> around<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.739> gun<00:03:51.890> and<00:03:52.040> actually<00:03:52.370> do

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
can shoot around a gun and actually do

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.530 
can shoot around a gun and actually do
damage<00:03:52.940> since<00:03:53.150> there's<00:03:53.390> nothing<00:03:53.540> there

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
damage since there's nothing there

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.059 
damage since there's nothing there
that's<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.690> weak<00:03:56.870> spot<00:03:57.170> of<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.530> since<00:03:57.860> the

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
that's the weak spot of it since the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.130 
that's the weak spot of it since the
whole<00:03:58.430> armor<00:03:58.610> is<00:03:58.910> all<00:03:59.060> 60<00:03:59.480> millimeter

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:12.460 

yeah<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.530> game<00:04:04.890> is<00:04:05.010> bad<00:04:07.520> yeah<00:04:08.520> they're<00:04:08.730> right

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.390
