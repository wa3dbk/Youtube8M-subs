00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it was really cool how he didn't like

it was really cool how he didn't like
these<00:02:08.369> amazing<00:02:08.910> math<00:02:09.060> problems<00:02:09.600> really

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
these amazing math problems really

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.530 
these amazing math problems really
quickly<00:02:10.350> but<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.340> this<00:02:11.640> part<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.270> what<00:02:12.390> my

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
quickly but well this part and what my

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.960 
quickly but well this part and what my
favorite<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.410> he<00:02:13.920> actually<00:02:14.250> showed<00:02:14.819> us

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
favorite was that he actually showed us

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.180 
favorite was that he actually showed us
how<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.180> do<00:02:15.480> them<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:16.230> other<00:02:16.680> magicians

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
how to do them like other magicians

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.240 
how to do them like other magicians
though<00:02:17.870> I'm<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.260> really<00:02:19.590> looking<00:02:19.650> forward

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
though I'm really really looking forward

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130 
though I'm really really looking forward
to<00:02:20.280> learning<00:02:20.520> algebra<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.360> how<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.930> works

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
to learning algebra and how it works

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.800 
to learning algebra and how it works
because<00:02:22.520> he<00:02:23.520> taught<00:02:23.730> us<00:02:23.760> how<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.569> I<00:02:24.600> really

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
because he taught us how to and I really

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.449 
because he taught us how to and I really
want<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.020> be<00:02:25.110> like<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.860> what<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.100> think

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
want to be like that and what I think

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.970 
want to be like that and what I think
about<00:02:27.239> ethan's<00:02:27.600> performance<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.319> separates

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
about ethan's performance that separates

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.699 
about ethan's performance that separates
him<00:02:29.190> from<00:02:29.220> some<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.880> other<00:02:29.910> acts<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.780> pto

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
him from some of the other acts and pto

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.320 
him from some of the other acts and pto
presentations<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.640> we've<00:02:32.819> had<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.000> is

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
presentations that we've had here is

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.690 
presentations that we've had here is
that<00:02:33.420> he<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.690> really<00:02:33.989> relate<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.769> connect<00:02:35.550> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that he can really relate and connect to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.759 
that he can really relate and connect to
the<00:02:35.819> kids<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.780> hear<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.110> buzz<00:02:37.350> and

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
afterwards and how excited they were

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.090 
afterwards and how excited they were
about<00:02:41.040> math<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:42.120> really<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.660> true<00:02:42.959> testimony<00:02:43.800> as

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
about math is really a true testimony as

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.790 
about math is really a true testimony as
to<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:45.000> effect<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.420> he<00:02:45.569> has<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.959> them<00:02:46.200> I

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
to the effect that he has on them I

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.539 
to the effect that he has on them I
loved<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.790> way<00:02:48.060> Ethan<00:02:48.840> stressed<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:50.130> mental

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
loved the way Ethan stressed the mental

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.490
