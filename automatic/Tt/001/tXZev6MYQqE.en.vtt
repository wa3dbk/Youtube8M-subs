to<00:02:14.880> build<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:15.150> road<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.780> add<00:02:15.870> landscaping

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.370 

let's<00:02:36.490> move<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.910> oasc<00:02:37.180> ale<00:02:37.480> I'm<00:02:37.990> going<00:02:38.290> to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
let's move on to oasc ale I'm going to

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.990 
let's move on to oasc ale I'm going to
show<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.770> process<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.250> attaching<00:02:39.790> to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
show you the process for attaching to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.660 
show you the process for attaching to
rail<00:02:40.150> crossing<00:02:40.720> o<00:02:40.960> scale<00:02:41.830> grade<00:02:42.100> crossings

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
rail crossing o scale grade crossings

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.130 
rail crossing o scale grade crossings
are<00:02:42.790> different<00:02:43.090> process<00:02:43.540> than<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.750> smaller

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
are different process than the smaller

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.020 
are different process than the smaller
scales<00:02:44.530> because<00:02:44.980> they<00:02:45.130> come<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.430> pieces<00:02:45.880> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
scales because they come in pieces that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.780 
scales because they come in pieces that
must<00:02:46.210> be<00:02:46.300> assembled<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.890> first<00:02:51.070> step<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.640> to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
must be assembled the first step is to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.700 
must be assembled the first step is to
assemble<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.240> center<00:02:52.420> crossing<00:02:53.020> the

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
the spacer depends on your track and

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.110 
the spacer depends on your track and
train<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.920> be<00:03:03.100> sure<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.460> test<00:03:03.670> fit<00:03:03.880> everything

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
train so be sure to test fit everything

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.000 
train so be sure to test fit everything
first<00:03:06.210> I'll<00:03:07.230> need<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.410> glue<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.860> center

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
first I'll need to glue the center

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.330 
first I'll need to glue the center
pieces<00:03:09.430> together<00:03:09.610> then<00:03:10.270> allow<00:03:10.570> them<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.870> dry

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.680 

here<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.550> ballast<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.030> higher<00:03:16.300> than<00:03:16.540> the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
here the ballast is higher than the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.090 
here the ballast is higher than the
track<00:03:16.930> ties<00:03:17.170> preventing<00:03:17.740> the<00:03:17.860> center

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
track ties preventing the center

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.080 
track ties preventing the center
crossing<00:03:18.490> from<00:03:18.640> sitting<00:03:18.940> level<00:03:20.370> I'll<00:03:21.370> just

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
crossing from sitting level I'll just

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.990 
crossing from sitting level I'll just
say<00:03:22.300> on<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.510> area<00:03:22.780> flat

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.540 

now<00:03:26.570> it's<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:26.960> flat<00:03:27.260> it<00:03:27.530> could<00:03:27.770> be<00:03:27.950> higher<00:03:28.190> so

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
now it's it's flat it could be higher so

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.370 
now it's it's flat it could be higher so
I'll<00:03:29.030> have<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.330> add<00:03:29.480> shims<00:03:29.900> Oh<00:03:32.080> scale<00:03:33.080> shims

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
I'll have to add shims Oh scale shims

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.470 
I'll have to add shims Oh scale shims
need<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:33.860> be<00:03:33.980> cut<00:03:34.250> I'll<00:03:34.520> measure<00:03:35.150> three

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
need to be cut I'll measure three

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.460 
need to be cut I'll measure three
quarters<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:35.870> an<00:03:36.080> inch<00:03:36.200> for<00:03:36.410> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
quarters of an inch for the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.280 
quarters of an inch for the
intersections<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.630> one<00:03:38.630> quarter<00:03:38.960> inch<00:03:39.110> for

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290

intersections and one quarter inch for
outer<00:03:39.470> section<00:03:41.830> I'll<00:03:42.830> score<00:03:43.310> along<00:03:43.520> my

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
outer section I'll score along my

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.830 
outer section I'll score along my
measurements<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:45.730> snap<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.940> shims<00:03:47.180> apart

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.630 

I'll<00:03:51.530> just<00:03:51.800> make<00:03:51.980> sure<00:03:52.160> it<00:03:52.310> sits<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.610> little

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
I'll just make sure it sits a little

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:10.089 
I'll just make sure it sits a little
below<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.360> rail<00:03:53.540> height<00:04:07.930> like<00:04:08.930> a<00:04:08.959> Cho<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.650> need

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
below the rail height like a Cho I need

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.380 
below the rail height like a Cho I need
to<00:04:10.220> make<00:04:10.370> sure<00:04:10.550> that<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.880> crossing<00:04:11.300> is

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
to make sure that the crossing is

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:19.560 
to make sure that the crossing is
centered<00:04:11.780> before<00:04:11.959> setting<00:04:12.500> it

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.810 

now<00:04:20.170> I'll<00:04:20.380> move<00:04:20.500> on<00:04:20.680> to<00:04:20.800> my<00:04:20.980> three<00:04:21.310> rail<00:04:21.490> track

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
now I'll move on to my three rail track

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.700 
now I'll move on to my three rail track
since<00:04:22.420> it's<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.630> same<00:04:22.810> track<00:04:23.140> code<00:04:23.380> as<00:04:23.500> my<00:04:23.650> two

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
since it's the same track code as my two

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.010 
since it's the same track code as my two
rail<00:04:24.130> I<00:04:24.370> already<00:04:25.000> know<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.210> I'll<00:04:25.510> need<00:04:25.660> shims

I'll<00:04:26.640> need<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.760> measure<00:04:27.940> my<00:04:28.150> shims<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:28.630> be<00:04:28.720> one

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
I'll need to measure my shims to be one

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.390 
I'll need to measure my shims to be one
quarter<00:04:29.260> of<00:04:29.380> an<00:04:29.470> inch<00:04:29.590> for<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.920> inner<00:04:30.100> and

quarter of an inch for the inner and
outer<00:04:30.790> sections<00:04:32.340> again<00:04:33.340> I'll<00:04:33.580> score<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.090> snap

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
outer sections again I'll score and snap

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:49.450 
outer sections again I'll score and snap
them

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.980 

I<00:04:49.490> have<00:04:50.120> to<00:04:50.240> make<00:04:50.390> sure<00:04:50.420> that<00:04:50.870> the
