miss open this up again comparing AV
cables<00:02:29.700> we'll<00:02:30.700> be<00:02:30.790> using<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.150> for<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
cables we'll be using this for the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.150 
cables we'll be using this for the
PlayStation<00:02:32.320> 2<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.650> they<00:02:32.709> said<00:02:34.440> look<00:02:35.440> pretty

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
PlayStation 2 and they said look pretty

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.720 
PlayStation 2 and they said look pretty
nice<00:02:36.340> no<00:02:36.820> no<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:37.420> face<00:02:37.660> I'm<00:02:40.829> going<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.890> put

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
nice no no my face I'm going to put

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.569 
nice no no my face I'm going to put
these<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:44.340> that's<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:46.680> component<00:02:47.680> versus<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
these on that's the component versus the

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.559 
these on that's the component versus the
cable<00:02:48.880> that<00:02:48.970> goes<00:02:49.000> into<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.450> ps2<00:02:49.950> gold-plated

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
cable that goes into the ps2 gold-plated

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.879 
cable that goes into the ps2 gold-plated
apparently<00:02:52.569> gives<00:02:52.870> better<00:02:53.200> connection<00:02:53.709> and

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:53.889 
apparently gives better connection and

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:56.309 
apparently gives better connection and
the<00:02:54.700> other<00:02:54.850> kind<00:02:55.540> of<00:02:55.630> connections<00:02:56.019> are<00:02:56.170> out

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
the other kind of connections are out

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.890 
the other kind of connections are out
there<00:02:56.880> let's<00:02:57.880> do<00:02:57.970> sure<00:02:58.120> someone's<00:02:58.510> telling<00:02:58.660> me

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
there let's do sure someone's telling me

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.150 
there let's do sure someone's telling me
about<00:02:59.370> oxygen-free<00:03:00.389> sure<00:03:01.389> what<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> means

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
about oxygen-free sure what that means

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.420 
about oxygen-free sure what that means
so<00:03:03.160> that's<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.430> leap<00:03:03.609> there<00:03:04.980> it's<00:03:05.980> open<00:03:06.130> these

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
so that's the leap there it's open these

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.650 
so that's the leap there it's open these
I<00:03:06.579> have<00:03:06.850> one<00:03:07.889> too<00:03:08.889> this<00:03:09.459> look<00:03:09.670> or<00:03:09.850> do<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.269> left

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
I have one too this look or do I left

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.640 
I have one too this look or do I left
them<00:03:10.840> right<00:03:13.290> collated

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:25.920 

this<00:03:17.650> is<00:03:17.859> gives<00:03:18.790> a<00:03:19.409> picture<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:25.510> what<00:03:25.749> gives

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
this is gives a picture this what gives

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.780 
this is gives a picture this what gives
the<00:03:26.049> picture<00:03:30.420> different<00:03:31.420> colors<00:03:31.749> here

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
the picture different colors here

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.539 
the picture different colors here
fingers<00:03:33.790> like<00:03:33.969> three<00:03:34.269> meters<00:03:34.719> long<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:36.129> cable

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
fingers like three meters long the cable

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.050 
fingers like three meters long the cable
so<00:03:36.939> plenty<00:03:37.389> of<00:03:37.420> them<00:03:38.099> so<00:03:39.099> yes<00:03:39.310> guys<00:03:39.549> thank<00:03:40.000> you

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
so plenty of them so yes guys thank you

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.240
