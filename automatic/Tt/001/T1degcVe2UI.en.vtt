00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:21.170 

this<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:13.040> this<00:00:14.179> as<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.560> SCH<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.580> am<00:00:20.180> this

this is the this as I SCH you I am this

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.540 
this is the this as I SCH you I am this
is<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.890> pubis<00:00:23.330> right<00:00:24.330> here<00:00:25.010> I'm<00:00:26.010> looking<00:00:26.250> at

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
is the pubis right here I'm looking at

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
is the pubis right here I'm looking at
the<00:00:27.590> pubic<00:00:28.590> area<00:00:31.640> from<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.850> dorsal<00:00:33.420> aspect<00:00:33.800> if

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the pubic area from the dorsal aspect if

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.190 
the pubic area from the dorsal aspect if
you<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> book<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:38.040> can<00:00:38.250> see

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
you look at it in the book you can see

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.459 
you look at it in the book you can see
the<00:00:40.200> posterior<00:00:41.149> superior<00:00:42.950> iliac<00:00:43.950> spine<00:00:45.469> right

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the posterior superior iliac spine right

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:56.650 
the posterior superior iliac spine right
here<00:00:53.539> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> posterior<00:00:55.190> superior

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
here this is the posterior superior

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:08.300 
here this is the posterior superior
iliac<00:00:57.660> spine<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:06.680> if<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
iliac spine and then you see if I was to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.760 
iliac spine and then you see if I was to
look<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:09.270> coxa<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> picture

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
look at the right coxa this is a picture

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.039 
look at the right coxa this is a picture
of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:11.130> qotsa<00:01:11.700> in<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> book<00:01:12.210> medial

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
of the right qotsa in the book medial

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
of the right qotsa in the book medial
surface

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:27.980 

the<00:01:18.210> medial<00:01:18.690> surface<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:19.680> coxa<00:01:26.990> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
the medial surface of the right coxa and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.250 
the medial surface of the right coxa and
since<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.440> have<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.830> in<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.100> dorsal<00:01:29.610> view

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
since I have this in the dorsal view

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.140 
since I have this in the dorsal view
that<00:01:31.260> is<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.560> back<00:01:31.770> posterior<00:01:32.490> view<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
that is the back posterior view this

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
that is the back posterior view this
would<00:01:33.330> be<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.660> right<00:01:33.900> side<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:35.040> looks

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
would be the right side and it looks

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:49.520 
would be the right side and it looks
just<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.940> book<00:01:36.500> right<00:01:37.500> here

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
posterior superior iliac spine this is

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.660 
posterior superior iliac spine this is
the<00:03:19.360> iliac<00:03:19.810> spine<00:03:21.690> you<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.720> see<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.670> AC

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
the iliac spine you can see the AC

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.380 
the iliac spine you can see the AC
tubulin<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.989> this<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.290> pubis<00:03:29.739> so<00:03:30.580> when<00:03:31.269> we

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
tubulin and this is the pubis so when we

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.809 
tubulin and this is the pubis so when we
look<00:03:31.569> at<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.769> know<00:03:32.950> this<00:03:33.160> part<00:03:33.519> goes<00:03:34.120> like

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
look at you know this part goes like

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:46.229 
look at you know this part goes like
that<00:03:38.310> looks<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.489> binocular<00:03:40.180> the<00:03:43.380> part<00:03:45.239> it

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
that looks like binocular the part it

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:55.500 
that looks like binocular the part it
looks<00:03:46.840> like<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.080> brain<00:03:51.870> on<00:03:52.870> either<00:03:53.110> side
