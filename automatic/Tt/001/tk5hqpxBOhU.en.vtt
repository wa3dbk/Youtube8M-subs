then we went ahead and did I gelid one

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.390 
then we went ahead and did I gelid one
forty<00:00:45.990> millimeter<00:00:46.380> for<00:00:46.800> my<00:00:46.920> intake<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.400> those

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
120mm fan for my plexiglass that was

however<00:01:31.140> today<00:01:32.010> I<00:01:32.040> noted<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.760> there<00:01:32.880> was<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
however today I noted that there was a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.310 
however today I noted that there was a
whole<00:01:33.450> lot<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.280> dust<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.700> was<00:01:36.090> being<00:01:36.330> taken

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
whole lot of dust that was being taken

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.490 
whole lot of dust that was being taken
in<00:01:37.650> through<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.670> unfiltered<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:40.050> went<00:01:40.350> been

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
in through the unfiltered and went been

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.630 
in through the unfiltered and went been
and<00:01:40.650> even<00:01:40.830> though<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> did<00:01:41.220> lower<00:01:41.430> my

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
and even though it did lower my

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.120 
and even though it did lower my
temperatures<00:01:42.120> on<00:01:42.330> my<00:01:42.590> video<00:01:43.590> card<00:01:43.830> by<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
temperatures on my video card by a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
temperatures on my video card by a
couple<00:01:44.400> of<00:01:44.490> Celsius<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.360> thrown<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.690> lot<00:01:45.990> of

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
couple of Celsius it was thrown a lot of

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.130 
couple of Celsius it was thrown a lot of
dust<00:01:46.350> into<00:01:47.070> my<00:01:47.310> case<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.630> went<00:01:48.870> ahead<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
dust into my case so I went ahead and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.560 
dust into my case so I went ahead and
took<00:01:49.260> that<00:01:49.320> one<00:01:49.620> 20<00:01:49.890> mil<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.729> added<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.330> for<00:01:51.540> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
took that one 20 mil and added it for a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.810 
took that one 20 mil and added it for a
push-pull<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.500> my<00:01:52.860> cooler<00:01:53.190> master<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.700> get

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
push-pull on my cooler master to get

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.590 
push-pull on my cooler master to get
better<00:01:53.970> cpu<00:01:54.210> temperatures<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.890> i<00:01:56.369> rather<00:01:56.909> my

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
better cpu temperatures and i rather my

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.149 
better cpu temperatures and i rather my

hotter<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.820> don't<00:02:00.600> necessarily<00:02:01.110> mind<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.650> be

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
hotter I don't necessarily mind just be

into the case was was crazy so there you
have<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
have it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.130 
have it
