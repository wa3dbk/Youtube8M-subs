00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.929
 geely mk cross 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.660
 hard to classify he 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.779
 like a mixed zone there is a little forest 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.330
 there is a lot of field he is like our country 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.720
 midway between europe and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.300
 Asia is just on the edge between 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.310
 car and crossovers from 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.250
 car he borrowed compact 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.059
 dimensions and economical engine 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.520
 the crossover is bringing him closer 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.809
 increased ground clearance and protection 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 body perimeter 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.390
 geely mk cross all in size 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.030
 quite a bit weighs it allows more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.730
 feel free to climb loose soil and snow 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.680
 machines without failing also 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 small mass allows filigree 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.300
 play the gas pedal and taxi on 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.730
 heavier cars in this 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420
 respect usually passes the barrier 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.989
 directly 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.710
 fleeing the inertia of their large mass 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.619
 geely mk cross 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.479
 equipped with a half liter petrol 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.450
 engine which despite being small 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.700
 volume and construction with 16 valves 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.990
 has a good advantage 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.640
 maximum moment reaches already at 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 three thousand four hundred 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.530
 rpm for comparison 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.869
 most similar in volume and 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.270
 motor designs peak 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.259
 moments at speeds of more than four s 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.409
 half thousand 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.780
 so geely mk cross can more 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.930
 pass difficult sections of the road with confidence 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.200
 preload without tearing wheels 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.140
 engine speed and the last is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.680
 ground clearance and with weight geely mk 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.810
 cross 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.420
 here at the height of the direct and portable 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.880
 sense the car has awesome 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.130
 geometric cross not yielding 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.130
 some more serious crossovers
