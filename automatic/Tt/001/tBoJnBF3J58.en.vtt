00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
think maybe with the help of something

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
think maybe with the help of something
other<00:00:57.270> than<00:00:57.449> God<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:58.649> maybe<00:00:59.100> maintain<00:00:59.690> with

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
feeling better but looking better just

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340 
feeling better but looking better just
make<00:01:44.729> me<00:01:44.759> look<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.329> looked<00:01:45.630> about<00:01:45.869> six
