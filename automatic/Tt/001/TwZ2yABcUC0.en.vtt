00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
hello I'm JW I another video about some

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.539 
hello I'm JW I another video about some
old<00:00:06.750> items<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.770> not<00:00:07.950> actually<00:00:08.100> electrical

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:08.549 
old items and is not actually electrical

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.280 
old items and is not actually electrical
themselves<00:00:09.120> but<00:00:09.270> certainly<00:00:09.600> are<00:00:09.750> electrical

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
themselves but certainly are electrical

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.560 
themselves but certainly are electrical
related<00:00:10.770> now<00:00:11.580> you've<00:00:11.730> obviously<00:00:11.850> probably

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
related now you've obviously probably

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.299 
related now you've obviously probably
seen<00:00:12.660> those<00:00:12.809> fuse<00:00:13.110> wires<00:00:13.350> which<00:00:13.740> typically

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
seen those fuse wires which typically

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.890 
seen those fuse wires which typically
was<00:00:14.459> supplied<00:00:14.699> on<00:00:14.820> those<00:00:14.969> small<00:00:15.240> cards<00:00:15.719> with

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
was supplied on those small cards with

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.800 
was supplied on those small cards with
three<00:00:16.199> values<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.830> each<00:00:17.160> card<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.570> isn't

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
three values on each card and this isn't

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.390 
three values on each card and this isn't
specific<00:00:19.140> about<00:00:19.230> those<00:00:19.440> but<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.099> how<00:00:20.220> much<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
specific about those but we how much you

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.749 
specific about those but we how much you
got<00:00:20.490> here<00:00:20.759> is<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:22.050> block<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.669> going

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
got here is this block and that's going

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.370 
got here is this block and that's going
to<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:23.970> it's<00:00:24.119> essentially<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.599> printing

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
to see it's essentially the printing

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.239 
to see it's essentially the printing
block<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:26.550> some<00:00:26.910> fuse<00:00:27.390> wire<00:00:27.570> cards<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.099> this

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:29.249 
block for some fuse wire cards and this

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.550 
block for some fuse wire cards and this
has<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.669> while<00:00:30.150> X<00:00:30.390> variety<00:00:30.839> there<00:00:31.320> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
has to be the while X variety there and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
has to be the while X variety there and
these<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.369> on<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.759> bits<00:00:32.970> of<00:00:33.120> plywood<00:00:33.450> but

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
these are on these bits of plywood but

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.170 
these are on these bits of plywood but
that's<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.310> we<00:00:35.489> originally<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.030> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that's how that we originally I'm not is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.529 
that's how that we originally I'm not is
a<00:00:36.210> story<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.350> certainly<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> metal<00:00:39.120> block<00:00:39.390> it

00:00:39.529 --> 00:00:39.539 
a story but certainly the metal block it

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.920 
a story but certainly the metal block it
on<00:00:39.629> there<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.190> actually<00:00:41.190> got<00:00:41.399> two<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.730> these

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
on there and actually got two of these

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.939 
on there and actually got two of these
is<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.109> other<00:00:43.230> one<00:00:43.320> they're<00:00:43.469> both<00:00:43.590> actually

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
is the other one they're both actually

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.040 
is the other one they're both actually
identical<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.609> has<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> bit<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:44.969> pitting<00:00:45.899> on

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
identical what has a bit of pitting on

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.250 
identical what has a bit of pitting on
the<00:00:46.079> front<00:00:46.649> plate<00:00:46.920> there<00:00:47.129> otherwise<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.760> are

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
the front plate there otherwise they are

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.770 
the front plate there otherwise they are
identical<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.969> closer<00:00:50.969> look<00:00:51.149> at<00:00:51.269> these<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
identical so a closer look at these and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.020 
identical so a closer look at these and
see<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.530> actually<00:00:53.219> print<00:00:53.430> something<00:00:53.699> with

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
see we can actually print something with

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.810 
see we can actually print something with
them<00:00:54.679> now<00:00:55.679> here's<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> two<00:00:56.100> blocks<00:00:56.280> here<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
them now here's the two blocks here and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.970 
them now here's the two blocks here and
they're<00:00:57.570> both<00:00:57.660> print<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> same<00:00:58.500> thing<00:00:58.769> as<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
they're both print the same thing as you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.139 
they're both print the same thing as you
can<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.309> just<00:00:59.340> got<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> white<00:00:59.820> logo

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
can see it's just got the white logo

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.319 
can see it's just got the white logo
here<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.840> tin<00:01:01.500> copper<00:01:01.710> fuse<00:01:02.070> wire<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.550> I'll

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
here and tin copper fuse wire and I'll

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.729 
here and tin copper fuse wire and I'll
just<00:01:03.449> reverse<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:03.929> so<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.230> can<00:01:04.350> see<00:01:04.559> them

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
just reverse these so you can see them

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.160 
just reverse these so you can see them
the<00:01:04.860> query<00:01:05.339> round<00:01:05.730> and<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.870> three<00:01:07.050> values

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the query round and see the three values

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.370 
the query round and see the three values
we've<00:01:07.440> got<00:01:07.560> here<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.800> obviously<00:01:08.160> just<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.640> 5

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
we've got here is obviously just your 5

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.020 
we've got here is obviously just your 5
15<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.590> 30<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.280> pretty<00:01:11.520> much<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> standard

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
15 and 30 so pretty much the standard

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.840 
15 and 30 so pretty much the standard
set<00:01:12.900> there<00:01:13.200> got<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:13.950> wire<00:01:14.130> gauges<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.670> well

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
set there got your wire gauges as well

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.590 
set there got your wire gauges as well
and<00:01:15.090> I'll<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.290> got<00:01:16.410> 24<00:01:17.360> rewire<00:01:18.360> about

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and I'll see it's got 24 rewire about

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.520 
and I'll see it's got 24 rewire about
few<00:01:19.230> of<00:01:19.350> control<00:01:20.010> units<00:01:20.490> at<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> bottom<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
few of control units at the bottom and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.250 
few of control units at the bottom and
the<00:01:22.530> say<00:01:23.250> both<00:01:23.460> same<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:25.110> you

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
the say both same but this one as you

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.860 
the say both same but this one as you
see<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> very<00:01:25.890> thin<00:01:26.190> metal<00:01:26.490> plate<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.120> so

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
see is a very thin metal plate there so

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.210 
see is a very thin metal plate there so
we've<00:01:27.960> got<00:01:28.050> this<00:01:28.140> stamp<00:01:28.470> about<00:01:28.710> phoenix

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
we've got this stamp about phoenix

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.310 
we've got this stamp about phoenix
inspection<00:01:30.120> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.300> side<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.540> no<00:01:30.930> idea<00:01:31.140> quite

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
thicker well of course the plywood block

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.200 
thicker well of course the plywood block
it's<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> same<00:01:40.100> quite<00:01:41.100> why<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.370> massive

something but in any case else we've got
there<00:01:49.980> now<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> thought<00:01:50.880> nice<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> try<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
there now I thought nice to try and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.240 
there now I thought nice to try and
print<00:01:51.900> something<00:01:52.140> off<00:01:52.260> of<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:53.070> little

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
print something off of this so a little

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.330 
print something off of this so a little
bit<00:01:53.400> of<00:01:53.430> black<00:01:53.700> paint<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.280> I'll

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
bit of black paint here and I think I'll

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.440 
bit of black paint here and I think I'll
just<00:01:56.370> use<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:56.640> one<00:01:56.730> because<00:01:56.910> this<00:01:57.150> has<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.300> bit

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
just use this one because this has a bit

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.750 
just use this one because this has a bit
of<00:01:57.510> pitting<00:01:57.900> see<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.260> the<00:01:58.410> actual<00:01:58.650> metal<00:01:58.860> being

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
of pitting see on the actual metal being

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.540 
of pitting see on the actual metal being
the<00:01:59.910> that's<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.480> thinner<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:01.550> rather

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
the that's the thinner one so rather

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.190 
the that's the thinner one so rather
sort<00:02:02.910> of<00:02:02.970> rough<00:02:03.150> texture<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.690> isn't<00:02:03.960> too<00:02:04.170> bad

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
sort of rough texture this isn't too bad

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.389 
sort of rough texture this isn't too bad
it's<00:02:04.620> take<00:02:05.520> virtually<00:02:05.940> flat<00:02:06.300> so<00:02:07.250> try<00:02:08.250> applying

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it's take virtually flat so try applying

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.470 
it's take virtually flat so try applying
some<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:08.940> paint<00:02:09.660> got<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.500> then

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
some of this paint got here and then

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.119 
some of this paint got here and then
with<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> shovel<00:02:12.230> bit<00:02:12.409> of<00:02:12.670> paper<00:02:13.670> on<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.180> top<00:02:15.129> no

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
with a shovel bit of paper on the top no

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.699 
with a shovel bit of paper on the top no
idea<00:02:16.580> how<00:02:16.670> well<00:02:16.879> this<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.090> going<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.510> go<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.170> of

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
idea how well this is going to go so of

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.830 
idea how well this is going to go so of
course<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.069> results<00:02:19.610> of<00:02:19.700> call<00:02:19.909> may<00:02:20.150> vary<00:02:20.450> so

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
course the results of call may vary so

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.550 
course the results of call may vary so
it's<00:02:21.620> just<00:02:21.830> apply<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:22.970> over<00:02:23.209> there<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
it's just apply that over there and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.339 
it's just apply that over there and
there<00:02:24.680> will<00:02:24.830> be<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> bit<00:02:25.129> too<00:02:25.340> much<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.700> but

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
there will be a bit too much on that but

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.000 
there will be a bit too much on that but
well<00:02:27.349> all<00:02:28.010> that<00:02:28.220> soon<00:02:28.580> find<00:02:28.819> out<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:30.010> Pico

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
well all that soon find out on the Pico

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.970 
well all that soon find out on the Pico
to<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:32.420> I'm<00:02:32.540> just<00:02:32.660> not<00:02:32.750> small<00:02:32.989> really<00:02:33.769> thick

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
to it so I'm just not small really thick

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.650 
to it so I'm just not small really thick
paper<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.430> actually<00:02:34.849> looks<00:02:35.000> awesome<00:02:35.420> paper

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
paper this actually looks awesome paper

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:43.170 
paper this actually looks awesome paper
there<00:02:35.930> press<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.069> down<00:02:41.170> okay<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.230> there<00:02:42.739> we<00:02:42.769> go

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
there press it down okay so there we go

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.720 
there press it down okay so there we go
so<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.620> smudged<00:02:45.620> over<00:02:45.890> then<00:02:46.069> is<00:02:46.370> obviously

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
so it smudged over then is obviously

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.180 
so it smudged over then is obviously
paint<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.239> not<00:02:47.420> ink<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.140> not<00:02:48.620> necessary<00:02:49.010> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
paint and not ink so not necessary the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.849 
paint and not ink so not necessary the
best<00:02:49.730> material<00:02:50.239> let's<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.260> try<00:02:51.620> that<00:02:51.650> again

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
best material let's just try that again

00:02:51.859 --> 00:03:00.650 
best material let's just try that again
on<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.489> other<00:02:53.019> side<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.049> that<00:02:54.290> paper

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.020 

okay<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:01.980> we<00:03:02.010> go<00:03:02.100> so<00:03:02.490> i'll<00:03:02.670> see<00:03:02.850> if<00:03:02.910> its

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
okay so there we go so i'll see if its

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.280 
okay so there we go so i'll see if its
intended<00:03:03.240> prints<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.660> card<00:03:03.900> you've<00:03:04.170> got

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
intended prints on a card you've got

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.090 
intended prints on a card you've got
your<00:03:04.410> little<00:03:04.500> hanging<00:03:05.130> hole<00:03:05.280> at<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.490> top<00:03:05.700> and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
your little hanging hole at the top and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.250 
your little hanging hole at the top and
so<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.190> would<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.400> attach<00:03:08.910> or<00:03:09.090> wire<00:03:09.330> in<00:03:10.050> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
so you would just attach or wire in the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.250 
so you would just attach or wire in the
nose<00:03:10.650> holes<00:03:10.950> now<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:12.090> does<00:03:12.360> set<00:03:12.660> up<00:03:12.780> here<00:03:13.050> to

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
nose holes now it does set up here to

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.230 
nose holes now it does set up here to
this<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.650> you'd<00:03:14.160> have<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.430> either<00:03:14.550> cut<00:03:14.850> slot

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
this that you'd have to either cut slot

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.100 
this that you'd have to either cut slot
in<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.510> or<00:03:17.210> actually<00:03:18.210> I<00:03:18.240> just<00:03:18.630> sort<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.840> cut<00:03:19.020> the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
in it or actually I just sort of cut the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.520 
in it or actually I just sort of cut the
edges<00:03:19.230> or<00:03:19.410> we<00:03:19.680> trim<00:03:19.950> ground<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.550> later<00:03:20.790> on<00:03:20.910> so

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
edges or we trim ground it later on so

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.480 
edges or we trim ground it later on so
putting<00:03:22.530> there<00:03:22.710> was<00:03:22.800> some<00:03:22.890> type<00:03:23.040> of<00:03:23.070> cutting

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
putting there was some type of cutting

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.830 
putting there was some type of cutting
die<00:03:23.700> which<00:03:23.970> sure<00:03:24.180> went<00:03:24.390> with<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.780> I'll

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
die which sure went with this and I'll

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.720 
die which sure went with this and I'll
also<00:03:24.990> have<00:03:25.110> punched<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.710> hole<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.340> top<00:03:26.520> as

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
also have punched the hole in the top as

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.150 
also have punched the hole in the top as
well<00:03:26.910> but<00:03:27.750> certainly<00:03:28.350> it's<00:03:28.500> quite<00:03:28.920> readable

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
well but certainly it's quite readable

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.060 
well but certainly it's quite readable
I'm<00:03:30.030> saying<00:03:30.360> what<00:03:30.450> you're<00:03:30.510> 5<00:03:30.960> 15<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.500> 30<00:03:31.770> amps

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
I'm saying what you're 5 15 and 30 amps

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.850 
I'm saying what you're 5 15 and 30 amps
there<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:33.120> lobster<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.740> standard<00:03:34.740> wire

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
there and lobster the standard wire

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.180 
there and lobster the standard wire
gauge<00:03:35.270> listed<00:03:36.270> alongside<00:03:36.710> no<00:03:37.710> no<00:03:37.890> idea<00:03:38.100> how

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
gauge listed alongside no no idea how

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.850 
gauge listed alongside no no idea how
old<00:03:38.310> these<00:03:38.460> things<00:03:38.760> are<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.360> they<00:03:40.110> didn't

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
old these things are and they didn't

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.780 
old these things are and they didn't
come<00:03:40.950> with<00:03:41.040> any<00:03:41.070> kind<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.400> date

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
come with any kind of date

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.570 
come with any kind of date
identification<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:42.720> them<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.430> I'd

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
identification on them and so I'd

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.100 
identification on them and so I'd
imagine<00:03:44.910> they're<00:03:45.060> pretty<00:03:45.390> old<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:45.840> effect

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
imagine they're pretty old just effect

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.480 
imagine they're pretty old just effect
they<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.260> fuse<00:03:46.590> well<00:03:46.740> on<00:03:46.890> them<00:03:47.070> which<00:03:47.220> sure

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
they have fuse well on them which sure

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:48.590 
they have fuse well on them which sure
cause<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:47.910> something<00:03:48.090> which<00:03:48.210> is<00:03:48.360> rarely

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
cause it's something which is rarely
