I've got a big one here so let's zoom

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.999 
I've got a big one here so let's zoom
out<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.020> bit<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.469> we<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.829> see

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
out a little bit here so we can see

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
out a little bit here so we can see
first<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.429> all

step so in other words you may call your

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.160 
step so in other words you may call your
little<00:02:38.129> dough<00:02:38.280> balls<00:02:38.519> first<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.180> then<00:02:40.019> you

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
little dough balls first and then you

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.420 
little dough balls first and then you
place<00:02:40.470> them<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.829> and<00:02:41.010> then<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.190> grab<00:02:41.400> your

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
tool and you do it it goes very very

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.650 
tool and you do it it goes very very
quickly<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:44.489> know<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> wrong<00:02:45.150> way<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:45.629> it

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
quickly you know the wrong way to do it

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.509 
quickly you know the wrong way to do it
is<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.049> one<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.500> time<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.950> push<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.400> then
