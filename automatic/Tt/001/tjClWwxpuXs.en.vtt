00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello how about youtube people as they walk 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.180
 domains this is inter gerardo and 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.540
 well, this video had already uploaded 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:15.340
 but a few small technical problems 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.990
 let's say that this link changed so 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.850
 that does not agree much what 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.100
 is the description of the video in 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.560
 the video with what what is being 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.900
 the link and the way to install it 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.199
 So, since you already read what 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.029
 it's been how to get here or mellor 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.680
 and in a free way obviously that 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.360
 for this we are going to need what is 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.360
 the jailbreak and install 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.750
 an application of Syrian Syria is the 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.850
 icon of cute red box that comes out 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.490
 Once your phone is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.580
 We are going to install from there a 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.250
 application that is called ipad for this and 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.100
 so good to approve them what 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.110
 is not there is not yet installed what 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.830
 is the files for here 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:04.170
 and now let's try to select it 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:07.519
 I do not know if they listen 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.519

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.630
 and I try to select you or 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:19.370
 greater and not good either, for this reason 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.310
 I'm going to leave the link below 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.730

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.010

 what they are going to do is that here in more 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.830
 information I'm going to leave that link and 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.270
 once you do it you touched 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.770

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.510

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.450
 second option I do not know in Spanish as 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.880

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.850
 archivist let's touch it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.460
 and then we give him in the corner where 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.520
 says dan 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.720
 now what we do is we get to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.320
 this folder that says will be given to that v 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.319
 data we are going to select it we give in 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.030
 edit we select these two files 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.389
 we give it in the folder here 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.780
 below and we touch the second option that 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:20.310
 is being cut this is here 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.080
 then we give in giving 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.760
 we touch here the little house that is here 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.150
 down we are going to touch it 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.480
 we give it in applications and we look for what 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.200
 what is the king of fighters let's see 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.200
 one by one 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.500
 until you find the king of fighters 12 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.500
 2012 sorry 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.440
 and good today we're going to see all the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.920
 applications that we have installed in 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.920
 our device 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.740
 let's find it 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.670
 and well it is this that says coffee 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.380
 coffee and what we are going to do here we are going 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.860
 to simply give it here in documents 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.230
 then we give here in edit we play the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.690
 folder from here we are going to select it 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.850
 and we hit paste 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.060
 let's write about what 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.470
 because it is already written of the same 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.270
 way like the files that we're going to 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.160
 put like that is that we're going to overwrite 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.660
 once and they are two files so it is that 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.310
 again after we're going to give him who they give 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.770
 Now what we have to do is a 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:41.500
 small sprint for our device 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.420
 and then make sure I 'm not going to be born 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.340
 this reboot because if they have the 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.349
 jailbreak the jailbreak this 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.040
 etc what will happen is that they are going to 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.780
 lose your key so I 'm going to be 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.090
 spring in a way like I have it 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.519
 with an application that install from here 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.860
 to say and the only thing we have to 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.910
 do 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.910
 s remove it 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:14.060
 it seems that it does not leave me 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.060
 the insurance that if it is 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:29.430
 Well yes there they are 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.430
 in the eye normally 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.020
 very well is already doing what is this 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.020
 sprint we hope 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.370
 we hope that 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.370
 that loads well 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.780
 and so good now let's open what 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.780
 is this our game 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.409
 and well, let's try to 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.779
 select what I write 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.110

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:22.110

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.340

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.270
 let's see if they are working 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.380
