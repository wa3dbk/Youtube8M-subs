for<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.479> engine<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.079> thought<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> that

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
for that engine I thought that that

for that engine I thought that that
would<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> good<00:01:45.240> plug<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> put<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.290> there

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
would be a good plug to put in there

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
would be a good plug to put in there
it's<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.630> blue<00:01:48.840> what<00:01:49.320> brand<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.829> is

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it's that's just a blue what brand it is

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.100 
it's that's just a blue what brand it is
although<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> lot<00:01:50.909> all<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> these<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> same

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
although a lot all of these are the same

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.639 
although a lot all of these are the same
three<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:53.299> think<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> old<00:01:54.600> Ford<00:01:54.930> cars<00:01:55.320> had

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
three it I think the old Ford cars had

several<00:02:37.470> factors<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.909> comes<00:02:39.209> into<00:02:39.450> what

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
several factors that comes into what

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.809 
several factors that comes into what
kind<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.079> plug<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.439> put<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.769> this<00:02:41.040> engine<00:02:41.430> here

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
kind of plug to put in this engine here

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.440 
kind of plug to put in this engine here
and<00:02:42.389> on<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.920> could<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.310> could<00:02:44.519> build<00:02:44.700> five<00:02:45.269> of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and on you could I could build five of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.259 
and on you could I could build five of
these<00:02:45.540> engines<00:02:46.109> and<00:02:46.519> one<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.760> them<00:02:47.879> would<00:02:48.030> run

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
these engines and one of them would run

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.750 
these engines and one of them would run
better<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.840> auto<00:02:49.319> light<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.579> them<00:02:50.670> would

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
better on auto light one of them would

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.909 
better on auto light one of them would
run<00:02:50.970> better<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.389> a<00:02:51.419> champion<00:02:52.079> one<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.799> them

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:52.919 
run better on a champion one of them

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:56.119 
run better on a champion one of them
would<00:02:53.040> run<00:02:54.000> better<00:02:54.269> on<00:02:54.569> a<00:02:54.599> w10<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.859> one<00:02:56.040> of

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
would run better on a w10 and one of

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.909 
would run better on a w10 and one of
them<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.370> run<00:02:56.700> better<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.409> sail<00:02:58.409> number

00:02:58.909 --> 00:02:58.919 
them would run better on a sail number

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.110 
them would run better on a sail number
one<00:02:59.159> so<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:01.500> one<00:03:01.829> plug<00:03:02.159> fits<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.760> you

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
one so it's not one plug fits all you

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.770 
one so it's not one plug fits all you
should<00:03:03.930> have<00:03:04.139> a<00:03:04.169> box<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.680> plugs<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.189> this<00:03:05.459> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
should have a box of plugs like this and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.569 
should have a box of plugs like this and
then<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:07.019> try<00:03:07.319> them<00:03:07.379> and<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.709> will<00:03:07.950> find<00:03:07.980> one

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
then just try them and you will find one

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.949 
then just try them and you will find one
that<00:03:08.849> actually<00:03:09.030> makes<00:03:09.419> a<00:03:09.540> difference<00:03:09.900> that

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
that actually makes a difference that

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.649 
that actually makes a difference that
you<00:03:10.079> can<00:03:10.230> tell<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:11.459> everything<00:03:11.939> else<00:03:12.150> fails

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
you can tell when everything else fails

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.839 
you can tell when everything else fails
just<00:03:13.189> get<00:03:14.189> you<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.549> these<00:03:14.760> auto<00:03:15.060> light

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
just get you one of these auto light

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.750 
just get you one of these auto light
3076<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.599> about<00:03:18.780> three<00:03:19.079> bucks<00:03:19.760> 350

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
one of these plugs are when they get

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.180 
one of these plugs are when they get
somebody<00:03:30.359> betting<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.229> it's<00:03:31.889> just

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
somebody betting on it it's just

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.599 
somebody betting on it it's just
uncalled<00:03:32.729> for<00:03:33.229> but<00:03:34.229> anyways<00:03:35.120> what<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:37.609> more

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
uncalled for but anyways what the more

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.800 
uncalled for but anyways what the more
important<00:03:39.239> than<00:03:39.419> the<00:03:39.540> plug<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.799> index<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
important than the plug is the index the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.080 
important than the plug is the index the
index<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.739> plug<00:03:44.099> when<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.549> look<00:03:44.729> up<00:03:44.909> in

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
index of that plug when you look up in

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.610 
index of that plug when you look up in
that<00:03:45.269> hole<00:03:45.599> in<00:03:46.049> there<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.479> position<00:03:48.930> that

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
that hole in there the the position that

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.289 
that hole in there the the position that
plug<00:03:50.040> ins<00:03:50.459> up<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:51.209> more<00:03:51.629> important<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.530> think

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
plug ins up is more important I think

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.199 
plug ins up is more important I think
than<00:03:54.299> anything<00:03:54.569> that's<00:03:54.959> about<00:03:55.139> this<00:03:55.349> plug

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
than anything that's about this plug

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.030 
than anything that's about this plug
range<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.359> pretty<00:03:57.510> important<00:03:57.989> too<00:03:58.109> but<00:03:58.919> you

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
range is pretty important too but you

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.949 
range is pretty important too but you
see<00:03:59.250> where<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.549> little<00:03:59.760> that<00:04:00.269> little<00:04:00.299> finger

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
see where that little that little finger

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.099 
see where that little that little finger
comes<00:04:01.260> over<00:04:01.590> yonder<00:04:02.180> okay<00:04:03.180> there<00:04:03.419> is<00:04:03.569> actually

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
comes over yonder okay there is actually

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.819 
comes over yonder okay there is actually
a<00:04:04.319> dead<00:04:05.129> place<00:04:05.549> on<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.000> plug<00:04:06.359> right<00:04:06.629> there<00:04:06.959> if

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
a dead place on that plug right there if

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.819 
a dead place on that plug right there if
this<00:04:08.099> right<00:04:08.340> here<00:04:08.669> is<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:08.879> facing<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.829> open

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
this right here is a facing the open

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.280 
this right here is a facing the open
chamber<00:04:11.400> then<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.329> spark<00:04:12.689> has<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.109> come

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
chamber then the spark has to come

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.619 
chamber then the spark has to come
around<00:04:13.439> it<00:04:14.009> if<00:04:14.459> this<00:04:14.759> is<00:04:14.939> like<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.329> right

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:15.629 
around it if this is like this right

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:19.759 
around it if this is like this right
here<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.049> it<00:04:16.229> just<00:04:16.530> hits<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.630> head-on<00:04:18.630> but<00:04:19.620> in

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
here that it just hits it head-on but in

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.949 
here that it just hits it head-on but in
this<00:04:19.919> head<00:04:20.159> here<00:04:20.549> you<00:04:20.759> can<00:04:20.970> if<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.510> push<00:04:21.750> put

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
this head here you can if you push put

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.959 
this head here you can if you push put
your<00:04:22.139> finger<00:04:22.469> down<00:04:22.590> in<00:04:22.830> there<00:04:23.010> you<00:04:23.159> can<00:04:23.370> easily

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
your finger down in there you can easily

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:25.610 
your finger down in there you can easily
assert<00:04:24.719> that<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
assert that the

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.810 
assert that the
that<00:04:25.800> flame<00:04:26.310> should<00:04:26.639> go<00:04:26.910> straight<00:04:27.300> back<00:04:28.820> so

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
that flame should go straight back so

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.879 
that flame should go straight back so
what'd<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.120> do<00:04:30.270> put<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.540> little<00:04:30.660> mark<00:04:31.500> on<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
what'd you do put a little mark on the

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.580 
what'd you do put a little mark on the
plug<00:04:32.130> right<00:04:32.160> here<00:04:32.490> screw<00:04:33.389> it<00:04:33.540> in<00:04:36.470> till<00:04:37.470> it

it's pointing like this to the tip to

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.900 
it's pointing like this to the tip to
hear<00:04:49.380> them<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:50.100> would<00:04:50.250> be<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> bad<00:04:50.669> position

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
hear them that would be a bad position

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.750 
hear them that would be a bad position
for<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:51.449> plug<00:04:51.720> you<00:04:52.500> cannot<00:04:52.979> expect<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.550> get

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
for that plug you cannot expect to get

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.060 
for that plug you cannot expect to get
to<00:04:53.910> hurt<00:04:54.090> for<00:04:54.300> sending<00:04:54.600> all<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:54.840> plug<00:04:55.139> so<00:04:55.949> the

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
to hurt for sending all that plug so the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.950 
to hurt for sending all that plug so the
way<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.250> do<00:04:56.490> that<00:04:56.639> is<00:04:56.820> put<00:04:57.030> an<00:04:57.120> extra<00:04:57.449> washer

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
way you do that is put an extra washer

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.230 
way you do that is put an extra washer
in<00:04:58.110> there<00:04:58.380> and<00:04:58.620> they<00:04:59.010> do<00:04:59.070> make<00:04:59.430> indexing

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
in there and they do make indexing

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.180 
in there and they do make indexing
washers<00:05:00.630> which<00:05:00.870> is<00:05:01.020> nothing<00:05:01.229> but<00:05:01.380> different

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
washers which is nothing but different

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.760 
washers which is nothing but different
thicknesses<00:05:02.760> washers<00:05:03.240> do<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.570> do<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.560> legwork

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
thicknesses washers do it do the legwork

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.120 
thicknesses washers do it do the legwork
on<00:05:05.250> it<00:05:05.490> you<00:05:06.450> will<00:05:06.630> educate<00:05:07.020> yourself<00:05:07.650> on<00:05:07.770> spark

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
on it you will educate yourself on spark

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.550 
on it you will educate yourself on spark
plugs<00:05:08.400> your<00:05:09.060> engine<00:05:09.479> will<00:05:09.660> be<00:05:09.690> more<00:05:09.960> happy<00:05:10.320> for

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
plugs your engine will be more happy for

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.680 
plugs your engine will be more happy for
it<00:05:10.680> we've<00:05:11.280> got<00:05:11.490> that<00:05:11.729> thread<00:05:12.000> let's<00:05:12.240> move<00:05:12.479> up

it we've got that thread let's move up
here<00:05:13.080> we<00:05:13.919> got<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.250> 3/8<00:05:14.820> unit<00:05:15.180> chaste<00:05:15.540> so<00:05:16.139> all

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
here we got that 3/8 unit chaste so all

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.279 
here we got that 3/8 unit chaste so all
is<00:05:16.560> good<00:05:16.800> there<00:05:17.160> what<00:05:18.060> we<00:05:18.240> get<00:05:18.960> ready<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.169> put

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
is good there what we get ready to put

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.440 
is good there what we get ready to put
the<00:05:19.410> head<00:05:19.590> on<00:05:19.620> this<00:05:19.919> engine<00:05:20.190> so<00:05:21.090> if<00:05:21.270> we

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
the head on this engine so if we

the head on this engine so if we
remember<00:05:22.229> we<00:05:22.470> rebuilt<00:05:22.919> it<00:05:23.130> just<00:05:23.370> go<00:05:23.550> over<00:05:23.669> here

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
remember we rebuilt it just go over here

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.790 
remember we rebuilt it just go over here
and<00:05:23.850> look<00:05:24.060> on<00:05:24.270> that<00:05:24.419> I<00:05:24.479> see<00:05:25.050> series<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.710> you

and look on that I see series and you
will<00:05:25.979> see<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:26.250> complete<00:05:26.610> build<00:05:26.970> on<00:05:27.180> this<00:05:27.389> head

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
will see the complete build on this head

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.570 
will see the complete build on this head
that's<00:05:28.289> the<00:05:28.410> ones<00:05:28.650> that<00:05:28.889> we<00:05:29.070> built<00:05:29.460> the

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
that's the ones that we built the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.240 
that's the ones that we built the
ballast<00:05:29.910> for<00:05:30.380> everything<00:05:31.380> works<00:05:31.680> really<00:05:31.950> good

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
ballast for everything works really good

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.110 
ballast for everything works really good
on<00:05:32.490> it<00:05:32.520> really<00:05:33.270> really<00:05:33.600> good<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.729> choke<00:05:35.729> and

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
on it really really good the choke and

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.210 
on it really really good the choke and
the<00:05:36.539> way<00:05:36.690> this<00:05:36.870> thing<00:05:36.930> works<00:05:37.470> if<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:37.830> can<00:05:38.010> see

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
the way this thing works if you can see

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.190 
the way this thing works if you can see
down<00:05:38.400> in<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.729> other<00:05:38.820> when<00:05:39.389> that<00:05:39.510> comes<00:05:39.810> up<00:05:40.020> it

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
down in the other when that comes up it

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.700 
down in the other when that comes up it
closes<00:05:40.740> up<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:41.160> the<00:05:42.090> choke<00:05:42.450> valve<00:05:42.810> simple

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
closes up that the choke valve simple

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.129 
closes up that the choke valve simple
really<00:05:44.010> simple<00:05:44.580> really<00:05:44.789> simple<00:05:44.910> and<00:05:45.660> if<00:05:46.020> you

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
really simple really simple and if you

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.920 
really simple really simple and if you
cannot<00:05:46.500> get<00:05:46.770> your<00:05:46.800> engine<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.550> idle<00:05:47.930> really

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
cannot get your engine to idle really

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.450 
cannot get your engine to idle really
low<00:05:49.970> sometimes<00:05:51.139> a<00:05:52.139> bigger<00:05:52.560> part<00:05:52.919> at<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.190> time

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
low sometimes a bigger part at the time

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.480 
low sometimes a bigger part at the time
is<00:05:53.760> that<00:05:54.360> hole<00:05:54.960> in<00:05:55.260> there<00:05:55.440> will<00:05:55.680> be<00:05:55.710> rusted

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
is that hole in there will be rusted

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.180 
is that hole in there will be rusted
especially<00:05:57.090> on<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.210> no<00:05:57.450> rebuilt<00:05:57.990> junk<00:05:58.740> engine

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
especially on a no rebuilt junk engine

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.230 
especially on a no rebuilt junk engine
that<00:05:59.970> hole<00:06:00.330> will<00:06:00.660> be<00:06:00.710> rusted<00:06:01.710> bigger<00:06:02.310> than<00:06:02.970> the

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
that hole will be rusted bigger than the

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.500 
that hole will be rusted bigger than the
clapper<00:06:03.570> is<00:06:03.979> and<00:06:04.979> when<00:06:05.250> that<00:06:05.370> happens<00:06:05.940> then<00:06:06.210> it

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
clapper is and when that happens then it

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.830 
clapper is and when that happens then it
can't<00:06:06.810> shut<00:06:07.110> off<00:06:07.139> the<00:06:07.470> air<00:06:08.210> the<00:06:09.210> next<00:06:09.599> biggest

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
can't shut off the air the next biggest

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.960 
can't shut off the air the next biggest
thing<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.410> goes<00:06:10.590> along<00:06:10.740> with<00:06:10.889> this<00:06:11.340> head<00:06:11.639> is

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
thing that goes along with this head is

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.650 
thing that goes along with this head is
this<00:06:12.539> shaft<00:06:12.990> or<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.770> hole<00:06:14.610> in<00:06:14.910> the<00:06:15.060> head<00:06:15.270> for

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
this shaft or the hole in the head for

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.230 
this shaft or the hole in the head for
that<00:06:18.229> governor<00:06:19.229> that<00:06:19.590> choke<00:06:19.950> plate<00:06:20.820> there

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
that governor that choke plate there

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.969 
that governor that choke plate there
that<00:06:21.479> mechanism<00:06:22.139> where<00:06:22.289> that<00:06:22.470> goes<00:06:22.680> through

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
that mechanism where that goes through

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.520 
that mechanism where that goes through
your<00:06:23.010> honor<00:06:23.220> if<00:06:24.090> that<00:06:24.389> is<00:06:24.570> worn<00:06:24.900> out<00:06:25.110> and

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
your honor if that is worn out and

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.070 
your honor if that is worn out and
you're<00:06:25.919> getting<00:06:26.190> our<00:06:26.550> in<00:06:26.849> there<00:06:27.210> then<00:06:27.930> it

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
you're getting our in there then it

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.810 
you're getting our in there then it
won't<00:06:28.229> have<00:06:28.470> the<00:06:28.620> suction<00:06:28.860> on<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.310> carburetor

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
won't have the suction on the carburetor

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.680 
won't have the suction on the carburetor
on<00:06:30.289> the<00:06:31.289> mixer<00:06:31.680> so<00:06:32.340> if<00:06:32.880> you<00:06:33.090> have<00:06:33.300> a<00:06:33.330> loose

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
on the mixer so if you have a loose

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.010 
on the mixer so if you have a loose
shaft<00:06:34.469> here<00:06:34.950> if<00:06:35.219> that<00:06:35.430> shaft<00:06:35.760> is<00:06:36.030> loose

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
shaft here if that shaft is loose

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.980 
shaft here if that shaft is loose
then<00:06:37.620> the<00:06:38.220> only<00:06:38.430> way<00:06:38.699> to<00:06:38.910> fix<00:06:39.180> that<00:06:39.419> is<00:06:39.599> to<00:06:39.629> take

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
then the only way to fix that is to take

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.790 
then the only way to fix that is to take
it<00:06:40.169> out<00:06:40.289> and<00:06:40.530> put<00:06:40.710> a<00:06:40.770> bushing<00:06:41.250> in<00:06:41.400> it<00:06:42.500> or<00:06:43.500> an

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
it out and put a bushing in it or an

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.189 
it out and put a bushing in it or an
oversized<00:06:44.370> shaft<00:06:44.930> or<00:06:46.370> both<00:06:47.840> but<00:06:48.840> we<00:06:49.020> don't

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 
oversized shaft or both but we don't

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.719 
oversized shaft or both but we don't
let's<00:06:49.409> put<00:06:49.590> this<00:06:49.740> on<00:06:49.919> let's<00:06:50.190> put<00:06:50.370> this<00:06:50.490> on<00:06:50.669> the

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
let's put this on let's put this on the

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.240 
let's put this on let's put this on the
engine
