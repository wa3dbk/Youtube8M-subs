 save galley linked in cipherclub 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.259
 maurice fernandes in this area is here 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.449
 to complement my two 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.390
 first classes about connected and time 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.160
 both linked and teps in addition to making the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.530
 most interesting guitar sound 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.629
 through natural passages are a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180
 great way to play with speed 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.159
 and provides agility to our solos 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.140
 so easily that they become 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.659
 naturally fit into any type 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.879
 from jazz to metal 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.530
 so for you who have not attended 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.750
 the first two classes do not 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 check it out will help you a lot 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.649
 perform the pre-salt exercises 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.649
 there the exercises 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.900
 ae 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.650
 my God 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.390
 this first exercise was withdrawn from 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.550
 an excerpt from a song of mine 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.430
 from start to finish let's go there attention 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.010
 especially in the execution of the 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.410
 sixteenth-century and especially in 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.750
 compass of speech disorders where 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:45.930
 I use that in the area of 5 by 4 and a 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.930
 four-way compass alternately 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.739
 this example is also taken from music 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.870
 from beginning to end 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.840
 I work the mix of techniques 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.640
 connected the time in with after staying 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.860
 evident how interesting it is 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.360
 that we can print using the 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.610
 implementation of the agreement 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.799
 another detail that will dictate a little is the 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.810
 mixture of quaternary compounds four 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.810
 for four and ternary three for four 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.250
 i 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.460
 This is the song impetuous wind she is 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.780
 built in a sixteenth note I'll show 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.880
 For you slow 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.979
 This makes it easier to see the notes. 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.229
 that uses the connector notice that soon 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:45.599
 At the beginning we have an eighteenth-note pause. 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.599
 because let me get over there 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.370
 That's it folks I hope you 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.040
 have enjoyed my lessons about 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.840
 tepes linked any doubt that you 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.040
 have just leave a comment here 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.780
