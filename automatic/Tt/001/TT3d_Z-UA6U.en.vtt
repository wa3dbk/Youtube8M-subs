00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
I'll take larger logs at that point and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.580 
I'll take larger logs at that point and
throw<00:01:32.300> them<00:01:32.360> in<00:01:32.510> there<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.840> usually<00:01:33.260> for

throw them in there and usually for
larger<00:01:33.890> would<00:01:34.270> if<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.600> come<00:01:36.170> across<00:01:37.060> this

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
larger would if you can come across this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.180 
larger would if you can come across this
thing<00:01:38.330> called<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.660> press<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:39.170> log<00:01:39.410> it's

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
thing called a press to log it's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.490 
thing called a press to log it's
basically<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.640> compressed<00:01:41.180> rooted<00:01:41.900> fire<00:01:42.170> dust

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
basically a compressed rooted fire dust

um yeah it's just extremely compressed
sawdust<00:01:48.310> 10,000<00:01:49.310> pound<00:01:49.460> machine<00:01:49.550> crushes<00:01:50.090> it

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
sawdust 10,000 pound machine crushes it

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.640 
sawdust 10,000 pound machine crushes it
together<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.630> there's<00:01:50.780> no<00:01:50.870> wax<00:01:51.080> or<00:01:51.350> nasty

together so there's no wax or nasty

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.680 
together so there's no wax or nasty
chemicals<00:01:52.070> holding<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.370> together<00:01:52.510> this<00:01:53.510> is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
chemicals holding it together this is

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.300 
chemicals holding it together this is
awesome<00:01:53.900> stuff<00:01:54.320> to<00:01:54.440> burn<00:01:54.590> if<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.010> have<00:01:55.160> it

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
awesome stuff to burn if you have it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.310 
awesome stuff to burn if you have it
locally<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.540> can<00:01:56.570> find<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:56.930> in<00:01:56.960> hardware

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
locally you can find it in hardware

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440 
locally you can find it in hardware
stores<00:01:57.350> under<00:01:57.860> such<00:01:58.070> places<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.150> usually

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
stores under such places and usually

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.360 
stores under such places and usually
what<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.690> do<00:01:59.840> is<00:02:00.380> you<00:02:00.590> cut<00:02:00.770> it<00:02:00.860> into<00:02:01.010> smaller

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
what you do is you cut it into smaller

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.030 
what you do is you cut it into smaller
pieces<00:02:01.550> like<00:02:01.910> this<00:02:02.060> little<00:02:02.600> disc<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.740> you

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
pieces like this little disc and you

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.200 
pieces like this little disc and you
just<00:02:04.220> throw<00:02:04.430> maybe<00:02:04.610> three<00:02:04.910> or<00:02:04.940> four<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.120> those

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
just throw maybe three or four of those

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.670 
just throw maybe three or four of those
discs<00:02:05.480> in<00:02:05.630> there<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:05.900> it'll<00:02:06.020> literally<00:02:06.320> burn

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
discs in there and it'll literally burn

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.460 
discs in there and it'll literally burn
for<00:02:06.950> hours<00:02:06.980> before<00:02:07.640> those<00:02:07.820> discs<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.690> forget

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
for hours before those discs so forget

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.590 
for hours before those discs so forget
about<00:02:09.500> eight<00:02:09.860> discounted<00:02:10.490> this<00:02:10.610> entire<00:02:11.330> press

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
about eight discounted this entire press

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.449 
about eight discounted this entire press
tulog<00:02:11.930> so<00:02:12.200> that's<00:02:12.740> eight<00:02:12.890> hours<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.190> fire

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
tulog so that's eight hours of fire

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.910 
tulog so that's eight hours of fire
right<00:02:13.760> there<00:02:13.790> out<00:02:14.300> of<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.480> log<00:02:14.660> pretty<00:02:15.500> awesome

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
right there out of a log pretty awesome

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.220 
right there out of a log pretty awesome
but<00:02:16.250> as<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.580> can<00:02:16.700> see<00:02:16.940> she<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.390> cranking<00:02:18.050> right

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
but as you can see she is cranking right

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.580 
but as you can see she is cranking right
now<00:02:18.550> just<00:02:19.550> from<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.760> one<00:02:19.820> burned<00:02:20.590> reason

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
now just from that one burned reason

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.800 
now just from that one burned reason
this<00:02:21.680> happens<00:02:22.100> this<00:02:22.550> stove<00:02:22.790> has<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.150> special

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
this happens this stove has a special

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.140 
this happens this stove has a special
air<00:02:24.470> induction<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:25.220> secondary<00:02:25.730> combustion

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
air induction a secondary combustion

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.870 
air induction a secondary combustion
going<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.430> basically<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.550> fire<00:02:28.730> is

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
going on so basically the fire is

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.060 
going on so basically the fire is
burning<00:02:29.239> down<00:02:29.390> here<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.870> there's<00:02:30.620> other

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
burning down here and there's other

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.160 
burning down here and there's other
oxygen<00:02:31.670> tubes<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.239> run<00:02:32.300> up<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> stove<00:02:32.930> and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
oxygen tubes that run up the stove and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.699 
oxygen tubes that run up the stove and
create<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:33.920> second<00:02:34.430> fire<00:02:34.640> up<00:02:35.330> here<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.560> it's

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
create a second fire up here and it's

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.260 
create a second fire up here and it's
basically<00:02:36.980> like<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.430> looks<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:37.910> a<00:02:37.940> steel

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
basically like it looks like a steel

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.330 
basically like it looks like a steel
honeycomb<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.050> that<00:02:39.920> little<00:02:40.070> steel

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
honeycomb and that little steel

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.360 
honeycomb and that little steel
honeycomb<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.050> recirculates<00:02:42.050> air<00:02:42.370> knocks

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
honeycomb just recirculates air knocks

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.670 
honeycomb just recirculates air knocks
turn<00:02:43.550> around<00:02:43.820> and<00:02:44.060> just<00:02:44.090> ignite<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:45.140> gases<00:02:45.560> on

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
turn around and just ignite the gases on

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.680 
turn around and just ignite the gases on
fire<00:02:45.950> from<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.790> wood<00:02:47.060> down<00:02:47.209> here<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.570> it's

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
fire from the wood down here so it's

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.540 
fire from the wood down here so it's
pretty<00:02:47.810> cool<00:02:48.050> I'll<00:02:48.800> go<00:02:49.010> get<00:02:49.130> to<00:02:49.220> see<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:49.520> a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
pretty cool I'll go get to see that in a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.670 
pretty cool I'll go get to see that in a
minute<00:02:49.670> but<00:02:50.390> on<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.750> Kimberly<00:02:51.110> stove<00:02:51.350> is

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
minute but on this Kimberly stove is

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.199 
minute but on this Kimberly stove is
definitely<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.280> most<00:02:52.400> efficient<00:02:52.820> wood<00:02:52.970> stove

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
definitely the most efficient wood stove

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.570 
definitely the most efficient wood stove
I've<00:02:53.360> used<00:02:53.570> I've<00:02:53.810> used<00:02:54.380> with<00:02:55.070> stoves<00:02:55.340> and

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
I've used I've used with stoves and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.970 
I've used I've used with stoves and
cabins<00:02:56.000> hunting<00:02:56.870> camps<00:02:57.230> friends<00:02:57.770> homes

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
cabins hunting camps friends homes

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.010 
cabins hunting camps friends homes

it actually has really little ash
usually<00:05:06.890> pretty<00:05:07.640> efficient<00:05:08.060> stoves<00:05:08.270> so<00:05:08.660> it

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
usually pretty efficient stoves so it

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.600 
usually pretty efficient stoves so it
burns<00:05:09.260> it<00:05:09.560> actually<00:05:09.830> uses<00:05:10.010> all<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.430> fuel

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
burns it actually uses all the fuel

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.540 
burns it actually uses all the fuel
isn't<00:05:11.090> just<00:05:11.210> turning<00:05:11.510> and<00:05:11.540> ash<00:05:11.750> uh<00:05:12.430> what<00:05:13.430> else

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
isn't just turning and ash uh what else

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.590 
isn't just turning and ash uh what else
can<00:05:13.729> we<00:05:13.820> tell<00:05:13.970> you<00:05:14.030> about<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.330> it's<00:05:14.419> pretty

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
can we tell you about it it's pretty

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.370 
can we tell you about it it's pretty
light<00:05:14.950> 56<00:05:15.950> pounds<00:05:16.100> so<00:05:17.000> if<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.510> doesn't<00:05:17.810> wait<00:05:17.960> RV

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
light 56 pounds so if it doesn't wait RV

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.050 
light 56 pounds so if it doesn't wait RV
down<00:05:18.560> most<00:05:18.979> small<00:05:19.070> stoves<00:05:19.460> are<00:05:19.700> anywhere<00:05:19.970> from

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
down most small stoves are anywhere from

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.690 
down most small stoves are anywhere from
100<00:05:20.479> 200<00:05:20.840> pounds<00:05:21.140> so<00:05:21.350> it's<00:05:22.310> kind<00:05:22.550> of<00:05:22.580> nice

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
100 200 pounds so it's kind of nice

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.240 
100 200 pounds so it's kind of nice
having<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:23.060> light<00:05:23.090> weight<00:05:23.390> stove<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.650> that's

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.100 
having a light weight stove and that's
pretty<00:05:25.490> much<00:05:25.610> it<00:05:25.760> I'm<00:05:26.180> pretty<00:05:26.660> soon<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.020> I'm

going to show you the secondary
combustion<00:05:30.200> that<00:05:31.039> the<00:05:31.190> stove<00:05:31.460> has

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
combustion that the stove has

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.020
