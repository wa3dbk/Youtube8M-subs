00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.610 
force myself to sit down and do what I
was<00:02:12.709> supposed<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.130> be<00:02:13.280> doing<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.989> did<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:15.500> I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
was supposed to be doing and I did and I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.410 
was supposed to be doing and I did and I
think<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:15.950> turned<00:02:16.160> out<00:02:16.310> right<00:02:16.520> what<00:02:17.270> do<00:02:17.330> you

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
think it turned out right what do you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.100 
think it turned out right what do you
think<00:02:20.680> so<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:21.709> really<00:02:22.340> loved<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.850> line<00:02:23.090> work<00:02:23.390> in

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
think so I really loved the line work in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.400 
think so I really loved the line work in
this<00:02:24.440> painting

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
this painting

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.960 
this painting
what<00:02:27.040> I<00:02:27.070> did<00:02:27.460> was<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:28.140> normally<00:02:29.140> don't<00:02:29.700> show<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
what I did was I normally don't show the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.090 
what I did was I normally don't show the
lines<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.810> use<00:02:32.140> when<00:02:32.350> I'm<00:02:32.470> drawing<00:02:32.770> but<00:02:33.070> I

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
lines that I use when I'm drawing but I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.570 
lines that I use when I'm drawing but I
did<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.850> time<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:35.770> was<00:02:35.920> really<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.310> focus

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
did this time it was really to focus

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.450 
did this time it was really to focus
myself<00:02:36.970> in<00:02:37.450> chant<00:02:37.750> channel<00:02:38.200> myself<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.310> know

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
myself in chant channel myself you know

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.980 
myself in chant channel myself you know
kind<00:02:39.700> of<00:02:39.820> pushed<00:02:40.690> me<00:02:40.810> in<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.020> right<00:02:41.200> direction

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
kind of pushed me in the right direction

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.770 
kind of pushed me in the right direction
it<00:02:43.990> has<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.170> real<00:02:44.500> calming<00:02:44.980> effect<00:02:45.310> on<00:02:45.490> me<00:02:45.780> plus

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
it has a real calming effect on me plus

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.500 
it has a real calming effect on me plus
it<00:02:46.990> slows<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.560> mind<00:02:47.830> down<00:02:48.070> so<00:02:48.520> much<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:48.880> I

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
it slows the mind down so much that I

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.030 
it slows the mind down so much that I
shuts<00:02:50.230> off<00:02:50.440> after<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> while

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.330 

it's<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.220> difficult<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.850> put<00:02:55.090> into<00:02:55.210> words

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
it's so difficult to put into words

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.110 
it's so difficult to put into words
because<00:02:59.220> when<00:03:00.220> you're<00:03:00.370> painting<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.940> go

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
because when you're painting you go

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.350 
because when you're painting you go
beyond<00:03:01.600> words<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:03.340> go<00:03:03.520> beyond<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.060> meaning

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
beyond words you go beyond the meaning

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.130 
beyond words you go beyond the meaning
of<00:03:04.450> anything<00:03:04.900> there<00:03:05.800> are<00:03:05.860> no<00:03:06.040> words<00:03:06.310> involved

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
of anything there are no words involved

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.810 
of anything there are no words involved
you<00:03:08.140> have<00:03:08.290> direct<00:03:08.860> connection<00:03:09.490> to<00:03:09.640> what

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
you have direct connection to what

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.650 
you have direct connection to what
you're<00:03:10.030> doing<00:03:10.470> without<00:03:11.470> thinking<00:03:12.130> about<00:03:12.250> it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
you're doing without thinking about it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.490 
you're doing without thinking about it
and<00:03:13.660> that's<00:03:13.840> all<00:03:14.020> I<00:03:14.050> was<00:03:14.200> trying<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:16.500> trying

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
and that's all I was trying to do trying

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.030 
and that's all I was trying to do trying
to<00:03:17.620> express<00:03:17.950> what's<00:03:18.160> going<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.520> inside<00:03:20.040> this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
to express what's going on inside this

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.890 
to express what's going on inside this
is<00:03:21.250> what<00:03:21.400> it<00:03:21.520> feels<00:03:21.550> like<00:03:22.120> inside<00:03:22.360> of<00:03:22.630> me

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
is what it feels like inside of me

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
is what it feels like inside of me
sometimes<00:03:23.530> you<00:03:23.650> know<00:03:23.770> very<00:03:24.550> calm<00:03:24.880> very<00:03:25.330> easy

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
sometimes you know very calm very easy

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.030 
sometimes you know very calm very easy
very<00:03:26.920> free<00:03:27.310> free-flowing

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.180 

always<00:03:32.879> turning<00:03:33.180> within

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
always turning within

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.890 
always turning within
that's<00:03:34.730> what<00:03:34.880> these<00:03:34.970> paintings<00:03:35.270> really<00:03:35.780> all

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
that's what these paintings really all

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.800 
that's what these paintings really all
about

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
about

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.089 
about
it's<00:03:38.810> about<00:03:39.110> going<00:03:39.500> within<00:03:39.800> yourself<00:03:42.099> calming

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
it's about going within yourself calming

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.420 
it's about going within yourself calming
yourself<00:03:43.250> down<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:45.230> trying<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.769> stay<00:03:46.069> in<00:03:46.280> that

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
yourself down and trying to stay in that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.339 
yourself down and trying to stay in that
place<00:03:46.610> no<00:03:47.180> matter<00:03:47.330> what's<00:03:47.659> going<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.170> around

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
place no matter what's going on around

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.920 
place no matter what's going on around
outside<00:03:48.799> of<00:03:49.099> you<00:03:49.310> trying<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.180> stay<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.569> a<00:03:50.629> calm

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930

outside of you trying to stay in a calm
cool<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.709> collected<00:03:51.920> place

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.290 

try<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.010> get<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> different<00:03:58.640> perspective<00:03:58.730> on

Nevada

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.240 

because<00:04:06.870> from<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.230> outside<00:04:07.290> things<00:04:08.010> look

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
because from the outside things look

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.170 
because from the outside things look
completely<00:04:08.760> different<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.420> me<00:04:09.600> inside<00:04:09.930> I
