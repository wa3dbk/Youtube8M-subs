move<00:04:51.600> for<00:04:51.840> a<00:04:51.870> championship<00:04:52.910> defensively<00:04:53.910> we

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
move for a championship defensively we

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.960 
move for a championship defensively we
were<00:04:54.860> so<00:04:55.860> much<00:04:56.010> better<00:04:56.070> than<00:04:56.490> previous<00:04:56.940> years

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
were so much better than previous years

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.020 
were so much better than previous years
and<00:04:57.600> that<00:04:58.230> was<00:04:58.260> a<00:04:58.410> difference<00:04:58.860> for<00:04:59.040> us<00:04:59.190> we<00:04:59.850> got

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
and that was a difference for us we got

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.700 
and that was a difference for us we got
guys<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.240> can<00:05:00.630> score<00:05:00.870> we<00:05:01.110> get<00:05:01.260> guys<00:05:01.410> I<00:05:01.590> can

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
guys that can score we get guys I can

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.280 
guys that can score we get guys I can
make<00:05:01.830> plays<00:05:02.040> with<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.340> ball<00:05:02.520> but<00:05:02.870> as<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.930> team

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
make plays with the ball but as a team

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.070 
make plays with the ball but as a team
if<00:05:04.320> we<00:05:04.710> can<00:05:04.860> figure<00:05:05.040> out<00:05:05.160> how<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:06.080> be

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
if we can figure out how to be

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.470 
if we can figure out how to be
consistent<00:05:07.680> on<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.770> end<00:05:08.130> and<00:05:08.310> make<00:05:09.180> plays

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
consistent on that end and make plays

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.790 
consistent on that end and make plays
and<00:05:09.950> just<00:05:10.950> be<00:05:11.070> disciplined<00:05:12.680> throughout<00:05:13.680> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
and just be disciplined throughout the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.370 
and just be disciplined throughout the
course<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.160> 48<00:05:14.550> minutes<00:05:15.110> we're<00:05:16.110> going<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.290> be<00:05:16.350> a

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
course of 48 minutes we're going to be a

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.440 
course of 48 minutes we're going to be a
good<00:05:16.590> shape<00:05:16.860> because<00:05:17.700> of<00:05:18.000> helping<00:05:18.300> your

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
good shape because of helping your

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.150 
good shape because of helping your
powerful<00:05:18.720> your<00:05:19.020> offensively<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.690> that<00:05:22.160> focus

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
powerful your offensively so that focus

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.280 
powerful your offensively so that focus
doesn't<00:05:23.550> they<00:05:23.760> actually<00:05:24.150> amps<00:05:24.720> up<00:05:24.870> even<00:05:25.140> more

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
doesn't they actually amps up even more

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.840 
doesn't they actually amps up even more
because<00:05:25.500> we<00:05:25.860> understand<00:05:26.250> how<00:05:26.370> important<00:05:26.760> it

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
because we understand how important it
