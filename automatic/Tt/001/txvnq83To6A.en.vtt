00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
before the game so I thought maybe it

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.509 
before the game so I thought maybe it
was<00:00:17.690> time<00:00:17.869> for<00:00:17.929> a<00:00:18.109> different<00:00:18.410> haircut<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:18.980> get

was time for a different haircut and get

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.609 
was time for a different haircut and get
a<00:00:19.660> decent<00:00:20.660> a<00:00:21.019> decent<00:00:21.349> enough<00:00:21.410> performance

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619
