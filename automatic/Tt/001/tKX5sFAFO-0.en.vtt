concerning aluminum repairs for example
a<00:00:16.619> lot<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.190> people<00:00:17.310> would<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:17.880> you

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
a lot of people would think that you

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.880 
a lot of people would think that you
can't<00:00:18.359> put<00:00:18.630> body<00:00:18.900> filler<00:00:19.020> directly<00:00:19.770> on

can't put body filler directly on
aluminum<00:00:20.340> panels<00:00:20.699> which<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.180> untrue<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
aluminum panels which is untrue if you

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
aluminum panels which is untrue if you
use<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.470> correct<00:00:22.740> body<00:00:22.920> fillers<00:00:23.400> premium

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
use the correct body fillers premium

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
use the correct body fillers premium
fillers<00:00:24.150> there's<00:00:25.019> no<00:00:25.170> problem<00:00:25.590> all<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
fillers there's no problem all the

fillers there's no problem all the
fillers<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.390> example<00:00:27.779> are

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
fillers that that we use for example are

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.870 
fillers that that we use for example are
tested<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.500> different<00:00:29.070> substrates<00:00:29.250> such<00:00:29.699> as

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
tested on different substrates such as

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.550 
tested on different substrates such as
aluminum<00:00:30.240> some<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.019> other<00:00:31.170> things<00:00:31.410> I

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
aluminum some of the other things I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
aluminum some of the other things I
discussed<00:00:31.980> was<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.790> neccessity<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
discussed was the the neccessity of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.950 
discussed was the the neccessity of
corrosion<00:00:34.920> protection<00:00:35.300> on<00:00:36.300> aluminum<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:36.930> well

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
corrosion protection on aluminum as well

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.319 
corrosion protection on aluminum as well
a<00:00:37.320> lot<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.590> people<00:00:37.860> mistakenly<00:00:38.550> think<00:00:39.030> because

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
a lot of people mistakenly think because

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.810 
a lot of people mistakenly think because
it's<00:00:39.480> aluminum<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.469> doesn't<00:00:40.829> rust<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.670> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it's aluminum it doesn't rust that you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's aluminum it doesn't rust that you
don't<00:00:42.090> need<00:00:42.270> corrosion<00:00:42.780> protection<00:00:42.960> but

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
don't need corrosion protection but

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
don't need corrosion protection but
there's<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.280> number<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.760> types<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.149> corrosion

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
there's a number of types of corrosion

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.319 
there's a number of types of corrosion
that<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.230> occur<00:00:46.500> even<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.920> aluminum<00:00:47.370> panels<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that can occur even on aluminum panels a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.819 
that can occur even on aluminum panels a
couple<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.050> other<00:00:49.170> things<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.590> talked

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
couple of the other things I talked

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.889 
couple of the other things I talked
about<00:00:49.950> we're<00:00:50.910> properly<00:00:51.149> fixturing

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
about we're properly fixturing

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.500 
about we're properly fixturing
structural<00:00:52.530> panels<00:00:53.000> setting<00:00:54.000> rivets<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
structural panels setting rivets and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.869 
structural panels setting rivets and
temporary<00:00:54.960> rivets<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> place<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.730> you

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
temporary rivets in place so that as you

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.599 
temporary rivets in place so that as you
bond<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.510> rivet<00:00:58.109> panels<00:00:58.469> together<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.370> they

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
bond and rivet panels together that they

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.020 
bond and rivet panels together that they
they<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.719> panels<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.170> move<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:02.030> elongate

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
they the panels don't move and elongate

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.050 
they the panels don't move and elongate
holes<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.690> set<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> rivets<00:01:04.500> incorrectly<00:01:05.070> so

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
holes or set the rivets incorrectly so

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660 
holes or set the rivets incorrectly so
things<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.570> nature<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.500> general<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
things of that nature so in general the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.000 
things of that nature so in general the
program<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.270> about<00:01:09.470> solving<00:01:10.470> some<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
program is about solving some of the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
program is about solving some of the
problems<00:01:11.549> talking<00:01:12.510> about<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:12.840> aluminum<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
problems talking about how aluminum is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.380 
problems talking about how aluminum is
different<00:01:13.890> than<00:01:14.010> steel<00:01:14.280> why<00:01:15.090> that's

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
different than steel why that's

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.840 
different than steel why that's
important<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> repairs<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.680> technicians<00:01:17.040> how

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
important to repairs for technicians how

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.249 
important to repairs for technicians how
to<00:01:17.909> deal<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.450> some<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.630> those<00:01:18.780> differences

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
to deal with some of those differences

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.030 
to deal with some of those differences
and<00:01:20.299> again<00:01:21.299> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.930> bring<00:01:22.140> some<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.619> level

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and again kind of bring some of a level

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.100 
and again kind of bring some of a level
of<00:01:23.159> hype<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.080> different

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
of hype down that it's it's a different

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.530 
of hype down that it's it's a different
substrate<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.490> it's<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.240> end<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
substrate but it's not the end of the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.510 
substrate but it's not the end of the
world<00:01:27.720> when<00:01:28.290> we<00:01:28.380> start<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.740> work<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.040> aluminum

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
world when we start to work on aluminum

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
world when we start to work on aluminum
that<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> shops<00:01:30.390> will<00:01:30.720> will<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.500> through<00:01:31.710> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that the shops will will go through that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.100 
that the shops will will go through that
learning<00:01:32.220> curve<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:32.909> eventually<00:01:33.210> it'll<00:01:33.930> be

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
learning curve but eventually it'll be

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.530 
learning curve but eventually it'll be
an<00:01:34.229> easy<00:01:34.409> process<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.790> one<00:01:35.939> demonstration

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
an easy process so the one demonstration

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.640 
an easy process so the one demonstration
I<00:01:36.810> did<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.710> show<00:01:37.740> how<00:01:38.720> aluminum<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:40.500> be

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
I did was to show how aluminum can be

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.700 
I did was to show how aluminum can be
easily<00:01:40.890> miss<00:01:41.610> shapen<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.409> panels<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.590> be

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
easily miss shapen or panels can be

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.490 
easily miss shapen or panels can be
destroyed<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.520> proper<00:01:45.149> repair<00:01:46.049> techniques

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
destroyed if proper repair techniques

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.740 
destroyed if proper repair techniques
are<00:01:46.680> not<00:01:46.799> used<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> did<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.180> took<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
are not used so what I did is I took a a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899 
are not used so what I did is I took a a
small<00:01:49.290> piece<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.619> an<00:01:49.860> aluminum<00:01:50.220> coupon<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
small piece of an aluminum coupon and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.780 
small piece of an aluminum coupon and
placed<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.899> metal<00:01:52.170> dolly<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.920> then<00:01:53.520> took

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
placed it on a metal dolly and then took

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.240 
placed it on a metal dolly and then took
a<00:01:53.939> hammer<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.509> hammered<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.710> to

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
a hammer and hammered right on to the to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.560 
a hammer and hammered right on to the to
the<00:01:56.340> aluminum<00:01:56.759> panel<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> dolly

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the aluminum panel with the dolly

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.050 
the aluminum panel with the dolly
directly<00:01:58.229> behind<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.399> happens<00:01:59.790> when<00:01:59.969> you

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
directly behind it what happens when you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.670 
directly behind it what happens when you
do<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> aluminum

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
do that is because of the aluminum

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.280 
do that is because of the aluminum
softer<00:02:02.250> material<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> actually<00:02:03.180> stretch<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
softer material it actually stretch and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.039 
softer material it actually stretch and
kind<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.590> pancake<00:02:04.860> out<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.670> coupon<00:02:06.210> where

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
kind of pancake out that coupon where

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.249 
kind of pancake out that coupon where
when<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.740> when<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.390> go<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.450> bend<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.929> it'll

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
when you when you go to bend that it'll

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
when you when you go to bend that it'll
have<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:10.530> oil<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.280> there<00:02:11.430> will<00:02:11.700> pop

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
have an oil can in there will pop

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
have an oil can in there will pop
paavo<00:02:12.660> because<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.290> material<00:02:13.739> has

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
paavo because that material has

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.610 
paavo because that material has
stretched<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.599> proper<00:02:15.959> technique<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.500> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
stretched so the proper technique is to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.470 
stretched so the proper technique is to
use<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.950> dolly<00:02:17.160> next<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.879> repair<00:02:18.269> area

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
use the dolly next to the repair area

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600 
use the dolly next to the repair area
instead<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.140> directly<00:02:19.590> behind<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:20.129> so<00:02:20.489> that

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
instead of directly behind it so that

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.699 
instead of directly behind it so that
was<00:02:20.700> my<00:02:20.819> demonstration<00:02:21.480> today<00:02:21.629> so<00:02:22.349> that<00:02:22.590> was

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
was my demonstration today so that was

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.770 
was my demonstration today so that was
the<00:02:22.860> summary<00:02:23.190> for<00:02:23.430> today's<00:02:23.670> program<00:02:23.910> hope

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
the summary for today's program hope

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.590 
the summary for today's program hope
everybody<00:02:25.140> enjoyed<00:02:25.440> it
