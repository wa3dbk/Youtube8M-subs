00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello and welcome to the fast 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.540
 gaming de dark as you know 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.130
 I do not really like that because I do not like it 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.630
 The keyboard is playing a razer naga 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 wanted core edition 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.420
 I think that's 2012 edition and me 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 I wanted to change now 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.740
 enhance the razer the new 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.390
 razer keyboard black window with the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.910
 I already own horny keys sound 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.940
 And now I have the mouse razer 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 naga 2013 edition or 14 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.120
 I am not by any means any more 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.309
 the latest also brought with these 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 mechanical buttons and I will 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.110
 whole now unpack for you a lot 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.989
 fun so i just want it all now 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.120
 just plain and out of this 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.109
 packaging and value here a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.890
 drive around a bit as always wonderful 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.719
 packed what is called here as always 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.110
 Of course we have the end product 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.110
 the razer naga with the accustomed 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.350
 usual usb connection there we come 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.350
 right now and then we have it with us 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:25.409
 sticker cool what the sticker need 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.259
 and this little guide here how 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.700
 always so here we see the two now 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.960
 mice are in comparison the colors 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.520
 Of course it fits the taste 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.390
 of course the new racer edition 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.549
 Of course, there are 12 buttons on it 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.049
 on the sides we will see the same 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.460
 here is quite good that is arched and 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.259
 or inward that conveys it 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.869
 arched outside is maybe from 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.780
 handy since it's easier to get there 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.640
 the individual buttons at the new racer 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.469
 which is also a very big one 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.100
 advantage was and I also very cool 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.320
 also found it very irritable you can 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.960
 the mouse wheel to both sides 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.970
 use as an extra button of course 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.679
 on top of that too 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.110
 but this page feature still offers 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.870
 extra time 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:21.740
 Do not knot what you have here with the old one 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.910
 could do so with the older edition 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.590
 Of course we also have the pages 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.760
 buttons that are now here i have the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.380
 already that continues to use difficult 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.820
 I do not think I can get that up 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.020
 just easy to use 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.270
 That's why I just leave it that way 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.740
 Button resistance when you press one 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:44.060
 may hear it like a little one 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.160
 Mouse click is that gives the whole 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.390
 play a great feeling you know that 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.340
 one has pressed one does not press 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.730
 three times in a row or something like that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.500
 did not know exactly as taken now 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.580
 I find it super cool you have to go to the 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.350
 volume is a bit used to it 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.070
 not quite as loud as the keyboard but 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.140
 In any case, noticeable from the 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.670
 handy he will find me this year 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.400
 little smaller a bit more pleasant 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.250
 as the new razer to pick up 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.860
 So this bit chunkier found the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.270
 a little smaller here 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.070
 So it's probably good too 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.860
 matter of taste concerning the hands 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.080
 she is also a heavyweight like me 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.400
 find 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.110
 So a ticking heavy man has got up 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.040
 any case more in the hand with this 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.340
 mouse with the new racer instead of the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.280
 old from razer so final here 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:39.620
 again my conclusion almost in the dark 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.880
 From the optical ago, I find the pure 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:47.390
 razer naga molten choir 2012 edition 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.630
 just a lot of horny red is my color 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.700
 Green continues to exist between toxic 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.250
 fits the whole now but of course 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.870
 green to green from the handling of the 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.890
 Keyboards are hornier you have more 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.110
 possibilities 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.130
 she is a bit heavier than 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.470
 the other which I am not quite so good 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.630
 But found if you have the necessary change 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.470
 because the price is also quite salted 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:14.480
 I would definitely be the new one 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:18.640
 razer naga 2014 is her name now 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.870
 Indian tend to be green variant 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.520
 I hope you can with the mist here 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.050
 what do I do and I get involved 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.389
 Little help in buying one 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.139
 See you 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.139
 the fist
