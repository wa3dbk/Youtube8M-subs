around<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.110> edges<00:01:46.290> here<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.939> part<00:01:48.299> here

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
around the edges here and this part here

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
around the edges here and this part here
I<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:49.170> there's<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> gap<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.979> I've<00:01:50.070> got

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
I know there's a gap there but I've got

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.039 
I know there's a gap there but I've got
a<00:01:50.310> plan<00:01:50.579> that's<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> bridge<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.780> gap

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
a plan that's going to bridge that gap

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.590 
a plan that's going to bridge that gap
so<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> next<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.610> next<00:01:53.640> video<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.329> will<00:01:54.509> be
