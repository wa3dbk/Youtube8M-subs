00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:12.660
 It is raining from 3 cities today and how strong this rain is and when it gets stronger 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:18.840
 I want to take a closer look at what I mean 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:22.920
 First in Kyushu and is now, but I'm currently already in this manner rain reports have arrived in Kyushu 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.779
 It is in the situation of rain from early morning 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.460
 And although it has then is it all over rain would say begin to rain 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:38.820
 First of all, it's time to start raining . 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.629
 Is rain in from the other China Kyushu, Shikoku morning until around noon It is also rain Kinki 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 And moderate is also disadvantageous in the afternoon from around noon 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:52.450
 Kanto will also be released in the evening from late afternoon 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.220
 In this way, it will be raining all over Japan today in West Japan 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.550
 Ray 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:03.550
 And I would like to confirm especially the area where the rain gets stronger 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:09.700
 It is how to get off today's rain 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:12.760
 Now it will be the low pressure and front bio front that comes from these 2 deaths 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:18.450
 I think you say that of Nishikawa Kyushu air of the 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:23.570
 The low pressure is located on the southwest side, which means that it moves to the lower east. 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.750
 I expect to pass near the southern part of Kyushu in this way 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.030
 So it's especially close to the low pressure 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:40.840
 And in the area where strong moist air flows into this tea ceremony 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:43.899
 It is said that the more southern areas of Kyushu and Shikoku Pacific gold area the rain gets stronger 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.430
 It is the timing when the extra rain gets stronger 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.800
 Note name 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:53.080
 I think this is the situation 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.460
 It is likely to be around lunch in southern Kyushu Kagoshima and Miyazaki 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.659
 And 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:05.170
 It is the Pacific side mainly in Kochi Prefecture in Shikoku, but around the evening is here. 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:06.040
 And likely to be referred to as rain rather strongly from the key fan and south at night 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.130
 is 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:14.450
 It is the strength of the rain, but it seems like a daunting way to go down like 50 mm in an hour 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:20.480
 There are also places where it rains 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.069
 That's right, so I would like you to be alert to landslides and other disasters along the road floods and mountains 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.999
 I will 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:33.450
 It became quite heavy rain the other day in Kyushu, but this time compared to the rain two days ago 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:39.209
 Strong fall time are seeing would not so long 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.840
 It is not a situation where heavy rain continues, but it will be likely to fall hard in a short time 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.800
 is 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.849
 But we would like to see a little in the final amount of rain 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:54.860
 Yes here it seems to be quite many in the southern part of Kyushu 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:58.310
 It is expected that there will be a place with more than 100 mm . 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:04.040
 It will be said that there are many places, but especially this 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:08.110
 This area is expected to be quite many, but there are quite a lot of Kagoshima prefectures 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.400
 Places that exceed 100 mm are also likely to come out 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:19.330
 In particular, Kagoshima Miyazaki in southern Kyushu It is the place of today by say 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:20.980
 And after the evening, we watch for quite heavy rain even in Kochi prefecture and the southern part of Wakayama prefecture. 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.260
 I would like to receive 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.840
 It is likely to be accompanied by lightning 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.840
 I mentioned above about today's strong rain
