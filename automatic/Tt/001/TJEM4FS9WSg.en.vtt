key<00:00:06.990> signatures<00:00:07.560> are<00:00:07.799> kind<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.160> like

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
key signatures are kind of like

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.480 
key signatures are kind of like
multiplication<00:00:09.540> tables<00:00:10.070> there<00:00:11.070> are<00:00:11.219> tricks

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
multiplication tables there are tricks

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.580 
multiplication tables there are tricks
for<00:00:11.759> figuring<00:00:12.150> them<00:00:12.330> out<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.750> I'm<00:00:13.349> going<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
for figuring them out and I'm going to

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.350 
for figuring them out and I'm going to
show<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.889> some<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.099> those<00:00:14.309> now<00:00:14.519> but<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.179> best

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
show you some of those now but the best

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.689 
show you some of those now but the best
way<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.660> learn<00:00:15.900> them<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.350> by<00:00:16.740> memorizing<00:00:17.520> all

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
way to learn them is by memorizing all

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.300 
way to learn them is by memorizing all
of<00:00:17.880> them<00:00:18.060> by<00:00:18.210> rote<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.740> following<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
of them by rote the following is a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.939 
of them by rote the following is a
method<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.630> figuring<00:00:21.960> key<00:00:22.260> signatures<00:00:22.740> out

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
method for figuring key signatures out

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
method for figuring key signatures out
but<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> suggest<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.789> practice<00:00:24.119> naming<00:00:24.779> them

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
but I suggest you practice naming them

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.990 
but I suggest you practice naming them
over<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.380> over<00:00:25.590> until<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.340> don't<00:00:26.580> need<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
over and over until you don't need this

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.750 
over and over until you don't need this
method<00:00:27.390> anymore<00:00:28.519> sharps<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.670> key

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you're in by going to the last sharp and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.390 
you're in by going to the last sharp and
then<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.700> half<00:01:08.970> step<00:01:09.799> let's<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.979> an<00:01:11.100> example

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
then up a half step let's do an example

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.469 
then up a half step let's do an example
with<00:01:11.610> one<00:01:11.880> sharp<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.830> sharp<00:01:14.479> we

allow us again to start a song or a
scale<00:02:23.260> on<00:02:23.560> E<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.250> keep<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.090> major<00:02:25.510> sound<00:02:26.430> let's

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
scale on E and keep a major sound let's

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.449 
scale on E and keep a major sound let's
first<00:02:27.730> play<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.240> scale<00:02:28.420> an<00:02:28.840> E<00:02:29.680> scale<00:02:29.980> without

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
first play this scale an E scale without

first play this scale an E scale without
the<00:02:31.000> four<00:02:31.240> sharps<00:02:31.600> so<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.959> hear<00:02:32.170> what

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the four sharps so you can hear what

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.700 
the four sharps so you can hear what
that<00:02:32.320> sounds<00:02:32.860> like

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.710 

now<00:02:40.710> listen<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> same<00:02:41.700> scale<00:02:42.120> with<00:02:42.450> four

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
now listen to the same scale with four

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960 
now listen to the same scale with four
sharps<00:02:43.140> notice<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.400> notes<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.850> staff

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
sharps notice the notes on the staff

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.260 
sharps notice the notes on the staff
won't<00:02:45.960> change<00:02:46.460> but<00:02:47.460> when<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:47.760> add<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.060> four

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
won't change but when we add the four

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.660 
won't change but when we add the four
sharps<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.720> key<00:02:48.810> signature<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:50.280> notes<00:02:50.490> on

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
sharps in the key signature the notes on

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.750 
sharps in the key signature the notes on
the<00:02:50.700> piano<00:02:50.910> will

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.880 

so<00:03:00.760> four<00:03:01.000> sharp<00:03:01.269> keys<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:02.440> only<00:03:02.590> need<00:03:02.769> to

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
so four sharp keys you only need to

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.130 
so four sharp keys you only need to
remember<00:03:02.980> two<00:03:03.489> things<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:04.420> order<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.900> sharps

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
remember two things the order of sharps

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.050 
remember two things the order of sharps

is FC ji Dae B fat cats go down alleys

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.020 
is FC ji Dae B fat cats go down alleys
eating<00:03:10.330> birds<00:03:11.069> and<00:03:12.069> the<00:03:12.190> second<00:03:12.819> thing<00:03:12.940> you

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
eating birds and the second thing you

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.940 
eating birds and the second thing you
need<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.209> remember<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.780> if<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.140> start<00:03:14.620> at<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
need to remember is if you start at the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.460 
need to remember is if you start at the
last<00:03:15.190> sharp<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.760> go<00:03:16.299> up<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.720> half<00:03:16.870> step<00:03:17.110> you'll

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
last sharp and go up a half step you'll

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.600 
last sharp and go up a half step you'll
find<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:18.010> key<00:03:19.860> ultimately<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.069> want<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.370> have

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
find the key ultimately you want to have

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.729 
find the key ultimately you want to have
your<00:03:21.730> key<00:03:21.910> signatures<00:03:22.390> memorized<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.680> you

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
your key signatures memorized so you

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.789 
your key signatures memorized so you
won't<00:03:24.010> have<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.310> go<00:03:24.430> through<00:03:24.459> this<00:03:24.730> process<00:03:25.060> in

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
won't have to go through this process in

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.259 
won't have to go through this process in
the<00:03:26.799> next<00:03:27.040> video<00:03:27.310> I'll<00:03:27.760> teach<00:03:28.060> you<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
the next video I'll teach you the

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.489 
the next video I'll teach you the
process<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.170> use<00:03:29.379> for<00:03:29.769> flat<00:03:30.190> keys
