warm<00:00:01.829> deck<00:00:02.070> now<00:00:02.550> worms<00:00:02.850> are<00:00:03.240> generally<00:00:03.899> just

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
warm deck now worms are generally just

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.079 
warm deck now worms are generally just
about<00:00:04.319> flip<00:00:04.589> effects<00:00:04.920> usually<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.879> standard

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
about flip effects usually the standard

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.940 
about flip effects usually the standard
builds<00:00:06.600> don't<00:00:06.839> run<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.230> many<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> cards

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
builds don't run to many of the cards

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.160 
builds don't run to many of the cards
there's<00:00:08.519> actually<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:08.970> really<00:00:09.330> lot<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.900> warm

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
there's actually a really lot of warm

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.629 
there's actually a really lot of warm
monsters<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.889> all<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.099> different<00:00:11.400> effects

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
monsters that all have different effects

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.339 
monsters that all have different effects
but<00:00:12.150> usually<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.570> just<00:00:12.750> burn<00:00:12.900> out<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> few<00:00:13.320> of

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
but usually you just burn out a few of

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.259 
but usually you just burn out a few of
them<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:13.710> make<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> neck<00:00:14.820> work<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.210> you

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
them that make the neck work and you

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.290 
them that make the neck work and you
don't<00:00:15.450> really<00:00:15.570> run<00:00:15.870> all<00:00:16.460> like<00:00:17.460> 26<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> them

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
don't really run all like 26 of them

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.359 
don't really run all like 26 of them
that<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.570> think<00:00:18.690> there<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:19.800> generally<00:00:20.220> the

that I think there are but generally the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.950 
that I think there are but generally the

graveyard and then you could set up the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
graveyard and then you could set up the
field<00:01:25.170> very<00:01:25.409> very<00:01:25.619> easily<00:01:25.799> which<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.610> very

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
field very very easily which is very

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
field very very easily which is very
nice<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> then<00:01:27.420> once<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.780> he's<00:01:28.080> once<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
nice and then once the he's once the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.649 
nice and then once the he's once the
Aegon's<00:01:29.100> flip<00:01:29.310> face-up<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:30.000> X<00:01:30.360> can't<00:01:30.600> be

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
Aegon's flip face-up as X can't be

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.270 
Aegon's flip face-up as X can't be
destroyed<00:01:31.020> by<00:01:31.170> battle<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.189> gonna

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
destroyed by battle so you're gonna
