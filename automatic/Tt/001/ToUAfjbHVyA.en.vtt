00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.410
 one of the most exciting novelties thriller Werz it three it is a gate like one 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.929
 added a complete Ajax framework called porridge 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.320
 the exciting thing about this is that you basically have no source code 1 6 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.529
 Add commands approx 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.580
 find this at properties who above under "insert" Spock I would like 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.970
 now Ghana from my currently quite normal html page a wide page 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:28.509
 First you have to do at least no lizard Melda three 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:30.590
 I will open it once shortly 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.429
 In principle, it contains four different datasets 

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:34.650
 called data 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.710
 then a title production a short description 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.770
 and a legend and image that repeats itself four times second 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.100
 Tip from production 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.050
 Image description and so on a very simple Dieter Melzer 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.930
 Now, instead of that, you want to be here 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.440
 four single Battenberg and then a new page lives 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.620
 that you press on the buttons automatically from Dexheim Ehlert 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.530
 have your own budget if you are here in the content immediately 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.980
 the current content gets displayed without a new one 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.960
 Page must be loaded 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.690
 Let's just have three buttons that we first open 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.900
 no longer need any case 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.740
 I like the leftover button now 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.810
 and here again sure that I had selected the entire left 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.159
 Difference is the following 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.689
 in a short we usually double-click in the split view or 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.320
 just mark the link 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.090
 one sees 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.579
 that not all the source code belongs to your chosen one in Berlin 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.109
 actually not selected 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.740
 That's why I kick once here fiscal area org Red 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.520
 and with that becomes 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.079
 the entire left selected 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.979
 you have to be first thing 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.929
 my side the Ex RTL file to assign 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.880
 this is done by saying here 1 9 2 x ml record I add 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.460
 In principle, the data records are designated by the abbreviation DS and afterwards 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.190
 simply through community 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.729
 We would search here 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.100
 and who now so Thater points out xml file 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.370
 click OK l 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.920
 and call out the schema of the xml files here we now see our boot scheme 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.969
 we see more records data comfort therefore sends every plus 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.770
 And every Clément data consists of three lower lands entitled Fortune 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.830
 seemed and image 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.239
 Title and the kölschen 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.959
 Data remains of the type is pushing 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:12.859
 my image 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:16.689
 is not a data chip went but such a picture on the left so I turn this here 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.140
 above 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.939
 so that later indicates that he goes in here a picture and not the text 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.119
 that would just turn me in my side 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:25.849
 Ash p 2 standing her post-punk jetpack 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.389
 I am always a little mistake I make data from who I am here 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.119
 above, that Zeil element should be repeated 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:35.399
 Now and then I want image and put it entirely on BT Group 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.010
 That was initially first steps can appeal now year before shocked 19 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.130
 we have production description text on image and the whole 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.449
 repeats itself four times 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.389
 click OK confirms the whole confirm again so now opens in the 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.079
 application-oriented 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.650
 Auletta ligature here 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.079
 my dad has been 1 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.040
 in the data z 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.280
 and here headlined Sketchen and Image and various groups Köln Roadies 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.039
 assigned 

00:02:58.039 --> 00:03:01.850
 I've even selected my total percent here 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.370
 and this I would like to replace first now 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.809
 «I say here Hechtner 90 at range insert 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:08.550
 in fact 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.060
 a normal range Kinda Teilbereich also come later 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.939
 click on OK 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.519
 and say now 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.619
 want to insert one at table 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.180
 in the broader balls 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.910
 I dont want me luck and not the picture either 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.580
 but only have the title 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.110
 and I really like that when you click on the title 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.009
 he sees partial area when kicking is updated 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.679
 Catena® with these features back on okay and we see here now 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.589
 a small table is inserted 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:37.499
 the table formatting nevertheless we go in the normal way in the 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.840
 Properties year set cell replenishment and center to zero 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.739
 Of course you could do that better with CSS 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.790
 and I would like to delete the title line that I need 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.329
 Not 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.659
 So kicking is easy 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.549
 and kindle Willy 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.989
 I left the source code open at the same time there we now see 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.470
 have added a Breivik Chen in this 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.130
 Find a table and for each table row will be 1 at Olympique 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.119
 Give command 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:08.240
 in principle, our site would work now who save once 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.419
 and then put 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.529
 the center will automatically come the annual fee transparent data and x pass 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.570
 and they are needed around this whole 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.739
 Ajax commands execute them now 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.780
 the two elements were here our times to it would be in principle 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.759
 already the memory works the whole we look at it in the times 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:26.689
 Preview 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:28.810
 we are still right here and pre-assembled 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.810
 the four entries production post production visual effects 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.560
 Now I would like to do the formatting here but also reasonable 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:35.939
 to have 

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:37.639
 this one means the following 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.960
 I open my page in which I have already done the design 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.789
 but I still have a downhill here 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.229
 Clever Westring I would have the whole so the link I here 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.040
 have marked 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.990
 Unfortunately, I did not quit the clipboard 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.129
 I'll just do that now 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.759
 we copy and paste it here instead of the title here again 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.240
 Control v 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.280
 I have it back, so to speak 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.539
 my formatting 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.330
 but I want now that she is not static production but 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.870
 instead the title 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.089
 Winners abroad data z the title 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:09.440
 click on insert 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.620
 and now we also have the sensible formatting that we do 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.860
 whole again in the browser 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.909
 we now see our 4 left here 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:20.620
 Of course, when you click on a link, we also open one of the sections 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:22.300
 That was not happening yet 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.449
 because we do not have one yet 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:25.539
 Subsections supplied 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.879
 I have it down here on the left side 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.589
 already added a test detects and this Act meets I want later 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:34.240
 say he saw that part of the picture 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.480
 have more than just retake and say a new spider is enough 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.140
 This time we will not be the type normal range but the subrange 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.599
 so that two proves after 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.639
 who should apply here the additional details depending on 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.510
 click on which link 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.729
 the banger Focke 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:53.029
 and here I can add content for example my picture 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:55.319
 Insert Kicker Images Location 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.740
 and next to the image 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.860
 Now I want my description and maybe still formal title in the first 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.940
 let's say the title here 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.700
 and after the title 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.520
 Let's add the description 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.879
 insert and disconnect the whole thing 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:10.249
 easy here 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:11.530
 through a break 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.749
 and our titles we still mark 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:14.960
 and introduce them here 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.089
 construction 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:19.110
 so the whole thing could be nice, for example 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.810
 Storage media page again and call again 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.340
 in the browser and see there our first entry Production click here 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.990
 post-production of the second application until July Facts and 3d animation the last one 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.779
 Hand on 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:35.649
 and all this we see here without a browser refresh actually giving it live 

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:38.649
 Spy speak Eltex 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.289
 and the nice thing we did not write a piece of source code and 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.830
 at some point to thrill time again on the many other two 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.150
 Enter function 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.730
 here, accordions can be written palettes with tabs menu bars 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.690
 Jamie collapsible pallets 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.800
 There are two check boxes 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.889
 The text areas there is check for coloring 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.940
 for text fields and so on for tables repeat lists the leg 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.550
 changed is a complete Feinberg for in Jacks and so they can 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.830
 do very many things without really going into the source code 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.399
 have to 

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:16.360
 the source code becomes and two cases are automatically updated with
