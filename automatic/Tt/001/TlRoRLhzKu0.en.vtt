like I said Wikipedia of bikes Carson
see<00:03:28.950> we've<00:03:29.070> got<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> digital<00:03:29.640> gauge<00:03:30.080> all<00:03:31.080> of

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
see we've got a digital gauge all of

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.200 
see we've got a digital gauge all of
your<00:03:31.410> instrumentation<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.670> right<00:03:32.820> there<00:03:33.060> and

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
your instrumentation is right there and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.000 
your instrumentation is right there and
then<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.660> press<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.990> start<00:03:34.230> button<00:03:34.260> the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
then if you press the start button the

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.980 
then if you press the start button the
motor<00:03:35.250> will<00:03:35.430> start

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.190 

I<00:03:41.020> like<00:03:41.590> a<00:03:41.620> class<00:03:41.920> that's<00:03:42.640> cool<00:03:42.930> you<00:03:43.930> know<00:03:43.990> why

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200

it's<00:03:44.380> facing<00:03:44.770> that<00:03:44.860> direction<00:03:45.660> for<00:03:46.660> a

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
it's facing that direction for a

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.650 
it's facing that direction for a
military<00:03:47.110> bike<00:03:47.650> or<00:03:47.950> for<00:03:48.190> military<00:03:48.580> flag<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
military bike or for military flag the
