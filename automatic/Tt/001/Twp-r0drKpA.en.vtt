00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hello everyone for those who still do not know me 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.890
 now pretty cold and 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.340
 general so every sneeze we were all there 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.990
 we all know how it all happens and the general 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.599
 I decided to make such a video for you. 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.690
 how to change during a cold 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.270
 especially if you have some business and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.880
 need to look more or less decent in 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 Generally what I do to more or less 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.349
 make yourself look like god 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.570
 so we are going and will be at home now 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 put in order the first thing that I will 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.219
 use this mask under the eyes from 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.200
 just want to remove green glow 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.379
 swelling because the eyes are very 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.940
 severely swell become red and 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:44.280
 also do not forget about other sites 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.850
 our lips are very dry 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.550
 is always 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.379
 and my hands dry terribly so I 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.289
 always use some cream checks 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.870
 lotion checks that's the same i recommend 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.789
 take some strong remedy for 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.949
 runny nose to firstly 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.859
 feels more or less normal during 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.750
 the time of that couple of hours and secondly not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.909
 spoil the makeup that we do and 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.720
 the rest of the time while the mask works 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.520
 I'm sitting here playing the iPad 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.680
 so proceed to make up the first thing that I 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.250
 I will do this preparing spray 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.009
 on our 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.290
 it's like a spray primer and I'm on 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.720
 I take a tonal basis and quite at all 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.360
 quite baby and and put to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 just to even out the tone of my face i'm not 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 I will disguise anything because it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.860
 doesn't make sense just need to align 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.100
 the tone of the face and here 's our concealer too 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.390
 even tone of the face is already 50 percent 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.869
 a healthy-looking concealer under eye 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.000
 I shade it all very well and 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.360
 Now we will move on to the next one. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.340
 stage 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.270
 I also like to draw a little bit 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 your eyebrows 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 it's not necessary but I still love 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.340
 so they were let's say so beautiful form 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.850
 so Iâ€™m going to draw a little bit of them 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 and of course I put something like that 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.810
 corrective on century because century u 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.760
 me and on their own with PR managers a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.560
 the time of illness is generally very red and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 until it's all later 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 swim did not swim I jumped it all 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.489
 also spray to fix the makeup believe 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.860
 eyes i will play with my new 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.349
 a palette of spirit and wall brushes 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.930
 Sedona Lace, who recently arrived to me 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.140
 and honestly tell you i would probably 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.540
 the time of a cold would have left my eyes alone 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.330
 but since I wanted to play 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.489
 just with my novelties I decided everything 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.030
 and try to see how I apply 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.819
 the shadows 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.430
 I chose a shade of champagne he 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.350
 pretty peaceful and put it in 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.480
 mostly not just for ages and yet in 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.700
 corner of the eye it will make our eyes 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.830
 as rested as possible and took 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.440
 the lightest matte shade which 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.140
 was in a palette and put it on now but in 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.250
 fold of the century is unequivocally if you have eyes 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.370
 watery 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.920
 or just feeling badly swollen 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.690
 then leave your eyes at all alone 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.090
 especially now summer and you can just 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.370
 put on glasses and still nobody nothing 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.730
 will see 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.250
 I also apply the same shade 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.459
 lower eyelid the same brush by the way do 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.150
 it's quite comfortable it is small and 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.160
 very soft not irritating eyes 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.870
 light such a shade 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.819
 haze 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.799
 eyes I pencil la corte 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.190
 because it is quite solid and at the same 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.739
 time resistant some kind of fat 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.480
 cream gel pencils i'm into it 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.310
 I don't want to use time because 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.400
 most likely everything will slip me 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.720
 and this pencil is great if 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.120
 for you it's a bust 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.730
 again do not finish this 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.280
 my mascara make up and let's pay 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.709
 moment of attention to my facial expression 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.810
 serial killer and only we collapsing not 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.170
 writhing while doing makeup 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.799
 it's just a nightmare but just a couple more 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.810
 seconds 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.290
 and we will go to the powder I will 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.350
 use powder gully brush too from 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.530
 sedona lace she was so mega blue was 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:17.940
 it was so nice to wear this powder to her 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:22.169
 and powder then I put under the eyes fasten 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.120
 this way concealer on the nose and also i 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.730
 Now I will put it on my forehead and 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.920
 chin are those places that 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.150
 on which I have enlarged pores 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.520
 this powder perfectly removes them visually and 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.200
 just creates this too fresh radiant 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.260
 kind of person she is very me for this 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.300
 like also I will not use 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.630
 Bronzer I turn to rouge chose 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.360
 the kingdom of benefit and put them 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.050
 up the cheekbones quite a bit again 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.450
 it is a shining product so further that we have 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.000
 It was lip gloss I chose a very such 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.240
 comfortable to wear shine this niks 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.800
 barry white eye by the way all products 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.380
 which I used I write 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.530
 necessarily below therefore look 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.380
 if something was interested there and put 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.730
 this brilliance he's pretty comfortable in 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.770
 sock is not nasty does not spread 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.660
 quite a bit sticky rather even such 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.100
 not sticky 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.170
 gel well, in general, then chose him and 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.510
 I was pleased here so I 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.960
 changed her face and now stayed 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.450
 outfit look today i will be like this 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.300
 So I chose a light shirt 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.120
 shorts so it was not hot 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.540
 comfortable here is such a necklace 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.190

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.190
 hung another bracelet 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.940
 well, that's all, so here I look 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.770
 option after unless of course cough and 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.590
 runny nose it could be said that I 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.360
