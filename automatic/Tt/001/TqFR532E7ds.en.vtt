pretty intense because it's twice the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.679 
pretty intense because it's twice the
resolution<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.659> 1080p<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.909> LG<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.510> gonna

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
resolution of 1080p and the LG is gonna

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.660 
resolution of 1080p and the LG is gonna
have<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:10.680> event<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.880> May<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.010> 27th<00:01:14.010> that's

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
have one event on May the 27th that's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.130 
have one event on May the 27th that's
actually<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> hit<00:01:15.420> before<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:15.900> birthday

kind<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> layout<00:01:55.070> as<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> LG<00:01:56.579> g2<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.960> volume

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
kind of layout as the LG g2 with volume

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.590 
kind of layout as the LG g2 with volume
up<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.860> down<00:01:59.040> keys<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.759> like<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> power<00:02:00.360> button

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
on the back there I can only assume that

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
on the back there I can only assume that
there's<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.700> power<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.390> button<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.840> middle

there's a power on button in the middle

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.200 
there's a power on button in the middle
and<00:02:04.170> also<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.310> camera<00:02:05.549> they're<00:02:05.820> very<00:02:06.060> very

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.499 
and also the camera they're very very
cool<00:02:06.479> nice<00:02:06.780> design

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
cool nice design

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.940 
cool nice design
don't<00:02:08.689> have<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:08.959> front<00:02:09.229> side<00:02:09.439> leak<00:02:09.679> though

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
don't have the front side leak though

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.240 
don't have the front side leak though
but<00:02:10.220> may<00:02:10.459> 27th<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.269> think<00:02:11.450> it's<00:02:11.569> almost<00:02:12.349> just<00:02:12.680> 19

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
but may 27th I think it's almost just 19

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
with the 5.5 inch qHD display are you

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.800 
with the 5.5 inch qHD display are you
looking<00:02:24.650> forward<00:02:24.860> to<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.159> and<00:02:25.629> it<00:02:26.629> will

looking forward to it and it will

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.420 
looking forward to it and it will
basically<00:02:27.079> be<00:02:27.379> a<00:02:27.409> pixel<00:02:27.950> density<00:02:28.370> pix<00:02:28.760> PPI<00:02:29.180> of

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
basically be a pixel density pix PPI of

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.809 
basically be a pixel density pix PPI of
534<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:32.180> is<00:02:32.360> pretty<00:02:32.720> insane<00:02:33.489> but<00:02:34.489> it<00:02:34.579> will<00:02:34.670> be

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
534 that is pretty insane but it will be

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.819 
534 that is pretty insane but it will be
pretty<00:02:34.940> cool<00:02:35.299> and<00:02:35.629> smaller<00:02:36.049> rumors<00:02:36.470> also
