code the good news is you don't actually
have<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.759> know<00:01:59.880> anything<00:02:00.119> about<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.899> code<00:02:01.170> or

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
have to know anything about the code or

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.789 
have to know anything about the code or
what<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.649> means<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> fix<00:02:03.680> what<00:02:04.680> you're

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
what it means to do the fix what you're

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.039 
what it means to do the fix what you're
going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:04.950> look<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> code<00:02:06.450> where

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
going to look for is in the code where

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.219 
going to look for is in the code where
you<00:02:07.229> see<00:02:07.469> version<00:02:08.280> equals<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.750> number

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
you see version equals and then a number

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.470 
you see version equals and then a number
in<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.619> case<00:02:10.679> it's<00:02:11.069> three<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:12.150> may<00:02:12.300> not

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
in this case it's three it may not

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.520 
in this case it's three it may not
always<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.810> three

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
always be three

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.500 
always be three
you<00:02:13.680> want<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:13.890> find<00:02:14.100> where<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.400> says<00:02:14.510> version

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you want to find where it says version

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.510 
you want to find where it says version
equals<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.380> number<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.160> I'm<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.400> do

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
equals that number so I'm going to do

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.190 
equals that number so I'm going to do
version<00:02:17.940> equals<00:02:18.209> three<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.990> what<00:02:19.110> I'm

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
version equals three and what I'm

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.240 
version equals three and what I'm
actually<00:02:19.319> going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:19.950> I'm<00:02:20.069> going<00:02:20.100> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
actually going to do is I'm going to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.150 
actually going to do is I'm going to
place<00:02:20.640> my<00:02:20.670> cursor<00:02:21.050> behind<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.590> I'm<00:02:23.010> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
place my cursor behind that and I'm the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.790 
place my cursor behind that and I'm the
delete<00:02:23.490> version<00:02:24.120> equals<00:02:24.540> three<00:02:24.959> out<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.319> this

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
delete version equals three out of this

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.130 
delete version equals three out of this
code<00:02:26.069> now<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.940> should<00:02:27.150> be<00:02:27.180> there<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> second

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
code now it should be there in a second

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.960 
code now it should be there in a second
place<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.830> come<00:02:29.040> down<00:02:29.069> here<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.520> see<00:02:29.880> it

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
place so if I come down here I see it

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.440 
place so if I come down here I see it
again

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
again

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.760 
again
so<00:02:30.959> I'm<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.170> go<00:02:31.290> ahead<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.680> I'm<00:02:31.739> going

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.920 
so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going
to<00:02:31.920> delete<00:02:32.220> out<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:32.640> code<00:02:32.940> again<00:02:32.970> version

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
to delete out that code again version

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.440 
to delete out that code again version
equals<00:02:34.800> three<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.580> going<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.819> be<00:02:35.910> deleted<00:02:38.450> okay

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
equals three is going to be deleted okay

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.900 
equals three is going to be deleted okay
and<00:02:39.690> now<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.530> I've<00:02:40.620> taken<00:02:40.830> those<00:02:41.340> two<00:02:41.700> things

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
and now that I've taken those two things

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.400 
and now that I've taken those two things
out<00:02:42.180> I'm<00:02:42.480> going<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.690> go<00:02:42.780> ahead<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.200> click
