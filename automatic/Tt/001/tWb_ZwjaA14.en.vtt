camera go check it's focused in okay and

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.959 
camera go check it's focused in okay and
it's<00:00:09.540> not<00:00:09.690> too<00:00:09.809> bad<00:00:10.910> and<00:00:11.910> I'm<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.110> do

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
he is have a series of Hexbug banana

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.050 
he is have a series of Hexbug banana
break<00:00:19.289> sweet<00:00:19.500> bugs<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.100> stop<00:00:20.490> bugs<00:00:20.760> race

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
break sweet bugs and stop bugs race

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.810 
break sweet bugs and stop bugs race
around<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.449> very<00:00:21.539> simple<00:00:21.900> track<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.670> I'm<00:00:23.670> going

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
around a very simple track and I'm going

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.790 
around a very simple track and I'm going
to<00:00:23.880> let<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.090> see<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.600> they<00:00:24.810> behave<00:00:24.869> close-up

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to let you see how they behave close-up

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
to let you see how they behave close-up
so<00:00:26.010> what<00:00:26.160> we've<00:00:26.279> got<00:00:26.400> first<00:00:26.640> up<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.480> complex

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
so what we've got first up are a complex

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.939 
so what we've got first up are a complex

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.950 
bug nano Raceway bugs with battery
covers<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.270> their<00:00:33.420> battery<00:00:33.750> cover

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
covers so this is their battery cover

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.069 
covers so this is their battery cover
legs<00:00:35.180> okay<00:00:36.180> we<00:00:36.480> just<00:00:36.510> pulled<00:00:36.750> them<00:00:37.050> through

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079

monorail a book with legs get these two
not<00:01:40.850> more<00:01:41.560> but<00:01:42.560> that<00:01:42.680> was<00:01:42.800> solid<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:44.509> then

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
not more but that was solid and then

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.229 

it's<00:02:16.069> gonna<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.400> pretty<00:02:16.640> much<00:02:16.819> impossible<00:02:17.030> to

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
it's gonna be pretty much impossible to

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.920 
it's gonna be pretty much impossible to
keep<00:02:17.390> both<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.959> shot<00:02:18.410> once<00:02:19.160> they<00:02:19.400> yeah<00:02:19.930> stem

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
keep both in shot once they yeah stem

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.449 
the table with a hex bugs bugs run down
that<00:02:35.120> straight<00:02:35.450> really<00:02:35.750> well<00:02:36.370> because<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
that straight really well because the

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.080 
that straight really well because the
register<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.120> then<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:40.370> front<00:02:40.640> P<00:02:40.730> pop<00:02:40.940> of

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.340 
register and then the front P pop of
them<00:02:41.209> through<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.570> snake<00:02:41.810> it's<00:02:42.019> like<00:02:42.170> a<00:02:42.200> good

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
them through the snake it's like a good

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.850 
them through the snake it's like a good
chance<00:02:42.640> through<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.730> snaking<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:48.290> much<00:02:48.500> more

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
chance through the snaking so much more

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.160 
chance through the snaking so much more
quiet<00:02:49.220> much<00:02:49.790> more<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.000> typical<00:02:50.450> sound<00:02:50.600> expert

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
quiet much more the typical sound expert

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.289 
quiet much more the typical sound expert
makes<00:02:51.430> because<00:02:52.430> without<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.880> raceway<00:02:53.239> you

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
makes because without the raceway you

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.120 
makes because without the raceway you
like<00:02:53.540> legs<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:56.090> don't<00:02:56.359> have<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.769> same<00:02:57.920> kind

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
like legs you don't have the same kind

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.610 
like legs you don't have the same kind
of<00:02:58.160> noise<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.269> get<00:02:59.480> from<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.019> battery

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
of noise that you get from the battery

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.390 
of noise that you get from the battery
compartment<00:03:01.220> legs<00:03:02.530> get<00:03:03.530> your<00:03:03.739> right<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.190> tap

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
compartment legs get your right to tap

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.280 
compartment legs get your right to tap
tap<00:03:04.670> sound<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.030> can<00:03:05.180> hear<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.600> actually<00:03:06.079> the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
tap sound you can hear is actually the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.860 
tap sound you can hear is actually the
shrouds<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.000> boats<00:03:08.209> vibrate<00:03:08.750> hit<00:03:09.410> sides

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
shrouds as the boats vibrate hit sides

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.930 
shrouds as the boats vibrate hit sides
but<00:03:11.870> otherwise<00:03:12.109> that's<00:03:12.769> pretty

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
but otherwise that's pretty
