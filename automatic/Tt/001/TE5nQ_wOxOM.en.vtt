using the vacuum vacuum tester for

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.409 
using the vacuum vacuum tester for
bleeding<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:11.059> cooling<00:00:11.480> system<00:00:13.240> works<00:00:14.240> really

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
bleeding the cooling system works really

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.359 
bleeding the cooling system works really
well

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:15.369 
well

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:18.070 
well
hook<00:00:16.369> up<00:00:16.550> the<00:00:16.640> shop<00:00:16.880> errors<00:00:17.240> regulate<00:00:17.720> it<00:00:17.840> I

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
hook up the shop errors regulate it I

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.630 
hook up the shop errors regulate it I
usually<00:00:18.980> put<00:00:19.340> it<00:00:19.370> up<00:00:19.520> right<00:00:19.820> at<00:00:20.510> the<00:00:20.540> full<00:00:20.840> mark

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
usually put it up right at the full mark

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.310 
usually put it up right at the full mark
with<00:00:22.640> a<00:00:24.070> coolant<00:00:25.070> into<00:00:25.250> saltwater<00:00:25.760> and<00:00:26.570> what

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
with a coolant into saltwater and what

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.239 
with a coolant into saltwater and what
it<00:00:27.410> does<00:00:27.560> is<00:00:27.770> it<00:00:28.210> brings<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:29.390> this<00:00:29.480> vacuum<00:00:29.870> and

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:33.249 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:35.439 

once<00:00:34.249> you<00:00:34.339> get<00:00:34.429> that<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:34.789> can<00:00:34.850> see<00:00:35.089> how<00:00:35.300> much

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
once you get that you can see how much

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.520 
once you get that you can see how much
vacuum<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.199> have

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.740 

so<00:00:42.070> what's<00:00:42.640> under<00:00:42.910> backing<00:00:43.270> sucks<00:00:43.570> all<00:00:43.720> the

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
so what's under backing sucks all the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.100 
so what's under backing sucks all the
air<00:00:43.990> out<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.350> cooling<00:00:44.620> system<00:00:45.630> and<00:00:46.630> as<00:00:46.960> you

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
air out of the cooling system and as you

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.280 
air out of the cooling system and as you
sit<00:00:47.440> and<00:00:47.590> see<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:49.239> hose<00:00:49.480> is<00:00:49.840> completely

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
sit and see the hose is completely

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.650 
sit and see the hose is completely
collapsed<00:00:54.180> there<00:00:55.180> you<00:00:55.270> go

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
collapsed there you go

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.740 
collapsed there you go
so<00:00:56.530> it's<00:00:56.680> sucking<00:00:56.950> all<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.160> air<00:00:57.489> out<00:00:57.910> and<00:01:00.750> then

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
so it's sucking all the air out and then

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.939 
so it's sucking all the air out and then
sometimes<00:01:02.110> you'll<00:01:02.230> see<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.470> air<00:01:02.559> bubbles

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
sometimes you'll see the air bubbles

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.530 
sometimes you'll see the air bubbles
coming<00:01:03.190> up<00:01:03.900> so<00:01:05.729> other<00:01:06.729> that's<00:01:07.000> pretty<00:01:07.210> much<00:01:07.300> it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
coming up so other that's pretty much it

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.870 
coming up so other that's pretty much it
and<00:01:07.900> then<00:01:08.320> usually<00:01:08.770> what<00:01:09.040> I<00:01:09.100> do<00:01:09.190> is<00:01:09.280> release<00:01:09.729> it

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
and then usually what I do is release it

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.080 
and then usually what I do is release it
from<00:01:09.970> here<00:01:10.240> slowly

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:24.890 

see<00:01:16.659> it<00:01:16.750> drop<00:01:16.960> down

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.110 

there<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:26.050> go<00:01:26.410> so<00:01:26.980> it<00:01:27.070> was<00:01:27.250> at<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.520> max<00:01:27.760> mark

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
there you go so it was at the max mark

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.480 
there you go so it was at the max mark
and<00:01:28.990> dropped<00:01:29.980> maybe<00:01:31.410> about<00:01:32.410> an<00:01:32.530> inch<00:01:32.680> so

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
and dropped maybe about an inch so

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.190 
and dropped maybe about an inch so
that's<00:01:33.790> what<00:01:34.030> your<00:01:34.120> error<00:01:34.300> who<00:01:34.450> was<00:01:34.630> in<00:01:34.780> system

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
that's what your error who was in system

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.380 
that's what your error who was in system
no<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.860> don't<00:01:36.490> have<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.670> go<00:01:36.790> and<00:01:36.940> drive<00:01:37.150> and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
no I don't have to go and drive and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.150 
no I don't have to go and drive and
bleed<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.870> stuff<00:01:38.020> like<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.350> they<00:01:39.010> use

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
bleed it and stuff like that they use

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.780 
bleed it and stuff like that they use
the<00:01:39.310> soil<00:01:39.580> so<00:01:39.850> that's<00:01:40.540> pretty<00:01:40.750> much<00:01:40.810> it<00:01:40.930> guys

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the soil so that's pretty much it guys

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.040 
the soil so that's pretty much it guys
so<00:01:42.790> Oh<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:44.320> was<00:01:44.410> wrong<00:01:44.530> with<00:01:44.650> this<00:01:44.770> thing<00:01:44.950> was

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
so Oh what was wrong with this thing was

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.230 
so Oh what was wrong with this thing was
was<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.260> inlet<00:01:47.620> tube<00:01:47.890> on<00:01:48.550> the<00:01:48.790> bottom<00:01:49.120> right

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
was the inlet tube on the bottom right

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.800 
was the inlet tube on the bottom right
there

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
there

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.450 
there
or<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.200> horn<00:01:50.350> stickers<00:01:50.680> that<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.100> was<00:01:51.250> leaking

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
or the horn stickers that it was leaking

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.220 
or the horn stickers that it was leaking
right<00:01:51.670> there<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.990> we<00:01:53.440> placed<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.800> seal<00:01:55.230> put

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
right there so we placed the seal put

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.490 
right there so we placed the seal put
new<00:01:56.380> coolant<00:01:56.740> and<00:01:57.870> that's<00:01:58.870> pretty<00:01:59.020> much<00:01:59.140> it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500
