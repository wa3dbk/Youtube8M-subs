three<00:01:04.910> centre-backs<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.750> yeah<00:01:05.870> i'm<00:01:06.110> using<00:01:06.470> a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
three centre-backs and yeah i'm using a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.850 
three centre-backs and yeah i'm using a
3412<00:01:07.160> formation<00:01:07.910> because<00:01:08.660> if<00:01:09.320> you're<00:01:09.560> good<00:01:09.770> at

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
3412 formation because if you're good at

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.130 
3412 formation because if you're good at
defending<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.670> should<00:01:10.880> definitely<00:01:11.480> try<00:01:11.840> them

because you'll have more chances on the
attack<00:01:14.660> but<00:01:15.140> moving<00:01:15.410> on<00:01:15.560> center<00:01:16.310> bags<00:01:16.520> we<00:01:16.820> have
