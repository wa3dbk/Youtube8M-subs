00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
lot more to it than that leverage is we

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.140 
lot more to it than that leverage is we
know<00:00:13.139> today<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.250> key<00:00:14.400> factors<00:00:14.880> in

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
know today is one of the key factors in

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.019 
know today is one of the key factors in
lameness<00:00:15.599> issues<00:00:16.440> medial<00:00:17.190> lateral<00:00:17.400> balance

lameness issues medial lateral balance

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.750 
lameness issues medial lateral balance
is<00:00:18.240> another<00:00:18.570> issue<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.590> creates<00:00:20.340> probably

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
is another issue that creates probably

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.720 
is another issue that creates probably
more<00:00:20.970> lameness<00:00:21.270> than<00:00:21.689> anything<00:00:21.900> else<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
more lameness than anything else and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.340 
more lameness than anything else and
foot<00:00:23.730> function<00:00:24.240> there's<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> horse<00:00:25.050> getting

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
foot function there's the horse getting

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.230 
foot function there's the horse getting
good<00:00:25.500> circulation<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.580> they're<00:00:26.789> using<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
good circulation or they're using the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
good circulation or they're using the
back<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.599> their<00:00:27.720> foot<00:00:27.960> appropriately<00:00:28.680> there's

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
back of their foot appropriately there's

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.820 
back of their foot appropriately there's
so<00:00:29.189> many<00:00:29.340> things<00:00:29.789> involved<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.720> lameness<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so many things involved in lameness that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.250 
so many things involved in lameness that
could<00:00:32.189> involve<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.790> shoe<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.630> could<00:00:33.930> involve

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
could involve a shoe that could involve

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.560 
could involve a shoe that could involve
being<00:00:34.590> barefooted<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.820> think<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.390> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
being barefooted and I think you have to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.110 
being barefooted and I think you have to
take<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.020> realistically<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.280> what

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
take this realistically because what

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
take this realistically because what
we're<00:00:39.270> seeing<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.950> leverage

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
we're seeing now is that the leverage

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.220 
we're seeing now is that the leverage
factor<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> hoof<00:00:42.210> preparation<00:00:42.960> on<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
factor and the hoof preparation on the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.840 
factor and the hoof preparation on the
front<00:00:43.500> side<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.800> whatever<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.670> whether

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
front side of whatever you do whether

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.010 
front side of whatever you do whether
it's<00:00:45.000> barefooted<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.719> whether<00:00:45.899> you're

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it's barefooted or whether you're

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's barefooted or whether you're
applying<00:00:46.320> shoes<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.700> key<00:00:47.940> element<00:00:48.450> to

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
applying shoes is the key element to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.650 
applying shoes is the key element to
whether<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> horse<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:51.360> better

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
whether the horse is going to do better

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.709 
whether the horse is going to do better
or<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:52.199> worse<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.309> prepare<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> foot<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
or do worse if you prepare a foot in a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.200 
or do worse if you prepare a foot in a
way<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.379> creating<00:00:56.039> leverage<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.910> put<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
way that is creating leverage you put a

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
way that is creating leverage you put a
shoe<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.449> top<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.140> yes<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.770> shoe<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.219> an

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
shoe on top of it yes the shoe is an

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
shoe on top of it yes the shoe is an
intricate<00:00:59.699> component<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> exacerbating<00:01:01.350> the

intricate component to exacerbating the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
intricate component to exacerbating the
problem<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> foot<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> shaped<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
problem and if the foot is shaped and

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.350 
problem and if the foot is shaped and
trimmed<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> prepared<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.250> way<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:06.180> is

trimmed and prepared in a way that is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
trimmed and prepared in a way that is
going<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> enhance<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.439> quality<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.159> foot

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to enhance the quality of the foot

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.070 
going to enhance the quality of the foot
put<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> shoe<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.450> everything<00:01:09.810> is

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
put a shoe on it then everything is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.510 
put a shoe on it then everything is
going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> work<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> best<00:01:10.920> interest<00:01:11.400> of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
going to work in the best interest of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
going to work in the best interest of
the<00:01:11.670> horse<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.630> there's<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:12.960> much

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the horse and I think there's so much

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.320 
the horse and I think there's so much
going<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.770> today<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.180> our

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
going on today with what we do with our

going on today with what we do with our
horses<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.110> lot<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.799> them<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.250> very<00:01:17.490> well

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
horses a lot of them can do very well

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
horses a lot of them can do very well
with<00:01:17.880> being<00:01:18.060> barefooted<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> lot<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.200> them

with being barefooted and a lot of them

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.140 
with being barefooted and a lot of them
need<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.159> shoes<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.670> they<00:01:20.820> need<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.030> have
