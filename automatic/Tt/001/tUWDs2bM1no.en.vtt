00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.860
 you are in the 14th day of the rally of 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.090
 France has just changed 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.950
 how did this rally start? 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.710
 well i had no problem i 'm going 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.360
 have the best engine among 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.869
 first that is to say that I consume 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.460
 no oil 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.060
 I was lucky not to fall 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.010
 again and my god everything went well 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.480
 so far it will take place during you 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.310
 very hard yeah because I have a motorcycle 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 powerful but the rainy season 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.730
 and late this year the wells 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.220
 are a lot more saggy me 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.600
 I'm expecting fast rallies where the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.340
 power of my bike would have served me 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.970
 and this is mostly a question of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.970
 workability weight 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.900
 but I was told she was really 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.340
 of all competitors this step at 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.840
 mali is one of the most difficult 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.660
 first three overall 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.670
 for us to spend together and 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.950
 now and that almost until the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.380
 end of the race we will be there the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.160

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.160
 his wake 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.750
 people father who continues the road the 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.190

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.390

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.390

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.100

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.170

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.129
