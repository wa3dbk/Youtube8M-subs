idea<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.140> when<00:00:58.850> in<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
idea of that is so that when in the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
idea of that is so that when in the
winter<00:01:00.149> months<00:01:00.500> from<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:03.260> extension<00:01:04.260> with

winter months from the extension with
the<00:01:04.860> lookout<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.729> make<00:01:06.030> sure<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.510> pond<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the lookout and make sure the pond is in

the lookout and make sure the pond is in
good<00:01:07.350> health<00:01:07.619> that's<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.670> reason<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
good health that's the reason for the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.719

wind<00:01:09.450> down<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> benefit<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.700> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
wind down but the benefit is it is a

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
in the pond I don't know why he's not

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.570 
in the pond I don't know why he's not
making<00:02:33.500> them<00:02:33.739> upon<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.190> that's<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.459> ivory

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
making them upon but that's not ivory

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.509 
making them upon but that's not ivory
and<00:02:34.819> Audia<00:02:35.180> as<00:02:35.690> you<00:02:35.930> say<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.190> see<00:02:37.340> that

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
and Audia as you say so you can see that
