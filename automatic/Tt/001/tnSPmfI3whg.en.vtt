there<00:05:04.729> was<00:05:05.150> actually<00:05:05.599> more<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:05.840> a

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
there was actually more of a

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.809 
there was actually more of a
butterscotch<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:07.000> would<00:05:08.000> like<00:05:08.150> a<00:05:08.180> mild

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:09.819 
butterscotch and would like a mild

very mellow mellow chocolate I can see

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:18.580 
very mellow mellow chocolate I can see
how<00:05:17.060> people<00:05:17.240> would<00:05:17.509> compare<00:05:17.930> this<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.259> cookie

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
how people would compare this to cookie

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.920 
how people would compare this to cookie

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
don't because it does have that kind of

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.110 
don't because it does have that kind of
cookie<00:05:21.680> dough<00:05:22.750> flavor<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.759> as<00:05:25.759> far<00:05:25.969> as<00:05:26.060> a

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
cookie dough flavor to it as far as a

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.050 
cookie dough flavor to it as far as a
sugar<00:05:26.360> cookie<00:05:26.509> you<00:05:26.750> definitely<00:05:27.199> taste<00:05:27.409> that

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
sugar cookie you definitely taste that

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.640 
sugar cookie you definitely taste that
if<00:05:29.060> you're<00:05:29.270> like<00:05:29.479> a<00:05:29.509> baked<00:05:29.810> good<00:05:30.020> this<00:05:30.500> is

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
if you're like a baked good this is

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:41.679
