00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
course play the only thing is it doesn't

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.210 
course play the only thing is it doesn't
raise<00:02:06.910> and<00:02:07.210> lower<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.540> mowers<00:02:08.020> so<00:02:08.830> if<00:02:09.070> you

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
raise and lower the mowers so if you

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.699 
raise and lower the mowers so if you
want<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.700> turn<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.780> off<00:02:10.959> for<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.170> quick<00:02:11.350> second

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
want to turn this off for a quick second

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.320 
want to turn this off for a quick second
so<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.010> want<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.430> use<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:12.730> course<00:02:13.150> play

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
so if you want to use this course play

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.390 
so if you want to use this course play
it<00:02:13.450> does<00:02:13.630> work<00:02:13.930> however<00:02:14.590> it'll<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.130> keep<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
it does work however it'll just keep the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.910 
it does work however it'll just keep the
mower<00:02:15.550> down<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:16.030> whole<00:02:16.240> time<00:02:16.740> so<00:02:17.740> for<00:02:17.890> example

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
mower down the whole time so for example

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.030 
mower down the whole time so for example
if<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.459> just<00:02:18.640> recorded<00:02:18.970> little<00:02:19.500> grass<00:02:20.500> outline

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
if I just recorded little grass outline

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.790 
if I just recorded little grass outline
here<00:02:21.370> for<00:02:21.610> example<00:02:24.060> like<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.620> just<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.770> little

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
here for example like so just a little

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.140 
here for example like so just a little
oval<00:02:27.430> shaped<00:02:27.730> track<00:02:28.120> or<00:02:28.959> outline<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:30.060> here<00:02:31.060> we

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
oval shaped track or outline and here we

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.900 
oval shaped track or outline and here we
go<00:02:34.320> here<00:02:35.320> we<00:02:35.350> go<00:02:35.440> stop<00:02:35.830> that<00:02:36.070> field<00:02:36.880> work<00:02:37.090> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
go here we go stop that field work and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.390 
go here we go stop that field work and
put<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.030> at<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.500> northwest<00:02:41.500> corner<00:02:41.620> heading

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
put it at the northwest corner heading

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
put it at the northwest corner heading
east<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:43.110> then

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
east and then

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.699 
east and then
that's<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:46.569> right<00:02:46.690> there<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.440> way<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.650> a

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
that's it right there so the way it's a

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.170 
that's it right there so the way it's a
work<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.100> put<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.340> into<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.700> first<00:02:49.000> Waypoint

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
work so I put it into the first Waypoint

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.920 
work so I put it into the first Waypoint
it<00:02:49.660> will<00:02:49.900> work<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:52.060> let's<00:02:52.240> just<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.540> quiet<00:02:52.780> for

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
it will work so let's just be quiet for

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.920 
it will work so let's just be quiet for
a<00:02:53.050> quick<00:02:53.260> sec<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.709> watch<00:02:54.069> listen<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.840> it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
a quick sec and watch listen to it so it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.160 
a quick sec and watch listen to it so it
does<00:02:59.110> turn<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.440> on<00:03:00.630> but<00:03:01.630> as<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.870> can<00:03:01.959> see

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
does turn it on but as you can see

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.870 
does turn it on but as you can see
unless<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.680> own<00:03:02.920> all<00:03:02.950> their<00:03:03.220> clothes<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.640> lowers

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
unless I own all their clothes it lowers

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.960 
unless I own all their clothes it lowers
it<00:03:04.140> alright<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.410> let's<00:03:05.590> do<00:03:06.130> another<00:03:06.250> test<00:03:06.640> oh

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
it alright so let's do another test oh

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.420 
it alright so let's do another test oh
no<00:03:07.600> it<00:03:07.720> didn't<00:03:07.989> lower<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.350> okay<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:08.890> let's<00:03:09.190> try

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
no it didn't lower it okay so let's try

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.979 
no it didn't lower it okay so let's try
that<00:03:09.610> one<00:03:09.670> more<00:03:09.880> time<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.660> I<00:03:10.690> didn't<00:03:10.870> see<00:03:10.959> it

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
that one more time so I didn't see it

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:12.840 
that one more time so I didn't see it
does<00:03:11.170> work<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.470> does<00:03:11.620> Moe<00:03:11.860> haste<00:03:12.130> or<00:03:12.400> mow<00:03:12.819> grass

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
does work it does Moe haste or mow grass

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.290 
does work it does Moe haste or mow grass
as<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.720> can<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.080> which<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.560> nice<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:16.090> I've

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
as you can see which is nice so I've

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.820 
as you can see which is nice so I've
raised<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.350> let<00:03:17.500> me<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:17.709> demonstrate

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
raised it so let me just demonstrate

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.920 
raised it so let me just demonstrate
that<00:03:18.220> one<00:03:18.370> time<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:18.790> lowered<00:03:19.180> that's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
that one time so it's lowered that's

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.979 
that one time so it's lowered that's
raised<00:03:20.290> ok<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:20.830> it's<00:03:21.070> raised<00:03:21.420> now<00:03:22.420> let's<00:03:22.720> go

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
raised ok so it's raised now let's go

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.540 
raised ok so it's raised now let's go
ahead<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.350> just<00:03:23.470> test<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.890> out<00:03:23.980> to<00:03:24.040> see<00:03:24.160> if<00:03:24.340> it

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
ahead and just test it out to see if it

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.699 
ahead and just test it out to see if it
does<00:03:24.760> work<00:03:24.940> with<00:03:25.180> course<00:03:25.420> play<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.440> first

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
does work with course play so first

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.910 
does work with course play so first
Waypoint<00:03:27.060> let's<00:03:28.060> follow<00:03:28.300> behind<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:31.860> so<00:03:32.860> it

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
Waypoint let's follow behind it so it

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.979 
Waypoint let's follow behind it so it
doesn't<00:03:32.980> lower<00:03:33.610> it<00:03:33.880> automatically<00:03:34.600> as<00:03:34.840> you

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
doesn't lower it automatically as you

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.890 
doesn't lower it automatically as you
can<00:03:35.110> see<00:03:35.260> do<00:03:35.620> have<00:03:35.769> to<00:03:35.920> manually<00:03:36.340> lower<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:37.690> if

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
can see do have to manually lower so if

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.030 
can see do have to manually lower so if
I<00:03:38.080> hop<00:03:38.350> into<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.430> lower<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.860> will

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
I hop into this and I lower it it will

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.880 
I hop into this and I lower it it will
actually<00:03:42.480> moje<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.840> course<00:03:44.260> play<00:03:44.500> but<00:03:44.800> you

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
actually moje in course play but you

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.670 
actually moje in course play but you
have<00:03:45.040> to<00:03:45.220> manually<00:03:45.489> lower<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:46.230> lower<00:03:47.230> nothing

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
have to manually lower the lower nothing

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.259 
have to manually lower the lower nothing
to<00:03:47.800> use<00:03:47.890> fancy<00:03:48.160> with<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.459> graphics<00:03:48.910> there<00:03:49.120> as

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
to use fancy with the graphics there as

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.620 
to use fancy with the graphics there as
you<00:03:49.480> can<00:03:49.570> see<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.769> does<00:03:51.160> turn<00:03:51.880> around<00:03:54.420> if<00:03:55.420> you

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
you can see it does turn around if you

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.039 
you can see it does turn around if you
don't<00:03:55.780> have<00:03:55.870> any<00:03:55.989> Trina<00:03:56.260> way<00:03:56.880> oops<00:03:58.049> doesn't
