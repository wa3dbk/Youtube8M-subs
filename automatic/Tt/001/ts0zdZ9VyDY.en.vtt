00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.509
 bead needle and accessories lighter 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.109

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.900
 millimeters and 4 beads almost them and 2 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:36.399
 fasteners from pliers tools and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.829
 round pliers get started the most important have 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.670
 at hand shemku her power download from my 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.649
 blog post 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.710
 link to the jump is in the description 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.780
 under this video she made a cape beats 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.780
 studio this program can be downloaded from 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.899
 my blog cut off a meter for free 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:56.410
 I started to make fishing lines without needles 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.469
 I think my way too we will like 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.370
 take our shooting and celebrate the most 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.219
 long row 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.500
 most often it is located in the middle 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.690
 picture 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.820
 I first put two on one end of the line 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.250
 beads black and white 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.370
 department turn the other end of the line 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.130
 we pass the back side and tighten 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.730
 white bead so glitter divided 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.730
 in half 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.590
 now take a new let and pass it 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.590
 also 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.230
 fishing line ends from different sides and so on 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.230
 the end of the first row following the scheme 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.820
 now we rotate the circuit and do 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:09.500
 move to the next row 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.610
 choose one end of the line with which 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.640
 will be working 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.610
 populate it in a needle second row 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.190
 decreases by bead so we 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.030
 at first we dress only one bead 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.360
 pink now between the first 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.569
 two bottom bead thread needle 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.890
 under the upper wood and pull up 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.890
 bead now 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.470
 needle pass through the bead with reverse 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.769
 hand and tighten that is with us 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.739
 it turns out a loop that holds on to 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.870
 existing wood 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.099
 dress the next bead and the same, and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.630
 year and bottom 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:53.480
 We are already catching the line between 2 and 3 beads 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.049
 This technique is called brick 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.470
 stitch 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.130
 with it we continue to do the whole row following 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.130
 according to the scheme 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:53.319
 the last bead of the second row which 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.060
 should act do the following 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.640
 way 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.459
 needle pass through 1 beads 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.079
 first row and then back again 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.079
 side in the same bead 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.850
 do the third row as well as 2 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.350
 so the fourth row begins with 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.590
 beads which stands 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.880
 this means that at first we dress not 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.330
 one and 2 beads black white mist 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.910
 hook on the first forest and pass 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:52.510
 in the opposite direction, only one bead 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.600
 white are the main techniques that 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.570
 we are allowed to make the floor faces hello 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.720
 kitty follow the scheme to the last 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.720
 row 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.669
 at the end we need to make access on 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.580
 as many as 2 beads without writing a single 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:52.540
 beads just below the needle thread 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.510
 between 2 and 3 beads now we went out there 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.880
 where should be the first bead 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.610
 the last row of string bead 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.229
 needle under the bottom in the same place 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:08.820
 we pass and in the opposite direction 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.820
 following the scheme will make a series to the end 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.250
 at the end the needle is hooked to the bottom 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.520
 wood them and the value of what is important 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:38.980
 near the last beads and 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.690
 we make loops and thread them in 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.690
 needles them several times 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.850
 then cut off the line leaves 5 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.850
 millimeters and light a lighter 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.639
 I take a doctor in the opposite direction and 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:15.509
 do a soul mate hello kitty 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.509

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.420
 take a ring and sell 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:33.570

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:37.380
 close it on pin pin dress 3 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:38.580

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:41.460
 steel piece 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.790
 bite off now using round pliers 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:48.510
 make a ring but not until the end we must 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:53.040
 pass our challah kiti with a ring and then 

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:55.380
