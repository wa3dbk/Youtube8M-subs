00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.560
 much desire for all the guys here 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.510
 mister clos dark and today I'm here for 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.520
 tell you about assassin's creed syndicate 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.750
 I understood in the venue presented 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.940
 a few minutes ago in world premiere 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.789
 output for playstation 4 and xbox 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.650
 when on October 23rd 2015 and for PC 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.090
 in autumn 2015 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.710
 the game will be set in London 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.650
 of the industrial revolution 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.430
 more precisely in 1868 the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.410
 protagonist jacob fry was born in 1847 ed 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.420
 he is a man guided by the allied instinct 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.130
 with the band of killer rooks la 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.989
 brotherhood which is secretly 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.610
 starting a revolution in the slums 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.410
 of the city to change the world and do 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.149
 to resurrect the abandoned order 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.809
 will attempt to change a city to 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.250
 drift 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.170
 in fact in this historical period there 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.300
 they are few men who keep them all 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.190
 the power is that others could be 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.410
 Templar synonyms how we can 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.090
 fight them thanks to the people we will have to 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.010
 help to then be able to use it as 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.110
 ally talking about real gameplay e 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.450
 we will be in command of jacob fry e 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.620
 most likely of ivey fry la 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.030
 sister of the protagonist 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.950
 the main mechanics of the game 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.170
 they seem to have suffered very few 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.000
 essential changes we find some 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.920
 small but interesting news that 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.390
 we will see soon we will first have the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.700
 possibility to move around the city 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.619
 through the horse-drawn carts that 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.479
 we will be the ones to lead this not 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.860
 it will be a marginal component since 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.479
 will be used several times 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.549
 within the missions to create 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.930
 chases within the city there 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.880
 then different factions will be inside 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.220
 of this world as we would have from a 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.439
 the upper middle class on the other side 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.000
 to organized crime and finally i 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.040
 unions that we would be 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 flag bearer we will have new armaments a 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.180
 arrangement like the kukri a knife 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.310
 curved able to penetrate the flesh 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.590
 bones of our victims a revolver in 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.180
 nineteenth-century style a practical knuckles 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.460
 to conclude the melee combat 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.259
 and the glove of the killer a union of 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.850
 hallucinogenic darts launches race for 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.770
 escape a move in the city and the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.630
 slaughtered talking about these clashes 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.009
 will be much closer than the 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 previous chapters increasing 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.430
 the importance of the melee that 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.500
 several animations were shown 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.390
 innovative of the macerated wing and the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.950
 brass knuckles as in unity back 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.019
 valletta furtive that will give us a big one 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.340
 help in the self sections even if in 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.079
 there are these first pieces of game 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.780
 seemed a little too easy to move 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.459
 exploiting 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.230
 especially if combined with the whistle for 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.940
 lure the guards something else 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.740
 will return often especially for the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750
 secondary objectives will be the killing 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.430
 taking advantage of the surrounding environment for 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.090
 example by dropping the suspended barrels 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.620
 for air 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.060
 everything will be divided into 7 districts 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.890
 different we should be able to 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.569
 conquer to defend to free the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.310
 population at the collar of the bands 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.260
 rivals and also to earn some 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.390
 to make it we will have to defeat 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.190
 certain elements of rival gangs 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.930
 and if we get involved in some 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.310
 pursuits we may also find ourselves ad 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.440
 facing gang clashes 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.480
 speaking of special edition we will have the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.880
 lux edition which will contain the box set from 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.440
 the artbook collection the map in london 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.989
 the official soundtrack and two 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.239
 extra missions ie haraway trains ed 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.830
 darwin and dickens with spears onwards 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.510
 we find the big shaun charging 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.300
 will contain the collection box 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.709
 the jacob fi artbook statuette la 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.690
 map of london the soundtrack 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.580
 official and the two extra missions in 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.220
 last we find the big ben collector 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.480
 scales that will contain the big ben la artbook 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.190
 statuette of jacob fry 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.200
 the map of london the soundtrack 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.390
 official lithographs that will be 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.000
 chosen by the fans who pre-order the 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.340
 package flair for the game disc and the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.930
 two extra broadly -based missions 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.640
 that's all we've been shown 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.290
 I personally must admit not 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.120
 be very impressed in that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.799
 there were no major changes 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.239
 and I can't understand how they will do it to 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.519
 connect current killers with 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.600
 those of ezio auditore 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.850
 obviously I don't even dare 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.890
 to assume a return of desmond also 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.680
 if from now until October ubisoft will still have 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.940
 time to amaze us all like 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.920
 always an invitation to leave a beautiful me 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.760
 like a comment and we'll meet again in 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.760
 next video
