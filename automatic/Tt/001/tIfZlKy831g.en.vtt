00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello very good dear subscribers 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.799
 here we are with this new video for 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.450
 the channel and this video if I can do it 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.400
 I'm banned though I bring you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.219
 a secret painting or secret color 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.650
 we can make our car be 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 like the joker if we choose the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.859
 car that we like to each one and what 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.539
 what we have to do is enter 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.609
 within the saints just once 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.840
 let's get inside the custom saints what 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.910
 what we have to do will be what 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 next we prepare the vehicle and the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.230
 shield the engine and we leave all this 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.179
 to our liking we are going to paint 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.489
 in main color we will go to mate 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.440
 and we 're going , we 're going to apologize 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.200
 purple shafter this we have here 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 ok we put it on well once it's 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.320
 let's put we're going to pearl and we 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.670
 we will fix that we can not put a 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.469
 pierced because it must have a color 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 metallic to solve this we go 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.039
 to metallic and without touching anything from here 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.719
 we go out again giving the circle up 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.090
 the main menu where these appear 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.219
 lights the whole horn and for example in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.390
 wheels we change an accessory for 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.460
 example we put a white smoke 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
 we return to give back to the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 circle we put back into paint 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.379
 and let us use the color 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.570
 Pearly Pearly main color in 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.670
