00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
put the lube patch in at the end just

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.250 
put the lube patch in at the end just
inhibit<00:01:07.810> any<00:01:07.960> rust<00:01:08.730> okay<00:01:09.730> as<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.810> can<00:01:10.990> see

gray on the patch and I'll go ahead and

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.620 
gray on the patch and I'll go ahead and
dry<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.200> bore<00:01:17.530> with<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:18.100> dry<00:01:19.030> cleaning<00:01:19.360> patch

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
dry the bore with a dry cleaning patch

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.960 
dry the bore with a dry cleaning patch
just<00:01:20.080> run<00:01:20.230> it<00:01:20.350> down<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.680> up<00:01:20.770> yeah<00:01:21.370> move<00:01:21.640> it<00:01:21.790> you

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
just run it down and up yeah move it you

just run it down and up yeah move it you
know<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.120> couple<00:01:22.180> times<00:01:22.450> just<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.930> make<00:01:23.050> sure

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
know a couple times just to make sure

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.470 
know a couple times just to make sure
you<00:01:23.320> there's<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:23.800> know<00:01:23.880> no<00:01:24.880> liquid<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.360> the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
you there's you know no liquid in the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.710 
you there's you know no liquid in the
barrel<00:01:25.830> okay<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:30.729> Lube<00:01:31.000> patch<00:01:31.330> with<00:01:31.690> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
barrel okay and a Lube patch with the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.770 
barrel okay and a Lube patch with the
t17<00:01:32.590> natural<00:01:33.070> Lube<00:01:33.220> on<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.550> and<00:01:34.450> what<00:01:34.630> that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
t17 natural Lube on it and what that

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.380 
t17 natural Lube on it and what that
does<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.229> inhibits<00:01:35.800> rust<00:01:36.100> but<00:01:36.580> over<00:01:36.880> time<00:01:37.150> it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
does is inhibits rust but over time it

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.210 
does is inhibits rust but over time it
starts<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.780> season<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.320> barrel<00:01:38.590> kind<00:01:39.070> of<00:01:39.130> like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
starts to season the barrel kind of like

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.219 
starts to season the barrel kind of like
it's<00:01:39.430> seasoned<00:01:39.790> a<00:01:39.850> cast-iron<00:01:40.240> skillet<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:41.140> it

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
it's seasoned a cast-iron skillet so it

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.440 
it's seasoned a cast-iron skillet so it
actually<00:01:41.530> make<00:01:41.680> it<00:01:41.770> easier<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.280> load<00:01:42.460> and<00:01:42.760> it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
actually make it easier to load and it

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.080 
actually make it easier to load and it
will<00:01:43.570> improve<00:01:43.720> your<00:01:44.080> accuracy<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.700> up<00:01:48.820> a

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
will improve your accuracy down and up a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.130 
will improve your accuracy down and up a
couple<00:01:49.360> times<00:01:49.540> there<00:01:50.820> perfect<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.259> go

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
couple times there perfect there you go

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.990 
couple times there perfect there you go
okay<00:01:56.140> now<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.380> barrel<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.040> completely<00:01:57.670> clean

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
okay now the barrel is completely clean

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.760 
okay now the barrel is completely clean
you<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.390> store<00:01:58.690> it<00:01:58.750> until<00:01:58.810> next<00:01:59.170> season<00:01:59.470> and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
you can store it until next season and

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.580 
you can store it until next season and
you<00:01:59.860> don't<00:02:00.009> have<00:02:00.100> to<00:02:00.190> worry<00:02:00.340> about<00:02:00.400> rust

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
you don't have to worry about rust

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.350 
you don't have to worry about rust
now<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.649> breech<00:02:02.950> end<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.369> gun<00:02:03.550> obviously

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
now the breech end of the gun obviously

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.320 
now the breech end of the gun obviously
being<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.380> seal<00:02:05.590> breech<00:02:05.890> gun<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:06.610> did<00:02:06.850> not<00:02:07.090> get

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
being a seal breech gun that did not get

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.840 
being a seal breech gun that did not get
very<00:02:07.360> dirty<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:09.220> all<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:09.369> have<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:09.729> do

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
very dirty so really all you have to do

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.450 
very dirty so really all you have to do
is<00:02:10.060> clean<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:11.230> threads<00:02:11.530> inside<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.130> barrel

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
is clean the threads inside the barrel

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.750 
is clean the threads inside the barrel
as<00:02:12.600> well<00:02:13.600> as<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.870> plug<00:02:14.080> itself<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:15.520> there's

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
as well as the plug itself so there's

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.809 
as well as the plug itself so there's
the<00:02:15.940> breech<00:02:16.150> plug<00:02:16.390> okay<00:02:18.240> lay<00:02:19.240> this<00:02:19.390> over<00:02:19.690> here

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
the breech plug okay lay this over here

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.970 
the breech plug okay lay this over here
so<00:02:21.819> we<00:02:21.940> do<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.390> like<00:02:22.480> we<00:02:22.720> did<00:02:22.990> earlier<00:02:23.170> today
