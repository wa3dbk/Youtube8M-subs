00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.840
 hello friends new information from the 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.240
 great blows and this has been 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.000
 provided by fans in do not you tube 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.769
 this is a very reliable person thing 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.360
 that has gotten out of the codes that are 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.759
 on the rockstar server then it 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.950
 confirms there are five great blows 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.530
 that come and then let's go with the first 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.270
 the first is the sessions and there are good 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.370
 a photograph that has been published in 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.140
 these days that refers to this great 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.710
 hit and what it is basically 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.210
 is to move two bands we have to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.580
 move two van will surely be 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.290
 move those from point a to point b without 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.660
 However everything we go to 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.250
 find on the road the rivals the 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.470
 obstacles that's what it's going to be 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.170
 interesting is this great blow 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.600
 we go with the second the second one is 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.329
 bending this is to steal the bank 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.210
 arrow and well there are some images that 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.160
 they already reveal what we are using 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.989
 here we see the car of the chroma that 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.120
 we are going to use for this great blow 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.309
 here we are accessing what are the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.220
 facilities of the flec a bank and therefore 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.290
 this is the second big blow we're going 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.320
 to make a base this is going to be a 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.720
 bank robbery 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.840
 with the third the third is the most 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.940
 known of human lab and it is this 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.530
 big blow let's say you have five 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.720
 secondary missions are the ones that already 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.100
 we know there a video went up with the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.119
 secondary missions in case they want it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.780
 see, I'll leave them in the description 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.210
 of the video and well this is a big blow 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.220
 that is going to be very very difficult because 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.100
 well let's go with the fourth the fourth one 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.050
 refers to the pacific standard job this is 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.170
 a robbery also to bank because it is going to 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.940
 be the blow to this bank now here already 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.729
 we see the images as we are inside 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.160
 all dressed very elegantly and well 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.470
 already to make us the money that is 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.190
 found in the safe of this 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.200
 Bank 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.740
 check attention in this following here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.660
 let's use the termite pump now 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.100
 we have it here and the last big blow 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.840
 prison break 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.580
 pay attention to the character of the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.100
 right as you are holding a 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 photograph where he is showing them to a 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.690
 prisoner the prisoner then good 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.229
 has the characteristic prison clothes 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.780
 and then here is a group attacking what 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.710
 which it is this truck that transports 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.960
 inmates of a place 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.480
 another one we're probably going to go to 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.490
 rescue it or it could even be 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.830
 the possibility that we're going to 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.360
 delete or we could delete it too 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.550
 go out there has ordered us madrazo 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.840
 to eliminate people like that is that it fits 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.340
 the possibility that it's not for 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200
 rescue it also be to eliminate it 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.630
 these were good friends for five 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.160
 great blows that come what they think of 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.160
