showing you a quick tutorial on how to

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.400 
showing you a quick tutorial on how to
solve<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.230> TYT<00:00:07.680> rubik's<00:00:08.130> cube<00:00:08.750> so<00:00:09.750> first<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.320> all

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
solve a TYT rubik's cube so first of all

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.690 
solve a TYT rubik's cube so first of all
I'll<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:10.620> explain<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.190> you<00:00:11.429> if<00:00:11.519> you're<00:00:11.670> a

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
I'll just explain to you if you're a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.549 
I'll just explain to you if you're a
beginner<00:00:12.000> what<00:00:12.420> an<00:00:12.509> algorithm<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.320> because

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
beginner what an algorithm is because

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.039 
beginner what an algorithm is because
I'll<00:00:13.650> be<00:00:13.799> using<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.130> word<00:00:14.309> quite<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> lot

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
I'll be using that word quite a lot

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:17.720 
I'll be using that word quite a lot
sounds<00:00:16.049> will<00:00:16.139> posh<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> fancy<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.310> tricky

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
sounds will posh and fancy and tricky

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
sounds will posh and fancy and tricky
but<00:00:18.270> it's<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.630> not<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.949> any

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
but it's really not it's just any

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.540 
but it's really not it's just any
sequins<00:00:20.789> or<00:00:21.480> moves<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:23.189> will<00:00:23.340> solve

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
sequins or moves and that will solve

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.210 
sequins or moves and that will solve
aside<00:00:23.910> without<00:00:24.810> messing<00:00:25.230> up<00:00:25.439> another<00:00:25.740> side<00:00:25.980> at

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
aside without messing up another side at

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.410 
aside without messing up another side at
the<00:00:26.310> same<00:00:26.490> time<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.910> that's<00:00:29.910> what<00:00:30.359> an

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
the same time so that's what an

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
the same time so that's what an
algorithm<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.900> pretty<00:00:31.080> much<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.500> hope<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.920> all

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
algorithm is pretty much I hope you all

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.490 
algorithm is pretty much I hope you all
know<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.399> new<00:00:32.520> notation<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.360> write<00:00:33.630> write

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
know the new notation so write write

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
know the new notation so write write

inverted<00:00:45.079> down<00:00:46.079> down<00:00:46.980> inverted<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
inverted down down inverted you get it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.660 
inverted down down inverted you get it
all<00:00:48.420> right<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> we'll<00:00:50.160> go<00:00:50.280> from<00:00:50.460> there

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
all right and so we'll go from there

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.010 
all right and so we'll go from there
just<00:00:51.120> solve<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> first<00:00:51.870> side<00:00:53.300> simple<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.899> got

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
just solve the first side simple you got

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.200 
just solve the first side simple you got
to<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> side<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.010> should<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:56.430> solve

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
to the side so you should just solve

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.599 
to the side so you should just solve
that<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.750> mean<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.620> not<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.770> hard<00:00:58.920> come<00:00:59.460> on

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
that I mean it's not that hard come on

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.959 
that I mean it's not that hard come on
it's<00:00:59.789> just<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.120> side<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.570> T<00:01:00.809> by<00:01:00.989> 2<00:01:01.399> so<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it's just one side on T by 2 so when you

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.240 
it's just one side on T by 2 so when you
go<00:01:03.120> along<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> top<00:01:03.690> layer<00:01:03.979> there<00:01:04.979> should<00:01:05.129> be

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
go along the top layer there should be

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940 
go along the top layer there should be
too<00:01:05.400> much<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.479> blue<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.500> blue

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
too much in just there blue and blue

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.399 
too much in just there blue and blue
pretty<00:01:08.820> much<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.170> shouldn't

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
pretty much all right so there shouldn't

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.490 
pretty much all right so there shouldn't
be<00:01:10.560> any<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.159> us<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.400> much<00:01:11.610> green<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.150> red

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
be any of us that much green and red

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.940 
be any of us that much green and red
orange<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> red<00:01:14.390> green<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> orange<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:16.830> got

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
orange and red green and orange you got

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.480 
orange and red green and orange you got
it<00:01:17.070> right<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.810> when<00:01:18.810> you've<00:01:19.290> solved<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.250> side

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it right so when you've solved that side

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.179 
it right so when you've solved that side
and<00:01:20.850> got<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> blue<00:01:21.210> much<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.979> doesn't<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
and got the blue much in doesn't have to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.190 
and got the blue much in doesn't have to
be<00:01:23.310> blue<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.580> could<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.820> any<00:01:24.000> color<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:25.020> could

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
be blue it could be any color it could

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
be blue it could be any color it could
be<00:01:25.320> any<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> face<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> blue<00:01:27.119> away

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
be any you have to face the blue away

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
be any you have to face the blue away
from<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.680> whatever<00:01:28.979> colors<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> have

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
from you and whatever colors you have

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.020 
from you and whatever colors you have
and<00:01:29.909> then<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.229> following<00:01:31.560> algorithm<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and then do this following algorithm to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.420 
and then do this following algorithm to
solve<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.840> entire<00:01:34.229> first<00:01:34.530> layer<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.280> here

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
solve the entire first layer so here

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.740 
solve the entire first layer so here
goes<00:01:35.750> right<00:01:36.750> inverted<00:01:37.350> down<00:01:38.240> right<00:01:39.259> left<00:01:40.259> down

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750

first<00:01:47.820> layer<00:01:48.090> sold<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.560> after<00:01:49.770> you've<00:01:49.860> done

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
first layer sold so after you've done

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.270 
first layer sold so after you've done
that<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:51.000> want<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:52.009> get<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> white

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that you want to do this get the white

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
that you want to do this get the white
side<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.210> turn<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.509> upside<00:01:54.810> down<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.409> it's

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
side and turn it upside down so it's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.859 
side and turn it upside down so it's
facing<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.920> floor<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.570> need<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
facing the floor so then you need to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.499 
facing the floor so then you need to
turn<00:01:58.110> onto<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> blue<00:01:58.770> side<00:01:59.180> which<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
turn onto the blue side which have the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
turn onto the blue side which have the
blue<00:02:00.810> at<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.930> bottom<00:02:01.020> doesn't<00:02:02.009> matter<00:02:02.310> what

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
blue at the bottom doesn't matter what

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.370 
blue at the bottom doesn't matter what
two<00:02:02.610> colors<00:02:02.880> are<00:02:03.000> there<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> do

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
two colors are there but you want to do

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.310 
two colors are there but you want to do
this<00:02:04.590> algorithm<00:02:05.540> to<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.840> yellow<00:02:07.020> side

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
this algorithm to get the yellow side

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.779 
this algorithm to get the yellow side
you<00:02:07.740> may<00:02:07.860> have<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.099> do<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.220> multiple<00:02:08.459> times

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
you may have to do it multiple times

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.900 
you may have to do it multiple times
until<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.220> end<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.700> all

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
until you get it but in the end it all

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.640 
until you get it but in the end it all
turns<00:02:12.180> out

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
turns out

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.929 
turns out
and<00:02:12.739> you<00:02:13.220> wouldn't<00:02:13.400> have<00:02:13.459> messed<00:02:13.670> up<00:02:13.790> the

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
and you wouldn't have messed up the

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.089 
and you wouldn't have messed up the
white<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:15.019> here<00:02:15.200> goes<00:02:16.030> front<00:02:17.560> row<00:02:18.590> what<00:02:18.860> am<00:02:18.980> I

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
white so here goes front row what am I

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.050 
white so here goes front row what am I
on<00:02:19.129> about<00:02:19.599> right<00:02:20.860> up<00:02:21.860> right<00:02:22.629> inverted<00:02:23.709> up

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
on about right up right inverted up

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.250 
on about right up right inverted up
right<00:02:26.060> up<00:02:27.019> twice<00:02:27.939> right<00:02:28.939> inverted<00:02:29.569> you<00:02:30.049> didn't

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
right up twice right inverted you didn't

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.690 
right up twice right inverted you didn't
miss<00:02:30.349> any<00:02:30.530> of<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.739> up<00:02:30.829> but<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> move<00:02:31.519> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
miss any of it up but you move the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.580 
miss any of it up but you move the
yellows<00:02:31.970> from<00:02:32.000> where<00:02:32.329> they<00:02:32.450> started<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.500> it

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
yellows from where they started so it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.809 
yellows from where they started so it
didn't<00:02:33.799> work<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.459> do<00:02:34.549> it<00:02:34.640> again

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
didn't work so you have to do it again

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.539 
didn't work so you have to do it again
right<00:02:35.799> up<00:02:36.799> right<00:02:37.480> inverted<00:02:38.480> up<00:02:38.920> right<00:02:39.920> or

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
right up right inverted up right or

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.110 
right up right inverted up right or
twice<00:02:41.209> right<00:02:41.900> inverted<00:02:42.500> didn't<00:02:43.280> work<00:02:43.430> they<00:02:44.000> do

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
twice right inverted didn't work they do

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.390 
twice right inverted didn't work they do
it<00:02:44.209> again<00:02:44.450> you<00:02:45.409> don't<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.889> turn<00:02:46.069> it<00:02:46.280> like

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
it again you don't have to turn it like

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.979 
it again you don't have to turn it like
that<00:02:46.459> but<00:02:46.879> you<00:02:46.970> can<00:02:47.150> if<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:47.389> on<00:02:47.540> if<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.840> want

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
that but you can if you on if you want

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.190 
that but you can if you on if you want
to<00:02:48.079> do<00:02:48.139> it<00:02:48.260> like<00:02:48.409> that<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:49.280> again<00:02:49.519> right<00:02:50.200> up

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
to do it like that so again right up

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.050 
to do it like that so again right up
right<00:02:51.560> inverted<00:02:52.549> up<00:02:52.730> right<00:02:53.629> up<00:02:54.139> twice<00:02:55.060> right

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
right inverted up right up twice right

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.140 
right inverted up right up twice right
inverted<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:57.709> Mayo<00:02:58.159> helped<00:02:58.609> you<00:02:58.700> solve<00:02:58.879> it

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
inverted this Mayo helped you solve it

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.289 
inverted this Mayo helped you solve it
so<00:02:59.420> it<00:03:00.349> has<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.280> have<00:03:01.609> to<00:03:01.730> get<00:03:01.879> the<00:03:01.970> yellow

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
so it has so you have to get the yellow

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.330 
so it has so you have to get the yellow
in<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:02.900> bottom<00:03:03.170> left<00:03:03.409> and<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:04.069> yellow

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
in the bottom left and the yellow

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.979 
in the bottom left and the yellow
therefore<00:03:04.879> yellows<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.389> bottom<00:03:05.599> left<00:03:05.810> in

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
therefore yellows in the bottom left in

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.170 
therefore yellows in the bottom left in
there<00:03:06.200> that's<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:07.010> you've<00:03:07.189> got<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:08.030> then

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
there that's it you've got it so then

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.899 
there that's it you've got it so then
the<00:03:08.389> algorithm<00:03:08.720> this<00:03:09.079> time<00:03:09.319> will<00:03:09.530> work<00:03:09.909> right

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
the algorithm this time will work right

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.039 
the algorithm this time will work right
up<00:03:11.750> right<00:03:12.129> inverted<00:03:13.129> pop<00:03:13.370> right<00:03:14.090> up<00:03:14.420> twice

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
up right inverted pop right up twice

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.159 
up right inverted pop right up twice
right<00:03:15.650> inverted<00:03:16.189> you<00:03:16.790> got<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.060> yellow<00:03:17.180> you

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
right inverted you got the yellow you

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.020 
right inverted you got the yellow you
got<00:03:18.319> the<00:03:18.440> red<00:03:18.590> hey<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.310> didn't<00:03:19.699> miss<00:03:19.790> any<00:03:19.940> of

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
got the red hey you didn't miss any of

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.409 
got the red hey you didn't miss any of
it<00:03:20.120> up

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:20.419 
it up

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.409 
it up
all<00:03:20.690> right<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.590> find<00:03:21.889> whichever<00:03:22.849> colors<00:03:23.209> match

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:23.419 
all right so find whichever colors match

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.770 
all right so find whichever colors match
at<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:23.959> top<00:03:24.340> look<00:03:25.340> it's<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.730> blue<00:03:25.910> so<00:03:26.540> turn

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
at the top look it's the blue so turn

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.020 
at the top look it's the blue so turn
the<00:03:26.959> blue<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.949> should<00:03:28.129> have<00:03:28.250> yellow<00:03:28.579> blue

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
the blue and you should have yellow blue

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.830 
the blue and you should have yellow blue
and<00:03:29.299> white

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
and white

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.289 
and white
that's<00:03:30.409> your<00:03:30.530> first<00:03:30.709> read<00:03:30.949> on<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:31.790> face<00:03:32.060> the

white on bottom last essential you have

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.300 
white on bottom last essential you have
trouble<00:03:38.299> walking<00:03:38.389> bottom<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.109> you<00:03:39.799> have<00:03:40.099> to

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
trouble walking bottom and you have to

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.280 
trouble walking bottom and you have to
have<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.549> yellow<00:03:40.790> on<00:03:40.909> top<00:03:40.940> Alps<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.139> way

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
have the yellow on top Alps this way

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.250 
have the yellow on top Alps this way
right<00:03:42.530> right<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:43.609> algorithm<00:03:44.359> will<00:03:44.930> solve

right right this algorithm will solve

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.990 
right right this algorithm will solve
the<00:03:45.440> creek<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.159> will<00:03:46.310> just<00:03:46.430> solve<00:03:46.669> the<00:03:46.819> cube

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
the creek it will just solve the cube

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.300 
the creek it will just solve the cube
fully<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:48.109> that's<00:03:48.349> it<00:03:48.500> that's<00:03:48.620> how<00:03:48.799> easy<00:03:49.069> is

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
fully and that's it that's how easy is

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.030 
fully and that's it that's how easy is
they<00:03:50.060> just<00:03:50.269> follow<00:03:50.419> this<00:03:50.659> carefully<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
they just follow this carefully the

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
algorithms as you've seen more well

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.869 
algorithms as you've seen more well
they've<00:03:54.709> been<00:03:54.739> up<00:03:55.099> on<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.280> screen<00:03:55.579> so<00:03:55.760> it

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
they've been up on the screen so it

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:56.939 
they've been up on the screen so it
couldn't<00:03:56.120> have<00:03:56.180> been<00:03:56.329> that<00:03:56.359> hard

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:56.949 
couldn't have been that hard

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:03.670 
couldn't have been that hard
okay<00:03:57.949> so<00:03:58.569> right<00:03:59.569> inverted<00:04:01.060> front<00:04:02.680> right
