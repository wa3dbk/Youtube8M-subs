00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
all right I've been kind of dissing this

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.310 
all right I've been kind of dissing this
digit<00:00:05.700> echoed<00:00:06.470> overdrive<00:00:07.470> tone<00:00:07.859> driver<00:00:08.160> pedal

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
digit echoed overdrive tone driver pedal

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.379 
digit echoed overdrive tone driver pedal
lately<00:00:10.460> my<00:00:11.460> reviews<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.910> think<00:00:11.940> I've<00:00:12.090> been<00:00:12.240> to

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
lately my reviews I think I've been to

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.299 
lately my reviews I think I've been to
reviews<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.870> them<00:00:12.960> one<00:00:13.139> against<00:00:13.500> ts808

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
reviews of them one against ts808

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.620 
reviews of them one against ts808
because<00:00:14.700> they<00:00:14.820> said<00:00:15.000> they<00:00:15.150> can<00:00:15.299> sound<00:00:15.540> like

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
because they said they can sound like

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.689 
because they said they can sound like
that<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.049> one<00:00:16.710> against<00:00:17.070> just<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.430> bunch<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that and one against just a bunch of

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.429 
that and one against just a bunch of
overdrive<00:00:18.090> pedals<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> shootout<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.109> I

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
overdrive pedals and a shootout and I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.800 
overdrive pedals and a shootout and I
always<00:00:20.100> say<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.430> really<00:00:20.580> digital<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.270> but

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
always say it's really digital it is but

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.140 
always say it's really digital it is but
it's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> pretty<00:00:22.769> good<00:00:22.980> over<00:00:23.220> I've<00:00:23.369> even<00:00:24.060> though

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
it's a pretty good over I've even though

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.279 
it's a pretty good over I've even though
it's<00:00:24.269> digital<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> thought<00:00:25.080> I'd<00:00:25.199> do

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
it's digital so what I thought I'd do

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.970 
it's digital so what I thought I'd do
today<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.980> thought<00:00:26.760> I'd<00:00:26.910> run<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> whole

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
today was I thought I'd run the whole

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.380 
today was I thought I'd run the whole
spectrum<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.130> what<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.490> pedal<00:00:29.789> can<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.150> I

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
spectrum of what this pedal can do I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.049 
spectrum of what this pedal can do I
usually<00:00:31.260> only<00:00:31.619> leave<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.040> morph<00:00:32.279> knob<00:00:32.550> all

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
usually only leave the morph knob all

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.990 
usually only leave the morph knob all
the<00:00:33.120> way<00:00:33.239> up<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:34.130> that<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.370> most<00:00:35.760> like

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the way up because that was most like

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.490 
the way up because that was most like
all<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> other<00:00:36.360> OverDrive's<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.350> was

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
all the other OverDrive's that I was

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.520 
all the other OverDrive's that I was
running<00:00:38.390> but<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.510> gonna<00:00:39.660> play<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> whole

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
running but I'm gonna play the whole

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.260 
running but I'm gonna play the whole
thing<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.070> more<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.550> think<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
thing this is more like I think this is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.690 
thing this is more like I think this is
kind<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> mid<00:00:42.809> scoop<00:00:43.140> kind<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> saying

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
kind of like a mid scoop kind of saying

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.389 
kind of like a mid scoop kind of saying
like<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.030> controls<00:00:45.539> your<00:00:45.660> mids<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:46.079> lot<00:00:46.399> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
like this controls your mids a lot the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.100 
like this controls your mids a lot the
other<00:00:47.520> stuff<00:00:47.730> controls<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.120> tone<00:00:48.329> gain<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
other stuff controls your tone gain and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.200 
other stuff controls your tone gain and
level<00:00:50.870> I'm<00:00:51.870> gonna<00:00:52.050> run<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.500> thing<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.640> I'll

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
level I'm gonna run this thing and I'll

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.430 
level I'm gonna run this thing and I'll
try<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:54.960> fair<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.620> possible<00:00:57.109> I'm<00:00:58.109> gonna
