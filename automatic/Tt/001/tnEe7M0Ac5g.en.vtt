really not a fan of that but looking on
the<00:01:30.000> bright<00:01:30.299> side<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.290> motivated<00:01:31.829> me

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
the bright side it actually motivated me

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.609 
the bright side it actually motivated me
to<00:01:32.130> study<00:01:32.640> almost<00:01:33.240> every<00:01:33.659> day<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:34.079> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
to study almost every day and it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.080 
to study almost every day and it's
easier<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.159> study<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.549> smaller<00:01:35.850> increments

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
easier to study in smaller increments

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.569 
easier to study in smaller increments
right<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> good<00:01:37.710> thing<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.979> you're<00:01:38.400> with

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
right but the good thing is you're with

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.340 
right but the good thing is you're with
like<00:01:38.759> 10<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.390> other<00:01:39.570> nursing<00:01:39.990> students

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
like 10 or so other nursing students

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.499 
like 10 or so other nursing students
that<00:01:40.470> are<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.979> boat<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.400> are<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
that are in the same boat you are so it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
that are in the same boat you are so it
makes<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.810> more<00:01:42.960> fun<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.799> there<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.040> 10
