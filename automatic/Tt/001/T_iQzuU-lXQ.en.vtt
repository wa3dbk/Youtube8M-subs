take<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.629> look<00:00:59.809> at<00:00:59.899> this<00:00:59.960> bad<00:01:00.199> boy

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
take a look at this bad boy

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.340 
take a look at this bad boy
these<00:01:01.940> are<00:01:02.149> some<00:01:02.420> of<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:02.570> biggest<00:01:02.780> capacitors

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
these are some of the biggest capacitors

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.510 
these are some of the biggest capacitors
I've<00:01:03.530> ever<00:01:03.679> seen<00:01:03.859> these<00:01:03.980> these<00:01:04.040> are<00:01:04.310> like<00:01:04.400> the

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
I've ever seen these these are like the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.070 
I've ever seen these these are like the
capacitors<00:01:04.910> you<00:01:05.000> see<00:01:05.150> on<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.330> giant<00:01:05.660> graphics

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
capacitors you see on the giant graphics

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.180 
capacitors you see on the giant graphics
cards<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.380> those<00:01:06.560> things<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:06.920> know<00:01:07.010> there's

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
cards and those things you know there's

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.160 
cards and those things you know there's
always<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.090> much<00:01:08.270> power<00:01:08.510> going<00:01:08.780> through<00:01:09.020> those

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
always so much power going through those

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.050 
always so much power going through those
well<00:01:09.830> they've<00:01:10.040> included<00:01:10.310> them<00:01:10.580> on<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:10.790> board

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
well they've included them on this board

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.430 
well they've included them on this board
so<00:01:11.180> you're<00:01:11.480> not<00:01:11.750> gonna<00:01:11.870> have<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.140> worry<00:01:12.290> about

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
so you're not gonna have to worry about

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.920 
so you're not gonna have to worry about
this<00:01:12.560> thing<00:01:12.620> frying<00:01:13.070> and<00:01:13.310> it's<00:01:13.400> gonna<00:01:13.520> last

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
this thing frying and it's gonna last

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.180 
this thing frying and it's gonna last
years<00:01:14.930> longer<00:01:15.470> than<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.770> other<00:01:15.920> boards

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
years longer than the other boards

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.670 
years longer than the other boards
that's<00:01:16.880> very<00:01:17.180> nice<00:01:17.450> let's<00:01:18.200> walk<00:01:18.350> around<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
that's very nice let's walk around the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.230 
that's very nice let's walk around the
board<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.130> in<00:01:19.370> turn<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.580> leaner<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.910> shoot<00:01:20.060> some

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
board and in turn a leaner to shoot some

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.670 
board and in turn a leaner to shoot some
of<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.360> features<00:01:20.690> and<00:01:20.870> we'll<00:01:21.260> tell<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.470> why

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
of the features and we'll tell you why

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.770 
of the features and we'll tell you why
this<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:22.190> still<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.880> good<00:01:23.090> motherboard<00:01:23.600> and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
this is still a good motherboard and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.200 
this is still a good motherboard and
very<00:01:24.530> very<00:01:24.950> good<00:01:25.220> for<00:01:25.370> the<00:01:25.430> price<00:01:25.670> range<00:01:25.970> so

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
very very good for the price range so

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.150 
very very good for the price range so
come<00:01:26.720> on<00:01:26.840> down<00:01:26.990> let's<00:01:27.170> take<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.380> look<00:01:27.590> right

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
come on down let's take a look right

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.640 
come on down let's take a look right
here<00:01:28.330> now<00:01:29.330> they've<00:01:29.570> they've<00:01:30.020> color-coded<00:01:30.560> the

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
here now they've they've color-coded the

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.830 
here now they've they've color-coded the
RAM<00:01:30.830> slots<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:31.820> you<00:01:32.210> know<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:32.390> put<00:01:32.540> one<00:01:32.690> in<00:01:32.780> the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
RAM slots so you know you put one in the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.940 
RAM slots so you know you put one in the
green<00:01:33.050> then<00:01:33.320> one<00:01:33.410> of<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> orange<00:01:33.830> then

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
green then one of the orange then

we move over here that is your PCI
Express<00:02:02.690> slot<00:02:02.990> now<00:02:03.380> they've<00:02:03.560> done<00:02:03.680> something

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
Express slot now they've done something

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.380 
Express slot now they've done something
a<00:02:04.160> little<00:02:04.430> different<00:02:04.790> with<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.000> PCI<00:02:05.300> Express

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
a little different with the PCI Express

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.720 
a little different with the PCI Express
if<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.200> put<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.500> one<00:02:06.680> graphics<00:02:07.130> card<00:02:07.340> that

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
if you put in one graphics card that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.760 
if you put in one graphics card that
runs<00:02:08.030> at<00:02:08.210> sixteen<00:02:08.660> speed<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.259> you<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.649> you

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
runs at sixteen speed and you get you

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.230 
runs at sixteen speed and you get you
know<00:02:09.860> full<00:02:10.190> power<00:02:10.369> out<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> lot<00:02:11.150> of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
know full power out of that and a lot of

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.220 
know full power out of that and a lot of
times<00:02:11.390> with<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.570> new<00:02:11.660> graphics<00:02:11.990> cards<00:02:12.170> you

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
times with the new graphics cards you

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.089 
times with the new graphics cards you
put<00:02:12.380> one<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.590> them<00:02:12.710> in<00:02:12.800> there

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
put one of them in there

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.220 
put one of them in there
you're<00:02:13.310> good<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.609> go<00:02:13.640> but<00:02:13.969> when<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.900> put<00:02:15.109> in

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
you're good to go but when you put in

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.229 
you're good to go but when you put in
two<00:02:15.680> graphics<00:02:16.129> cards<00:02:16.159> it<00:02:16.670> doesn't<00:02:16.969> run<00:02:17.090> at

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
two graphics cards it doesn't run at

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.030 
two graphics cards it doesn't run at
sixteen<00:02:17.569> speed<00:02:17.810> each<00:02:17.989> they<00:02:18.499> share<00:02:18.829> that

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
sixteen speed each they share that

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.069 
sixteen speed each they share that
sixteen<00:02:19.400> speed<00:02:19.639> bandwidth<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.269> each<00:02:20.480> runs<00:02:20.870> at

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.079 
sixteen speed bandwidth and each runs at

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.989 
sixteen speed bandwidth and each runs at
eight<00:02:21.260> speed<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.129> you're<00:02:22.280> sacrificing<00:02:22.519> a

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:22.999 
eight speed so you're sacrificing a

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.580 
eight speed so you're sacrificing a
little<00:02:23.299> bit<00:02:23.389> of<00:02:23.480> speed<00:02:23.689> there<00:02:23.900> but<00:02:24.319> you're

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
little bit of speed there but you're

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.309 
little bit of speed there but you're
gaining<00:02:25.219> stability<00:02:25.849> so<00:02:26.359> you<00:02:27.079> know<00:02:27.170> it's

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
gaining stability so you know it's

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.530 
gaining stability so you know it's
give-and-take<00:02:27.650> for<00:02:28.249> the<00:02:28.340> money<00:02:28.489> very<00:02:29.239> very

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
give-and-take for the money very very

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.330 
give-and-take for the money very very
good<00:02:29.750> this<00:02:30.230> little<00:02:30.500> slot<00:02:30.650> that<00:02:30.859> your<00:02:31.040> PCI

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
good this little slot that your PCI

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.640 
good this little slot that your PCI
Express<00:02:31.639> 1x<00:02:32.299> slot<00:02:32.569> that's<00:02:32.989> good<00:02:33.200> for<00:02:33.379> a<00:02:33.409> lot<00:02:33.530> of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
Express 1x slot that's good for a lot of

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.839 
Express 1x slot that's good for a lot of

now if we move back a little bit right
here<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:14.569> ridiculous<00:03:15.500> copper<00:03:15.829> thing<00:03:16.010> that

here this ridiculous copper thing that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.830 
here this ridiculous copper thing that
is<00:03:16.549> your<00:03:16.730> heat<00:03:16.909> pipe<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.629> help

regulates the temperature of the board

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.849 
regulates the temperature of the board
and<00:03:19.909> it's<00:03:20.479> very<00:03:20.780> necessary<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:21.769> know

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
and it's very necessary and you know

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.069 
and it's very necessary and you know
since<00:03:22.040> they<00:03:22.159> included<00:03:22.909> this<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.629> will<00:03:23.870> allow

like<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.019> said<00:03:54.229> for<00:03:54.859> me<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.639> most<00:03:55.879> stable

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
like I said for me it is the most stable

in force board that I've seen so I give

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.420 
in force board that I've seen so I give
it<00:03:58.849> a<00:03:58.879> thumbs<00:03:59.209> up<00:03:59.479> for<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.169> factor<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.310> with
