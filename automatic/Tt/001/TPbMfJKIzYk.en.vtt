when it's done the food
and<00:02:10.140> then<00:02:10.650> here<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.460> shows<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.090> different

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and then here it shows you the different

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.720 
and then here it shows you the different
steps<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.230> take<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.560> make<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.070> food<00:02:14.340> I

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
steps that you take to make the food I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.150 
steps that you take to make the food I
think<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.660> great<00:02:15.870> idea

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
think that's a great idea

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.770 
think that's a great idea

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
green beans to make the steak I got out

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.380 
green beans to make the steak I got out
the<00:02:28.050> mold<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.860> steak<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.400> some<00:02:29.970> brown

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
the mold for the steak and some brown

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.320 
the mold for the steak and some brown
play-doh<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.800> I'm<00:02:32.070> just<00:02:32.340> gonna<00:02:32.550> put<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.030> in

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
play-doh so I'm just gonna put it in

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.260 
play-doh so I'm just gonna put it in
here<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:34.160> push<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.310> down<00:02:35.490> just<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.910> little<00:02:35.940> bit

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
here and push it down just a little bit

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.480 
here and push it down just a little bit
because<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.020> is<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> book<00:02:37.500> mold<00:02:37.860> which<00:02:38.130> means

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
because this is a book mold which means

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.250 
because this is a book mold which means
that<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.840> squeeze<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
that you squeeze it like this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.230 
that you squeeze it like this
remember<00:02:43.260> it<00:02:43.320> looks<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.650> grill<00:02:44.010> and<00:02:44.310> then

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
remember it looks like a grill and then

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.810 
remember it looks like a grill and then
you<00:02:45.420> open<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.790> makes<00:02:48.330> our<00:02:48.510> steak<00:02:49.820> we

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
you open it and that makes our steak we

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.810 
you open it and that makes our steak we
just<00:02:51.030> have<00:02:51.210> to<00:02:51.330> take<00:02:51.540> off<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:52.290> excess

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
just have to take off the excess

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.730 
just have to take off the excess
play-doh<00:02:53.820> and<00:02:54.270> then<00:02:54.600> let's<00:02:54.930> throw<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
play-doh and then let's throw it in the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.420 
play-doh and then let's throw it in the
skillet<00:02:57.560> there<00:02:58.560> we<00:02:58.860> go

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
skillet there we go

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.450 
skillet there we go
it's<00:02:59.700> gonna<00:02:59.880> fry<00:03:00.210> away<00:03:00.950> while<00:03:01.950> that's<00:03:02.190> cooking

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
it's gonna fry away while that's cooking

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.330 
it's gonna fry away while that's cooking
let's<00:03:03.390> make<00:03:03.660> some<00:03:03.900> green<00:03:04.080> beans<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.980> make<00:03:05.190> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
let's make some green beans to make the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.110 
let's make some green beans to make the
green<00:03:05.550> beans<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.060> grab<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.690> extruder<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:08.120> I

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
green beans I grab the extruder and I

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.510 
green beans I grab the extruder and I
grabbed<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.510> knife<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.740> grab<00:03:10.950> some<00:03:10.980> green

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
grabbed a knife and I grab some green

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.780 
grabbed a knife and I grab some green
play-doh<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.870> let's<00:03:13.080> open<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:13.620> up<00:03:13.680> here<00:03:13.980> and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
play-doh so let's open this up here and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.520 
play-doh so let's open this up here and
put<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.660> play-doh<00:03:15.870> into<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.330> opening<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
put the play-doh into the opening and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.770 
put the play-doh into the opening and
then<00:03:19.530> let's<00:03:19.830> figure<00:03:20.100> out<00:03:20.280> what<00:03:21.030> green<00:03:21.540> bean

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
then let's figure out what green bean

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.780 
then let's figure out what green bean
should<00:03:22.050> look<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.710> don't<00:03:22.890> think<00:03:23.250> that's<00:03:23.490> it

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
should look like I don't think that's it

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.820 
should look like I don't think that's it
I<00:03:24.080> think<00:03:25.370> maybe<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:27.090> one<00:03:27.570> will<00:03:28.320> be<00:03:28.500> what<00:03:28.710> we

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
I think maybe this one will be what we

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.480 
I think maybe this one will be what we
use<00:03:29.090> ok<00:03:30.090> watch<00:03:30.510> as<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.900> squeeze<00:03:31.200> out<00:03:31.410> some<00:03:31.710> green

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
use ok watch as I squeeze out some green

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.400 
use ok watch as I squeeze out some green
beans<00:03:32.960> here<00:03:33.960> they<00:03:34.110> come<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:36.080> I'm<00:03:37.080> gonna<00:03:37.170> use

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410
