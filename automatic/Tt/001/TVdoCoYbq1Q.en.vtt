pricking just not quite as easily as on
this<00:03:43.430> one<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.910> it's<00:03:44.569> an<00:03:44.720> extra<00:03:45.260> light<00:03:45.440> duty

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
this one and it's an extra light duty

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.670 
this one and it's an extra light duty
for<00:03:45.950> around<00:03:47.140> very<00:03:48.140> well<00:03:48.470> tended<00:03:49.870> Gardens<00:03:50.870> with

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
for around very well tended Gardens with

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.250 
for around very well tended Gardens with
friable<00:03:52.250> soils<00:03:52.819> this<00:03:53.239> is<00:03:53.450> an<00:03:53.569> excellent<00:03:53.900> tool

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
friable soils this is an excellent tool

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.650 
friable soils this is an excellent tool
it<00:03:54.799> tends<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.190> self<00:03:55.549> sharpen<00:03:56.090> because<00:03:56.510> the

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
it tends to self sharpen because the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.110 
it tends to self sharpen because the
blade<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:57.319> very<00:03:58.040> thin<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.609> slightly

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
blade is is very thin and slightly

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.259 
blade is is very thin and slightly
cupped<00:03:59.660> and<00:03:59.989> so<00:04:00.889> it<00:04:01.130> sharpens<00:04:01.670> itself<00:04:01.790> at<00:04:02.180> the

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
cupped and so it sharpens itself at the

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.640 
cupped and so it sharpens itself at the
edges<00:04:02.600> where<00:04:02.780> most<00:04:02.959> of<00:04:03.079> these<00:04:03.170> other<00:04:03.410> tools

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650

you<00:04:03.889> have<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.130> file<00:04:04.340> them<00:04:04.609> occasionally<00:04:04.940> and

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
you have to file them occasionally and

right<00:04:08.450> here<00:04:08.480> is<00:04:08.959> a<00:04:09.670> tool<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:11.000> not<00:04:11.180> around

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
right here is a tool that is not around

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.690 
right here is a tool that is not around
very<00:04:11.870> much<00:04:12.079> anymore<00:04:12.410> this<00:04:12.799> one<00:04:13.069> right<00:04:13.280> here<00:04:13.519> is

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
very much anymore this one right here is

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.640 
very much anymore this one right here is
the<00:04:13.850> only<00:04:13.880> version<00:04:14.569> of<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:14.959> still<00:04:15.350> on<00:04:15.530> the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
the only version of that still on the

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.349 
the only version of that still on the
market<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:17.299> a<00:04:17.419> tool<00:04:17.720> that<00:04:17.750> that<00:04:19.359> floats

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
market and it's a tool that that floats

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.080 
market and it's a tool that that floats
over<00:04:20.600> soil<00:04:21.200> it<00:04:21.440> has<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.650> bit<00:04:21.889> of<00:04:21.919> flex<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.460> it<00:04:22.580> and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
over soil it has a bit of flex to it and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.969 
over soil it has a bit of flex to it and
so<00:04:23.300> on<00:04:23.450> uneven<00:04:24.139> ground

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
so on uneven ground

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.940 
so on uneven ground
it's<00:04:25.760> excellent<00:04:26.300> tool<00:04:26.660> because<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.560> keeps<00:04:27.770> you
