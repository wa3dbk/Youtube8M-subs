instead<00:00:06.240> at<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.480> other<00:00:06.600> day<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:06.870> my

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
instead at the other day for my

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.140 
instead at the other day for my
recruitment<00:00:07.649> challenge<00:00:08.069> thing<00:00:08.250> but<00:00:08.519> I'd<00:00:09.090> only

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
recruitment challenge thing but I'd only

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.520 
recruitment challenge thing but I'd only
think<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:09.570> counted<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> reason<00:00:10.349> why<00:00:10.440> I'm

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
think I counted and the reason why I'm

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.610 
think I counted and the reason why I'm
doing<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.010> actually<00:00:11.160> because<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> that

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
doing this is actually because of that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.410 
doing this is actually because of that
so<00:00:13.620> basically<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.000> unlike<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.240> full

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
so basically I have it unlike a full

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.910 
so basically I have it unlike a full
commentary<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> long<00:00:16.170> time<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.590> told<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
commentary in a long time like told a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.170 
commentary in a long time like told a
story<00:00:17.100> but<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.369> left<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:17.609> cut<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.940> off<00:00:18.029> in

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
story but we left like cut it off in

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.510

one or two tries on a video and then I
found<00:00:33.540> myself<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.380> literally<00:00:34.590> took<00:00:34.680> me<00:00:34.770> two

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950

found myself that literally took me two
hours<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.430> took<00:00:35.579> me<00:00:35.670> two<00:00:35.730> hours<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> do

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
hours you don't took me two hours to do

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.260 
hours you don't took me two hours to do
that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
that

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.549 
that
it's<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:36.809> because<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> clip<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.440> anything

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it's not because of the clip or anything

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.530 
it's not because of the clip or anything
it's<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.770> because<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.340> would<00:00:38.910> choke<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.420> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it's just because I would choke and I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.170 
it's just because I would choke and I
wouldn't<00:00:39.840> know<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.079> say<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.180> don't

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
wouldn't know what to say and I don't

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.459 
wouldn't know what to say and I don't
know<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.600> lost<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.170> think<00:00:43.379> it's

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
know how I just lost that I think it's

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.450 
know how I just lost that I think it's
because<00:00:43.620> I've<00:00:43.710> been<00:00:43.829> doing<00:00:43.980> all<00:00:44.160> these<00:00:44.309> like

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
because I've been doing all these like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
because I've been doing all these like
no<00:00:44.940> cut<00:00:45.180> up<00:00:45.300> commentary<00:00:45.750> saw<00:00:46.020> been<00:00:46.350> like

no cut up commentary saw been like

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.900 
no cut up commentary saw been like
Houston<00:00:46.920> messing<00:00:47.219> off<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> everything<00:00:47.760> else

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
