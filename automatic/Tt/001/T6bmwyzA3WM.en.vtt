00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
finished yet so this is part to burn I'm

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.509 
finished yet so this is part to burn I'm
gonna<00:00:09.210> go<00:00:09.480> over<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.840> articulation<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.040> guess

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
gonna go over the articulation I guess

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.829 
gonna go over the articulation I guess
this<00:00:12.240> figure<00:00:12.719> this<00:00:13.049> should<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> short<00:00:13.860> video

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
this figure this should be a short video

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.380

transformers<00:00:25.859> was<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.279> working<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
transformers was the working of the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.580 
transformers was the working of the
joints<00:00:27.689> making<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.680> robot<00:00:30.140> poseable<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.320> well

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
joints making a robot poseable as well

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.090 
joints making a robot poseable as well
as<00:00:31.800> being<00:00:32.460> able<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> turn<00:00:33.180> into<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> car<00:00:34.070> so<00:00:35.070> you

wider<00:00:43.370> these<00:00:44.370> plastic<00:00:45.059> parts<00:00:45.390> are<00:00:45.539> connected

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
wider these plastic parts are connected

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.220 
wider these plastic parts are connected
to<00:00:46.260> his<00:00:46.440> own<00:00:46.710> legs<00:00:47.300> just<00:00:48.300> cool<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> mech<00:00:51.840> alive

elbow joint is kind of weird because um
it's<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.090> double-jointed<00:01:22.340> see<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.380> could

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.580 

make<00:01:29.040> him<00:01:29.250> bend<00:01:29.580> his<00:01:29.760> arm<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.390> much

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.609 

but<00:01:37.490> sometimes<00:01:37.789> after<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.659> transform<00:01:39.409> it

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
but sometimes after you transform it

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.399 
but sometimes after you transform it
will<00:01:39.920> have<00:01:40.100> a<00:01:40.130> weird<00:01:40.549> position<00:01:40.880> like<00:01:41.810> this<00:01:41.840> you

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
will have a weird position like this you

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.800 
will have a weird position like this you
see<00:01:43.390> but<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.689> can<00:01:45.530> make<00:01:45.649> it<00:01:45.859> straight<00:01:46.810> there's

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
see but you can make it straight there's

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.160 
see but you can make it straight there's
no<00:01:48.109> swivel<00:01:48.770> on<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.369> arm<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:53.509> head<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.959> on<00:01:54.140> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
no swivel on the arm the head is on a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.429 
no swivel on the arm the head is on a
ball<00:01:54.289> joint<00:01:54.500> at<00:01:55.459> first<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.990> head<00:02:00.229> would

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
ball joint at first the the head would

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.910 
ball joint at first the the head would
pop<00:02:00.740> off<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:01.039> lot<00:02:01.719> but<00:02:02.719> since<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.350> popped<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:03.859> back

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
pop off a lot but since I popped it back

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.630 
pop off a lot but since I popped it back
on<00:02:04.459> after<00:02:05.209> pushing<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.200> down<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:06.890> popping<00:02:07.490> it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
on after pushing it down and popping it

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.559 
on after pushing it down and popping it
in<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:09.110> hasn't<00:02:09.319> come<00:02:09.709> off<00:02:09.950> yet<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:11.150> chin

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
in it hasn't come off yet the chin

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.160 
in it hasn't come off yet the chin
limits<00:02:12.560> any<00:02:12.849> articulation<00:02:13.849> so<00:02:14.780> there's<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
limits any articulation so there's the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.199 
limits any articulation so there's the
back<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.650> head<00:02:16.269> because<00:02:18.670> there's<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.760> part

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
back of the head because there's a part

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.539 
back of the head because there's a part
of<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.720> neck<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.090> can<00:02:23.329> see<00:02:23.599> this<00:02:23.840> part

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
of the neck that you can see this part

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.650 
of the neck that you can see this part
it<00:02:25.549> gets<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.209> way<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:28.819> letting<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.390> head

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it gets in the way of letting the head

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:42.220 
it gets in the way of letting the head
move<00:02:29.959> all<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.349> way<00:02:30.379> around<00:02:40.359> this<00:02:41.359> guy<00:02:41.690> has<00:02:41.930> no

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230

feet he just has a wheels for feet which
is<00:02:46.760> kind<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.239> cool<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:47.780> kind<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.440> reminds<00:02:48.799> me<00:02:48.980> of

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
is kind of cool it kind of reminds me of

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.289 
is kind of cool it kind of reminds me of
Dom's<00:02:49.639> from<00:02:50.380> mobile<00:02:51.380> suit<00:02:51.590> gundam<00:02:52.090> they<00:02:53.090> would

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
Dom's from mobile suit gundam they would

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.839 
Dom's from mobile suit gundam they would
slide<00:02:53.959> around<00:02:55.569> instead<00:02:56.569> of<00:02:56.630> walking<00:02:57.639> so<00:02:58.639> this

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
slide around instead of walking so this

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.629 
slide around instead of walking so this
guy's<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.150> slider<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:02.349> was<00:03:03.349> experimenting<00:03:03.980> like

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
guy's a slider I was experimenting like

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.920 
guy's a slider I was experimenting like
you<00:03:05.450> could<00:03:05.660> invent<00:03:06.079> your<00:03:06.319> own<00:03:06.380> fan<00:03:06.980> mode<00:03:07.930> like

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
you could invent your own fan mode like

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.000 
you could invent your own fan mode like
lets<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:13.280> could<00:03:13.489> say<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:14.169> this<00:03:15.169> is<00:03:15.440> his

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
lets you could say that this is his

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.309 
lets you could say that this is his
flying<00:03:16.669> mode<00:03:18.040> let<00:03:19.040> me<00:03:19.130> go<00:03:19.340> like<00:03:19.519> that

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:33.280 

you<00:03:24.319> can<00:03:24.530> fly<00:03:30.519> um<00:03:31.519> would<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.450> recommend<00:03:32.750> this

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
you can fly um would I recommend this

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.539 
you can fly um would I recommend this
figure<00:03:34.269> yes<00:03:35.269> of<00:03:35.780> course<00:03:36.230> it's<00:03:37.129> a<00:03:37.220> cool<00:03:37.519> car

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
figure yes of course it's a cool car
