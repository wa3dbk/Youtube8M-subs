cuz<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.340> how<00:02:26.700> us<00:02:27.000> our<00:02:27.300> characters<00:02:27.870> was<00:02:28.050> so

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
cuz I how us our characters was so

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.680 
cuz I how us our characters was so
strong<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:29.640> didn't<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.000> didn't<00:02:30.240> actually<00:02:30.330> seem

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
strong it didn't it didn't actually seem

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.970 
strong it didn't it didn't actually seem
that<00:02:30.840> bad<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.050> think<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.500> because<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:31.860> went

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that bad I think it's because we went

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.200 
that bad I think it's because we went
into<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> fire<00:02:32.400> thinking<00:02:32.760> was<00:02:32.910> gonna<00:02:33.000> win

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
into the fire thinking was gonna win

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.150 
into the fire thinking was gonna win
easily<00:02:33.540> that's<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:34.650> that's<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.040> reason

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
easily that's I think that's the reason

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.530 
easily that's I think that's the reason
why<00:02:35.370> every<00:02:35.610> give<00:02:35.730> us<00:02:35.820> more<00:02:35.970> trouble<00:02:36.060> domain<00:02:36.450> is

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
why every give us more trouble domain is

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.000 
why every give us more trouble domain is
actually<00:02:36.630> now<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.230> know<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.500> strong<00:02:37.710> he<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.890> I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
actually now I know a strong he is I

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.680 
actually now I know a strong he is I
think<00:02:38.280> I'll<00:02:38.370> block<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.580> little<00:02:38.730> bit<00:02:38.910> more<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.660> I

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
think I'll block a little bit more so I

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.090 
think I'll block a little bit more so I
figure<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.050> she<00:02:40.230> had<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.500> defeat<00:02:40.740> him<00:02:40.860> quite

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
figure that she had to defeat him quite

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.000 
figure that she had to defeat him quite
