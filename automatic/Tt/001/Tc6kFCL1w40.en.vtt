I<00:00:15.269> mean<00:00:15.680> it's<00:00:16.680> with<00:00:17.009> growth<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.670> think<00:00:17.849> is<00:00:18.270> the

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
I mean it's with growth I think is the

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.359 
I mean it's with growth I think is the
reason<00:00:18.630> why<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:18.989> see<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.529> much<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:19.770> you<00:00:20.279> know

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
reason why you see so much of you know

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.330 
reason why you see so much of you know
the<00:00:21.180> comparisons<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:22.529> they<00:00:22.919> have<00:00:23.040> seen

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the comparisons because they have seen

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.310 
the comparisons because they have seen
you<00:00:23.820> know<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.329> past<00:00:24.509> they've<00:00:24.840> seen<00:00:25.079> some

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
well-dressed athletes whatever but the

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.389 
well-dressed athletes whatever but the
growth<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.509> what<00:00:30.899> what's<00:00:31.649> evolved<00:00:32.160> over<00:00:32.250> a

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
growth of what what's evolved over a

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.009 
growth of what what's evolved over a
period<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.759> time<00:00:33.469> is<00:00:34.550> is<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.789> I<00:00:36.059> guess<00:00:36.539> a<00:00:36.570> lot<00:00:36.989> of

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
period of time is is is I guess a lot of

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:39.229 
period of time is is is I guess a lot of
the<00:00:37.170> blame<00:00:37.289> is<00:00:37.590> what<00:00:38.399> they're<00:00:38.519> not<00:00:38.609> society<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the blame is what they're not society to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.020 
the blame is what they're not society to
know<00:00:39.570> now<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.469> way<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.160> there<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.609> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
know now it's it's way out there and you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.340 
know now it's it's way out there and you

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
know obviously have to take some of the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.250 
know obviously have to take some of the
credit<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.890> know<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.190> terms<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.929> blame<00:00:45.929> either

kids<00:00:49.350> are<00:00:49.499> coming<00:00:49.679> in<00:00:49.890> today<00:00:50.039> looking<00:00:50.550> at<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
kids are coming in today looking at the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
kids are coming in today looking at the
business<00:00:51.179> side<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.420> what<00:00:52.170> their<00:00:52.710> skills<00:00:53.070> could

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
business side of what their skills could

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
business side of what their skills could
provide<00:00:53.519> for<00:00:53.760> him<00:00:53.850> instead<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.179> looking<00:00:54.359> at

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
provide for him instead of looking at

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
provide for him instead of looking at
what<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.839> game<00:00:55.109> is<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.530> provide<00:00:55.739> for

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
what the game is going to provide for

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.239 
what the game is going to provide for
him<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.249> mean<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.620> lot<00:00:58.769> more<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.129> that

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249 
him so I mean it's a lot more of that

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.220 
him so I mean it's a lot more of that
but<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.519> think<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.819> it's<00:01:00.390> unfair<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:00.839> I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
but I think that it's unfair because I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.319 
but I think that it's unfair because I
mean<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:02.429> tough<00:01:02.640> pressure<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.239> have

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
mean it's tough pressure that they have

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
mean it's tough pressure that they have
to<00:01:03.449> deal<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.320> we<00:01:04.440> never<00:01:04.620> had<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.980> deal

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
to deal with and we never had to deal

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.740 
to deal with and we never had to deal
with<00:01:05.190> that<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.610> they've<00:01:06.240> done<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> good<00:01:06.689> job

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
with that and they've done a good job

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.679 
with that and they've done a good job
and<00:01:07.259> still<00:01:07.439> been<00:01:08.310> able<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.640> showcase<00:01:09.240> their

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689
