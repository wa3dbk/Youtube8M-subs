later<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.390> oh<00:01:24.509> where's<00:01:24.720> Pluto<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
later you're like oh where's Pluto and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.660 
later you're like oh where's Pluto and
you<00:01:25.259> realize<00:01:25.470> oh<00:01:25.650> he<00:01:25.920> actually<00:01:26.100> loved<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you realize oh he actually loved you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.710 
you realize oh he actually loved you
might<00:01:26.790> ask<00:01:26.909> yourself<00:01:27.090> why<00:01:27.420> don't<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.630> know

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
might ask yourself why don't we know

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.060 
might ask yourself why don't we know
more<00:01:27.840> about<00:01:27.960> Pluto<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:28.920> tell

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
more about Pluto to which I would tell

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
more about Pluto to which I would tell
you<00:01:29.250> don't<00:01:29.670> ask<00:01:29.790> yourself<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.240> ask<00:01:30.420> me

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
you don't ask yourself that ask me

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.850 
you don't ask yourself that ask me
because<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.930> had<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.200> answers<00:01:31.470> everyone's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860

what's<00:01:59.070> currently<00:01:59.340> going<00:01:59.399> faster<00:01:59.880> than<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
what's currently going faster than it so

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.249 
what's currently going faster than it so
I'm<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> assume<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.689> Superman

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I'm just going to assume that Superman

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.510 
I'm just going to assume that Superman
at<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.500> point<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.799> time<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.070> got<00:02:02.219> really<00:02:02.369> mad

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
at one point in time just got really mad

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.830 
at one point in time just got really mad
grab<00:02:02.850> something<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.299> checked<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.689> at<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
grab something and checked it up at the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.060 
grab something and checked it up at the
sky<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.079> hard<00:02:04.290> as<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.439> could<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.710> mean<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> Pope

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
sky as hard as you could I mean the Pope

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.380 
sky as hard as you could I mean the Pope
arrives<00:02:05.189> at<00:02:05.520> Pluto<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.909> won't<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.149> able<00:02:06.270> to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
arrives at Pluto it won't be able to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.340 
arrives at Pluto it won't be able to
land<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.689> it<00:02:06.840> because<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.049> would<00:02:07.229> require

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
land on it because that would require

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
land on it because that would require
way<00:02:07.619> too<00:02:07.680> much<00:02:07.890> fuel<00:02:08.099> because<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.520> basicly

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
way too much fuel because you basicly

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.979 
way too much fuel because you basicly
have<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> slam<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.300> reverse<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.660> fire<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
have to slam it in reverse and fire the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.240 
have to slam it in reverse and fire the
Rockets<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.440> opposite<00:02:10.739> direction<00:02:10.830> order

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
Rockets in the opposite direction order

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.650 
Rockets in the opposite direction order
to<00:02:11.340> slow<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.610> down<00:02:11.640> enough<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.060> safely<00:02:12.270> land<00:02:12.480> on

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
to slow it down enough to safely land on

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.390 
to slow it down enough to safely land on
the<00:02:12.720> surface<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.530> instead<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.010> will<00:02:14.069> be<00:02:14.190> doing

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
the surface so instead it will be doing

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.430 
the surface so instead it will be doing
a<00:02:14.489> flyby<00:02:14.700> where<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.239> just<00:02:15.330> goes<00:02:15.480> Jupiter<00:02:16.319> will

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
a flyby where it just goes Jupiter will

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.780 
a flyby where it just goes Jupiter will
also<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.739> lending<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.040> hand<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.310> get<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.610> probe

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
also be lending a hand to get the probe

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.699 
also be lending a hand to get the probe
there<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.060> time<00:02:18.300> by<00:02:18.599> giving<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.170> gravity

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
there on time by giving it a gravity

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.229 
there on time by giving it a gravity
assist<00:02:19.739> which<00:02:20.430> is<00:02:20.520> pretty<00:02:20.610> nice<00:02:20.790> considering

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
assist which is pretty nice considering

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.550 
assist which is pretty nice considering
the<00:02:21.300> only<00:02:21.450> thing<00:02:21.569> gravity<00:02:21.900> ever<00:02:22.020> assists<00:02:22.410> me

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the only thing gravity ever assists me

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.800 
the only thing gravity ever assists me
with<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.890> dropping<00:02:23.220> things<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.480> during<00:02:24.780> that

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
with is dropping things so during that

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.540 
with is dropping things so during that
flyby<00:02:25.230> what<00:02:25.470> will<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> probe<00:02:25.980> tell<00:02:26.220> us<00:02:26.370> about

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
flyby what will the probe tell us about

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.100 
flyby what will the probe tell us about
Pluto<00:02:27.239> like<00:02:27.450> what<00:02:27.750> does<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.959> look<00:02:28.050> like

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
Pluto like what does it look like

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.360 
Pluto like what does it look like
because<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.590> really<00:02:28.800> don't<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.069> does<00:02:29.280> it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
because we really don't know does it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
because we really don't know does it
have<00:02:29.489> cracks<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:30.000> craters<00:02:30.360> or<00:02:30.540> mountains<00:02:30.900> is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
have cracks or craters or mountains is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.900 
have cracks or craters or mountains is
there<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.349> face<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.769> Pluto<00:02:32.069> does<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.400> look<00:02:32.519> happy

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
there a face on Pluto does it look happy

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.400 
there a face on Pluto does it look happy
to<00:02:33.060> see<00:02:33.239> us<00:02:33.269> also<00:02:33.720> we'll<00:02:33.810> find<00:02:33.959> out<00:02:34.050> how<00:02:34.170> big<00:02:34.319> it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
to see us also we'll find out how big it

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.809 
to see us also we'll find out how big it
is<00:02:34.500> right<00:02:34.739> now<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> diameter<00:02:35.790> is

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
is right now we think the diameter is

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:36.890 
is right now we think the diameter is
somewhere<00:02:36.090> between<00:02:36.150> two<00:02:36.510> thousand<00:02:36.840> two

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
somewhere between two thousand two

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.150 
somewhere between two thousand two
hundred<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.170> sixty<00:02:37.500> kilometers<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.069> two

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
hundred and sixty kilometers in two

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.380 
hundred and sixty kilometers in two
thousand<00:02:38.489> four<00:02:38.610> hundred<00:02:38.640> kilometers<00:02:39.239> which

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
thousand four hundred kilometers which

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.970 
thousand four hundred kilometers which
is<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> really<00:02:39.780> wide<00:02:40.019> range<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.319> uncertainty<00:02:40.860> if

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
is a really wide range of uncertainty if

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
is a really wide range of uncertainty if
you're<00:02:41.099> wondering<00:02:41.250> i'm<00:02:41.489> getting<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.849> my

also<00:02:48.180> we'll<00:02:48.300> find<00:02:48.450> out<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.660> Pluto's

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
also we'll find out what Pluto's

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.210 
also we'll find out what Pluto's
atmosphere<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.560> made<00:02:49.709> up<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.099> it's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
atmosphere is made up you think it's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.009 
atmosphere is made up you think it's
made<00:02:50.340> of<00:02:50.459> nitrogen<00:02:50.879> methane<00:02:51.000> carbon<00:02:51.450> monoxide

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
made of nitrogen methane carbon monoxide

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.360 
made of nitrogen methane carbon monoxide
and<00:02:52.170> argon<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.650> we're<00:02:52.769> not<00:02:52.860> sure<00:02:52.890> about<00:02:53.190> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and argon but we're not sure about the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.680 
and argon but we're not sure about the
total<00:02:53.580> amounts<00:02:53.879> or<00:02:53.940> what<00:02:54.150> else<00:02:54.269> is<00:02:54.390> there<00:02:54.540> I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
total amounts or what else is there I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.940 
total amounts or what else is there I
like<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.870> think<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.200> atmosphere<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.739> sort<00:02:55.920> of

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
like to think the atmosphere is sort of

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.820 
like to think the atmosphere is sort of
like<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.129> late<00:02:56.430> 50s<00:02:56.940> vibe<00:02:57.440> also<00:02:58.440> we'll<00:02:58.560> find<00:02:58.739> out

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
like a late 50s vibe also we'll find out

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.320 
like a late 50s vibe also we'll find out
exactly<00:02:59.159> how<00:02:59.310> cold<00:02:59.610> Pluto<00:02:59.879> is<00:03:00.030> because

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
exactly how cold Pluto is because

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.899 
exactly how cold Pluto is because
currently<00:03:00.629> we<00:03:00.780> think<00:03:01.080> it's<00:03:01.230> very<00:03:01.980> cold<00:03:02.340> but<00:03:02.819> it

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
currently we think it's very cold but it

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.020 
currently we think it's very cold but it
could<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.500> very<00:03:04.500> very<00:03:04.739> cold<00:03:05.069> or<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.640> know<00:03:05.760> very

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
could be very very cold or you know very

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.430 
could be very very cold or you know very
very<00:03:06.090> very<00:03:06.420> cold<00:03:06.659> one<00:03:06.900> somewhere<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.379> that

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
very very cold one somewhere in that

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.690 
very very cold one somewhere in that
range<00:03:07.530> also<00:03:07.890> we'll<00:03:08.069> find<00:03:08.220> out<00:03:08.310> how<00:03:08.430> much<00:03:08.519> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
range also we'll find out how much the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.860 
range also we'll find out how much the
atmospheric<00:03:09.120> temperature<00:03:09.450> varies<00:03:09.720> with

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
atmospheric temperature varies with

know<00:03:11.459> what<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:11.940> Pluto<00:03:12.209> tastes<00:03:12.629> like<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.989> if<00:03:13.110> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
know what is Pluto tastes like like if I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
know what is Pluto tastes like like if I
had<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.349> cup<00:03:13.590> full<00:03:13.830> of<00:03:13.890> liquid<00:03:14.220> Pluto<00:03:14.700> what

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
had a cup full of liquid Pluto what

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.960 
had a cup full of liquid Pluto what
would<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.150> what<00:03:15.360> would<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.540> taste<00:03:15.690> like

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
would it what would it taste like

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.330 
would it what would it taste like
