00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.880 

comparison<00:02:14.340> here's<00:02:14.940> my<00:02:15.210> other<00:02:15.360> rarity<00:02:15.930> isn't

comparison here's my other rarity isn't

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.800 
comparison here's my other rarity isn't
until<00:02:17.370> I'm<00:02:17.490> rare<00:02:17.700> teeth<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.180> just<00:02:18.420> noticed

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
until I'm rare teeth that I just noticed

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.860 
until I'm rare teeth that I just noticed
I<00:02:19.610> don't<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> can<00:02:21.030> see<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.420> but<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
I don't know if you can see that but it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.390 
I don't know if you can see that but it
looks<00:02:22.050> like<00:02:22.170> packaging<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.800> put<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> dent<00:02:23.250> in

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
looks like packaging you put a dent in

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.980 
looks like packaging you put a dent in
her<00:02:24.500> for<00:02:25.500> comparison<00:02:26.540> they<00:02:27.540> look<00:02:27.720> about<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
her for comparison they look about the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.520 
her for comparison they look about the
same

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
same

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.740 
same
so<00:02:28.950> I'm<00:02:29.670> sure<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> molding<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.390> pretty<00:02:30.630> much

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
so I'm sure the molding is pretty much

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.720 
so I'm sure the molding is pretty much
the<00:02:30.930> same<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:32.040> only<00:02:32.100> difference<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.670> know

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the same the only difference I know

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.470 
the same the only difference I know
about<00:02:33.300> these<00:02:33.720> two<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:34.520> like<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.820> curl<00:02:35.970> crystal

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
about these two is like the curl crystal

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.320 
about these two is like the curl crystal
Empire<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:38.360> Jim<00:02:39.360> shine<00:02:40.110> eyes<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.910> -<00:02:42.090> Jim

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
Empire is the Jim shine eyes the - Jim

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.700 
Empire is the Jim shine eyes the - Jim
shine<00:02:42.570> compared<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:45.420> rarity<00:02:45.930> with<00:02:46.110> just

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
shine compared to this rarity with just

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.880 
shine compared to this rarity with just
a<00:02:46.860> circular<00:02:47.100> shine<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.470> don't<00:02:49.470> know<00:02:49.530> why<00:02:49.680> they

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
a circular shine I don't know why they

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.470 
a circular shine I don't know why they
had<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.190> do<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.490> but<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:50.880> guess<00:02:51.090> they<00:02:51.240> wanted

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
had to do that but I guess they wanted

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.880 
had to do that but I guess they wanted
to<00:02:51.570> do<00:02:51.690> something<00:02:52.020> different<00:02:52.140> instead<00:02:52.650> of

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
to do something different instead of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.460 
to do something different instead of
getting<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.220> Met<00:02:53.490> Ball<00:02:53.730> main<00:02:53.970> sinks<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.290> it

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
getting a Met Ball main sinks this is it

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.530 
getting a Met Ball main sinks this is it
the<00:02:55.620> same<00:02:55.800> way<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.040> wish<00:02:56.340> they<00:02:56.550> did<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:57.030> crystal

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the same way I wish they did the crystal

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.590 
the same way I wish they did the crystal
main<00:02:57.720> six<00:02:57.990> because<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.440> is<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.740> least<00:02:58.770> canon

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
main six because that is at least canon

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.580 
main six because that is at least canon
and<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:01.080> did<00:03:01.590> see<00:03:01.860> some<00:03:02.070> tableau<00:03:02.490> prototypes<00:03:03.120> uh

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
and I did see some tableau prototypes uh

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.870 
and I did see some tableau prototypes uh
if<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.770> guys<00:03:04.890> are<00:03:05.130> curious<00:03:05.280> I'll<00:03:05.610> explain

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
if you guys are curious I'll explain

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.700 
if you guys are curious I'll explain
what<00:03:06.060> time<00:03:06.210> we<00:03:06.330> lose<00:03:06.450> later<00:03:06.720> but<00:03:06.990> there<00:03:07.500> it's

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
what time we lose later but there it's

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.760 
what time we lose later but there it's
like<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.330> Chinese<00:03:09.330> eBay<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.050> you<00:03:10.590> see

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
like a Chinese eBay and you see

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.720 
like a Chinese eBay and you see
prototypes<00:03:11.400> from<00:03:11.750> several<00:03:12.750> things<00:03:12.960> on<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.730> but

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
prototypes from several things on it but

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.390 
prototypes from several things on it but
that's<00:03:15.390> where<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.630> first<00:03:15.900> saw<00:03:16.170> these<00:03:16.400> right

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
that's where I first saw these right

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.740 
that's where I first saw these right
there<00:03:17.610> buy<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.790> in<00:03:18.000> stores<00:03:18.270> you<00:03:18.510> saw<00:03:18.690> the

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
there buy this in stores you saw the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.690 
there buy this in stores you saw the
packaging<00:03:19.410> you<00:03:19.590> can't<00:03:19.860> really<00:03:20.040> get<00:03:20.190> packaging

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
packaging you can't really get packaging

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.560 
packaging you can't really get packaging
from<00:03:20.820> time<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:22.459> here's<00:03:23.459> me<00:03:24.380> moving<00:03:25.380> up<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:26.570> oh

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
from time so here's me moving up and oh

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.830 
from time so here's me moving up and oh
I<00:03:28.410> say<00:03:28.740> she's<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> really<00:03:29.490> nice<00:03:29.610> mole<00:03:29.970> just<00:03:30.630> for

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
I say she's a really nice mole just for

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.640 
I say she's a really nice mole just for
a<00:03:30.870> mold<00:03:31.380> comparison<00:03:32.100> here's<00:03:33.030> cadence<00:03:33.650> of

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
a mold comparison here's cadence of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.020 
a mold comparison here's cadence of
course<00:03:34.860> there<00:03:35.040> was<00:03:35.160> they<00:03:35.430> are<00:03:35.610> there<00:03:35.820> in<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
course there was they are there in the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.090 
course there was they are there in the
same<00:03:36.240> molding<00:03:36.630> paintings<00:03:37.470> his<00:03:37.650> eyes<00:03:37.800> are

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
same molding paintings his eyes are

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.130 
same molding paintings his eyes are
different<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.670> these<00:03:38.820> will<00:03:39.030> appear<00:03:39.240> to<00:03:40.020> be

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
different and these will appear to be

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.840 
different and these will appear to be
completely<00:03:40.830> new<00:03:40.980> eyes<00:03:41.130> from<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.520> moon<00:03:41.610> which

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
completely new eyes from the moon which

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.240 
completely new eyes from the moon which
I<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:43.230> they<00:03:43.350> actually<00:03:43.500> made<00:03:43.860> her<00:03:44.070> new

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
I like that they actually made her new

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.280 
I like that they actually made her new
ice<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.970> from<00:03:45.360> straight-on<00:03:45.840> she<00:03:46.140> actually

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
ice and from straight-on she actually

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.540 
ice and from straight-on she actually
doesn't<00:03:46.860> look<00:03:46.950> like<00:03:47.840> Luna<00:03:48.840> from<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:50.010> episode

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
doesn't look like Luna from the episode

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.180 
doesn't look like Luna from the episode
that<00:03:51.470> many<00:03:52.470> larger<00:03:52.920> then<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.190> was<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:55.190> nightmare

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that many larger then I was in nightmare

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.240 
that many larger then I was in nightmare
night<00:03:56.520> by<00:03:57.420> camera<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.050> cannot<00:03:58.650> remember<00:03:58.950> the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
night by camera and cannot remember the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.220 
night by camera and cannot remember the
whole<00:03:59.459> that<00:04:00.120> was<00:04:00.209> her<00:04:00.360> name<00:04:00.570> I'm<00:04:00.780> pretty<00:04:01.020> sure

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
whole that was her name I'm pretty sure

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.670 
whole that was her name I'm pretty sure
was<00:04:01.470> nightmare<00:04:01.680> night<00:04:02.070> something<00:04:02.430> but<00:04:03.680> this

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
was nightmare night something but this

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.500 
was nightmare night something but this
one<00:04:04.920> I'm<00:04:05.040> so<00:04:05.370> good<00:04:05.520> I'm<00:04:05.700> guessing<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.209> supposed

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
one I'm so good I'm guessing is supposed

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.580 
one I'm so good I'm guessing is supposed
to<00:04:06.660> be<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.840> one<00:04:07.940> like<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.390> one<00:04:10.020> I'm<00:04:10.290> I'm

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
to be that one like this one I'm I'm

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.670 
to be that one like this one I'm I'm
just<00:04:11.100> assuming<00:04:11.610> it's<00:04:11.880> supposed<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.209> be<00:04:12.680> season

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
just assuming it's supposed to be season

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.250 
just assuming it's supposed to be season
one<00:04:13.860> Luna<00:04:14.239> yes<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.360> did<00:04:15.540> cut<00:04:15.720> her<00:04:15.810> hair<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.049> it

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
one Luna yes I did cut her hair and it

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.979 
one Luna yes I did cut her hair and it
look<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.500> think<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.799> looks<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.100> lot<00:04:17.280> better<00:04:17.340> now

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
look I think it looks a lot better now

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.270 
look I think it looks a lot better now
she's<00:04:18.989> wearing<00:04:19.109> shiny<00:04:19.440> average<00:04:19.830> crown<00:04:20.070> which

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
she's wearing shiny average crown which

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.710 
she's wearing shiny average crown which
I<00:04:20.370> never<00:04:20.430> gotten<00:04:20.850> anything<00:04:21.120> over<00:04:21.390> having<00:04:21.570> a

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
I never gotten anything over having a

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.530 
I never gotten anything over having a
crown<00:04:22.700> but

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
crown but

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.130 
crown but
now<00:04:26.640> compared<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.790> that<00:04:27.910> Luna<00:04:28.360> doesn't<00:04:29.020> wanna

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
now compared to that Luna doesn't wanna

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.200 
now compared to that Luna doesn't wanna
they're<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.830> same<00:04:30.040> color<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.880> kind<00:04:31.090> of

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
they're the same color that kind of

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.720 
they're the same color that kind of
aggravates<00:04:31.720> me<00:04:31.900> since<00:04:32.170> Luna<00:04:32.500> is<00:04:32.560> bloom<00:04:33.010> even

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
aggravates me since Luna is bloom even

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.590 
aggravates me since Luna is bloom even
in<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:35.430> first<00:04:36.430> season<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:37.030> guess<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.450> could

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
in the first season I guess you could

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.330 
in the first season I guess you could
argue<00:04:37.720> that<00:04:37.900> she<00:04:38.200> was<00:04:38.290> purplish<00:04:38.860> but<00:04:39.160> she's

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
argue that she was purplish but she's

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.640 
argue that she was purplish but she's
not<00:04:39.490> this<00:04:39.700> color<00:04:39.970> purple<00:04:40.510> she's<00:04:41.230> never<00:04:41.440> been

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
not this color purple she's never been
