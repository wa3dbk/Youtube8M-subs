trimester as soon as I had my third
trimester<00:03:34.329> so<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:37.060> did<00:03:37.299> help<00:03:37.480> but<00:03:37.780> it

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
trimester so this really did help but it

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.720 
trimester so this really did help but it
does<00:03:38.260> have<00:03:38.440> biotin<00:03:38.829> in<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.100> so<00:03:39.400> that's

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
does have biotin in it so that's

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.630 
does have biotin in it so that's
basically<00:03:40.510> why<00:03:40.840> these<00:03:41.799> do<00:03:42.190> have<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.430> lot<00:03:42.609> of

basically why these do have a lot of

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.250 
basically why these do have a lot of
great<00:03:42.850> vitamins<00:03:43.269> that<00:03:43.480> actually<00:03:43.989> help<00:03:44.200> with
