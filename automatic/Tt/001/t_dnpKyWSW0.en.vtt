00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.090
 Hello and 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.170
 Welcome to stretch 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.780
 Ideas of 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.370
 nÃ¼rburgring-nordschleife so the first 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.650
 turn right at the brakes where the 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.940
 box stops and move in calmly sooner 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.410
 you can also visit the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.330
 But his head does not come that far because of him 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.310
 Here is this small relatively high 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.960
 right bend goes full throttle and the now 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.410
 actually comes with almost 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.880
 every race car full throttle with some 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.320
 high performance sports car sooner 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.570
 hard to brake here too sooner 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.829
 this left kink and early right 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.590
 you do not cover it there 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.320
 understeer gets so the next 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.810
 Right Left passages to quite good here 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.490
 for this left turn quite far 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.130
 and slow down earlier here 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.570
 so that you can drive far into it 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.550
 and can implement early because here goes 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.320
 it's a bit downhill and now you can 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.180
 you accelerate a bit high here 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.190
 This small right bend goes full throttle 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.080
 so now this group comes up front 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.940
 a bit difficult sometimes 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.370
 the car lifts off a bit early 4 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.220
 very briefly tap the brakes with high 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.379
 speed right in and accelerate 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.650
 Take the speed with you for these fast ones 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.450
 passage here yes if he overtake here 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.219
 wanted to fit in when you right since 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.929
 because there is relatively little grip so 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:16.390
 try the curve now too 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.399
 also comes on a short brake from the gas 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.499
 stay on the gas and not too early 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.590
 rise and slow again the 

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:25.179
 super long drawn right turn here 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.770
 do not go too early on the gas because otherwise 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.539
 you have two vertices and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.310
 try it as a single turn too 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.159
 drive so here it is actually 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.689
 relatively unproblematic by trying 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.340
 a straight line to find the 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.689
 shortest way down here in the valley 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.429
 sometimes go with the gas a bit 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.139
 be sport and here this sign 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.990
 Immediately brake and pull in now 

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:45.310
 comes a very difficult passage 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.049
 adenauer forest over this this 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.869
 Zebra crossing is already braking earlier 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.009
 move in and then immediately implement and 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.470
 be careful here that you are not too far 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.930
 comes out a difficult ask a 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.880
 not so here is actually again 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.380
 relatively easy you drive a bit 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.590
 the next left is right 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.190
 good-natured if he can come around sooner 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.900
 her also a higher one 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.190
 Turning speed with pure here 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.649
 It gets a bit tighter 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.800
 slow down more and here again immediately 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.950
 move to the right and brake here 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.320
 or curling starts right and yes not 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.570
 we give the curve too early for gas 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.160
 pretty far to do so this left here 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.660
 goes with many cars full of some 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.360
 you have to go a bit from the gas here 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.220
 so here if this kink comes in the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.930
 Kick something in and brake 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.570
 second glance purely accelerate 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.760
 so now come here before the right bend 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.130
 Braking here is the slowest point 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.500
 drive slowly around the track and 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.360
 accelerate out quietly to the left 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.170
 take the body out in speed 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.490
 can these be valuable right here and here 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.230
 brake where right this small area 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.910
 is and catch up sooner 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.950
 move in because otherwise he comes with it 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.510
 under control too far out in here 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.790
 Brakes where the body starts on the left 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.959
 I'm a bit behind afterwards 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.209
 accelerate here everything goes again 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.390
 full throttle the left now comes the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.980
 also goes full throttle that comes now so and 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.950
 the next right where the sign on the right 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.900
 is there now brake and then right 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.370
 move in early because you can 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 vertex difficult to see and you 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.610
 really needs a lot here 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.060
 come a pretty fast 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.010
 passage at the mine and at the mine 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.570
 continue here it goes full throttle left 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.430
 try a little bit right here 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.910
 arrange at this point so that you 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.560
 the next left can take full throttle 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.440
 and yes with some sports cars that works 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.510
 not always necessarily comes too 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.070
 Of course on the tire somewhere here 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.810
 everything is going on full throttle now 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.310
 so come a little courage curve here 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.760
 Slightly slowing down and again with 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.510
 a lot of speed in order to make you beautiful here 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.130
 get through and have traction so goes 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.299
 also usually full sometimes you have to 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.040
 lupfen bit of gas 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.060
 and at this point slow down where the 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.970
 body a bit in the distance 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.640
 go in and give in early here too 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.959
 Again the turn is far 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.390
 Now comes the so-called carousel 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.250
 There left where this tree is now 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.599
 already there already break in and enter 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.560
 he plays with the gas 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.239
 through his track 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.440
 Stop the gas a bit 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.239
 play and then back when he enters 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.730
 a little bit around the bend comes out 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.420
 accelerate down here so it goes 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.670
 vollgas 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.530
 the next left is also with many 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.959
 but not fully with her true 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.359
 sometimes you can loll a bit and 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.250
 braking again here 450 meters high 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.419
 accelerate here you can go back 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.160
 pull right here would have a bit 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.400
 watch the curve puts quite a 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.200
 but you have to slow down a bit and 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.419
 on the right, pull the next right 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.740
 is relatively unproblematic 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.520
 Nice purely accelerate but earlier 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.150
 otherwise you 'll miss the next one 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.010
 curve combinations down here in the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.350
 lower left where the body stops 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.700
 you can brake and pull in immediately 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.740
 namely to take all the momentum 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.330
 drainage area up there is something 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.380
 continue here at the sign left 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.700
 turn in sales at the basket and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.530
 You can swear here as well 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.030
 drive a little bit out of here where the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.830
 body hold something easy again 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.500
 brake and where I move in always 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.720
 get in and out quickly 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.430
 Here , too, where the body is on the left 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.169
 start quietly brakes then you can 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.340
 her first as such a kind 90 degrees 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.039
 Curves take even if they actually 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.419
 relatively liquid gas is so full here 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.310
 down now comes such a small paragraph 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.660
 short form sales to slow down again 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.550
 the brake and immediately from the brake 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.650
 so that the brothers do not block and 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.789
 accelerate purely so that's it 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.539
 actually if he is then in the good 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.820
 line are all full left down 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.200
 and give in early as I said 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.160
 it can also be a bit on the vehicle 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.289
 vary 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.450
 and that could be yours 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.310
 So gas is the next one 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.840
 very long right-hand bend here 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.180
 already early on brakes and rhine 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.690
 prefer to move in slowly and quickly 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.430
 out and the links here will be something 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.350
 slower so right where the body is something 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.180
 differently colored will brake and then 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.250
 you can pull the little carousel 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.260
 here also on the left brake where the body 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.660
 something is discolored that you can see on the 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.860
 stretch quite well and speed up 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.650
 here, of course, the whole speed 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.950
 take it right in and take everything 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.960
 take with you on the dettinger 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.080
 Of course , you can get high up here 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.250
 accelerate fits the vehicle setup 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.010
 good that he's there enough 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.390
 Otherwise, you have the top speed 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.660
 eat the opponents there immediately if 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.730
 even if he curves all the way 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.380
 have liability and stay up there 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.030
 you lost then at the latest 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.010
 So be aware of the shadow 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.380
 of course you can also again 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.430
 counter because it's just long enough 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.410
 but you really need a good one 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.770
 translation this left turn goes here 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.600
 full throttle so in this left kink it works 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.430
 also full and then you should already 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.260
 go off the gas and brake quietly 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.890
 again a little earlier and sooner 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:41.540
 move in and to the left and then on 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.440
 slow down where this surface begins to the left 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.300
 and here really as streets instead 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.950
 City course curve is about very tight 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.060
 yes that was a round on the 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.980
 nordschleife i hope you have it 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.150
 I like you and thank you 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.150
 watch until next time
