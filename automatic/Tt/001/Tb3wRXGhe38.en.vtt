00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.590 

so<00:00:35.240> this<00:00:35.390> song<00:00:35.630> uses<00:00:36.880> just<00:00:37.880> three<00:00:38.390> chords

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
so this song uses just three chords

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.680 
so this song uses just three chords
which<00:00:39.350> are<00:00:39.380> a<00:00:40.180> minor<00:00:43.060> whole<00:00:44.060> sixth<00:00:44.360> ring<00:00:44.510> two

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
which are a minor whole sixth ring two

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.490 
which are a minor whole sixth ring two
fingers<00:00:45.050> one<00:00:45.500> and<00:00:45.800> two<00:00:46.370> on<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.700> second<00:00:47.180> fret

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
fingers one and two on the second fret

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.440 
fingers one and two on the second fret
away<00:00:48.500> from<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.800> capo<00:00:49.100> in<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:49.310> case<00:00:49.520> and<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
away from the capo in this case and the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.150 
away from the capo in this case and the
next<00:00:50.780> chord<00:00:51.080> is<00:00:51.350> G<00:00:51.410> which<00:00:52.309> is<00:00:52.450> this<00:00:53.450> chord<00:00:53.750> here

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
next chord is G which is this chord here

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.410 
next chord is G which is this chord here
so<00:00:55.160> first<00:00:55.430> finger<00:00:55.700> actually<00:00:55.790> stays<00:00:56.120> where<00:00:56.390> he

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
so first finger actually stays where he

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.380 
so first finger actually stays where he
is<00:00:56.480> second<00:00:57.350> finger<00:00:57.620> jumps<00:00:58.070> up<00:00:58.190> from<00:00:58.400> there<00:00:58.970> so

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
is second finger jumps up from there so

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.360 
is second finger jumps up from there so
they're<00:00:59.960> on<00:01:00.080> the<00:01:00.110> third<00:01:00.230> fret<00:01:00.710> away<00:01:01.100> from<00:01:01.280> the

and<00:02:29.830> twice<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.209> D<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.780> it<00:02:31.900> sounds<00:02:32.230> like

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
and twice on the D so it sounds like

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:58.250 
and twice on the D so it sounds like
this<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:32.860> you've<00:02:33.010> got<00:02:33.129> a<00:02:33.250> minor<00:02:33.610> with

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.690 

so<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.410> entire<00:02:59.620> song<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.460> sanctuary

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
so the entire song is the sanctuary

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.000 
so the entire song is the sanctuary
calls<00:03:01.090> all<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.300> way<00:03:01.480> through<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.010> this

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
calls all the way through so this

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.890 
calls all the way through so this
maintain<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.550> same<00:03:03.730> strumming<00:03:04.120> from<00:03:04.540> start

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
maintain the same strumming from start

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.870 
maintain the same strumming from start
to<00:03:05.020> finish<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.530> at<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.220> end<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.640> course

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
to finish so at the end of the course

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.030 
to finish so at the end of the course
there<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.210> pause<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.960> G<00:03:08.200> chord<00:03:08.470> so<00:03:08.890> we're

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
there is a pause on the G chord so we're

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:23.310 
there is a pause on the G chord so we're
going<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.190> go

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.220 

those<00:03:24.320> chords<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:26.330> get<00:03:26.540> one<00:03:26.660> more<00:03:26.780> time<00:03:26.990> so<00:03:27.170> at

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
those chords so get one more time so at

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:41.190 
those chords so get one more time so at
the<00:03:27.320> end<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.590> course<00:03:27.830> it's

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.680 

so<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.310> song<00:03:42.520> high<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.940> dry<00:03:43.090> also<00:03:43.510> has<00:03:43.660> a

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
so the song high and dry also has a

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.840 
so the song high and dry also has a
little<00:03:43.930> guitar<00:03:44.080> melody<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:44.800> that<00:03:45.310> is<00:03:45.400> used<00:03:45.670> in

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
little guitar melody but that is used in

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.540 
little guitar melody but that is used in
the<00:03:45.970> intro<00:03:46.360> and<00:03:46.600> after<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.410> choruses<00:03:47.920> so<00:03:48.400> this

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
the intro and after the choruses so this

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:57.570 
the intro and after the choruses so this
is<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.760> EZ<00:03:48.970> single<00:03:49.540> string<00:03:49.810> version<00:03:50.320> of<00:03:50.440> it

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:06.760 

so<00:03:58.360> again

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.260 

so<00:04:07.770> I'll<00:04:07.860> run<00:04:07.980> through<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.280> notes<00:04:08.460> used<00:04:09.000> in

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
so I'll run through the notes used in

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.870 
so I'll run through the notes used in
the<00:04:09.360> melody<00:04:09.630> here<00:04:10.040> so<00:04:11.040> first<00:04:11.280> off<00:04:11.550> we<00:04:11.670> start

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
the same string now doing so little

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.020 
the same string now doing so little
trick<00:05:04.350> with<00:05:04.470> this<00:05:04.560> melody<00:05:05.010> here<00:05:05.310> is<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.580> the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
trick with this melody here is that the

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.240 
trick with this melody here is that the
first<00:05:06.270> down<00:05:06.870> up<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.530> first<00:05:07.830> night<00:05:08.040> here

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
first down up on that first night here

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.570 
first down up on that first night here
this<00:05:08.400> down<00:05:08.700> up<00:05:08.940> is<00:05:09.600> actually<00:05:10.190> before<00:05:11.190> the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
this down up is actually before the

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.520 
this down up is actually before the
strumming<00:05:11.970> starts<00:05:12.330> actually<00:05:12.570> it's<00:05:13.110> only<00:05:13.290> off

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
strumming starts actually it's only off

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.830 
strumming starts actually it's only off
Beatle<00:05:13.950> at<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.220> end<00:05:14.430> after<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:15.150> number<00:05:15.510> four

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
Beatle at the end after the number four

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.930 
Beatle at the end after the number four
of<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.440> bar<00:05:16.650> before<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.670> actual

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
of the bar before the the actual

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.760 
of the bar before the the actual
strumming<00:05:18.360> starts<00:05:18.780> in<00:05:18.930> the<00:05:19.050> song<00:05:19.260> or<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.740> E

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
strumming starts in the song or the E

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.640 
strumming starts in the song or the E
minor<00:05:20.130> chord<00:05:20.280> anyway<00:05:20.820> so<00:05:21.480> so<00:05:22.169> it's<00:05:22.380> called<00:05:22.590> a

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
minor chord anyway so so it's called a

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.170 
minor chord anyway so so it's called a
pickup<00:05:22.950> note<00:05:23.190> or<00:05:23.340> a<00:05:23.370> pickup<00:05:23.669> beat<00:05:23.880> it's<00:05:24.150> a

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
pickup note or a pickup beat it's a

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.730 
pickup note or a pickup beat it's a
little<00:05:24.450> bit<00:05:24.540> fiddly<00:05:24.750> to<00:05:24.870> get<00:05:25.140> right<00:05:25.380> so

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
little bit fiddly to get right so

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.320 
little bit fiddly to get right so
there's<00:05:25.950> sort<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.130> an<00:05:26.250> intensive<00:05:26.730> account<00:05:27.090> I

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330
