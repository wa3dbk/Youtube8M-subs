and here just under the flame you'll

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.359 
and here just under the flame you'll
notice<00:00:28.089> this<00:00:28.240> you<00:00:28.300> have<00:00:28.599> a<00:00:28.630> cloud<00:00:28.900> of<00:00:29.259> gas<00:00:29.439> just

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
notice this you have a cloud of gas just

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.780 
notice this you have a cloud of gas just
waiting<00:00:30.759> to<00:00:30.849> be<00:00:30.939> consumed<00:00:31.330> in<00:00:32.400> other<00:00:33.400> models

use<00:00:35.560> it<00:00:35.710> for<00:00:35.830> other<00:00:35.950> purposes<00:00:36.160> but<00:00:36.730> in<00:00:37.690> this

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
use it for other purposes but in this

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.210 
use it for other purposes but in this
case<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.230> just<00:00:38.260> thing<00:00:38.680> they're<00:00:38.860> waiting<00:00:39.130> to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
case is just thing they're waiting to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.440 
case is just thing they're waiting to
burn<00:00:40.830> later<00:00:41.830> on<00:00:42.010> in<00:00:42.130> the<00:00:42.190> video<00:00:42.280> I'll<00:00:43.240> show<00:00:43.420> you

this<00:00:53.290> means<00:00:53.530> that<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.830> char<00:00:54.040> production<00:00:54.460> is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
this means that the char production is

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.180 
this means that the char production is
almost<00:00:54.910> non-existent<00:00:55.180> in<00:00:55.690> this<00:00:55.840> world<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:57.100> as

underneath the flame we can see glowing
embers<00:02:01.760> this<00:02:02.760> is<00:02:02.910> because<00:02:03.330> there<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.840> no<00:02:03.960> char

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
measurement so to conclude this last

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.480 
measurement so to conclude this last
test<00:02:32.940> run<00:02:34.160> we<00:02:35.160> used<00:02:35.510> 10<00:02:36.510> litres<00:02:36.960> of<00:02:37.490> wood

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
test run we used 10 litres of wood

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:48.290 
test run we used 10 litres of wood
pellets<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.560> produce<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:45.060> much<00:02:45.360> ash<00:02:46.610> so<00:02:47.610> 10

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
pellets to produce this much ash so 10

00:02:48.300 --> 00:03:01.460 
pellets to produce this much ash so 10
litres<00:02:50.090> produced<00:02:54.560> 50<00:02:55.560> milliliters<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:57.830> ash<00:03:00.470> so

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
litres produced 50 milliliters of ash so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.410 
litres produced 50 milliliters of ash so
I<00:03:01.530> guess<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.860> could<00:03:02.010> say<00:03:02.220> 50<00:03:02.670> milliliters<00:03:03.180> out

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
I guess you could say 50 milliliters out

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.840 
I guess you could say 50 milliliters out
of<00:03:03.540> 10<00:03:03.720> litres<00:03:03.989> is<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.310> little<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:07.850> guess

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
of 10 litres is just a little I guess

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.160 
of 10 litres is just a little I guess
that's<00:03:09.030> all<00:03:09.150> for<00:03:09.209> today<00:03:09.510> thanks

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170
