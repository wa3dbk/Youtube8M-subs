00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
okay so in this video I'm just going to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.970 
okay so in this video I'm just going to
quickly<00:00:05.250> go<00:00:05.460> over<00:00:05.750> send<00:00:06.750> up<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:06.960> ik/fk<00:00:07.319> switch

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
quickly go over send up the ik/fk switch

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.610 
quickly go over send up the ik/fk switch
for<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.370> right-hand<00:00:09.210> side<00:00:09.330> as<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:10.349> did<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
for the right-hand side as we did in the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.470 
for the right-hand side as we did in the
previous<00:00:11.040> video<00:00:11.519> with<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> left<00:00:12.179> hand<00:00:12.330> side

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
previous video with the left hand side

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.289 
previous video with the left hand side
so<00:00:13.290> if<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.740> come<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.920> all<00:00:14.099> with<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.179> did

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so if you come to all with what we did

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
so if you come to all with what we did
in<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.420> last<00:00:15.540> video<00:00:15.980> feel<00:00:16.980> free<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.160> skip<00:00:17.400> this

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
in the last video feel free to skip this

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.189 
in the last video feel free to skip this
video<00:00:17.820> on<00:00:18.029> work<00:00:18.420> on<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.750> right<00:00:18.930> hand<00:00:19.080> side

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
video on work on the right hand side

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.920 
video on work on the right hand side
yourself<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:20.279> you're<00:00:20.550> quite<00:00:20.730> new<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.330> recommend

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
yourself if you're quite new I recommend

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.130 
yourself if you're quite new I recommend
just<00:00:22.380> following<00:00:22.830> through<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.130> again<00:00:24.140> just

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
just following through this again just

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.320 
just following through this again just
so<00:00:25.199> we<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:26.039> go<00:00:26.220> step-by-step<00:00:26.609> through<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
so we can go step-by-step through the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.310 
so we can go step-by-step through the
whole<00:00:27.570> rig<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:29.570> what<00:00:30.570> would<00:00:30.660> quickly<00:00:31.050> do

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
whole rig so what would quickly do

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.060 
whole rig so what would quickly do
quickly<00:00:32.219> go<00:00:32.399> through<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.640> again<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:34.890> did

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
quickly go through this again is we did

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160 
quickly go through this again is we did
the<00:00:35.160> set<00:00:35.370> drinky<00:00:35.760> first<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.390> went<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.840> in

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the set drinky first so we went to in

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.319 
the set drinky first so we went to in
the<00:00:37.739> animation<00:00:38.070> section<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> went<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> met

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the animation section we went to I met

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.650 
the animation section we went to I met
set<00:00:40.200> drunky<00:00:41.210> set<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.190> loaded<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.329> driver

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
set drunky set and we loaded the driver

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
set drunky set and we loaded the driver
which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.649> ik/fk<00:00:47.070> switch<00:00:47.700> control<00:00:49.039> select

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
which is the ik/fk switch control select

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.480 
which is the ik/fk switch control select
the<00:00:50.340> ik<00:00:50.750> handle<00:00:51.750> as<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.590> driven

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
the ik handle as the driven

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.570 
the ik handle as the driven
and<00:00:54.820> then<00:00:55.270> we<00:00:55.510> basically<00:00:55.900> wanted<00:00:56.260> it<00:00:56.380> so<00:00:56.650> when

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
and then we basically wanted it so when

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.480 
and then we basically wanted it so when
it's<00:00:57.700> at<00:00:57.850> zero<00:00:57.880> and<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.980> can<00:01:00.130> always<00:01:00.310> check

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
it's at zero and we can always check

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.920 
it's at zero and we can always check
called<00:01:00.820> the

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
called the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.520 
called the
left<00:01:03.590> hand<00:01:03.800> side

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
left hand side

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.850 
left hand side
they<00:01:06.070> set<00:01:06.400> to<00:01:06.520> zero<00:01:06.760> and<00:01:07.000> we're<00:01:07.210> in<00:01:07.299> ik<00:01:07.630> mode<00:01:08.110> so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
they set to zero and we're in ik mode so

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.460 
they set to zero and we're in ik mode so
in<00:01:09.330> 01<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.479> set<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.260> hike<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:12.240> then<00:01:13.440> go<00:01:14.440> down

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
in 01 it set to hike it and then go down

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.609 
in 01 it set to hike it and then go down
to<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.799> ik/fk<00:01:15.310> blend<00:01:16.030> and<00:01:16.390> we<00:01:17.229> will<00:01:17.350> set<00:01:17.530> out

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
to the ik/fk blend and we will set out

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.730 
to the ik/fk blend and we will set out
to<00:01:17.740> 1<00:01:17.979> because<00:01:18.280> we<00:01:18.460> want<00:01:18.640> ik<00:01:18.970> on<00:01:19.180> and<00:01:19.740> we'll

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
to 1 because we want ik on and we'll

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.460 
to 1 because we want ik on and we'll
just<00:01:20.890> hit<00:01:21.070> key<00:01:21.369> with<00:01:22.360> those<00:01:22.690> two<00:01:22.899> values

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
just hit key with those two values

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.240 
just hit key with those two values
selected<00:01:24.159> those<00:01:24.369> two<00:01:24.580> attributes<00:01:24.990> key<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
selected those two attributes key and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.460 
selected those two attributes key and
then<00:01:27.460> we'll<00:01:27.640> select<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.630> ik/fk<00:01:29.020> switch

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
then we'll select the ik/fk switch

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.890 
then we'll select the ik/fk switch
switch<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.190> to<00:01:30.220> one

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
switch it to one

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.469 
switch it to one
switch<00:01:32.900> select<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.710> ik<00:01:33.920> blend<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:35.090> step<00:01:35.390> up

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
switch select the ik blend and step up

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.130 
switch select the ik blend and step up
to<00:01:35.659> zero<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.320> we're<00:01:37.159> in<00:01:37.189> FK<00:01:37.580> mode<00:01:37.820> now<00:01:38.180> we<00:01:38.960> want

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
to zero so we're in FK mode now we want

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.270 
to zero so we're in FK mode now we want
to<00:01:39.350> switch<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.860> eye<00:01:39.890> care<00:01:40.280> off<00:01:40.460> hit<00:01:41.450> key<00:01:42.280> so

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
to switch the eye care off hit key so

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.580 
to switch the eye care off hit key so
now<00:01:43.369> we've<00:01:43.520> crypt<00:01:43.790> that<00:01:43.909> I<00:01:44.030> k<00:01:44.090> FK<00:01:44.450> blend

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.300 

and<00:01:47.740> it's<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.659> move<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.399> control

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and it's so you can move the control

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.060 
and it's so you can move the control
and<00:01:53.850> blend<00:01:54.149> between<00:01:54.240> those<00:01:54.600> two

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.720 

so<00:01:59.810> that's<00:02:00.810> working<00:02:01.200> now

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.850 

we'll<00:02:04.330> set<00:02:04.510> back<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.660> zero<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.380> now<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:05.710> want

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
we'll set back to zero and now we want

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.600 
we'll set back to zero and now we want
to<00:02:06.040> set<00:02:06.220> up<00:02:06.370> the<00:02:06.900> switching<00:02:07.900> off<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.020> FK<00:02:08.680> so

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
to set up the switching off the FK so

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.930 
to set up the switching off the FK so
we'll<00:02:09.910> go<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.150> animation<00:02:11.080> rendering

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
we'll go to animation rendering

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.760 
we'll go to animation rendering
rendering<00:02:12.940> editors<00:02:13.260> bring<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.410> hype<00:02:14.560> shirt

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
rendering editors bring the hype shirt

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.200 
rendering editors bring the hype shirt
again

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.110 

and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.390 

I'll<00:02:21.659> just<00:02:21.900> graph<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.409> network

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
I'll just graph the network

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.720 
I'll just graph the network
of<00:02:24.909> this<00:02:25.150> arm<00:02:25.989> control<00:02:26.439> so<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.489> get<00:02:27.579> the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
of this arm control so we can get the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.950 
of this arm control so we can get the
oreck<00:02:28.150> constraint

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
oreck constraint

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.490 
oreck constraint
and<00:02:30.740> we<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:30.980> just<00:02:31.300> hide<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.510> rest<00:02:32.720> graph

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
and we can just hide the rest graph

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.970 
and we can just hide the rest graph
remove<00:02:34.160> selected<00:02:34.370> from<00:02:34.790> graph<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.800> then<00:02:36.800> add

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
remove selected from graph and then add

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.560 
remove selected from graph and then add
in<00:02:37.220> this<00:02:37.670> ik/fk<00:02:38.650> control<00:02:39.650> graph<00:02:40.490> add<00:02:41.300> to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
in this ik/fk control graph add to

in this ik/fk control graph add to
graph

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.300 

and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.070 

again<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.330> want<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.540> weight<00:02:48.660> set<00:02:48.690> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
again we just want the weight set to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.250 
again we just want the weight set to
zero<00:02:49.349> when<00:02:49.650> we're<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:49.890> fk1<00:02:50.640> when<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:51.720> kiss<00:02:51.959> re<00:02:52.170> oh

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
zero when we're in fk1 when I kiss re oh

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.559 
zero when we're in fk1 when I kiss re oh
man<00:02:52.500> FK<00:02:52.770> we<00:02:53.069> want<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.340> way<00:02:53.430> it's<00:02:53.580> set<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> 1<00:02:54.360> so

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
man FK we want the way it's set to 1 so

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.620 
man FK we want the way it's set to 1 so
we<00:02:55.020> can<00:02:55.200> minimize<00:02:55.319> click<00:02:55.739> drag<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.130> drop<00:02:56.630> got

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
we can minimize click drag and drop got

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.830 
we can minimize click drag and drop got
over<00:02:58.020> we're<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.620> connect<00:02:58.950> in<00:02:59.250> the<00:03:00.239> right

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
over we're going to connect in the right

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.530 
over we're going to connect in the right
icare<00:03:01.650> FK<00:03:02.069> attribute<00:03:02.900> into<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.110> way<00:03:04.260> it

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
icare FK attribute into the way it

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.660 
icare FK attribute into the way it
and<00:03:06.019> hit<00:03:06.469> close<00:03:06.769> so<00:03:07.159> that's<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:07.430> connected

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
and hit close so that's now connected

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.699 
and hit close so that's now connected
okay<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:10.300> we've<00:03:10.450> got<00:03:10.599> lots<00:03:10.690> two<00:03:10.930> connected<00:03:11.380> so

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
okay so we've got lots two connected so

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.589 
okay so we've got lots two connected so
now<00:03:11.950> what<00:03:12.069> we<00:03:12.160> need<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.400> do<00:03:12.520> is<00:03:13.020> set<00:03:14.020> up<00:03:14.050> the

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
now what we need to do is set up the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.660 
now what we need to do is set up the
forearm<00:03:16.599> we<00:03:17.380> did<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:17.650> because<00:03:18.130> we<00:03:18.280> have<00:03:18.520> the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
forearm we did this because we have the

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.350 
forearm we did this because we have the
farm<00:03:19.060> with<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.540> twist<00:03:19.780> distribution<00:03:21.360> so

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
farm with the twist distribution so

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.089 
farm with the twist distribution so
we'll<00:03:22.480> graph<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:22.930> select<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.739> multiply

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
we'll graph that select the multiply

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.920 
we'll graph that select the multiply
divide<00:03:24.430> node<00:03:24.459> graph<00:03:24.819> that<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.599> so<00:03:25.690> we've<00:03:25.810> got

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
divide node graph that just so we've got

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.380 
divide node graph that just so we've got
this<00:03:26.050> smaller<00:03:26.739> graph<00:03:27.040> so<00:03:28.030> we're<00:03:28.120> not<00:03:28.150> we're

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
this smaller graph so we're not we're

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.090 
this smaller graph so we're not we're
dealing<00:03:28.660> with<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:31.170> select<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.350> idea<00:03:32.680> FK

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.479 

and<00:03:38.659> we're<00:03:38.780> going<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:38.930> bypass<00:03:39.489> these

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
and we're going to bypass these

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.890 
and we're going to bypass these
connections<00:03:40.819> here<00:03:41.269> with<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> color<00:03:41.900> blend<00:03:42.799> node

isaac remember before the claw to you

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.920 
isaac remember before the claw to you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
when it's an eye care so we set the

rotate 20 don't want any influence on
them<00:03:56.510> and<00:03:57.310> then<00:03:58.310> we<00:03:58.670> can<00:03:59.269> minimize<00:03:59.659> click<00:04:00.110> drag

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
them and then we can minimize click drag

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.990 
them and then we can minimize click drag
and<00:04:00.650> drop<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.720> ik/fk<00:04:02.720> curve<00:04:03.290> on<00:04:03.680> to<00:04:04.670> the<00:04:04.790> blank

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.140 
and drop the ik/fk curve on to the blank
color<00:04:05.209> or<00:04:05.420> go<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.959> over<00:04:06.879> and<00:04:07.879> we're<00:04:08.000> going<00:04:08.120> to

color or go to over and we're going to

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.670

choose<00:04:08.450> e<00:04:09.400> ik/fk<00:04:10.400> switch<00:04:10.909> and<00:04:11.439> connect<00:04:12.439> it<00:04:12.530> to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
choose e ik/fk switch and connect it to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.339 
choose e ik/fk switch and connect it to
the<00:04:12.769> blender<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:14.569> blend<00:04:14.900> in<00:04:14.989> between<00:04:15.230> those

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
the blender so blend in between those

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.090 
the blender so blend in between those
two<00:04:15.669> two<00:04:16.669> colors<00:04:17.090> those<00:04:17.389> two<00:04:17.600> RGB<00:04:18.440> values<00:04:18.859> and

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
two two colors those two RGB values and

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.540 
two two colors those two RGB values and
then<00:04:19.940> we<00:04:20.359> want<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.690> first<00:04:21.470> RGB<00:04:22.100> value<00:04:22.400> to

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
then we want the first RGB value to

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.760 
then we want the first RGB value to
actually<00:04:22.880> be<00:04:22.970> this<00:04:23.150> twist<00:04:23.419> distribution<00:04:24.080> the

to<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.590> output<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.430> put<00:04:31.699> it<00:04:31.760> into<00:04:31.880> color<00:04:32.270> one

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
to the output and put it into color one

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.070 
to the output and put it into color one
clause<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.120> now<00:04:35.120> we<00:04:35.180> want<00:04:35.419> to<00:04:35.479> take<00:04:35.960> the

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
clause and now we want to take the

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.570 
clause and now we want to take the
output<00:04:36.229> of<00:04:36.410> this<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:37.039> put<00:04:37.220> it<00:04:37.340> into<00:04:37.460> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
output of this and put it into the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.320 
output of this and put it into the
rotates<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.360> these<00:04:38.510> two<00:04:38.690> joints<00:04:40.150> so<00:04:41.150> I'll<00:04:41.210> do

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
rotates of these two joints so I'll do

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.260 
rotates of these two joints so I'll do
the<00:04:41.419> same<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:42.169> output

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
the same to output

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.910 
the same to output
set<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.080> rot<00:04:45.410> it

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
set to rot it

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.090 
set to rot it
what<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.640> next<00:04:47.790> giant<00:04:48.030> reload<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:48.900> right<00:04:49.100> put

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
what the next giant reload the right put

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.140 
what the next giant reload the right put
into<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.340> Rotter

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
into the Rotter

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.680 
into the Rotter
so<00:04:52.780> I've<00:04:52.840> got<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.170> all<00:04:53.530> set<00:04:53.800> up<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:54.640> now<00:04:55.630> we

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
so I've got that all set up and now we

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.130 
so I've got that all set up and now we
need<00:04:56.140> to<00:04:56.350> set<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.730> up<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.600> visibility<00:04:59.110> of

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
need to set this up to the visibility of

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.530 
need to set this up to the visibility of
these<00:04:59.320> controls<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:01.030> I'm<00:05:01.120> going<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.300> let<00:05:01.420> these

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
these controls so I'm going to let these

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.590 
these controls so I'm going to let these
three<00:05:01.780> controls<00:05:02.260> going<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.740> go<00:05:02.830> graph

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
three controls going to go graph

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.650 
three controls going to go graph
Claire<00:05:05.260> graph<00:05:05.500> graph<00:05:06.130> add<00:05:06.430> selected<00:05:06.790> to<00:05:07.060> graph

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.980 

and<00:05:09.750> we<00:05:10.710> just<00:05:10.890> want<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.400> ik/fk<00:05:12.060> blend<00:05:12.480> to

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
and we just want the ik/fk blend to

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.870 
and we just want the ik/fk blend to
control<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.890> visibility<00:05:14.070> of<00:05:14.490> these<00:05:14.700> two

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
control the visibility of these two

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.140 
control the visibility of these two
curves<00:05:15.350> so<00:05:16.350> again<00:05:16.710> we'll<00:05:16.860> drag<00:05:17.040> and<00:05:17.190> drop<00:05:17.340> go

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
curves so again we'll drag and drop go

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.960 
curves so again we'll drag and drop go
to<00:05:18.210> over<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.750> bring<00:05:18.900> up<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.050> connection<00:05:19.230> either

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
to over to bring up a connection either

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.350 
to over to bring up a connection either
change<00:05:20.970> the<00:05:21.030> right<00:05:21.720> I<00:05:21.960> care<00:05:22.590> fki<00:05:23.550> switch<00:05:23.850> to

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
change the right I care fki switch to

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.050 
change the right I care fki switch to
the<00:05:24.750> visibility<00:05:25.550> like<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.640> next<00:05:26.850> curve

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
the visibility like the next curve

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.170 
the visibility like the next curve
reload<00:05:27.990> right<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.650> reload<00:05:29.040> it<00:05:29.190> with<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.060> new

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
reload right to reload it with the new

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.350 
reload right to reload it with the new
curve<00:05:30.480> hit<00:05:31.410> visible<00:05:31.830> it<00:05:31.950> to<00:05:32.310> connect<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.730> close

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
curve hit visible it to connect it close

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.629 
curve hit visible it to connect it close
so<00:05:34.290> they're<00:05:34.440> hidden<00:05:34.620> now

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
so they're hidden now

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:42.080 
so they're hidden now
and<00:05:36.729> again<00:05:37.539> we<00:05:37.780> want<00:05:37.960> to<00:05:38.110> just<00:05:39.090> set<00:05:40.090> up

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
and again we want to just set up

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.250 
and again we want to just set up
the<00:05:43.010> f<00:05:44.010> care<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.520> hide<00:05:44.699> when<00:05:45.000> we<00:05:45.150> the<00:05:45.870> eye<00:05:45.900> care

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
the f care to hide when we the eye care

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.680 
the f care to hide when we the eye care
to<00:05:46.350> hide<00:05:46.500> sorry<00:05:46.740> when<00:05:46.980> we're<00:05:47.100> in<00:05:47.190> FK<00:05:47.580> mode<00:05:47.760> so

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
to hide sorry when we're in FK mode so

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.159 
to hide sorry when we're in FK mode so
to<00:05:48.750> do<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:49.040> let's<00:05:50.040> let<00:05:50.190> the<00:05:50.280> eye<00:05:50.310> care<00:05:51.169> graph

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
to do that let's let the eye care graph

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:55.279 
to do that let's let the eye care graph

set of a key

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.469 
set of a key
and<00:06:02.009> we<00:06:02.490> can<00:06:02.639> just<00:06:02.759> hide<00:06:02.970> the<00:06:03.120> rest<00:06:03.300> of<00:06:03.419> these

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
and we can just hide the rest of these

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.379 
and we can just hide the rest of these

from<00:06:06.930> graphs<00:06:07.229> just<00:06:07.590> so<00:06:07.680> we've<00:06:07.800> got<00:06:07.889> this<00:06:08.150> set

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
from graphs just so we've got this set

actually<00:06:18.090> drive<00:06:18.629> the<00:06:18.960> visibility<00:06:19.560> as<00:06:19.680> well<00:06:20.270> so

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
actually drive the visibility as well so

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.330 
actually drive the visibility as well so
I'll<00:06:21.360> select<00:06:21.449> these<00:06:21.629> two<00:06:21.720> controls<00:06:22.340> graph

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
I'll select these two controls graph

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.620 
I'll select these two controls graph
I've<00:06:24.180> selected<00:06:24.419> to<00:06:24.720> graph

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.770 

okay<00:07:29.200> so<00:07:29.260> now<00:07:29.590> we've<00:07:29.920> got<00:07:30.130> both<00:07:30.520> I<00:07:30.820> Kiev<00:07:31.510> guess

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:31.780 
okay so now we've got both I Kiev guess

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.680 
okay so now we've got both I Kiev guess
which<00:07:32.050> is<00:07:32.850> connected<00:07:33.850> up<00:07:34.000> and<00:07:34.240> one<00:07:34.450> last<00:07:34.570> thing

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.690 
which is connected up and one last thing

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.530 
which is connected up and one last thing
we<00:07:34.870> probably<00:07:35.080> ought<00:07:35.230> to<00:07:35.320> do<00:07:35.440> is<00:07:36.240> rename<00:07:37.240> laws

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:37.540 
we probably ought to do is rename laws

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.630 
we probably ought to do is rename laws
to<00:07:38.080> blend<00:07:38.410> colors<00:07:38.800> that<00:07:38.920> were<00:07:39.040> created<00:07:39.250> so

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.640 
to blend colors that were created so

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.280 
to blend colors that were created so
we're<00:07:39.760> just<00:07:39.790> going<00:07:39.970> to<00:07:40.030> do<00:07:40.150> that<00:07:40.180> in<00:07:40.570> the<00:07:41.260> next

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.290 
we're just going to do that in the next

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.400 
we're just going to do that in the next
tutorial<00:07:41.680> and<00:07:42.190> we<00:07:43.000> will<00:07:43.180> set<00:07:43.450> up<00:07:43.660> the

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.410 
tutorial and we will set up the

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.970 
tutorial and we will set up the
rotations<00:07:45.100> for<00:07:45.310> these<00:07:45.430> wrists
