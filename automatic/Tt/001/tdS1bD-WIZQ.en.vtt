occurred<00:00:54.350> during<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.829> game<00:00:54.980> I<00:00:55.160> don't<00:00:55.610> know<00:00:55.699> if

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
occurred during the game I don't know if

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.549 
occurred during the game I don't know if
they<00:00:55.879> calculated<00:00:56.360> it<00:00:56.510> wrong<00:00:56.750> or<00:00:57.260> if<00:00:57.440> they<00:00:57.530> just

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
they calculated it wrong or if they just

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.410 
they calculated it wrong or if they just
weren't<00:00:57.920> calculating<00:00:58.520> it<00:00:58.640> at<00:00:58.760> all<00:00:59.030> and<00:00:59.329> then

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
weren't calculating it at all and then

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.779 
weren't calculating it at all and then
tried<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.660> play<00:00:59.840> catch-up<00:01:00.079> but<00:01:00.469> July<00:01:01.190> Winston

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
tried to play catch-up but July Winston

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.819 
tried to play catch-up but July Winston
actually<00:01:02.210> won<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.629> game<00:01:02.809> one<00:01:03.140> he<00:01:03.469> didn't<00:01:03.739> get

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
actually won that game one he didn't get

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.010 
actually won that game one he didn't get
too<00:01:04.039> old<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:04.789> there<00:01:05.239> should<00:01:05.539> have<00:01:05.570> been<00:01:05.660> a<00:01:05.810> game

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
too old so there should have been a game

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.870 
too old so there should have been a game
three<00:01:06.289> but<00:01:06.470> it<00:01:06.530> didn't<00:01:06.830> actually<00:01:06.950> happen<00:01:07.190> now

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
three but it didn't actually happen now

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
duelists like sometimes the pressure can

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.360 
duelists like sometimes the pressure can
get<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.180> you<00:04:50.390> forget<00:04:50.810> about<00:04:50.990> even<00:04:51.590> something
