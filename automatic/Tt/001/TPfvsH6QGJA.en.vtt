00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.450
 living in this video is about it 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.440
 Basin around a metal frame 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.330
 549 cm at 122 cm depending on dimensions 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.360
 can your pool be slightly more or 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.560
 less assembly division 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.349
 Check that all has book 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.520
 listed parts are present 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.980
 Do not start with the assembly 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.160
 if parts are missing but challenge them 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.020
 build these from the index customer service 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.029
 Make the swimming pool an absolute 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.320
 level surface on the water 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.660
 is evenly distributed 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.120
 the stability of the tool is at risk 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.949
 if this tends to the side of the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.079
 In addition, location must be in 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.300
 reach of the garden hose and one 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.240
 fi socket are filled 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.800
 Poland will not be moved then 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.510
 The tour is not right next to the house 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 build up 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.550
 Think about how the fathers pump 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.380
 can be attached 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.520
 So no one about pumping cable 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.750
 trip local regulations can 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.790
 that one to one of the book 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.140
 prescribe inform yourself about 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.140
 all valid regulations 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.720
 before rolling out the fous the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.370
 Exhibition area thoroughly by small 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.810
 Objects clear the floor plate 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.180
 could pierce 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.409
 for added protection 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.220
 plan over the whole 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.380
 exhibition area 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:31.840
 Now the swimming pool can be built up 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:33.910
 the basins will be on the clothes 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.480
 underlaid tarp with the top 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.370
 The pool does not unroll above the pool 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.260
 pull the floor cause the bitch 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.380
 can 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.850
 The filter connection openings must be in 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.150
 show the direction in the pump 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.040
 to be installed should check again 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.780
 whether a fi outlet within reach 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.850
 the butcher finds the lining in 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.270
 let the sun warm up what that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.400
 Inserting the rods facilitates one 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.440
 carrier with a large diameter through one 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.020
 cuffs on the tank top 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.090
 then push a threefold 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.709
 connecting piece on a carrier in the 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.060
 put on and with a 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.060
 lock connector 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.830
 this process in a direction around 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.900
 the basin repeat the last one 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.160
 Connection is under circumstances only 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.890
 difficult to produce 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.330
 the connector and the rod 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.890
 lift a few centimeters 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.050
 the rods are the connecting piece 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.709
 Introduce and then the frame again 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.709
 laying ground 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.980
 the legs inside the holder as 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.290
 through the belt in the middle of the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.210
 side wall of the basin push the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.490
 Legs in the threefold pieces of connection 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.700
 a snap and the fever founder 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.290
 align the openings 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.480
 make sure that again 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.630
 all cry within the hold since 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.400
 and in the straps 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.350
 the bottom alone with caps 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.180
 close 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.730
 shake the basin well with it all 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:09.440
 put parts and check if all the pens 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:12.260
 Make sure you are sitting firmly in your seat 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.970
 that everyone is standing at a straight 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.950
 filter connection openings again 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.990
 check and make sure they are still working 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.480
 pointing in the direction in which delivered 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.780
 doll is attached necessary 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.040
 make corrections 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.090
 install the filter pump 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.550
 To fill the swimming pool, you choose 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.110
 the matching film montage video with
