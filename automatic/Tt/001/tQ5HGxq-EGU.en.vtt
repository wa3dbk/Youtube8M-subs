slip<00:02:20.970> your<00:02:21.150> pictures<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.709> also<00:02:23.069> do

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
slip your pictures in but what I also do

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.780 
slip your pictures in but what I also do
is<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.270> have<00:02:24.510> noticed<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.080> sometimes

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
is that I have noticed that sometimes

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.699 
is that I have noticed that sometimes
the<00:02:26.790> staples<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:28.650> undone<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.720> transporting

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
the staples get undone and transporting

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.160 
the staples get undone and transporting
so<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:31.980> really<00:02:32.459> force<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:35.000> white<00:02:36.170> duct

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
so I really force it with a white duct

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.590 
so I really force it with a white duct
tape<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.750> cover<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.500> staples<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:44.600> razor

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
tape and I cover the staples a razor

00:02:45.600 --> 00:03:27.350 
tape and I cover the staples a razor
blade<00:02:45.810> works<00:02:46.230> best<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:48.620> cover<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.390> duct<00:02:51.390> tape

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.810 

and<00:03:27.900> then<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.140> go<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.890> ready<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.250> be<00:03:29.490> put<00:03:29.670> in
