00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.580
Welcome in the 2nd stage of the Africa Race 2014.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.080
Have you ever woken up at 5am on New Year’s Day?

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.720
The bikers have and now they are on their way to today’s stage.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:58.180
It’s 6:36, we’re getting up too to start along with our racing Tatra.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.340
Their start is planned to 7:29 and 150 km away.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.120
The racers can expect their 1st dunes around the town of M’Dhamid.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.280
The River Draa flows through a beautiful valley.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.900
It’s early, we’re in a hurry, so we cannot admire much of it.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:07.720
We got to the start in advance so we used the time to move to an elevated spot to wait for the racers to pass by.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.560
Now, the racers are heading to the dunes. We’ve got the whole day to get to the bivouac.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.780
We drove all way long, we were lucky. The stage was very difficult, fast, damaged.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.620
We did it. The Tatra keeps on, it runs well, it’s good.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:18.140
About 60 kilometres of dunes. They were hard, which was good. It was fun to go over them.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:29.180
But they were badly tracked up, the cars went up diagonally and we had to go up straight.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.900
They were very high.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.020
We got to the stage finish and Tomáš Tomeček had passed by 15 minutes ago.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.920
All other trucks are still in the stage. Elizabeth is just coming.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:03.720
Today’s stage was a success for Gabari from Morocco in bikes and the car category was dominated by old stager Schlesser.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.800
Tomáš Tomeček arrived 20 minutes before Elizabeth Jacinto.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.600
Considering the length of today’s stage, the overall standings are almost the same. We’ll see in the next days.
