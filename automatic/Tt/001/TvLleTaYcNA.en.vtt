for a soccer the circle in the middle

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.479 
for a soccer the circle in the middle
and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.500> put<00:00:55.649> stands<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:56.430> you

can<00:00:56.579> put<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> scoreboard<00:00:59.000> this<00:01:00.000> game<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.510> very

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
can put a scoreboard this game is very

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.250 
can put a scoreboard this game is very
very<00:01:01.230> glitchy<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.100> need<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> big<00:01:03.059> table<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:04.080> set

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
very glitchy you need a big table to set

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.160 
very glitchy you need a big table to set
it<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.339> customize<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.060> size<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it up you can customize the size of the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.070 
it up you can customize the size of the
actual<00:01:07.650> feel<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:11.150> suggest<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.630> using<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
actual feel but I suggest just using a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
actual feel but I suggest just using a
big<00:01:13.260> table<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.799> small<00:01:14.070> field<00:01:14.390> what<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.630> is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
big table in a small field what it is is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.649 
big table in a small field what it is is
it<00:01:16.049> pops<00:01:16.290> up<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:17.520> people<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.119> then<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it pops up as little people and then a

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929 
it pops up as little people and then a
little<00:01:18.990> tiny<00:01:19.170> ball<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.490> flick

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
little tiny ball and you have to flick

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.530 
little tiny ball and you have to flick
it<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:22.369> squirt<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> goal<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.210> flick

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it to squirt in the goal it's like flick

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.359 
it to squirt in the goal it's like flick
and<00:01:24.930> flick<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.650> another<00:01:25.770> person<00:01:25.890> putting

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
and flick it to another person putting

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.800 
and flick it to another person putting
to<00:01:26.490> another<00:01:26.700> person<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:27.689> do<00:01:27.780> all

the how to play it just it is that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.030

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.859 
try it see if it's something you like
but<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.579> personally<00:01:42.979> did<00:01:43.979> not<00:01:44.009> enjoy<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.869> I

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
but I personally did not enjoy it and I

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.399 
but I personally did not enjoy it and I
give<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.640> out<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.850> five<00:01:48.140> just<00:01:49.140> because

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
give it a one out of five just because

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.450 
give it a one out of five just because
it's<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.710> cool<00:01:49.890> concept<00:01:50.420> but<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:52.369> just<00:01:53.369> think

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
it's a cool concept but I just think

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.690 
it's a cool concept but I just think
it's<00:01:53.729> really<00:01:54.590> really<00:01:55.590> glitchy<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> just

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it's really really glitchy and it just

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.450 
it's really really glitchy and it just
doesn't<00:01:57.299> come<00:01:57.810> across<00:01:57.899> as<00:01:58.110> good<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.979> mean<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.340> is
