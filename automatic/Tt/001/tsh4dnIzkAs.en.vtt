00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:12.750
 once a few years ago the father of one 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.450
 of us who is now no longer the father of a 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.960
 angel with the 24 on the fairing and in the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.480
 heart defined us so he had me so much 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.300
 talked about you but actually not 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.460
 I had never heard that much but 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.769
 being a big headlock to me he has them 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.300
 wanted to introduce one by one 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.330
 these guys to hug and kiss 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.570
 as children really immersed in them 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.930
 their leather suits with their helmets 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.930
 gaudy all real hard people that up 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.670
 street never looks down but 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.070
 try raising their visors 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.340
 Martian ax and you will find eyes 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 beautiful clean swollen with those tears 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.970
 true where you can drown and get 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.610
 until the end 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.270
 from their 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.490
 to see how candid then try to 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.040
 take off those overalls and you will find al 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.170
 inside, they are loving babies 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.900
 of weekend steaks and life 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.090
 sausages still so in need of a 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.610
 father and a mother who takes them for 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:18.050
 hand when the fate and begins to play 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:20.570
 hard they say that every time we go up 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.710
 riding our steeds together with 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.300
 we sagano also angels and devils is true 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.950
 they represent the dualism that makes 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.619
 this way of living so dense of 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.570
 emotions that sometimes the heart seems to want 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.130
 jump off your chest and get in 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.479
 run to scream devils that turn 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.460
 that place sometimes so 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.990
 irrational violent than the sketch of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.330
 adrenaline gets you straight to the brain 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.550
 without going through the street 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.899
 leaving us 3 walls for very long 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.940
 endless minutes and angels that 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.940
 they carry the face and the voice of those who are not 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.180
 more with us 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.120
 of our appeals and our fears and 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:04.490
 experiences built on our bones 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.119
 yes it is true 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.410
 in motion moves captain can happen to 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.180
 each of us and hurts so badly 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.540
 but how much life turns memories 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.310
 beautiful in moments and terms in laughter 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.660
 so loud that the sun returns 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.370
 even on a cold and rainy day 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.739
 of November 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.340
 speak like the united wolves and do yourself 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.340
 tell a story an anecdote a cure 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.370
 and get lost in that look that 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.650
 begins to spark in laughter in the 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.940
 smile that spontaneously stretches the corners 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.520
 of the face and will relax forehead spoken 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.960
 and ask him what would be of him if a 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.050
 day should renounce this 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.660
 passion and get ready to hear the scream 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.370
 of silence to see that look of 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.410
 baby become the gaze of a 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 sailor forced to live on the ground with 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.140
 the sea in sight or a pilot who 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.830
 look at the sky anchored to the ground in motion 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.190
 you die 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.310
 it's true but there is no better way to 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.370
 live the time we are allowed 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.450
 and if you still haven't understood correctly 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.730
 leave it open you will never understand it not 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.409
 Yes, tomorrow 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.349
 going to the beach with your family 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.930
 automotive correctness should 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.000
 come one of us and see 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.379
 your thread spins around and say goodbye 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.849
 waving like a madman 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:33.920
 give up understanding him too in him and 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.989
 in his unconsciousness he sees that in him 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.980
 spark that you have not been able 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.180
 to see and if you see the motorcyclist 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.230
 return the greeting 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.250
 well there is nothing strange you know between 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:53.079
 you always greet angels on earth but 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.950
 this who has lost loyal does not remember it 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:59.950
 motorcyclists strange wonderful people 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.950
 happy
