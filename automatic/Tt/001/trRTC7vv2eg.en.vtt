00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
mine and trying to determine it by some

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
of the melees whose was whose or most of

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
of the melees whose was whose or most of
it<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> couldn't<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.890> couldn't<00:01:08.549> tell<00:01:08.970> whose

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
it I couldn't I couldn't tell whose

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.140 
it I couldn't I couldn't tell whose
gameplay<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.110> whose<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:11.460> kept<00:01:11.700> getting<00:01:11.820> mixed

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
gameplay was whose it kept getting mixed

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.230 
gameplay was whose it kept getting mixed
up<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:14.630> had<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> more<00:01:16.560> by<00:01:17.240> motion

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
up so I had to do it more by motion

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.710 
up so I had to do it more by motion
since<00:01:18.600> I've<00:01:18.810> been<00:01:18.960> playing<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:21.270> know<00:01:21.390> cod

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
since I've been playing you know cod

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.090 
since I've been playing you know cod
full

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.130 

more<00:01:26.100> fluid<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.580> my<00:01:26.729> motion<00:01:27.120> but<00:01:27.330> that's

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
more fluid in my motion but that's

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.940 
more fluid in my motion but that's
pretty<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.560> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
pretty much it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.500 
pretty much it
because<00:01:29.220> she's<00:01:29.460> fitted<00:01:29.850> her<00:01:29.970> killed<00:01:30.240> she's

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
because she's fitted her killed she's

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.680 
because she's fitted her killed she's
good<00:01:30.870> at<00:01:30.990> her<00:01:31.020> melees<00:01:31.880> she's<00:01:32.880> still<00:01:33.240> getting

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
good at her melees she's still getting

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.630 
good at her melees she's still getting
the<00:01:34.850> grenades<00:01:35.850> down<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:37.229> she<00:01:37.640> forgets

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the grenades down I think she forgets

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.920 
the grenades down I think she forgets
that<00:01:38.850> she<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.240> them<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.009> fair<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.930> tend

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
that she has them and to be fair I tend

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
that she has them and to be fair I tend
to<00:01:43.020> still<00:01:43.470> also<00:01:43.770> I'm<00:01:45.619> getting<00:01:46.619> more<00:01:46.890> used<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to still also I'm getting more used to

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.420 
to still also I'm getting more used to
it<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.630> when<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.690> get<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.290> whole<00:01:50.009> mess<00:01:50.400> of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it because when you get a whole mess of

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.450 
it because when you get a whole mess of
zombies<00:01:50.970> coming<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.400> you

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
zombies coming at you you know you

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.249 
zombies coming at you you know you
pretty<00:01:53.909> much<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.060> got<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> think<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:54.990> another

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
pretty much just got to think of another

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.010 
pretty much just got to think of another
way<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> kill<00:01:55.770> them<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.720> that's<00:01:57.720> pretty

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
way to kill them all so that's pretty

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.980 
way to kill them all so that's pretty
much<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.380> only<00:01:58.410> time<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.890> remember<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
much the only time I remember that I

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.760 
much the only time I remember that I
need<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> use<00:02:01.289> them<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:03.500> that's<00:02:04.500> pretty<00:02:04.649> much

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
need to use them and that's pretty much

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.240 
need to use them and that's pretty much
it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.509 
it
oh<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:07.340> okay<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.610> isn't<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:10.519> was

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519

watching her gameplay just a second ago

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.860 
watching her gameplay just a second ago
I<00:02:13.860> had<00:02:14.790> watched<00:02:15.030> mine<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:17.570> just<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.660> give<00:02:18.840> you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
I had watched mine but just to give you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.800 
I had watched mine but just to give you
a<00:02:18.989> quick<00:02:19.260> tip<00:02:19.970> one<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.239> heard<00:02:21.570> just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
a quick tip one that I heard just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.390 
a quick tip one that I heard just
recently<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:24.650> you<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:25.739> when<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.040> could<00:02:26.190> save

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
recently is you know when you could save

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.090 
recently is you know when you could save
your<00:02:26.519> bullets<00:02:26.760> save<00:02:27.209> them<00:02:27.709> melee<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.829> kills

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
your bullets save them melee the kills

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.449 
your bullets save them melee the kills
for<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.180> kill<00:02:30.440> but<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:32.480> you<00:02:33.480> with<00:02:33.840> your<00:02:33.989> 1911

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
for the kill but if you with your 1911

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.490 
for the kill but if you with your 1911
shoot<00:02:35.459> them<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.570> it's<00:02:36.810> five<00:02:37.019> or<00:02:37.049> six

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
shoot them I think it's five or six

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.000 
shoot them I think it's five or six
times<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:41.160> know<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.400> chest<00:02:41.760> and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
times in the you know in the chest and

the<00:02:59.489> melee<00:02:59.850> so<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:01.560> talking<00:03:01.880> you<00:03:02.880> know

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
the melee so you're talking you know

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.600 
the melee so you're talking you know
depending<00:03:05.150> on<00:03:05.210> how<00:03:05.360> many<00:03:05.420> times<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.930> shot

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.690 

180<00:03:09.610> or<00:03:09.850> 190<00:03:10.420> points<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.950> each<00:03:12.130> kill

180 or 190 points for each kill

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.550 
180 or 190 points for each kill
so<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:14.190> maximizing<00:03:15.190> your<00:03:15.280> points<00:03:15.730> and

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
the carnage and everything so if I see a

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.400 
the carnage and everything so if I see a
group<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.959> them<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:24.720> even<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:25.930> don't<00:03:25.990> have

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
group of them and even if I don't have

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.100 
group of them and even if I don't have
to<00:03:26.620> use<00:03:26.770> it<00:03:26.800> I'll<00:03:27.490> use<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:28.000> grenade<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:31.110> like

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110

to use it I'll use the grenade and like
on<00:03:32.680> four<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.160> them<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.640> I'll<00:03:34.000> hardly<00:03:34.390> get<00:03:34.630> any

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
on four of them and I'll hardly get any

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.600 
on four of them and I'll hardly get any
points<00:03:35.080> which<00:03:35.680> totally<00:03:36.040> sucks

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
soon as you walk over that you pretty

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.800 
soon as you walk over that you pretty
much<00:03:50.410> kill<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.430> think<00:03:51.670> every<00:03:52.000> everything

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
much kill I think every everything

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:01.220 
much kill I think every everything
that's<00:03:54.360> within<00:03:57.090> what<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.209> it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.170 

well<00:04:01.800> I<00:04:01.830> was<00:04:01.950> gonna<00:04:02.040> say<00:04:02.160> within<00:04:02.520> view<00:04:02.940> but

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
well I was gonna say within view but

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.089 
well I was gonna say within view but
actually<00:04:03.629> it's<00:04:03.900> probably<00:04:04.200> whoever's<00:04:04.860> still

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
actually it's probably whoever's still

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.740 
actually it's probably whoever's still
in<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.400> round<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.970> gonna<00:04:06.269> get<00:04:06.420> killed<00:04:06.690> I

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
in that round is gonna get killed I

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.660 
in that round is gonna get killed I
forgot<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.900> check<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.349> but<00:04:10.709> I'm<00:04:11.040> guessing<00:04:11.310> we

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
forgot to check that but I'm guessing we

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.650 
forgot to check that but I'm guessing we
just<00:04:11.940> went<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.989> just<00:04:13.019> went<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.470> run<00:04:13.650> for

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
just went to we just went to run for

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.289 
just went to we just went to run for
because<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:16.019> believe<00:04:16.669> show<00:04:17.669> seems<00:04:17.910> like<00:04:18.150> we're

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
because I believe show seems like we're

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.060 
because I believe show seems like we're
getting<00:04:18.419> a<00:04:18.600> new<00:04:18.780> wave<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.260> zombies<00:04:20.930> and

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
getting a new wave of zombies and

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.790 
getting a new wave of zombies and
another<00:04:23.070> tip<00:04:23.370> which<00:04:23.790> I'll<00:04:24.060> probably<00:04:24.800> point

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
another tip which I'll probably point

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.010 
another tip which I'll probably point
out<00:04:27.470> much<00:04:28.470> clearer<00:04:28.860> next<00:04:29.250> time<00:04:29.430> yep<00:04:30.020> your
