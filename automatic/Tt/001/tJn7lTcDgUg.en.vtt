00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.629 
health wise you don't have tomatoes
sitting<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.139> storage<00:03:04.500> for<00:03:04.650> three<00:03:05.189> weeks<00:03:05.430> and

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:05.639 
sitting in storage for three weeks and

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:06.770 
sitting in storage for three weeks and
then<00:03:05.790> you<00:03:05.879> get<00:03:05.969> them<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.269> grocery<00:03:06.359> store

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
then you get them in the grocery store

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.360 
then you get them in the grocery store
you<00:03:06.810> get<00:03:07.109> it<00:03:07.260> pretty<00:03:07.650> much<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:07.919> same<00:03:08.040> day<00:03:08.219> we

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you get it pretty much the same day we

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.069 
you get it pretty much the same day we
harvest<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.599> know<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.959> not

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
harvest it and so you know it's not

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.539 
harvest it and so you know it's not
sitting<00:03:10.439> there<00:03:10.469> losing<00:03:10.829> all<00:03:10.949> those<00:03:11.040> nutrients

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
sitting there losing all those nutrients

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.449 
sitting there losing all those nutrients
we<00:03:11.819> harvest<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.359> right<00:03:12.689> from<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.019> vine<00:03:13.230> so<00:03:13.980> all

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
we harvest it right from the vine so all

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.520 
we harvest it right from the vine so all
possible<00:03:15.209> nutrients<00:03:15.629> go<00:03:15.750> into<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.109> fruit

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
possible nutrients go into that fruit

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.759 
possible nutrients go into that fruit
when<00:03:17.060> ripening<00:03:18.060> the<00:03:18.659> food<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.019> almost<00:03:19.169> alive

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
when ripening the food is almost alive

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.179 
when ripening the food is almost alive
it<00:03:20.129> is<00:03:20.489> freshly<00:03:20.909> picked<00:03:21.269> very<00:03:22.189> tasty

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
it is freshly picked very tasty

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.449 
it is freshly picked very tasty
nutritious<00:03:23.669> it<00:03:24.659> hasn't<00:03:25.560> traveled<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:26.189> long<00:03:26.400> way

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
nutritious it hasn't traveled a long way

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.729 
nutritious it hasn't traveled a long way
so<00:03:26.669> there's<00:03:27.209> not<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.449> big<00:03:27.510> carbon<00:03:27.989> footprint<00:03:28.560> as

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
so there's not a big carbon footprint as

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.499 
so there's not a big carbon footprint as
far<00:03:28.919> as<00:03:29.099> purchasing<00:03:29.699> those<00:03:29.939> vegetables

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:30.509 
far as purchasing those vegetables

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:32.270 
far as purchasing those vegetables
versus<00:03:30.900> something<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.859> came<00:03:31.979> from<00:03:32.129> Mexico

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
versus something that came from Mexico

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.699 
versus something that came from Mexico

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.640 
here took them to the market right there
you<00:03:42.299> know<00:03:42.449> we<00:03:42.659> didn't<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.049> drive<00:03:43.439> it

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
you know we didn't have to drive it

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.589 
you know we didn't have to drive it
anywhere<00:03:43.769> it's<00:03:44.609> so<00:03:44.759> much<00:03:44.909> nicer<00:03:44.939> than<00:03:45.540> having

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
anywhere it's so much nicer than having

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.499 
anywhere it's so much nicer than having
to<00:03:46.290> drive<00:03:47.009> you<00:03:47.400> know<00:03:47.489> thousands<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.030> miles<00:03:48.150> but

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
to drive you know thousands of miles but

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.069 
to drive you know thousands of miles but
that<00:03:49.139> doesn't<00:03:49.439> really<00:03:49.530> make<00:03:49.739> sense<00:03:49.970> there's<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
that doesn't really make sense there's a

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.030 
that doesn't really make sense there's a
federal<00:03:52.079> program<00:03:52.259> called<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.769> farmers

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
federal program called the farmers

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.949 
federal program called the farmers
market<00:03:53.069> nutrition<00:03:53.669> program<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.359> that's<00:03:54.870> how

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
market nutrition program and that's how

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.499 
market nutrition program and that's how
the<00:03:55.079> WIC<00:03:55.530> mothers<00:03:56.129> get<00:03:56.669> these<00:03:56.819> vouchers<00:03:57.090> and

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
the WIC mothers get these vouchers and

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:58.729 
the WIC mothers get these vouchers and
they<00:03:57.569> can<00:03:57.720> spend<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.139> think<00:03:58.319> it's<00:03:58.409> like<00:03:58.530> thirty

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
they can spend I think it's like thirty

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.069 
they can spend I think it's like thirty
dollars<00:03:59.129> a<00:03:59.459> year<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.449> we<00:04:00.540> want<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.810> provide<00:04:01.019> a
