00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 Why 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:10.739
 as we speak 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.739
 ignoring the bar 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.150
 report soon we will be able to do 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.779
 before these rhubarb cold ratios 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.029
 we will provide 500 grams the goal being to cut the sheet and well 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.349
 all alone hoyer it is enough to have a small lateral movement and sometimes in 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.310
 opposite way the salt shakers without being cut we will provide 500 grams 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.930
 when he assured me 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.530
 here are our ribs 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.560
 for the greedy 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.160
 and here is our man who is toxic 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160
 as a repellent where he was too 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.860
 an amp 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.070
 of formic acid it stings a little eyes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.200
 equipment 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.600
 the scale because we will need only 500 grams 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.240
 a month ago we will have to tear him off 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.660
 jacob shears and then it will take the ceo 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.420
 it will be filled more than 3000 rainwater 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.810
 and with a lid 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.280
 for a pilot seduced me cold for 24 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.170
 after these 24 hours 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.730
 it will be necessary to publish to filter the pieces to pick up the filtered pieces 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.520
 once it is well filtered we will simply invert dublin the little 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 if we can use it as 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.300
 very dry who was player 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.850
 that is, europe 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.220
 no idea 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 here are our products you do not believe 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 the number of our members 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 750 grams 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.390
 we can arrive at 500 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480
 500 grams 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 for red plans 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.169
 combining the arches 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.679
 already there 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:22.619
 for its part ended up bad thing important that I snatched him 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:23.749
 welcome 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.040
 what tracks as fast as ever acidic 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.729
 is that it will push higher Shia dignitary 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.969
 because for 24 hours it will broadcast 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.969
 I must cold maceration 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.869
 so we will run 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.919
 the little hat 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.519
 and then during 24 hours we will put darren aronofsky 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.760
 for twenty-four years later we will see how note is 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.549
 cold maceration then we will take advantage of all this the colander we go 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.809
 first do it like that 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:04.809
 without artifice and citizenship and family 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.489
 large infiltration knows how to use the hand-held sprayer or 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.969
 foot then shiite 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.169
 button does not want it to get clogged 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:19.419
 in the application on for example a susceptible rose a vegetable invaded by 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.419
 aphids copy then tivo the sensitive places 

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.529
 three times in three days 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:30.469
 the important lampard happy to wet the plant is until 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.469
 that it dripping 

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.899
 I remember you do not know insecticides are not infected anymore it scares away 

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.899
 the insects 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.139
 %
