00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.020

stretching a cold muscle you have a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210 
stretching a cold muscle you have a
better<00:01:39.119> chance<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.720> injuring<00:01:40.290> yourself<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.190> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220

bit<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.990> playing<00:01:43.170> time<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:44.190> my<00:01:44.430> muscles<00:01:45.030> can

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
bit of playing time so my muscles can

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.719 
bit of playing time so my muscles can
warm<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:45.990> bit<00:01:46.399> right<00:01:47.399> after

you're doing is you're starting out with

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.779 
you're doing is you're starting out with
paradiddles<00:02:04.110> single<00:02:04.469> paradiddles<00:02:05.009> leading

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
paradiddles single paradiddles leading

with your right hand and you do four of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.260 
with your right hand and you do four of
those<00:02:07.950> total<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.830 

like<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:15.040> next<00:02:16.040> part<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.910> do<00:02:17.090> two<00:02:17.510> groups

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
like that next part is to do two groups

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.200 
like that next part is to do two groups
of<00:02:18.080> paradiddle<00:02:18.860> diddles<00:02:19.310> leading<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.180> your

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210

right<00:02:20.480> hand<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.640> then<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.980> next

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
right hand like that and then the next

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.460 
right hand like that and then the next
part<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.030> do<00:02:29.210> just<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.660> single<00:02:29.990> paradiddle

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
part is to do just a single paradiddle

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.110 
part is to do just a single paradiddle
leading<00:02:31.040> with<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.280> right<00:02:31.430> hands<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:32.000> it's

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
leading with the right hands so it's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.960 
leading with the right hands so it's
just<00:02:32.210> right<00:02:32.570> left<00:02:32.960> right<00:02:33.350> right<00:02:33.820> then<00:02:34.820> that

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
just right left right right then that

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.670 
just right left right right then that
will<00:02:35.150> take<00:02:35.330> you<00:02:35.510> immediately<00:02:35.930> into<00:02:36.590> the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
second part of this exercise which leads

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.370 
second part of this exercise which leads
with<00:02:38.810> your<00:02:38.960> left<00:02:39.140> hand<00:02:39.290> so<00:02:40.070> it's<00:02:40.250> just<00:02:41.380> two

group<00:02:54.080> for<00:02:54.470> these<00:02:54.590> paradiddle<00:02:55.250> diddles<00:02:55.580> it's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
group for these paradiddle diddles it's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.000 
group for these paradiddle diddles it's
really<00:02:56.330> important<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.930> then<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.530> last<00:02:57.680> part

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.330 
rolls full out you know go for as long
as<00:05:25.660> you<00:05:25.750> can<00:05:25.990> until<00:05:26.200> your<00:05:26.500> arm<00:05:26.740> muscles<00:05:26.950> start

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
as you can until your arm muscles start

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.810 
as you can until your arm muscles start
to<00:05:27.550> burn<00:05:27.760> and<00:05:28.240> then<00:05:29.080> take<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.680> break<00:05:29.980> stretch

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
to burn and then take a break stretch

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.670 
to burn and then take a break stretch
and<00:05:31.180> do<00:05:31.390> it<00:05:31.480> again<00:05:31.540> three<00:05:31.960> times<00:05:31.990> so<00:05:32.440> I<00:05:32.470> would

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
and do it again three times so I would

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:44.770 
and do it again three times so I would
do<00:05:32.800> something<00:05:33.070> like<00:05:33.130> this

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.660 

something<00:05:45.650> like<00:05:45.770> that<00:05:45.980> or<00:05:46.160> it's<00:05:46.280> just<00:05:46.310> full

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.670 
something like that or it's just full

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.610 
something like that or it's just full
out<00:05:46.880> you<00:05:47.450> know<00:05:47.540> do<00:05:47.780> that<00:05:47.960> for<00:05:48.139> as<00:05:48.230> long<00:05:48.380> as<00:05:48.440> you

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
out you know do that for as long as you

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.400 
out you know do that for as long as you
can<00:05:48.889> like<00:05:49.550> I<00:05:49.700> was<00:05:49.790> saying<00:05:49.850> take<00:05:50.300> a<00:05:50.330> break<00:05:50.660> once

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410 
can like I was saying take a break once

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.980 
can like I was saying take a break once
you're<00:05:51.530> done<00:05:51.740> we'll<00:05:52.370> stretch<00:05:52.760> shake<00:05:53.240> it<00:05:53.510> do

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
you're done we'll stretch shake it do

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.140 
you're done we'll stretch shake it do
that<00:05:54.020> two<00:05:54.320> more<00:05:54.350> times<00:05:54.560> three<00:05:55.460> times<00:05:55.669> total

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
that two more times three times total

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.740 
that two more times three times total
and<00:05:56.740> then<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:58.250> do<00:05:58.430> a<00:05:58.460> quick<00:05:58.639> cool<00:05:58.940> down<00:05:59.000> of

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
and then just do a quick cool down of

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.080 
and then just do a quick cool down of
big<00:06:00.560> wide-open<00:06:00.860> double<00:06:01.490> strokes<00:06:01.760> again

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
big wide-open double strokes again

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.170 
big wide-open double strokes again
you're<00:06:02.720> single<00:06:03.350> strokes<00:06:03.560> I<00:06:03.680> mean<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.040> you

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
you're single strokes I mean and you

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.980 
you're single strokes I mean and you
should<00:06:05.180> be<00:06:05.210> good<00:06:05.380> so<00:06:07.240> warming<00:06:08.240> up<00:06:08.389> is<00:06:08.630> probably

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
should be good so warming up is probably

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.900 
should be good so warming up is probably
one<00:06:09.230> of<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.440> most<00:06:09.620> overlooked<00:06:10.460> parts<00:06:10.790> of

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
one of the most overlooked parts of

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.240 
one of the most overlooked parts of
drumming<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.740> it's<00:06:12.740> really<00:06:12.889> helpful

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
drumming and it's really helpful

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.830 
drumming and it's really helpful

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
especially when you're playing live

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.500

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
because I don't like to take first two

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.780 
because I don't like to take first two
