going until the 12 Ron I see this by
going<00:02:45.320> 12<00:02:45.650> rounds<00:02:46.010> it's<00:02:46.130> really<00:02:46.880> hard<00:02:47.060> for<00:02:47.120> me

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
going 12 rounds it's really hard for me

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.000 
going 12 rounds it's really hard for me
to<00:02:47.420> see<00:02:47.600> a<00:02:47.630> knockout<00:02:48.290> comes<00:02:48.530> only<00:02:48.650> because

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
to see a knockout comes only because

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.560 
to see a knockout comes only because
their<00:02:49.160> styles<00:02:49.580> are<00:02:49.850> so<00:02:49.910> hard<00:02:50.750> to<00:02:52.030> know<00:02:53.030> they

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
their styles are so hard to know they

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.750 
their styles are so hard to know they
could<00:02:53.720> take<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.900> punch<00:02:54.020> each<00:02:54.590> fighter<00:02:54.860> can<00:02:55.520> take

a punch you've seen cotto fight against

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.410 
a punch you've seen cotto fight against
margarito<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.890> he's<00:03:01.250> endured<00:03:01.790> for

margarito and and he's endured for
almost<00:03:02.720> 11<00:03:02.930> 12<00:03:03.440> rounds<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:03.950> with<00:03:04.670> a<00:03:04.700> big

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
almost 11 12 rounds with with a big

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.510 
almost 11 12 rounds with with a big
margarito<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.620> know<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.709> can't<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:07.220> many

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
margarito so you know I can't see many

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.460 
margarito so you know I can't see many

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
trying to knock him out with one punch

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.290 
trying to knock him out with one punch
or<00:03:09.860> in<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.220> early<00:03:10.489> rounds<00:03:10.580> i<00:03:10.850> see<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.120> by

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
or in the early rounds i see this by

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.720 
or in the early rounds i see this by
going<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.720> later<00:03:11.930> rounds<00:03:12.320> maybe<00:03:12.860> 9-10<00:03:13.400> brown

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
going to later rounds maybe 9-10 brown

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.600 
going to later rounds maybe 9-10 brown
knockout<00:03:14.420> but<00:03:14.680> more<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:15.860> I<00:03:15.890> see<00:03:16.130> this<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.430> going

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
knockout but more so I see this is going

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.610 
knockout but more so I see this is going
to<00:03:16.700> your<00:03:16.850> decision<00:03:17.360> what<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.200> weakness<00:03:18.350> of

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
to your decision what is the weakness of

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.280 
to your decision what is the weakness of
khodam<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.310> many<00:03:19.790> has<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.180> overcome<00:03:20.420> I<00:03:20.810> think

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
khodam that many has to overcome I think

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.630 
khodam that many has to overcome I think
the<00:03:21.860> weakness<00:03:22.130> for<00:03:22.310> kotas<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:23.000> think<00:03:23.989> he

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
the weakness for kotas that I think he

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.180 
the weakness for kotas that I think he
can't<00:03:25.640> match<00:03:25.850> he<00:03:26.810> can't<00:03:27.020> match<00:03:27.200> of<00:03:27.650> Manny

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
can't match he can't match of Manny

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.510 
can't match he can't match of Manny
speed<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:28.910> think<00:03:29.660> Koto's<00:03:29.989> has<00:03:30.350> power<00:03:30.739> but<00:03:31.459> I

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
speed I think Koto's has power but I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.670 
speed I think Koto's has power but I
think<00:03:31.790> he's<00:03:31.910> fast<00:03:32.330> enough<00:03:32.510> for<00:03:33.110> him<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.260> elude

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
think he's fast enough for him to elude

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.360 
think he's fast enough for him to elude
some<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:34.010> Maddie's<00:03:34.459> quick<00:03:34.970> combinations<00:03:35.209> and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
some of Maddie's quick combinations and

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.440 
some of Maddie's quick combinations and
I<00:03:37.370> think<00:03:37.900> Cotto<00:03:38.900> buckles<00:03:39.410> under<00:03:39.470> pressure

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
I think Cotto buckles under pressure

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.820 
I think Cotto buckles under pressure
when<00:03:41.450> he's<00:03:41.630> being<00:03:41.780> bombarded<00:03:41.959> with<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.620> lot<00:03:42.800> of

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
when he's being bombarded with a lot of

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.370 
when he's being bombarded with a lot of
combinations<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:44.000> way<00:03:44.150> mark<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:45.080> way

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
combinations the way mark the way

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.740 
combinations the way mark the way
margarito<00:03:45.830> did<00:03:46.280> against<00:03:46.760> him<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.090> think<00:03:47.600> that's

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
margarito did against him I think that's

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.960 
margarito did against him I think that's
a<00:03:48.019> little<00:03:48.709> bit<00:03:48.830> of<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:49.070> weakness<00:03:49.280> that<00:03:49.489> that

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
a little bit of a weakness that that

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.390 
a little bit of a weakness that that
Cotto<00:03:50.180> has<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.630> something<00:03:51.019> that<00:03:51.170> many<00:03:52.040> can

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
Cotto has and something that many can

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.950 
Cotto has and something that many can
actually

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
actually

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.860 
actually
open<00:03:54.960> up<00:03:55.050> with<00:03:55.640> but<00:03:56.640> who<00:03:56.880> is<00:03:56.910> your<00:03:57.360> pick<00:03:57.600> for

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
tomorrow night I gotta go with Manny

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.900 
tomorrow night I gotta go with Manny
Manny<00:04:00.300> for<00:04:00.600> unanimous<00:04:00.810> decision<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.910> it's

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
Manny for unanimous decision and it's

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.610 
Manny for unanimous decision and it's
only<00:04:03.120> because<00:04:03.180> man<00:04:03.600> is<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:03.900> much<00:04:04.170> more<00:04:04.200> quicker

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
only because man is so much more quicker

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.770 
only because man is so much more quicker
and<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.130> on<00:04:05.250> top<00:04:05.430> of<00:04:05.520> his<00:04:05.610> game<00:04:05.670> right<00:04:06.000> now<00:04:06.030> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
and is on top of his game right now the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.440 
and is on top of his game right now the
way<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:06.930> transfer<00:04:07.440> each<00:04:07.620> fight<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.760> he<00:04:09.240> just

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
way you transfer each fight and he just

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.390 
way you transfer each fight and he just
steamrolling<00:04:09.870> opponents<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:10.560> for<00:04:11.250> me<00:04:11.370> I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
steamrolling opponents and for me I

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.160 
steamrolling opponents and for me I
think<00:04:11.460> his<00:04:12.000> speed<00:04:12.300> is<00:04:12.330> gonna<00:04:12.600> be<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> big<00:04:12.960> factor

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
think his speed is gonna be a big factor

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.800 
think his speed is gonna be a big factor
despite<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.010> if<00:04:14.580> he<00:04:14.730> uses<00:04:14.940> it<00:04:15.210> properly<00:04:15.600> he's

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
despite and if he uses it properly he's

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.539 
despite and if he uses it properly he's
gonna<00:04:15.930> win<00:04:16.110> this<00:04:16.200> fight<00:04:16.410> well<00:04:17.010> you've<00:04:17.340> heard
