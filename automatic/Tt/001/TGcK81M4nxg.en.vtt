00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.579 
smallest mini pcs you can buy at the
moment<00:01:01.400> and<00:01:02.400> it<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> small<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.300> mean<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.440> could

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
moment and it is small I mean you could

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.910 
moment and it is small I mean you could
quite<00:01:04.949> happily<00:01:04.979> put<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.520> in<00:01:05.640> your<00:01:05.729> pocket

quite happily put this in your pocket
and<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.910> boasts<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.539> variety<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.050> functionality

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and it boasts a variety of functionality

and it boasts a variety of functionality
that<00:01:10.770> I've<00:01:11.160> not<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:11.789> seen<00:01:11.820> all<00:01:12.539> that<00:01:12.660> much

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
that I've not really seen all that much

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
that I've not really seen all that much
for<00:01:13.080> many<00:01:13.259> pcs<00:01:14.539> obviously<00:01:15.539> most<00:01:16.110> mini<00:01:16.350> pcs<00:01:16.740> can

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
for many pcs obviously most mini pcs can

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.969 
for many pcs obviously most mini pcs can
have<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> lot<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.149> functionality<00:01:18.830> but<00:01:19.830> you're

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
have a lot of functionality but you're

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.359 
have a lot of functionality but you're
usually<00:01:20.160> kind<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.550> restricted<00:01:21.030> by<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> space

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
usually kind of restricted by the space

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.800 
usually kind of restricted by the space
the<00:01:23.369> first<00:01:23.640> thing<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.360> say<00:01:24.509> about<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the first thing I want to say about the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.830 
the first thing I want to say about the
QV<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> love<00:01:26.070> about<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.720> fact

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
QV and what I love about it is the fact

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
QV and what I love about it is the fact
that<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.110> comes<00:01:28.289> with<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.940> base

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
that it comes with this is like the base

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.050 
that it comes with this is like the base
model<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.860> expand<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.399> using<00:01:32.789> an

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
model and you can expand it using an

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.559 
model and you can expand it using an
expansion<00:01:33.539> bracket<00:01:34.099> so<00:01:35.099> if<00:01:35.819> you<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.330> fit

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
expansion bracket so if you want to fit

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.609 
expansion bracket so if you want to fit
perhaps<00:01:36.959> a<00:01:37.259> I'm<00:01:37.440> a<00:01:38.149> bigger<00:01:39.149> Drive<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:40.470> can

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
perhaps a I'm a bigger Drive you can

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.070 
perhaps a I'm a bigger Drive you can
just<00:01:41.750> unscrew<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.959> and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.819> you<00:01:45.000> use<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.780> weird

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
just unscrew it and then you use a weird

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.510 
just unscrew it and then you use a weird
cable<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.119> somehow<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.390> connects<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
cable and somehow it connects so you can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.199 
cable and somehow it connects so you can
put<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.849> a<00:01:50.880> 2.5<00:01:51.840> inch<00:01:51.869> drive<00:01:52.319> basically<00:01:53.090> but<00:01:54.090> if

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
put on a 2.5 inch drive basically but if

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:55.490 
put on a 2.5 inch drive basically but if
you<00:01:54.330> don't<00:01:54.539> want<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.110> you're<00:01:55.200> perhaps

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
you don't want that and you're perhaps

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.040 
you don't want that and you're perhaps
just<00:01:55.890> running<00:01:56.160> a<00:01:56.220> thin<00:01:56.429> client<00:01:56.720> no<00:01:57.720> worries

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
just running a thin client no worries

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.300 
just running a thin client no worries

the cubes got you covered have to admit

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.150 
the cubes got you covered have to admit
that<00:02:02.840> aesthetically<00:02:03.840> this<00:02:04.709> is<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.039> the

a lot of work a good example is having

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.480 
a lot of work a good example is having

handle<00:04:39.500> that<00:04:39.650> quite<00:04:39.949> easily<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:41.270> it's

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
handle that quite easily so it's

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.589 
handle that quite easily so it's

more<00:04:45.190> crowds<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.669> people<00:04:47.500> than<00:04:48.500> just<00:04:48.800> one

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
more crowds and people than just one

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.290 
more crowds and people than just one
market<00:04:50.120> it's<00:04:50.360> like<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.539> mini<00:04:50.810> PC<00:04:51.229> for<00:04:51.440> everyone

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
market it's like a mini PC for everyone

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.719 
market it's like a mini PC for everyone
but<00:04:53.930> that's<00:04:54.530> not<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.860> thing<00:04:55.039> that<00:04:55.310> I<00:04:55.460> find

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
but that's not the thing that I find

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.240 
but that's not the thing that I find
really<00:04:55.909> cool<00:04:56.360> about<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.770> little<00:04:58.009> mini

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
really cool about this this little mini

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.450 
really cool about this this little mini
PC<00:04:58.729> it's<00:04:59.389> the<00:04:59.509> energy<00:04:59.870> efficiency<00:05:00.319> I<00:05:00.620> think

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
PC it's the energy efficiency I think

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.129 
PC it's the energy efficiency I think
that<00:05:01.610> these<00:05:01.729> days<00:05:02.000> people<00:05:02.210> just<00:05:02.419> want<00:05:02.780> bigger

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
that these days people just want bigger

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.409 
that these days people just want bigger
and<00:05:03.289> bigger<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.680> bigger<00:05:03.740> computers<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:05.300> they

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
and bigger and bigger computers and they

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:06.490 
and bigger and bigger computers and they
should<00:05:05.599> be<00:05:05.690> looking<00:05:06.020> at<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.229> smallest

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
should be looking at the smallest

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.740 
should be looking at the smallest
solutions<00:05:07.129> that<00:05:07.370> cost<00:05:07.580> less<00:05:07.849> in<00:05:07.879> the<00:05:08.210> long<00:05:08.240> run

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
solutions that cost less in the long run

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.189 
solutions that cost less in the long run
I<00:05:08.780> mean<00:05:09.620> it's<00:05:09.919> cheaper<00:05:10.400> for<00:05:10.580> one<00:05:10.909> for<00:05:11.720> two<00:05:11.900> it's

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
I mean it's cheaper for one for two it's

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.830 
I mean it's cheaper for one for two it's
gonna<00:05:12.289> be<00:05:12.470> cheaper<00:05:12.650> on<00:05:12.860> your<00:05:12.979> electricity<00:05:13.840> and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
gonna be cheaper on your electricity and

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.629 
gonna be cheaper on your electricity and
you're<00:05:15.080> not<00:05:15.199> really<00:05:15.440> sacrificing<00:05:16.009> that<00:05:16.340> much

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
you're not really sacrificing that much

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.089 
you're not really sacrificing that much
so<00:05:17.330> why<00:05:17.780> wouldn't<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.229> consider<00:05:18.440> a<00:05:18.680> computer

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:19.099 
so why wouldn't you consider a computer

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.740 
so why wouldn't you consider a computer
like<00:05:19.220> this

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.779

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
modular design there's also a monitor

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.980 
modular design there's also a monitor
mount<00:06:06.880> so<00:06:07.880> you<00:06:07.969> can<00:06:08.150> stick<00:06:08.389> this<00:06:08.539> on<00:06:08.719> the<00:06:08.840> back

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:08.990 
mount so you can stick this on the back

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.439

of a monarch and that's all in the box
so<00:06:12.169> out<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.740> box<00:06:12.949> you<00:06:13.219> can<00:06:13.400> buy<00:06:13.880> a<00:06:13.909> monitor<00:06:14.419> for

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
so out the box you can buy a monitor for

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.230 
so out the box you can buy a monitor for
maybe<00:06:14.779> 100<00:06:14.930> pounds<00:06:15.529> one<00:06:16.039> of<00:06:16.069> these<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:16.759> you've

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
maybe 100 pounds one of these and you've

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.670 
maybe 100 pounds one of these and you've
got<00:06:17.449> basically<00:06:17.930> what<00:06:18.080> is<00:06:18.199> an<00:06:18.319> all-in-one

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
got basically what is an all-in-one

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.800 
got basically what is an all-in-one
computer<00:06:20.979> so<00:06:21.979> that's<00:06:22.490> it<00:06:22.759> really<00:06:22.909> I<00:06:23.539> don't

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 
computer so that's it really I don't

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.450 
computer so that's it really I don't
have<00:06:24.050> much<00:06:24.259> more<00:06:24.500> to<00:06:24.680> say<00:06:24.830> about<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:25.129> QV

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
have much more to say about the QV

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.749 
have much more to say about the QV
because<00:06:25.759> it's<00:06:25.940> it's<00:06:26.599> not<00:06:26.840> like<00:06:27.050> a<00:06:27.080> crazy<00:06:27.979> top

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
because it's it's not like a crazy top

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.029 
because it's it's not like a crazy top
of<00:06:28.879> the<00:06:28.969> end<00:06:29.150> gaming<00:06:29.990> notebook<00:06:30.560> it's<00:06:30.770> just<00:06:30.949> a

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 
of the end gaming notebook it's just a

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.860 
of the end gaming notebook it's just a
simple<00:06:31.400> computer<00:06:32.500> but<00:06:33.500> what<00:06:33.650> they've<00:06:33.860> done<00:06:33.889> I

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
simple computer but what they've done I
