00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.870
 video as promised I want to talk about 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.150
 knives 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.580
 the walls of the castle backlog is such 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.040
 button behind the knife handle 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.660
 both talk i want about how easy it is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 you can simply open with one hand 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 I 'll show it in several ways. 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.630
 on two different knives on a small and 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.359
 large with the same type of lock and 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.680
 Now we simulate a situation as if similar 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.599
 with real when one hand is busy 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.000
 suppose one hand is busy with me 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.750
 shoe second hand I can get out 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 pocket knife 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.890
 I take and open it and I can already cut 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 let's say sausage there cut off 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 fishing line if i'm fishing either 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 anything else cut or cut for 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 order to open such a knife one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.930
 hand you need to firmly take it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.789
 about the middle of his blade and on 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.039
 knife opening action is divided by two 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.329
 Ways first is cutting the swing from yourself and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.629
 We already fix the legs and we can 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.670
 cut sausage the same and method 2 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 we also hold tight to the middle 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 knife with two fingers big and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.760
 index and middle finger gurney 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.740
 grip 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 a little helping yourself repel either 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.530
 if we have pushed the middle finger 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 the handle or the end of it just opened 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.880
 tilting the legs and suspension on the handle 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.700
 he opens further can there 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.930
 somehow twist legs to move 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.180
 but in my opinion one of the simplest 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.860
 ways to take the legs a normal bench press 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.600
 it either pull down and expand 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.780
 either way that require a little and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.270
 atm hand dexterity opened legs and go 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.939
 0 hand and throw it as follows 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.009
 the way that moment we opened 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.290
 legs here we hold on the index 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.630
 finger and fix the thumb we 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.040
 we shift it to the thumb 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 I turn around, so to speak, guide, I 'm afraid 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.729
 remove and he attacks the hand you need 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.700
 just remove your index finger and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.630
 just in time to move your thumb 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.950
 and she finger palm 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.650
 that is, it is already just synchronous to do and 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.300
 he will fall his palms 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.860
 in principle, you can not even traumatic 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.899
 the main thing to do the same synchronous 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.910
 most want to show with a small knife 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.680
 it's a little simpler and harder 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.830
 at the same time and more difficult because he 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.930
 lighter blade lighter scolding 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.450
 it is heavy and it turns out very bad 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.630
 counterweight and have a way of turning a knife 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.020
 it is somewhat more difficult to catch do not 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.010
 get over it looks like 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.090
 in the following way 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.380
 swung open it here between us 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.959
 thumb, remove the thumb 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.550
 fall out in sync first big 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.890
 first we collect the index finger 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.500
 then big as if there is literally in 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:52.030
 split second he falls london here here 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.709
 cross you need to get the hang of the center of gravity 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.360
 all things we like anyway 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.730
 prepare yourself or the second way 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.770
 open up and need a little nagging 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.590
 so that at the right moment the legs do not fall out of 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.900
 hands all these nuances sort of with this knife 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.760
 that handle heavy blades fine and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.010
 bad counterweight is very necessary the same 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.440
 take into account and get the hang of it 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.580
 a certain foot padvar let's say here 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.769
 something like this 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.570
 but I want to say goodbye to you wait for new 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.570
 good luck video
