 In terms of content, the aim is to change Twitter and medicines 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.840
 that's about 80 percent of the companies over 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.810

 First only for a consultation or a comparable he says 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
 The customers can then go downhill

 The Care Emergency Call Center Dusseldorf is the first in Germany 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740

 Pflegenotstand not only long search but quick help under 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.290
 a central emergency number 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.130
 we have outnumbered postal codes 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.750
 and Haider have offered next to Nursing here in Europe the tooth too 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.190
 then take it 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.260
 quotes in quotes so that means if a call in the 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.260
 Emergency Center comes in then they are able based on the postal code 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.609

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:50.500
 they can call immediately 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 and worth living out and after this first use allows games too 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.649
 no matter what is done on this mission 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.239
 The first use is basically free for the affected one 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:05.239
 Use today is not an acute emergency yet the old lady is after one 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.489
 Hospitalization dependent on a nursing service 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.200
 In a personal conversation, Sister Ocker returns to life 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.790
 of her new patients and makes such a picture Jenoptik rose by 4 weeks 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.939
 but also «If you are in the semifinals relatives too sooner 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:26.040
 where good father will dismiss daughter on the hospital and there still 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.369
 nothing was regulated

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.889
 change from the dressing percentage to the catheter or continue fighting 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.810
 Kerstin Hohmann who, together with a colleague, came up with the idea of ​​a fly 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:48.559
 Emergency Center has implemented is convinced 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:51.619
 The interest is likely in Cologne Aachen and Heinsberg 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:52.730
 is working 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.410

 The advantage is that we avoid hospitalizations 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.799
 he can experience very often that GPs or emergency physicians call 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.310
 and ask us to come over in the evening, we have one 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.569
 Needed emergency but need in winter again a nursing service of 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.939
 In the evening, a specialization makes percent otherwise they would have the 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.239
 to bring the affected to the hospital that is the same of course 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.129
 even for the affected he may need to go from Mainz Hospital because 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.609
 the tendency is very well that the affected like to stay at home 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.639
 wish you all the best 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.810
 the fast personal care offers a straight 27 older people 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.969
 and of course also the relatives 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:47.669
 The AOK Kramer in Dusseldorf should in the future nurses throughout 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.020
 Germany arriving emergency cases are alerted 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.409
 over a nationwide uniform number 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.510
 and that already from 2013 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.980
 that is at least the ambitious goal of the founders of the Düsseldorfer 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.560
