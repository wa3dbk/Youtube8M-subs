so I think that is pretty good thinking
that<00:07:38.180> I<00:07:38.389> probably<00:07:38.750> would<00:07:39.020> have<00:07:39.050> had<00:07:39.199> to<00:07:39.469> buy

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.649 
that I probably would have had to buy
another<00:07:39.680> of<00:07:40.129> those<00:07:40.310> small<00:07:40.759> cases<00:07:41.060> I<00:07:41.509> would

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:41.659 
another of those small cases I would

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:45.640 
another of those small cases I would
