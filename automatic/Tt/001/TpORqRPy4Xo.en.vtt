00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.860 
spend these four episodes looking at how
to<00:00:11.410> design<00:00:11.860> a<00:00:12.160> good<00:00:12.550> living<00:00:13.090> room<00:00:13.120> space<00:00:13.570> yeah

and<00:00:14.020> as<00:00:14.110> an<00:00:14.260> example<00:00:14.710> what<00:00:14.800> we<00:00:14.890> thought<00:00:15.070> we

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.220 
and as an example what we thought we

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.650 
and as an example what we thought we
would<00:00:15.250> do<00:00:15.490> is<00:00:15.640> we<00:00:15.760> would<00:00:15.850> take<00:00:15.910> a<00:00:16.059> project<00:00:16.539> from

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
would do is we would take a project from

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.329 
would do is we would take a project from
our<00:00:16.779> portfolio<00:00:17.410> that<00:00:17.439> really<00:00:17.829> recently

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
completed and look at how we detailed

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.720 
completed and look at how we detailed
and<00:00:20.140> design<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.560> living<00:00:20.800> space<00:00:21.039> and<00:00:21.159> this<00:00:21.550> one

windows<00:00:41.590> that<00:00:42.040> looked<00:00:42.370> out<00:00:42.520> into<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.090> back

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
windows that looked out into the back

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.050 
windows that looked out into the back
into<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.410> backyard<00:00:44.890> and<00:00:45.490> I<00:00:45.610> want<00:00:45.790> to<00:00:45.880> talk

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
into the backyard and I want to talk

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.540 
into the backyard and I want to talk
about<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.450> sort<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.720> general

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
about the sort of general

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.590 
about the sort of general
disorganization<00:00:48.550> of<00:00:48.940> the<00:00:49.060> living<00:00:49.330> and<00:00:49.480> dining

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
disorganization of the living and dining

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.210 
disorganization of the living and dining
space<00:00:49.750> because<00:00:50.260> we<00:00:50.380> see<00:00:50.560> this<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.800> lot<00:00:50.920> of<00:00:51.040> times

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
space because we see this a lot of times

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.530 
space because we see this a lot of times
in<00:00:51.370> houses<00:00:51.730> where<00:00:51.880> we<00:00:51.910> come<00:00:52.120> in<00:00:52.270> to<00:00:52.390> do<00:00:52.510> a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
in houses where we come in to do a

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.750 
in houses where we come in to do a
remodel<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.290> issue<00:00:53.950> seems<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.370> be<00:00:54.580> in

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
remodel and the issue seems to be in

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.340 
remodel and the issue seems to be in
spaces<00:00:55.180> where<00:00:55.360> you<00:00:55.570> have<00:00:55.750> both<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:55.960> living

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
spaces where you have both the living

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.840 
spaces where you have both the living
room<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.710> dining<00:00:56.890> room<00:00:57.160> sharing<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.640> space

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
room and the dining room sharing a space

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.580 
room and the dining room sharing a space
that<00:00:58.240> there<00:00:58.420> really<00:00:58.570> isn't<00:00:58.840> a<00:00:59.020> sense<00:00:59.260> of<00:00:59.440> where

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
that there really isn't a sense of where

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.810 
that there really isn't a sense of where
the<00:00:59.620> dining<00:01:00.070> room<00:01:00.100> should<00:01:00.460> be<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:00.640> where<00:01:00.730> the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
the dining room should be and where the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.950 
the dining room should be and where the
living<00:01:01.000> room<00:01:01.210> should<00:01:01.390> be<00:01:01.480> or<00:01:01.600> not<00:01:01.750> is

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
living room should be or not is

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.870 
living room should be or not is
primarily<00:01:02.770> because<00:01:03.160> there's<00:01:03.340> a<00:01:03.430> lack<00:01:03.610> of<00:01:03.640> a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
primarily because there's a lack of a

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.429 
primarily because there's a lack of a
focal<00:01:04.269> point<00:01:04.299> so<00:01:04.659> one<00:01:04.839> of<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:04.989> principal

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
focal point so one of the principal

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.170 
focal point so one of the principal
things<00:01:05.470> that<00:01:05.800> we<00:01:05.890> had<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.130> do<00:01:06.280> in<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.520> design

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
things that we had to do in the design

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.640 
things that we had to do in the design
of<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.540> living<00:01:07.750> space<00:01:07.930> was<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.290> create<00:01:08.530> a

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
of the living space was to create a

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.530 
of the living space was to create a
focal<00:01:09.010> point<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.640> ground<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.180> overall

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
focal point to ground the overall

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.180 
focal point to ground the overall
furniture<00:01:11.080> arrangement<00:01:11.590> that's<00:01:11.800> right<00:01:12.010> and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
furniture arrangement that's right and

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.860 
furniture arrangement that's right and
that<00:01:12.220> meant<00:01:12.580> looking<00:01:12.970> for<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.180> wall<00:01:13.480> and<00:01:13.810> we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
that meant looking for a wall and we

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.270 
that meant looking for a wall and we
obviously<00:01:14.050> we're<00:01:14.560> not<00:01:14.740> going<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:14.950> put<00:01:15.190> the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
obviously we're not going to put the

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.219 
obviously we're not going to put the
focal<00:01:15.610> point<00:01:15.820> on<00:01:15.970> this<00:01:16.180> wall<00:01:16.420> because<00:01:16.780> because

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
focal point on this wall because because

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.630 
focal point on this wall because because
that's<00:01:17.380> where<00:01:17.620> all<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.830> windows<00:01:18.159> were<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.550> a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
that's where all the windows were and a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.610 
that's where all the windows were and a
focal<00:01:18.970> point<00:01:19.150> of<00:01:19.270> a<00:01:19.360> TV<00:01:19.750> or<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:19.930> fireplace<00:01:20.409> would

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
focal point of a TV or a fireplace would

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.230 
focal point of a TV or a fireplace would
just<00:01:20.800> obscure<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.670> so<00:01:21.790> we<00:01:21.970> thought<00:01:22.180> that

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
just obscure that and so we thought that

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.930 
just obscure that and so we thought that
this<00:01:22.420> actually<00:01:23.290> was<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:24.100> right<00:01:24.310> wall<00:01:24.610> to<00:01:24.820> do

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
this actually was the right wall to do

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.580 
this actually was the right wall to do
that<00:01:25.120> and<00:01:25.300> so<00:01:25.390> we<00:01:25.540> reverse<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.170> living<00:01:26.440> room

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
that and so we reverse the living room

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.560 
that and so we reverse the living room
and<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:27.130> dining<00:01:27.310> room<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.820> so<00:01:27.940> there<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.360> can

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
and the dining room and so there you can

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.360 
and the dining room and so there you can
see<00:01:28.810> now<00:01:29.020> that's<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.740> window<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.130> we<00:01:30.250> were

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
see now that's the window that we were

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.280 
see now that's the window that we were
just<00:01:30.580> talking<00:01:30.640> about<00:01:31.120> and<00:01:31.479> this<00:01:31.690> is<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.080> end

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
just talking about and this is the end

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.960 
just talking about and this is the end
wall<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.159> space<00:01:33.520> yeah<00:01:33.790> and<00:01:33.880> it's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
wall of that space yeah and it's

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.000 
wall of that space yeah and it's
important<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.540> talk<00:01:34.720> about<00:01:34.780> what<00:01:35.260> types<00:01:35.830> of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
important to talk about what types of

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.890 
important to talk about what types of
things<00:01:36.070> constitute<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:37.090> focal<00:01:37.420> point<00:01:37.450> because

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
things constitute a focal point because

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.510 
things constitute a focal point because
in<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.110> living<00:01:38.380> room<00:01:38.530> space<00:01:38.770> there's<00:01:39.159> sort<00:01:39.430> of

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
in a living room space there's sort of

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.830 
in a living room space there's sort of
three<00:01:39.700> things<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.120> can<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.360> as<00:01:40.479> a<00:01:40.510> focal

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
three things you can have as a focal

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.240 
three things you can have as a focal
point<00:01:40.870> you<00:01:41.049> can<00:01:41.200> obviously<00:01:41.440> have<00:01:41.650> like<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:42.040> did

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
point you can obviously have like we did

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.399 
point you can obviously have like we did
a<00:01:42.370> fireplace<00:01:43.210> another<00:01:43.900> thing<00:01:44.140> that<00:01:44.290> could

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
a fireplace another thing that could

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.690 
a fireplace another thing that could
typically<00:01:44.799> be<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> focal<00:01:45.280> point<00:01:45.310> would<00:01:45.580> be<00:01:45.610> a

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
typically be a focal point would be a

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.399 
typically be a focal point would be a
television<00:01:46.119> yeah<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.930> third<00:01:47.110> thing<00:01:47.290> I

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
television yeah and the third thing I

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.630 
television yeah and the third thing I
think<00:01:47.440> would<00:01:47.770> be<00:01:47.799> a<00:01:47.890> view<00:01:48.220> if<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:48.460> had<00:01:48.610> a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
think would be a view if you had a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.370 
think would be a view if you had a
beautiful<00:01:48.909> view<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.600> know<00:01:49.930> you're<00:01:50.080> looking

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
beautiful view you know you're looking

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.500 
beautiful view you know you're looking
out<00:01:50.470> sort<00:01:50.799> of<00:01:50.830> at<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.010> Vista<00:01:51.729> then<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.210> may<00:01:52.360> want

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
out sort of at a Vista then you may want

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.969 
out sort of at a Vista then you may want
to<00:01:52.690> orient<00:01:52.840> your<00:01:53.110> furniture<00:01:53.470> towards<00:01:53.799> that

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
to orient your furniture towards that

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.440 
to orient your furniture towards that
it's<00:01:54.190> right<00:01:54.310> these<00:01:54.490> clients<00:01:54.880> wanted<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.299> have

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
it's right these clients wanted to have

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.240 
it's right these clients wanted to have
the<00:01:55.570> fireplace<00:01:55.960> not<00:01:56.350> just<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.799> view<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.130> so

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
the fireplace not just the view and so

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.649 
the fireplace not just the view and so
we<00:01:57.400> were<00:01:57.490> able<00:01:57.580> to<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:57.909> both<00:01:58.180> at<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.420> same<00:01:58.600> time

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
we were able to do both at the same time

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.020 
we were able to do both at the same time
which<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:59.080> actually<00:01:59.260> kind<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.860> like<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:00.580> you<00:02:01.000> can

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
which I actually kind of like so you can

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.460 
which I actually kind of like so you can
see<00:02:01.180> that<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.570> focal<00:02:01.960> point<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.229> something

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
see that this focal point is something

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.109 
see that this focal point is something
that<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.680> inserted<00:02:03.159> into<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.729> room<00:02:03.880> we've<00:02:04.090> got

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
that we inserted into the room we've got

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:08.070 
that we inserted into the room we've got
a<00:02:04.540> fireplace<00:02:05.880> insert<00:02:06.880> gas<00:02:07.090> fireplace<00:02:07.659> it<00:02:07.869> sits

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
a fireplace insert gas fireplace it sits

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.839 
a fireplace insert gas fireplace it sits
inside<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.739> wall<00:02:08.950> it's<00:02:09.220> direct<00:02:09.610> vent

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
inside of the wall it's direct vent

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.970 
inside of the wall it's direct vent
going<00:02:10.060> out<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.569> then<00:02:10.780> but<00:02:11.290> it's<00:02:11.440> not<00:02:11.620> just

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
going out and we then but it's not just

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.710 
going out and we then but it's not just
that<00:02:12.310> if<00:02:12.490> you<00:02:12.610> just<00:02:12.849> did<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.090> on<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.599> wall

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
that if you just did that on the wall

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.660 
that if you just did that on the wall
this<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:13.930> something<00:02:14.230> you<00:02:14.319> see<00:02:14.349> a<00:02:14.560> lot<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.950> that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
this is something you see a lot of that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.570 
this is something you see a lot of that
fireplace<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.480> too<00:02:16.720> small<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.530> scale<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.490> the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
fireplace is too small in scale to the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.620 
fireplace is too small in scale to the
rest<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.000> roommates<00:02:19.150> that<00:02:19.240> can<00:02:19.420> apply

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
rest of the roommates that can apply

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.030 
rest of the roommates that can apply
that's<00:02:20.020> right<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.349> an<00:02:20.530> appliance<00:02:20.770> what

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's right it's just an appliance what

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.800 
that's right it's just an appliance what
you<00:02:21.160> need<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.970> think<00:02:22.270> about<00:02:22.360> how<00:02:22.750> to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
you need to do is think about how to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.140 
you need to do is think about how to
expand<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.860> scale<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.430> first<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:24.940> all<00:02:25.000> we

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
expand the scale so that first of all we

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.580 
expand the scale so that first of all we
have<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.900> stone<00:02:26.170> we're<00:02:26.290> going<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.470> be

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
have the the stone we're going to be

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.780 
have the the stone we're going to be
talking<00:02:26.890> about<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.099> in<00:02:27.250> more<00:02:27.370> detail<00:02:27.760> in

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
talking about this in more detail in

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.460 
talking about this in more detail in
another<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.480> another<00:02:28.599> episode<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.349> then

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
another in another episode and then

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.920 
another in another episode and then
expand<00:02:29.950> out<00:02:30.130> with<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.610> storage<00:02:31.360> on<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.720> side

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
expand out with the storage on the side

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.840 
expand out with the storage on the side
to<00:02:32.140> create<00:02:32.260> a<00:02:32.410> whole<00:02:32.620> composition<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.640> what's

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
to create a whole composition and what's

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.070 
to create a whole composition and what's
really<00:02:34.120> interesting<00:02:34.300> now<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.930> you're

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
really interesting now is you're

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.020 
really interesting now is you're
starting<00:02:35.260> to<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.739> how<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.010> living<00:02:36.340> room<00:02:36.610> zone

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
starting to see how the living room zone

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.000 
starting to see how the living room zone
is<00:02:37.360> defined<00:02:37.630> differently<00:02:37.989> from<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.650> dining

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
is defined differently from the dining

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.860 
is defined differently from the dining
room<00:02:39.160> zone<00:02:39.370> within<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.760> same<00:02:39.940> space<00:02:40.239> and<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
room zone within the same space and the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.210 
room zone within the same space and the
way<00:02:41.020> we<00:02:41.170> were<00:02:41.290> able<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.500> do<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.890> course<00:02:41.920> is

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
way we were able to do that of course is

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.620 
way we were able to do that of course is
with<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.519> fireplace<00:02:42.850> we're<00:02:43.090> also<00:02:43.239> able<00:02:43.510> to

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
with that fireplace we're also able to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.210 
with that fireplace we're also able to
do<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.140> paint<00:02:44.620> color<00:02:44.830> change

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
do that with that paint color change

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.490 
do that with that paint color change
very<00:02:45.819> very<00:02:46.000> subtle<00:02:46.480> detail<00:02:46.840> but<00:02:47.050> we<00:02:47.140> created

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
very very subtle detail but we created

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.320 
very very subtle detail but we created
this<00:02:47.650> bulkhead<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.310> we<00:02:48.640> wrap<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.090> paint

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
this bulkhead and we wrap the paint

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.759 
this bulkhead and we wrap the paint
color<00:02:49.510> from<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.870> bulkhead<00:02:50.140> down<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.620> that

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
color from the bulkhead down on that

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.710 
color from the bulkhead down on that
wall<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.250> kind<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.489> grounds<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.269> furniture

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
wall so it kind of grounds the furniture

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.930 
wall so it kind of grounds the furniture
into<00:02:52.959> that<00:02:53.410> corner<00:02:53.799> then<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.340> dining<00:02:54.819> room

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
into that corner then the dining room

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.460 
into that corner then the dining room
which<00:02:55.120> we're<00:02:55.269> not<00:02:55.360> speaking<00:02:55.750> specifically

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
which we're not speaking specifically

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.840 
which we're not speaking specifically
about<00:02:56.560> dining<00:02:57.010> rooms<00:02:57.130> has<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.340> light<00:02:57.610> fixture

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
about dining rooms has a light fixture

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.059 
about dining rooms has a light fixture
which<00:02:58.420> sets<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.959> in<00:02:59.170> place<00:02:59.380> so<00:02:59.890> it's<00:03:00.010> not

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
which sets that in place so it's not

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.970 
which sets that in place so it's not
just<00:03:00.489> about<00:03:00.720> common<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:02.380> not<00:03:02.530> just<00:03:02.769> about

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
just about common it's not just about

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.710 
just about common it's not just about
focal<00:03:03.400> points<00:03:03.700> with<00:03:03.880> living<00:03:04.209> rooms<00:03:04.390> we<00:03:04.540> also

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
focal points with living rooms we also

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.539 
focal points with living rooms we also
need<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.170> think<00:03:05.290> about<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.680> organization<00:03:05.860> of

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
need to think about the organization of

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.280 
need to think about the organization of
the<00:03:06.670> furniture<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.239> there<00:03:07.540> it's<00:03:07.930> important

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
the furniture and there it's important

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.390 
the furniture and there it's important
to<00:03:08.350> think<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.590> you're<00:03:08.739> not<00:03:08.769> just<00:03:09.100> doing<00:03:09.220> it

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
to think that you're not just doing it

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.640 
to think that you're not just doing it
compositionally<00:03:10.120> for<00:03:10.299> how<00:03:10.390> it<00:03:10.540> looks<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.319> or

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
compositionally for how it looks but or

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.740 
compositionally for how it looks but or
and<00:03:11.920> it's<00:03:12.069> not<00:03:12.220> just<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.549> furniture<00:03:13.030> showroom

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750

and it's not just a furniture showroom
it's<00:03:14.170> actually<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.560> place<00:03:14.769> than<00:03:14.920> what<00:03:15.010> you're

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
it's actually a place than what you're
