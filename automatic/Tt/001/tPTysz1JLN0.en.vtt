think<00:02:30.000> it's<00:02:30.330> i<00:02:30.599> wasn't<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.319> keep

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
think it's i wasn't going to keep

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.780 
think it's i wasn't going to keep
spending<00:02:31.860> money<00:02:31.980> on<00:02:32.129> it<00:02:32.340> though<00:02:32.489> because<00:02:32.610> i

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
spending money on it though because i

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.520 
spending money on it though because i
think<00:02:32.849> that<00:02:33.269> it's<00:02:33.870> going<00:02:34.019> to<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.200> pretty<00:02:34.349> easy

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
think that it's going to be pretty easy

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.860 
think that it's going to be pretty easy
to<00:02:34.830> get<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.250> crest<00:02:35.670> once<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.209> forging<00:02:36.660> gets

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
