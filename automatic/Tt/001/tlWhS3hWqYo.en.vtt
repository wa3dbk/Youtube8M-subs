00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
to try for the Black Watch instead of

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.540 
to try for the Black Watch instead of
the<00:04:02.910> silver<00:04:03.570> one<00:04:03.980> might<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.040> able<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.520> it

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it's hard I if I could use my angles

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.630 
it's hard I if I could use my angles
which<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.760> can't<00:04:12.650> dump<00:04:13.650> staggers<00:04:14.250> in<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.460> way

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
which I can't dump staggers in the way
