00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.780 
bat and then I go all the way over to
four<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.229> hit<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> six<00:01:52.979> times<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.520> reason

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
four and I hit that six times the reason

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.060 
four and I hit that six times the reason
I<00:01:53.880> hit<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.060> six<00:01:54.450> times<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.649> when<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
I hit that six times is because when you

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.789 
I hit that six times is because when you
use<00:01:56.399> number<00:01:57.060> two<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.540> gives<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.320> a<00:02:00.799> little

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
use number two it gives you a little

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.859 
use number two it gives you a little
buff<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.520> little<00:02:03.509> buff<00:02:03.719> right<00:02:04.259> over<00:02:04.560> here<00:02:04.829> is

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
buff that little buff right over here is

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.619 
buff that little buff right over here is
backdraft<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.340> don't<00:02:08.340> use<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.060> castle

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
backdraft I don't use that with castle

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.320 
backdraft I don't use that with castle
because<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.259> waste<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.830> use<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:12.180> my

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
because it's a waste I use that with my

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.730 
because it's a waste I use that with my
number<00:02:12.599> four<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.140> that's

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
number four and that's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
number four and that's
it's<00:02:13.860> amazing<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.670> works<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.090> best<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.510> if

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
it's amazing it works the best and if

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.190 
it's amazing it works the best and if
you<00:02:16.170> use<00:02:16.440> two<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.860> them<00:02:17.690> you'll<00:02:18.690> see<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.140> I
