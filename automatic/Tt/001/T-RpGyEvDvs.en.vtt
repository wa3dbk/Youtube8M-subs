 at this time we add the meat 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.219
 you have to do it stirring 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:06.480
 constantly and disrupting the one that does not 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:09.900
 we are going to make the trunk 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.720
 and agile we mix everything very well what 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.069
 we stir and until the meat 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.299

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.569
 and we leave them for two minutes 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.409
 in two minutes we returned to see how 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.450

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.989
 you want 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.430

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.530
 for 20 minutes 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:59.849
 we take it out and leave it in low 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.849
 remember on bass for 20 minutes 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:12.660
 Now let's make mashed potatoes 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.989
 now we add three quarters 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.889
 of the cheese that we have I'm going 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.889
 adding gradually 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.520
 at this moment we pass the mixture of 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.520
 ground meat to retract it 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.410
 I am having fun with this 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.900
 not spend much broth 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.900
 look at the broth that remained was always 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.340
 is lived this caldito is what can 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.340
 save for another preparation 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.479
 now we add the mashed potatoes 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.450
 that we have to prepare 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.450
 ah 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.860
 you have to spread it out right away 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.370
 I begin to spread it well above the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.370
 Ground beef 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.870
 look at how to spread the potato in this 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.630
 moment I add the cheese 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.800
 that all of you have what you want 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.800
 let it be grated 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:36.720
 and now we take it to the oven at 200 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:39.449
 free Centigrade until I 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.020
 I calculate 120 minutes after I 'm 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:45.820
 well golden I'll tell you how long 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.690
 it was in the oven exactly 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:52.090
 that's how our ground meat pie was 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:56.889
 in the oven I had it exactly 20 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:59.379
 15 minutes minutes fire up and water 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:02.110
 and five minutes the last five 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.639
 minutes to gratinate only the 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.770
 part of above 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:09.219
 remember that everything is cooked all 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:12.430
 it's fine then the important thing is that 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:16.960
 free look like 0 from rich rich divine 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:20.440

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.449
 It was very rich, I hope you like it. 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.449
