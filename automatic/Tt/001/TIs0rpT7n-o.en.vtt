00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.220 

basically<00:00:43.420> what<00:00:43.600> I've<00:00:43.660> done<00:00:43.780> is<00:00:43.900> I've<00:00:44.020> cast

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
basically what I've done is I've cast

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.500 
basically what I've done is I've cast
out<00:00:44.410> a<00:00:44.530> letter<00:00:44.830> to<00:00:44.980> look<00:00:45.520> around<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.880> area<00:00:45.910> and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
out a letter to look around the area and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.090 
out a letter to look around the area and
I<00:00:46.600> think<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:47.140> best<00:00:47.290> feature<00:00:47.380> to<00:00:47.710> fish<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.040> at

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
I think the best feature to fish to at

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.040 
I think the best feature to fish to at
the<00:00:48.160> moment<00:00:48.460> he's<00:00:48.640> just<00:00:49.630> down<00:00:49.750> there<00:00:49.930> where

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
the moment he's just down there where

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.810 
the moment he's just down there where
the<00:00:50.080> marker<00:00:50.410> flow<00:00:50.560> to<00:00:50.620> I'll<00:00:51.190> get<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.460> depth<00:00:51.670> of

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
the marker flow to I'll get the depth of

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.210 
the marker flow to I'll get the depth of
around<00:00:51.940> about<00:00:52.240> four<00:00:52.600> and<00:00:52.660> a<00:00:52.750> five<00:00:52.810> foot<00:00:53.410> it's<00:00:54.160> a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
around about four and a five foot it's a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.770 
around about four and a five foot it's a
little<00:00:54.430> bit<00:00:54.520> of<00:00:54.610> clear<00:00:54.790> gravel<00:00:55.210> there's<00:00:55.540> a<00:00:55.630> lot

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
little bit of clear gravel there's a lot

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.260 
little bit of clear gravel there's a lot
of<00:00:55.930> weed<00:00:56.290> over<00:00:56.560> towards<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.010> left<00:00:57.180> there's<00:00:58.180> a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.270

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.970 
of weed over towards the left there's a
lot<00:00:58.420> of<00:00:58.570> silt<00:00:59.080> around<00:00:59.440> this<00:00:59.559> sort<00:00:59.710> of<00:00:59.830> area

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
lot of silt around this sort of area

that's gonna be the spot to fish to
tonight<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.680> plan<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.160> to<00:01:06.910> get<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.510> fish

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
tonight the plan is to get the fish

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.790 
tonight the plan is to get the fish
rooting<00:01:07.960> around<00:01:08.020> at<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.380> time<00:01:08.620> of<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.740> year

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800

rooting around at this time of the year
they<00:01:09.100> go<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.490> shallower<00:01:09.790> areas<00:01:10.210> and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
they go to the shallower areas and

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.840 
they go to the shallower areas and
that's<00:01:10.479> a<00:01:10.540> nice<00:01:10.690> shallower<00:01:11.050> area<00:01:11.410> so<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.340> nice

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
that's a nice shallower area so a nice

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
that's a nice shallower area so a nice
broad<00:01:13.630> scattering<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.380> four<00:01:14.800> five<00:01:15.070> bombs<00:01:15.369> and

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:36.939 
but that's just really just to keep a

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.849 
but that's just really just to keep a
good<00:02:37.030> attention<00:02:37.329> in<00:02:37.540> there<00:02:37.719> so<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.379> fish<00:02:38.590> runs

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859
