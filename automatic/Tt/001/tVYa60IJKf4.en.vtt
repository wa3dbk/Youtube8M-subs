00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.660 

it's<00:00:22.240> going<00:00:22.510> into<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:23.170> spin<00:00:23.560> cycle<00:00:24.010> you<00:00:24.490> can

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
it's going into the spin cycle you can

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.050 
it's going into the spin cycle you can
hear<00:00:24.970> the<00:00:25.120> water<00:00:25.300> draining<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.400> you<00:00:27.610> hear<00:00:27.910> the

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
hear the water draining but you hear the

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.630 
hear the water draining but you hear the
motor<00:00:28.770> but<00:00:29.770> it's<00:00:29.950> not<00:00:30.190> spinning<00:00:32.370> can<00:00:33.370> you<00:00:33.460> hear

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
motor but it's not spinning can you hear

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.280 
motor but it's not spinning can you hear
the<00:00:33.730> motor

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.580 

but<00:00:40.950> all<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.670> got<00:00:41.970> to<00:00:42.060> do<00:00:42.890> lift<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> lid<00:00:45.590> closed

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
but all I got to do lift the lid closed

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.450 
but all I got to do lift the lid closed
it<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:48.330> it<00:00:48.690> will<00:00:48.810> start<00:00:49.110> spinning<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.950> mean<00:00:50.310> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it and it will start spinning I mean it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.720 
it and it will start spinning I mean it
runs<00:00:50.730> through<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.240> whole<00:00:51.450> cycle<00:00:52.490> like<00:00:53.490> it

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
runs through the whole cycle like it

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.200 
runs through the whole cycle like it
should<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:55.610> now<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.330> it's<00:00:57.540> spinning

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
should as now you can see it's spinning

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.630 
should as now you can see it's spinning
it's<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.810> got<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> do<00:01:01.470> that<00:01:01.680> twice<00:01:02.010> near

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it's just I got to do that twice near

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.010 
it's just I got to do that twice near
they<00:01:02.850> wash<00:01:03.380> I'm<00:01:04.380> you're<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.830> close<00:01:06.020> whenever

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
they wash I'm you're not close whenever

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.670 
they wash I'm you're not close whenever
I'm<00:01:07.380> doing<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.800> wash<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.630> had<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:09.960> right

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
I'm doing the wash I had to do it right

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.999 
I'm doing the wash I had to do it right
about<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:12.050> it'll<00:01:13.050> start<00:01:13.440> draining<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
about here it'll start draining the

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:21.640 
about here it'll start draining the
water<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:15.210> start<00:01:15.570> their<00:01:15.780> rents<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.840> also

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.749 

right<00:01:22.650> about<00:01:23.150> there<00:01:24.530> you'll<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.830> also<00:01:26.369> so

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
right about there you'll see also so

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.120 
right about there you'll see also so
here<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.320> here<00:01:30.140> I'll<00:01:31.140> open<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> lid<00:01:31.830> and

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
here and here I'll open the lid and

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.400 
here and here I'll open the lid and
it'll<00:01:32.369> work<00:01:32.550> fine<00:01:32.910> I've<00:01:33.540> checked<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> lid

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
it'll work fine I've checked the lid

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.310 
it'll work fine I've checked the lid
switch<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.070> bought<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> new<00:01:35.610> timer<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.420> put<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
switch I bought a new timer and put the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.980 
switch I bought a new timer and put the
timer<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> sent<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.390> ran<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
timer on there and sent it back I ran it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.600 
timer on there and sent it back I ran it
over<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.440> over<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.479> worked<00:01:42.479> great

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.280 

and<00:01:46.120> now<00:01:46.300> it's<00:01:46.540> going<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.750> go<00:01:46.930> through<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
and now it's going to go through the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.700 
and now it's going to go through the
process<00:01:47.530> again<00:01:48.060> right<00:01:49.060> before<00:01:49.240> spin<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.350> I'll

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
process again right before spin and I'll

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.690 
process again right before spin and I'll
have<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.070> do<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.340> same<00:01:51.640> thing<00:01:53.160> if<00:01:54.160> anybody

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
have to do the same thing if anybody

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.470 
have to do the same thing if anybody
knows<00:01:55.000> anything<00:01:55.950> about<00:01:56.950> washes<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:57.880> appreciate

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
knows anything about washes I appreciate

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.710 
knows anything about washes I appreciate
the<00:01:58.630> help<00:01:58.900> I<00:01:59.170> got<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> Kenmore<00:02:01.080> 70<00:02:02.080> series<00:02:03.720> and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
the help I got a Kenmore 70 series and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.330 
the help I got a Kenmore 70 series and
you<00:02:04.870> see<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.140> controls<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:06.010> am<00:02:08.070> that's<00:02:09.070> my

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
you see the controls I am that's my

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.250 
you see the controls I am that's my
problem<00:02:09.550> i<00:02:10.000> checked<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.420> lid<00:02:10.690> switch<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
problem i checked the lid switch a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.610 
problem i checked the lid switch a
hardwired<00:02:11.920> it<00:02:12.250> just<00:02:13.240> straight<00:02:13.630> up<00:02:13.660> without

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
hardwired it just straight up without

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.250 
hardwired it just straight up without
the<00:02:14.830> lid<00:02:15.010> switch<00:02:15.250> but<00:02:16.240> every<00:02:16.510> time<00:02:16.750> right

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the lid switch but every time right

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.550 
the lid switch but every time right
there<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.980> right<00:02:18.510> about<00:02:19.510> there<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.200> then<00:02:20.470> I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
there and right about there and then I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.199 
there and right about there and then I
have<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.800> do<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:21.160> again<00:02:21.220> right<00:02:21.610> before<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.090> goes

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
have to do it again right before it goes

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.690 
have to do it again right before it goes
into<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.660> final<00:02:23.020> spin<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.489> to

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
into the final spin just to get it to

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.290 
into the final spin just to get it to
turn<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.360> mean<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.709> runs<00:02:27.040> smooth<00:02:27.459> after<00:02:27.910> you've

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
turn I mean it runs smooth after you've

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.500 
turn I mean it runs smooth after you've
got<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.750> up<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.140> lid<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:29.500> shut<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:30.510> any
