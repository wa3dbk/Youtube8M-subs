aperture priority mode in gear here I'm

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.260 
aperture priority mode in gear here I'm
gonna<00:00:40.320> take<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.530> few<00:00:40.770> frames<00:00:41.100> check<00:00:42.059> my

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
gonna take a few frames check my

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.680 
gonna take a few frames check my
exposures<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.649> actually<00:00:44.420> I've<00:00:45.420> made<00:00:45.660> a

pretty decent image here as I said

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.670 
pretty decent image here as I said
earlier<00:00:48.450> we're<00:00:48.600> trying<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:48.809> make<00:00:48.960> as<00:00:49.110> many

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
earlier we're trying to make as many

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.170 
earlier we're trying to make as many
different<00:00:49.890> images<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.460> possible<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.149> just

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
different images as possible we just

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.260 
different images as possible we just
shot<00:00:51.510> Ashley<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.559> sort<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.000> somewhat<00:00:54.000> static

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
shot Ashley just sort of somewhat static

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.709 
shot Ashley just sort of somewhat static
on<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.500> little<00:00:55.739> path<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.219> another<00:00:57.059> way<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
on this little path here another way to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
on this little path here another way to
get<00:00:57.870> another<00:00:58.530> type<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.010> image<00:00:59.250> let's<00:00:59.460> just

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
get another type of image let's just

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
get another type of image let's just
have<00:00:59.820> your<00:01:00.000> couple<00:01:00.300> or<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.690> bride<00:01:00.989> herself

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
just walk towards the camera I don't

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.539 
just walk towards the camera I don't
need<00:01:03.960> her<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.320> camera<00:01:04.830> where<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> don't<00:01:05.309> need

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
need her to be camera where I don't need

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.429 
need her to be camera where I don't need
her<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> look<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.299> camera<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.290> need

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
her to look at the camera I just need

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
her to look at the camera I just need
her<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.590> move<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.369> we<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.700> movement

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
her to move so we get a little movement

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750 
her to move so we get a little movement
we<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> these<00:01:10.439> lines<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> again

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
we get this these lines going and again

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
we get this these lines going and again
this<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.270> addition<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.260> static<00:01:13.650> image

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this is in addition to the static image

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
this is in addition to the static image
that<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.460> made<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:15.390> those<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.659> you<00:01:15.750> that

that we just made for those of you that
might<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.229> thinking<00:01:16.409> well<00:01:16.770> where's<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
might be thinking well where's the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.789 
might be thinking well where's the
reflector<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.840> forth<00:01:19.140> right<00:01:19.619> now

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
reflector so on and so forth right now

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
reflector so on and so forth right now
the<00:01:19.860> lights<00:01:20.189> pretty<00:01:20.700> flat<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.600> yeah<00:01:21.810> see

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
the lights pretty flat out here yeah see

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.469 
the lights pretty flat out here yeah see
now<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.409> Sun<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.070> came<00:01:23.189> out<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.090> right<00:01:24.299> now

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
now that Sun just came out but right now

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.240 
now that Sun just came out but right now
it's<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:26.009> use<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it's in and out I don't really use a

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's in and out I don't really use a
reflector<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.210> really<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.659> me<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
reflector it's not really for me I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.830 
reflector it's not really for me I
exposed<00:01:28.920> properly<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.490> my<00:01:29.579> camera<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.180> exposed

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
exposed properly in my camera I exposed

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.069 
exposed properly in my camera I exposed
for<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.680> face<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.189> I'm<00:01:32.820> not<00:01:33.180> too<00:01:33.390> worried<00:01:33.750> nor

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
for the face and I'm not too worried nor

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.780 
for the face and I'm not too worried nor
do<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> time<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:35.369> worry<00:01:35.549> about<00:01:35.759> a

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
do I have the time to worry about a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.640 
do I have the time to worry about a
reflector<00:01:36.240> all<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> time<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.930> you'll<00:01:37.409> never

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
reflector all the time so you'll never

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
reflector all the time so you'll never
see<00:01:37.890> me<00:01:38.040> using<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.430> reflector<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.600> right<00:01:39.900> now

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
see me using a reflector so right now

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.050 
see me using a reflector so right now
