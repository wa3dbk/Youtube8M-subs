I thought to myself when I was in
college<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.359> I'd<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.500> garage<00:00:22.769> yeah<00:00:23.580> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
college that I'd be in a garage yeah a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.790 
college that I'd be in a garage yeah a
couple<00:00:24.630> miles<00:00:24.930> away<00:00:25.109> from<00:00:25.289> where<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.650> was

the<00:01:56.520> families<00:01:57.000> all<00:01:57.780> that's<00:01:58.020> important<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
the families all that's important but I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.679 
the families all that's important but I
think<00:01:59.130> part<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.640> point<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.390> wanted<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
think part of the point that I wanted to

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899 
think part of the point that I wanted to
make<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.979> not<00:02:02.219> enough<00:02:02.549> just<00:02:02.579> to

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
make was that it's not enough just to

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
make was that it's not enough just to
feel<00:02:03.240> bad<00:02:03.450> there<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:03.960> actions<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.680> could<00:02:04.860> be

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
feel bad there are actions that could be

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.730 
feel bad there are actions that could be
taken<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.579> make<00:02:06.210> events<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:07.229> less

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
taken to make events like this less

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.270 
taken to make events like this less
likely<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.599> those<00:02:09.899> actions<00:02:10.739> we<00:02:10.950> could

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
likely and one of those actions we could

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.490 
likely and one of those actions we could
take<00:02:11.550> would<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.690> enhance

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
take would be to enhance

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.330 
take would be to enhance
some<00:02:14.010> basic<00:02:14.820> common-sense<00:02:15.390> gun-safety<00:02:15.930> laws
