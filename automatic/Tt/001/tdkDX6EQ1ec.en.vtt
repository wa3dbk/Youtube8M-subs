different doctor now different insurance

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.010

and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.369> guys<00:01:26.520> know<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.390> took<00:01:27.720> us<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.990> couple

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and you guys know it took us a couple

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.890 
and you guys know it took us a couple
months<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.970> biopsy<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.600> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
months to get the biopsy because of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300 
months to get the biopsy because of
insurance<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.470> everything's<00:01:31.829> different<00:01:32.070> now

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
insurance so everything's different now

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.490 
insurance so everything's different now
uh<00:01:33.829> so<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.490> doctor<00:01:36.060> does<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.200> doing

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
uh so this doctor does not like doing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.190 
uh so this doctor does not like doing
that<00:01:37.829> procedure<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.759> he<00:01:39.000> says<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.750> can

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
that procedure because he says it can

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.490 
that procedure because he says it can
move<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:41.189> mass<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:42.020> stuff<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
move the mass and stuff like that and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.859 
move the mass and stuff like that and
when<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.950> go<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> biopsy<00:01:44.970> stuff

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
when they go in and do the biopsy stuff

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.990 
when they go in and do the biopsy stuff
can<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.110> left<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.399> he<00:01:47.579> doesn't<00:01:47.610> like

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
can be left in there so he doesn't like

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.359 
can be left in there so he doesn't like
to<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.450> he<00:01:48.750> does<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.320> biopsy<00:01:49.770> removes<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
to do it he does the biopsy removes it

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
to do it he does the biopsy removes it
and<00:01:50.549> sends<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.090> lab<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:52.020> basically<00:01:52.740> you

style so that's what I've been doing and
