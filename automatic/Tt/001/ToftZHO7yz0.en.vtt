okay<00:00:00.120> so<00:00:00.179> a<00:00:00.719> bug<00:00:01.079> like<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.410> on<00:00:01.560> tool<00:00:02.220> is<00:00:02.370> in

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
okay so a bug like this on tool is in

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay so a bug like this on tool is in
hand<00:00:02.760> let's<00:00:03.659> go<00:00:03.899> through<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.230> notions<00:00:04.620> as<00:00:04.799> if

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
hand let's go through the notions as if

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.940 
hand let's go through the notions as if
we're<00:00:05.160> gonna<00:00:05.279> try<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.730> read<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.060> codes<00:00:06.950> so

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
we're gonna try and read the codes so

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:17.810 
we're gonna try and read the codes so
diagnose<00:00:08.929> three<00:00:09.929> series<00:00:10.469> oh<00:00:16.699> sorry<00:00:17.699> I'm

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
diagnose three series oh sorry I'm

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.710 
diagnose three series oh sorry I'm
pressing<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.180> wrong<00:00:18.300> button<00:00:18.359> here<00:00:18.859> diagnose

pressing the wrong button here diagnose

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.200 
pressing the wrong button here diagnose
three<00:00:21.720> series<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.640> an<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.910> ninety<00:00:26.210> so

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
three series and it's an a ninety so

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
three series and it's an a ninety so
we're<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> body<00:00:28.849> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.300> ACS

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
we're going to the body going to the ACS

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.470 
we're going to the body going to the ACS
M<00:00:32.059> crash<00:00:33.059> safety<00:00:33.300> module<00:00:34.219> okay<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.480> it's

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
M crash safety module okay that it's

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.990 
M crash safety module okay that it's
communicating<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> system<00:00:38.000> okay

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
communicating with the system okay

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.650 
communicating with the system okay
that's<00:00:39.030> how<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.270> read<00:00:39.570> trouble<00:00:39.960> codes<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:41.660> all

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
that's how I read trouble codes and all

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.160 
that's how I read trouble codes and all
right<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.260> success<00:00:44.629> it<00:00:45.629> tells<00:00:45.930> us

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
right so that's a success it tells us

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.279 
right so that's a success it tells us
that<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.399> fault<00:00:47.640> codes<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> that's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that for the the fault codes so that's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.639 
that for the the fault codes so that's
the<00:00:52.410> start<00:00:52.710> now<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.160> will<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.610> now<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.649> in

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the start now what will you do now is in

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
the start now what will you do now is in
normal<00:00:55.980> circumstances<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.820> would<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.180> hook

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
normal circumstances you would just hook

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.959 
normal circumstances you would just hook
up<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:58.079> find<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> fault<00:00:58.710> fix<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> fault<00:00:59.550> but

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
up or find the fault fix the fault but

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.099 
up or find the fault fix the fault but
we<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.180> where<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.390> fault<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.840> we'll<00:01:00.989> just

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
we know where the fault is so we'll just

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 
we know where the fault is so we'll just
put<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> connector<00:01:02.190> back<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.120> see

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
put the connector back in and then see

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
put the connector back in and then see
if<00:01:03.420> we<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.660> clear<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> codes<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.650> see<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
if we can clear the codes and see if it

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.149 
if we can clear the codes and see if it
was<00:01:05.280> clear<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.960> bad<00:01:06.960> light<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.350> well<00:01:08.810> okay<00:01:09.810> now

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
was clear the bad light as well okay now

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
was clear the bad light as well okay now
we've<00:01:11.159> just<00:01:11.369> connected<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.790> connector<00:01:12.510> back

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
we've just connected the connector back

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
we've just connected the connector back
up<00:01:12.840> under<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> passenger<00:01:13.470> seat<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> we're

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
up under the passenger seat so we're

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420 
up under the passenger seat so we're
gonna<00:01:15.330> go<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.020> erase<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.100> trouble

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
gonna go in now and erase the trouble

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.760 
gonna go in now and erase the trouble
codes<00:01:17.869> what<00:01:18.869> I'm<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.259> actually<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
codes what I'm going to do actually is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.350 
codes what I'm going to do actually is
I'm<00:01:19.920> gonna<00:01:20.330> do<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.900> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
I'm gonna do this so you can see the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.679 
I'm gonna do this so you can see the
dashboard<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.479> well<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> same<00:01:25.439> time<00:01:26.689> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
dashboard as well at the same time and

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.609 
dashboard as well at the same time and
hopefully<00:01:27.930> I'll<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.200> able<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> see

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
hopefully I'll be able to see

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.340 
hopefully I'll be able to see
simultaneous<00:01:29.430> actions<00:01:30.090> going<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.540> here

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
simultaneous actions going on here

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.030 
simultaneous actions going on here
right<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.130> okay<00:01:33.049> every<00:01:34.049> trouble<00:01:34.470> codes<00:01:37.040> fault

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
right so okay every trouble codes fault

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.069 
right so okay every trouble codes fault
code<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.460> erased<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.060> as<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> seen<00:01:39.900> they're

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
code is erased and as you seen they're

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.280 
code is erased and as you seen they're
pretty<00:01:40.320> quickly<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:41.700> airbag<00:01:42.060> light<00:01:42.390> did

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
pretty quickly the airbag light did

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.760 
pretty quickly the airbag light did
actually<00:01:43.680> turn<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:45.229> fault<00:01:46.229> colors<00:01:46.649> are

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
actually turn off fault colors are

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.289 
actually turn off fault colors are
raised<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.310> we'll<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.579> back<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.060> read

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
raised so we'll go back in and read

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.889 
raised so we'll go back in and read
trouble<00:01:48.659> codes<00:01:49.490> no<00:01:50.490> trouble<00:01:50.880> codes<00:01:51.149> excellent

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.420 

so<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.229> come<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.680> put<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.189> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
so we can come on I put that down for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.700 
so we can come on I put that down for
now<00:01:56.579> what<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.570> do<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.560> turn

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
now what I do want to do is just turn

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.660 
now what I do want to do is just turn
the<00:01:58.890> ignition<00:01:58.979> off<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.780> put<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.079> back<00:02:01.110> on

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the ignition off and then put it back on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.800 
the ignition off and then put it back on
just<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.820> make<00:02:02.969> sure<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.270> has<00:02:03.570> definitely

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
just to make sure that has definitely

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.880 
just to make sure that has definitely
cleared<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.439> airbag<00:02:04.979> fault

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.680 

we'll<00:02:09.460> start<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.790> engine<00:02:10.030> as<00:02:10.150> well<00:02:10.300> actually

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
we'll start the engine as well actually

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.440 
we'll start the engine as well actually
just<00:02:11.410> come<00:02:11.530> on<00:02:11.620> check

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.030 

looks<00:02:17.990> good<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.880> analysis<00:02:19.880> is<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.570> the<00:02:21.130> c-110

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
looks good so analysis is that the c-110

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
looks good so analysis is that the c-110
diagnostic<00:02:25.040> tool<00:02:25.220> will<00:02:26.060> clear<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.900> airbag

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
diagnostic tool will clear the airbag

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.040 
diagnostic tool will clear the airbag
light<00:02:27.770> on<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.070> BMW<00:02:28.700> e90<00:02:29.270> 91<00:02:30.080> 92<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.770> 93
