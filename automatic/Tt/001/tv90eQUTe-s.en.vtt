00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
of thing yep so now we're going to be
preventing<00:01:59.790> color<00:02:00.030> staining<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.659> is

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
preventing color staining and this is

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.139 
preventing color staining and this is
when<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.170> darker<00:02:01.890> color<00:02:02.100> clay<00:02:02.729> you've<00:02:02.969> been

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
when a darker color clay you've been

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.170 
when a darker color clay you've been
using<00:02:03.450> makes<00:02:03.829> color<00:02:04.829> stains<00:02:05.219> on<00:02:05.549> lighter<00:02:05.909> clay

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
using makes color stains on lighter clay

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.240 
using makes color stains on lighter clay
so<00:02:06.719> for<00:02:06.869> example<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.350> using<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.740> wet<00:02:07.979> clay

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so for example I'm using this wet clay

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.339 
so for example I'm using this wet clay
and<00:02:08.429> then<00:02:08.520> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.789> go<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.110> condition<00:02:10.110> white

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
and then if you go and condition white

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.500 
and then if you go and condition white
clay<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.739> leaves<00:02:11.009> stains<00:02:11.940> I'm<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.270> sure<00:02:12.420> if

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
clay it leaves stains I'm not sure if

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.220 
clay it leaves stains I'm not sure if
you<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:12.690> see<00:02:12.930> but

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
you can see but

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.309 
you can see but
I<00:02:13.260> can<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:14.220> notice<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.819> real<00:02:14.970> life<00:02:15.319> so

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
I can really notice it in real life so

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.320 
I can really notice it in real life so
to<00:02:16.379> prevent<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.099> you<00:02:17.280> need<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.549> wipe<00:02:18.120> your

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
to prevent this you need to wipe your

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.089 
to prevent this you need to wipe your
hands<00:02:18.510> with<00:02:18.690> baby<00:02:18.989> wipes<00:02:19.290> fatherly<00:02:19.830> paying

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
hands with baby wipes fatherly paying

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.970 
hands with baby wipes fatherly paying
attention<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.790> your<00:02:20.970> fingertips

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
attention to your fingertips

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.920 
attention to your fingertips
or<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.549> always<00:02:23.819> wash<00:02:24.150> your<00:02:24.390> hands<00:02:24.629> then

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
or you can always wash your hands then

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.949 
or you can always wash your hands then
but<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.680> find<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.129> easy<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.340> use<00:02:26.430> baby<00:02:26.730> wipes<00:02:26.959> so

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
but I find it easy to use baby wipes so

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.210 
but I find it easy to use baby wipes so
now<00:02:28.110> we're<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.530> removing<00:02:28.709> large

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
now we're going to be removing large

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.949 
now we're going to be removing large
pieces<00:02:29.549> of<00:02:29.700> dirt<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.180> dust<00:02:30.330> from<00:02:30.569> your<00:02:30.629> clay

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959

when you do that now we're going to be
sanding<00:02:45.599> our<00:02:45.720> charms<00:02:46.079> after<00:02:46.650> they're<00:02:46.829> baked

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
sanding our charms after they're baked

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.470 
sanding our charms after they're baked
then<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.400> have<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.670> make<00:02:47.819> sure<00:02:47.940> they're<00:02:48.180> being

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480

then you have to make sure they're being
baked<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.440> painted<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.920> face<00:02:50.099> on<00:02:50.310> now<00:02:50.610> and

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
on the charm just really carefully as

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.319 
on the charm just really carefully as
this<00:02:58.079> can<00:02:58.379> scratch<00:02:58.829> your<00:02:59.190> piece<00:02:59.940> if<00:03:00.180> you're

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
this can scratch your piece if you're

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.390 
this can scratch your piece if you're
not<00:03:00.510> careful<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.109> you<00:03:01.200> must<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.530> really

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
not careful so you must be really

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.599 
not careful so you must be really
careful<00:03:02.790> not<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.150> scratch<00:03:03.450> them<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.459> also

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
careful not to scratch them you can also

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.470 
careful not to scratch them you can also
use<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.910> nail<00:03:06.209> file<00:03:06.569> but<00:03:06.959> um<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:08.030> find<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.180> easier

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
use a nail file but um I find it easier

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.210 
use a nail file but um I find it easier
to<00:03:09.599> use<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.750> blade<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.769> have<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:10.950> bit<00:03:11.190> more

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
to use a blade you have a bit more

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.000 
to use a blade you have a bit more
control<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.329> really<00:03:12.540> depends<00:03:12.870> on<00:03:13.019> what

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
control but it really depends on what

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.400 
control but it really depends on what
you<00:03:14.129> prefer<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.790> can<00:03:15.060> decide<00:03:15.420> which<00:03:16.170> one

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
you prefer so you can decide which one

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.020 
you prefer so you can decide which one
you<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.709> which<00:03:17.190> one<00:03:17.430> you<00:03:17.579> like<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.760> it's

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
you like which one you like and it's

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.629 
you like which one you like and it's
best<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.269> test<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.690> out<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.139> spec<00:03:19.530> piece<00:03:19.799> to

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
best to test this out on a spec piece to

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.159 
best to test this out on a spec piece to
make<00:03:20.760> sure<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.120> don't<00:03:21.540> scratch<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.840> first<00:03:24.169> so

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
make sure you don't scratch it first so

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.530 
make sure you don't scratch it first so
and<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.889> can<00:03:26.010> also<00:03:26.160> remove<00:03:26.459> paint<00:03:26.970> using<00:03:27.419> this
