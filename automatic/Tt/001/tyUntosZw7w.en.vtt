to<00:00:51.750> lose<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.199> thought<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.559> achievement<00:00:53.070> was

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

glitched<00:00:53.489> okay<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.840> you'll<00:00:55.020> see<00:00:55.289> that's

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
glitched okay so here you'll see that's

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
glitched okay so here you'll see that's
where<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:55.890> wanted<00:00:56.190> we're<00:00:56.550> wanting<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> go

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the entire game so you just hop onto the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.950 
the entire game so you just hop onto the
zipline<00:01:04.220> zip<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.400> up<00:01:05.610> you'll<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> guys<00:01:06.780> on

back<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> campfire<00:02:10.160> thinking<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.670> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
back to the campfire thinking that I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.430 
back to the campfire thinking that I
needed<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.840> respawn<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.290> guys

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
don't you just need to zip across that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.230 
don't you just need to zip across that
zip<00:02:15.780> line<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.319> that's<00:02:17.130> all<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.580> have<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.910> do<00:02:18.030> I
