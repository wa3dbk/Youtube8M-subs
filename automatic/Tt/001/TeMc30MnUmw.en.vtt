the play decision-making speed of

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.620 
the play decision-making speed of
thought

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
thought

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.870 
thought
obviously<00:01:41.380> we'll<00:01:41.530> both<00:01:41.860> physical<00:01:42.640> things

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
obviously we'll both physical things

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.200 
obviously we'll both physical things
like<00:01:43.119> peace<00:01:43.780> air<00:01:44.530> reaction<00:01:45.189> times<00:01:45.460> and<00:01:45.939> how

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
like peace air reaction times and how

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.080 
like peace air reaction times and how
agile<00:01:46.600> are<00:01:46.780> they<00:01:46.899> so<00:01:47.049> we're<00:01:47.200> looking<00:01:47.470> for<00:01:47.710> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
agile are they so we're looking for a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.429 
agile are they so we're looking for a
basic<00:01:49.090> skill<00:01:49.360> set<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:49.659> we<00:01:49.899> can<00:01:50.110> try<00:01:50.409> and

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
basic skill set that we can try and

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.350 
basic skill set that we can try and
develop<00:01:50.890> over<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.310> short<00:01:51.789> Kitty<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.179> same
