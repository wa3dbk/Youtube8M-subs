they're<00:00:52.020> gonna<00:00:52.140> sit<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.770> between<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.340> zones

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
they're gonna sit in between the zones

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.270 
they're gonna sit in between the zones
now<00:00:53.940> they<00:00:54.539> picked<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.920> about

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
now they picked and now they think about

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.170 
now they picked and now they think about
that<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:57.120> against<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.920> type<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.670> curl<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
that now against this type of curl you

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.209 
that now against this type of curl you
could<00:01:00.390> always<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> cornerback<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.770> put

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
could always take a cornerback and put

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.359 
could always take a cornerback and put
them<00:01:02.340> in<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> flat<00:01:02.910> zone<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.769> kind<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
them in a flat zone and it will kind of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.030 
them in a flat zone and it will kind of
stop<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.150> long<00:01:06.750> as<00:01:06.930> there's<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> flat

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
stop it as long as there's not a flat

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.090 
stop it as long as there's not a flat
flat<00:01:08.729> route<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.240> anybody<00:01:09.780> going<00:01:10.049> wide<00:01:10.409> they

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
flat route or anybody going wide they

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.700 
flat route or anybody going wide they
will<00:01:11.340> stop<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.909> as<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
will stop in as you can see here the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.649 
will stop in as you can see here the
guy's<00:01:13.920> going<00:01:14.189> straight<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.760> there's<00:01:15.150> no<00:01:15.299> flat

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
guy's going straight up there's no flat

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.870 
guy's going straight up there's no flat

way to stop that throw the flat zone is

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.480 
way to stop that throw the flat zone is
good<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.570> long<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.960> there's<00:01:52.229> no<00:01:52.619> flats<00:01:53.100> going
