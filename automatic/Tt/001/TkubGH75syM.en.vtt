00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello my name is Victoria and in this 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.930
 video I want to offer you my recipe 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.400
 pickled cabbage 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.889
 what I want to say cabbage is obtained 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.690
 know so tender but at the same time 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.650
 crispy it with such flavor and taste 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.680
 what is important it is juicy which is not 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.010
 for example, from the cabbage let 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.840
 let's start what we need for 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.630
 sauerkraut sure whether she sprouts 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.399
 big cool elastic head slightly 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.270
 flattened on top because round 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.989
 less fit 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:41.340
 further tasty juicy carrot of course 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.399
 salt as a preservative adore just adore 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 dill kernels they give exactly that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.800
 the very taste that 's how in childhood 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.510
 straight grandma and something sour 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.370
 onion type 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 or lingonberry well, and then it all 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.090
 prepare means cabbage that we 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.949
 do subtly shred if you 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.909
 holder of a special shredder for 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.960
 sauerkraut 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.880
 raise time touareg i'm not yet 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.540
 the owner of this miracle priborchika 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.610
 so just an ordinary knife 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.689
 I turn it like that into thin ones 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.280
 things a certain machine 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.979
 quantity but more often i am exactly 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.509
 measure such a bowl that we need 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 we need to do it a little bit 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.970
 here but this process and some 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.820
 exclude who will be more such 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.600
 on these crispy more fresh more than that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.840
 salad option but you need to insist and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.649
 such sauerkraut I'm a little bit 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.659
 to clear up 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.659
 so she you 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:05.520
 cabbage we hired now we have it lightly 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:12.200
 we put it down and set it aside 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.200
 about twenty minutes so that she fell a 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.620
 in the meantime, let's take a carrot to me 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.740
 like that cabbage has such a long 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.800
 structure your form so i'm not lazy 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.810
 and make grated carrots for Korean 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:36.810
 carrot what did you get the plotter 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:41.010
 moulting a bit of similar carrot 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.600
 stripes well now carrots are our business 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.830
 cabbage infused from carrots we 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.830
 prepared so we introduce our flour 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:05.760
 shuffle add first yet 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:08.250
 salt how much salt is needed is everyone decides 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.610
 for yourself you once tried you 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.110
 understand what salinity is necessary 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:25.610
 you are just as well fragrant tasty 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:25.610
 shevchik them in this case our cowberry 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.730
 the whole thing is now gently mix 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.099
 the last stage can be said 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.290
 laying in our container in this case 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.999
 This is a three-liter can using such 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.370
 cool thing you bought for 

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:47.900
 canning features jam 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.049
 different notes and start filling out our 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.790
 a jar like i do i enter 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.489
 a certain portion per eye after which 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.449
 I remove the nozzle and 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:11.530
 hand leveling and pressing I press 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:17.799
 tightly and then repeat this procedure and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:21.530
 so until all the cabbage goes into the jar 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:23.240
 but all my bank is complete you 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.360
 pretend that there are huge plugs 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.620
 cabbage with carrots and honestly say 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.570
 every time i do 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.159
 every time I can not believe that they can 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.710
 shredded cabbage 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.470
 condense in a three-liter jar but how 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.780
 you see there is even a little above 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.720
 what I want to say pretty 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.389
 titanic work know all this so 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.220
 very tight hand inside and besides 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.740
 as if prolazit mainly women's bag 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.070
 thin spouse hand about it not even 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.830
 ask here but due to the fact that very 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.190
 tightly tamped then not needed 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.770
 press 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.659
 for many it's just a stumbling block 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.099
 in order to start making your 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.440
 own sauerkraut 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:06.199
 well and let's take a closer look here 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.259
 It has been seen that here it is the juice he had 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:11.360
 reached the top almost go bubbles 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:14.360
 and that we can only do now 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.270
 you leave regularly at room 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.310
 our cabbage temperature for 3 days 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.800
 this temperature is different for everyone from 20 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.300
 up to 25 I have on the glass in order 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.419
 to make our whole place happen 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.219
 fermentation fermentation can raise juice 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.320
 generally high through for what about 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.770
 or need to do it regularly do here 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.800
 such a 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.770
 with a sharp object and knives or 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.669
 something other thin but 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.539
 on to go to the bottom and thereby gas 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.120
 will go out 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:47.860
 the juice will go down and everything will go 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.500
 farther on after three days in 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.780
 warm cabbage laid out by 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.069
 containers and clean in a cold place 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.250
 or if someone has the opportunity 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.080
 all charm all taro in general cans 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.840
 just transferred to a cool place but 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.120
 it is convenient to store it in the refrigerator 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.150
 was my cooking option for pickled 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.330
 cabbage on this unwilling part of everything 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.330
 until
