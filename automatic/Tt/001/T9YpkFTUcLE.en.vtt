00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:09.980 
parts of the violin here we have a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.419 
parts of the violin here we have a
violin<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.219> play<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:12.120> lot<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.469> really

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
violin that I play a lot and it's really

violin that I play a lot and it's really
totally<00:00:14.670> together<00:00:15.030> but<00:00:15.960> here<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:17.300> have<00:00:18.300> a

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.029 

violin<00:00:22.980> which<00:00:23.660> comes<00:00:24.660> apart<00:00:26.779> bingo<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.410> I

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
violin which comes apart bingo and I

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.320 
violin which comes apart bingo and I
thought<00:00:29.220> I'd<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.519> give<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> quick<00:00:30.119> overview

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
thought I'd just give a quick overview

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.069 
thought I'd just give a quick overview
of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.019> parts<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.940> my<00:00:33.390> hands<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.899> the

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
of the parts here in my hands as the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.110 
of the parts here in my hands as the
violins<00:00:34.559> top<00:00:35.010> which<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.340> sometimes<00:00:35.880> referred

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
violins top which is sometimes referred

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.190 
violins top which is sometimes referred
to<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.840> soundboard<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.899> piece

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to as the soundboard and this is a piece

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.940 
to as the soundboard and this is a piece
this<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.980> actually<00:00:41.309> two<00:00:41.550> joined<00:00:41.910> pieces<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
this is actually two joined pieces of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.150 
this is actually two joined pieces of
carved<00:00:43.950> spruce<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> inside<00:00:46.440> we<00:00:46.829> can

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
carved spruce and on the inside we can

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
carved spruce and on the inside we can
see<00:00:47.300> now<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.360> can't<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.620> it's

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
see now we can't really see that it's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.939 
see now we can't really see that it's
two<00:00:50.250> pieces<00:00:50.700> but<00:00:51.300> there's<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.600> seam<00:00:52.199> right<00:00:52.590> down

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
two pieces but there's a seam right down

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
two pieces but there's a seam right down
the<00:00:53.160> center<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.520> where<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.570> two<00:00:54.780> pieces<00:00:54.989> are

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the center here where the two pieces are

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.220 
the center here where the two pieces are
joined<00:00:55.410> together<00:00:55.730> on<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> side<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
joined together on this side this is the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.910 
joined together on this side this is the
base<00:00:58.469> bar<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.399> is<00:01:02.000> I'm<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.750> able<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.350> give<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
base bar which is I'm not able to give a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.550 
base bar which is I'm not able to give a
scientific<00:01:05.630> description<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.049> base<00:01:07.200> bars

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
scientific description of the base bars

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.800 
scientific description of the base bars
function<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.640> say<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.210> adds

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
function but I can say that it adds

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.630 
function but I can say that it adds
structural<00:01:10.680> strength<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.430> affects<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
structural strength and affects the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.090 
structural strength and affects the
characteristics<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.150> vibration<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
characteristics of the vibration of the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
characteristics of the vibration of the
top<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.180> base<00:01:21.180> bar<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.689> made<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
top and this the base bar is made of

top and this the base bar is made of
spruce<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.140> see<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:26.030> penciled<00:01:27.030> name<00:01:27.630> here

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
spruce you can see a penciled name here

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.350 
spruce you can see a penciled name here
which<00:01:28.320> may<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.549> name<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> either<00:01:30.090> the

this violin has had a hard life has had
many<00:01:37.799> repairs<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.270> patches<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:40.200> spruce

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
many repairs we have patches of spruce

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.130 
many repairs we have patches of spruce
and<00:01:40.950> other<00:01:41.100> wood<00:01:41.369> which<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.960> attempts<00:01:42.960> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and other wood which are attempts to

and other wood which are attempts to
stabilize<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:44.369> cracks<00:01:44.939> which<00:01:45.390> developed

and we have copious quantities of glue
which<00:01:51.210> are<00:01:51.450> probably<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.710> result<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:54.020> several

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
which are probably the result of several

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.980 
which are probably the result of several
different<00:01:55.530> attempts<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> repair<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.990> that's
