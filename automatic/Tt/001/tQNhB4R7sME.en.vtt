to the neck at this point instead of

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.070 
to the neck at this point instead of
down<00:02:31.870> below<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.920> allows<00:02:33.220> you<00:02:33.550> movement<00:02:34.510> in

turned out better than the last one
there<00:02:43.990> there<00:02:44.349> they<00:02:44.530> are<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:45.209> finished<00:02:46.209> heads

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:46.960
