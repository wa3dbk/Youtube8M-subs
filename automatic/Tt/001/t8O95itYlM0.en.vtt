00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.680

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.580
 international is reached to see step of the 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.810
 North east side you see it there goes 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.860
 Then Ivan Juarez here turned him over and 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:23.060
 it is said that the trip is 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.230
 stosur is through this corridor people 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:30.320
 that happen even if they come from the USA come in 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.290
 around here and on the other side do you have 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.860
 to pay three pesos of misery fee 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.170
 here I'll show it to you there 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.790
 see the bottom one pay three pesos and pass 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.470
 on the other side mean I want to move to 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.540
 another side does not mean that they leave it 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.309
 to pass is what one pays to cross 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.809
 until the other side east towards the USA 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.760
 we've been here in juarez is what 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.370
 long of this day and let me tell you that 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.739
 It has been a very interesting experience 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:01.070
 what I want to show you now that I 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.020
 I understand that there are many this let's say 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.979
 everything you come to what side then 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:09.890
 now yes that's the usa is the river and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.110
 this is the last step where people 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.210
 you want to be in a car here they pass 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.860
 like this car that comes to me 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.320
 we know if it's going to happen to the other side 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.869
 if it's going to happen I wanted to show you that 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.390
 I'm going to move here for you to see 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.659
 fully the matter this is 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.340
 watching there with you 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.460
 in installments that's where the people go 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.590
 walking in this last point towards the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.100
 United States and what I was seeing 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.069
 towards this border area in 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.799
 Where do you find these roads? 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.600
 very typical vericuetos of the border of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.880
 the american border and this is what 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 I teach to give them away I can 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.500
 because it's a gift that we all 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.500
 we deserve 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.090
 for you 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.520
 this is the moon that today welcomes the side 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.069
 towards Paris and that side and up to you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.009
 in the good step let me tell you that 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.590
 We have been here these days trying to 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.200
 find see some of the instances 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.000
 today most important of the border between 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.269
 mexico and usa consultants what happens 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.370
 towards Juarez I show you this because 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.790
 I have an investment without having you 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.340
 too much 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.640
 without being very warned in the subject that something 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.900
 you should consider is that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.090
 much of what happens in if appear in 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.069
 this border is this border because 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.590
 people do not pass and then they stay 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.989
 here and here it returns and between them so 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.060
 it's how it works here stays one 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.439
 stopped our children who do not pass has been 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.629
 made you think about what makes 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.730
 many of those who stay here 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.650
 arrested and do not pass then they are left 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.599
 here and make this city is a 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.670
 city ​​in some unpleasant sense to 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.859
 times but today we have been here there 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.480
 something in this story that we see in this 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.340
 bridge that we see there is something I want to be 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.989
 insistent city ​​Juarez begins to 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.730
 be different by a fundamental action 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.079
 what is citizen action and 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.909
 good resistance 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.139
 here we are talking with this border 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.790
 that if he realizes unlike the 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.470
 border other not what it is I think it is 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.209
 have in front of texas or a city 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.669
 like this have mexicalli in front 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.919
 known as calexico have in front of 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:10.819
 Tijuana a city like San Isidro San 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.370
 diego but that you do not 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.760
 at this time it's Wednesday are the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.599

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.950
