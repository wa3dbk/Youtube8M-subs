00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.540
 good your come to a new video 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.400
 news the truth quite pretty bad 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.740
 if the other day we have a news like 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.820
 that already has the game closed because this one 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.769
 it's also pretty awful 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.020
 it seems that sony santa monica has 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.810
 decided to dismiss neither more nor less than 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.990
 to 50 workers this leaves the number of 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.480
 the developer pretty fucked up and is 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.640
 quite bad enough for the 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.780
 industry and they are santa monica so that you 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.520
 site did a little bit because it's the 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.739
 developer of the joy quart and ha 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.929
 also collaborated in many games 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.660
 Apart from software and services has 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.190
 collaborated with in many others is one of 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.980
 the fundamental pillars we could 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.620
 say of the exclusive Tosoni games and 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.269
 it really is a pretty enough pain 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.379
 what he neglects in the 50's 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.600
 people not only because these people 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.210
 they lose their jobs but also because 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.550
 Cancer seems to be a new 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.350
 project they had in their hands had 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.839
 a new ip that had nothing to do 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.639
 with software or anything like that 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.420
 that we are going to stay seems to be without 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:06.100
 see the next title is a true 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.990
 putada surely these people find 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.450
 quickly he is even rumored of 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.330
 that could end up in the microsoft I 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.370
 Really 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.430
 and had some power in microsoft or 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.310
 something like that would not be so foolish 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.870
 let them go for real or I would say 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.450
 how much are you charging this, then take the 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.460
 double twins and now for my offices 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.040
 but directly we go without thinking a 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.170
 only micro second never better said 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.660
 microsoft microsoft so good 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 long that microsoft consists of a lot 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.120
 money 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.460
 and I really think they can afford 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.710
 pass them twice and have people there 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.040
 working good and of a lot of quality 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.620
 that could really get them out of 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.510
 more of a rush I do not know what will happen to the 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.610
 saga for war I do not know if this will affect you 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.350
 in some sense really in the sense 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.320
 that it will take longer to leave is likely 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.030
 so we'll see to see in this 3 and some 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.790
 surprise there is still no surprise because 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.100
 this is starting to fly a little 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.930
 type of developer dismissals that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 close and such the truth that is a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.580
 pretty big bitch that I do not understand 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.410
 Why do I know why it's done and nothing 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.790
 it really is a sector for you 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.290
 you understand the video game that is 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.840
 growing is booming sells more than the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.120
 music the cinema and it really is a bit 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.799
 I miss this kind of thing 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.269
 this is attributed a little to the 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.840
 redistribution of resources and such 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.849
 but hey it 's a bit strange that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.790
 dispense with veteran people also of 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.010
 the developer and the truth is that it is 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.620
 bad news is bad news if 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.799
 really the next one is naughty dog 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.909
 really is going to start crying because 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.590
 it would be a pretty big pain not 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.890
 nautical for me is the developer 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.209
 favorite and would be a pretty accused 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.190
 big let's hope you do not have to give 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.609
 a similar news the truth because 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.500
 we would be disgust disgust so 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.849
 good nothing more kids are in the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.849
 next video tonight we played
