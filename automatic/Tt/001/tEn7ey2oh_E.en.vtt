00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 PVV recommends that if in a neighborhood 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.379
 in the Netherlands street violence of prominent 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.120
 Moroccans are raising the army 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.300
 must be deployed it went 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.130
 firmly in the second room yesterday 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.929
 cause are the event in gouda 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.060
 where bus drivers are no longer through one 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.210
 want to drive in a neighborhood because of bullying 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.220
 we are for an aso order and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.670
 tighten sheet with a ban on it 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.160
 anti-social behavior puts them in boarding schools 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.219
 gives them a resocialization and thereby 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.710
 Of course the parents remember but 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.450
 the soup is not eaten so hot here 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.250
 well guess they don't say about tilburg 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.719
 a very long tradition that we are very there 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
 are doing well 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.500
 I am very tough process but we 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.960
 have passed inside security house 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 very targeted approach among Antilleans 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.590
 have the ability to have their white like that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 resocialize 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.800
 so we do a lot of things that are stuck 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.449
 going in the right direction 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.949
 families where spoken to politics 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.809
 There is a recipe for dealing with 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.910
 Moroccan problem youth 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.699
 Mayor of Halderberge says of 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.920
 however he left the sports and youth 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.400
 made contact with the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.369
 parents 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.280
 I always walk with phone numbers from 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.930
 the Moroccan youth fathers in my 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.170
 pocket and if there is a problem 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.200
 that also has district police officer then am 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.420
 I go to one or more fathers and that 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.700
 then unload the case 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.659
 silent on and long-term attention 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.549
 for problem 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.040
 works silently say ohh take it already 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.860
 for instance 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.750
 of course from French Bauer at the end 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.480
 the boys came some 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.440
 Moroccan boys in front of the camera 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.560
 with the reef flag bit 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.120
 to make the police who acted 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.980
 that he threatened to escalate 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.140
 I saw that as a mayor knew me 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.300
 those young people so I have them with me 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.350
 yes so he distorted the police that is 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.300
 still an interesting one 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.040
 the escalating effect minister in horst 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.050
 of Interior wanted 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.160
 mayors give more powers to 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.160
 to tackle problem youngsters
