just<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> simplest<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.240> fundamentals<00:01:12.830> you

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
just on the simplest of fundamentals you

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
just on the simplest of fundamentals you
know<00:01:13.950> pivoting<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.490> starting<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.210> often

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
know pivoting and starting it's often

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.140 
know pivoting and starting it's often
you<00:01:16.080> know<00:01:16.170> under<00:01:16.560> top<00:01:16.799> because<00:01:17.759> once<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.030> get

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you know under top because once you get

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.490 
you know under top because once you get
past<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.450> certain<00:01:18.600> age<00:01:18.750> w<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.350> never

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
past a certain age w think you never

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.340 
past a certain age w think you never
have<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.740> have<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> do<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.520> again<00:01:21.350> it's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
have to have to do that again it's

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.289 
have to have to do that again it's
evident<00:01:22.890> there<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:23.430> people<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.759> travel<00:01:23.939> all

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
evident there are people that travel all

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
evident there are people that travel all
the<00:01:24.540> time<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.990> basketball<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:26.070> x<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.580> want<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the time in basketball with x we want to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.670 
the time in basketball with x we want to
make<00:01:26.880> sure<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.030> he<00:01:27.210> eliminates<00:01:27.630> mistakes<00:01:28.020> so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
make sure that he eliminates mistakes so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.319 
make sure that he eliminates mistakes so
we<00:01:28.890> started<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.369> from<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> basics<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.090> about

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
we started back from the basics we about

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.700 
we started back from the basics we about
an<00:01:30.450> eight-week<00:01:30.780> camp<00:01:31.049> here<00:01:31.229> until<00:01:31.439> he<00:01:31.560> goes

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
an eight-week camp here until he goes

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.010 
an eight-week camp here until he goes
into<00:01:32.159> training<00:01:33.030> camp<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> seventy<00:01:33.689> sixers

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
into training camp with a seventy sixers

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.179 
into training camp with a seventy sixers
and<00:01:34.439> we're<00:01:34.560> going<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> start<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.040> an

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and we're going to start it like an
