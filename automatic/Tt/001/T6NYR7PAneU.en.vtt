00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.580
 the environment of the technical school 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.099
 superior of agronomists of the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.480
 Polytechnic University of Madrid 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.699
 enjoy a lot of trees 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.349
 and shrubs that decorate the gardens and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.810
 green spaces of the facilities 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.390
 besides the tree plantations 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 fruit trees and vineyards as an object of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.940
 training of students in the fields of 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.940
 practices 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 Most trees and shrubs 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.489
 require pruning for susana 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.110
 conservation and optimal production labor 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.150
 which is carried out by the staff 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.430
 school technician 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.050
 in the plants of small branches a 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.390
 much of the pruning can be carried 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.370
 out with one or two handed scissors 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.130
 without further need of the help of a 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.080
 right stair let's see a case 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.850
 pruning special as is the pruning 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.580
 of fruit trees in a plantation 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.650
 intensive this we have here is a 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.400
 pear plantation an intensity 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.650
 the distance between 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.080
 between plants you can see that it is very 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.110
 small one meter as they little cut 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.750
 little height very close together we have a 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.480
 structure of an axis 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.700
 we want branching to be the most 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.520
 short possible and that is the heaviest 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.880
 to the tree to have a lot of fruit in very 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.790
 little space 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.820
 what they do is simply 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.930
 as they are pear trees that their natural bearing is 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.490
 a pyramid what we do is 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.409
 we do a recoil pruning 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.840
 what I just did is download a 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.170
 height 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.539
 We tell you about a bud in the burning 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.680
 of wood that what you are trying is 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.480
 keep forming the axis 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.880
 and then the only thing that is done is 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.010
 restore branches a pruning cleanup and a 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.200
 pruning fructification by cleaning 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.470
 would be for example the lighting of this 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.470
 bouquet 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:07.340
 that goes through the middle of the tree 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.340
 example this too 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.380
 and then simply a logic of 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.340
 cleaning now is already fortification that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.840
 would be in this case by training 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.760
 of the primary branches on are 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.569
 small and everything else what is done 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.080
 is three themes three slogans or in your case 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.120
 in this case we have many formations 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.940
 fruitful what is done is a maximum 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.010
 of two yolks per organ 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.510
 It would be layered 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.340
 this center with hearing this is bald 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.650
 here we say a two three yolks with one 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.980
 for example cleaning because it is dry 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.980
 and we would have executed those on the plate 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.890
 another interesting and essential pruning 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.959
 is the profiling of hedges this operation 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.760
 is carried out mostly with 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.860
 gasoline sector short machine 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.939
 electrical appliances and sometimes with 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.939
 mushroom short scissors 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.280
 However, when the branches are large 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.860
 thickness different types of 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.110
 chainsaw as the types of chainsaws 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.940
 can be reduced basically to two times 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.590
 one side the conventional chain saws 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.810
 that we know that are used to 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.090
 chop the pruning remains and facilitate 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.920
 your transport handling on the other hand 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.350
 There are more use of chainsaws 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.510
 specialized as the desert that is 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.470
 used for pruning of trees of carriage 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.240
 medium large 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.640
 for pruning large trees 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.560
 It is necessary to carry out the works 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.600
 from a crane equipped with a basket 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.760
 where operators equipped with the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.440
 convenient security measures can 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.290
 develop work with relative 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.970
 comfort the extensive experience of 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.950
 staff of the internship camps with 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.870
 this type of machinery makes this 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.820
 height pruning operation run 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.820
 in a correct way and without danger 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.750
 the cuts on very thick branches are 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.120
 treated immediately with pasta 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.740
 healing with this treatment is 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.200
 protects long from possible diseases 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.739
 and the healing of the 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.739
 damaged tissue 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.960
 Chainsaws are also necessary 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.030
 when due to illness and other cause of 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.150
 structural nature it is necessary to withdraw 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.250
 large specimens in full 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.530
 then talk about logging is the case that 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.880
 is presented with some poplars this 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.010
 kind with the years 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.720
 he wants a big size they are sometimes 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.270
 prone to suffer with a position 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.820
 interior that weakens them and makes 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.620
 lose resistance being susceptible 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.990
 of being knocked down by a gust of wind 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.720
 can cause serious damage and 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.000
 even personal in place by the 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.700
 cut tree are sought replace by 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.570
 other species good cuts 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:07.320
 in all pruning operations though 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.440
 we have no words 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.730
 in the case of these if we do not throw it 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.020
 They will drop and fall freely to by 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.020
 security is better 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.500
 crushing the prunings are 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:28.449
 performed in the same place with a 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.090
 crusher hooked on the tractor and 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.340
 driven by the PTO in 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.199
 sometimes you must resort to the 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:39.150
 loss of logs to diameters that 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.340
 the crusher can chop and dismantle 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.930
 with all this crushed plant material 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.000
 that has been used in the plant 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.530
 composting of practice camps or 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.780
 treated in the biomass plant that 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.520
 manages the production department 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.069
 botanical vegetable 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.960
 as we can check weddings in addition 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.669
 of being a necessary operation for the 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.740
 correct development and conservation of 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.199
 the woody plants produces another 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.120
 benefit through its waste that 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.229
 can be used in production 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.229
 of energy sources
