there and screw it back on that's pretty

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.110 
there and screw it back on that's pretty
much<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:11.070> only<00:03:11.220> thing<00:03:11.310> about<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.700> stove

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
much it the only thing about this stove

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.449 
much it the only thing about this stove
that's<00:03:12.510> kind<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.320> a<00:03:13.410> drawback<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.130> you

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
that's kind of a drawback is that you

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.830 
that's kind of a drawback is that you
have<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.610> light<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.090> with<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.239> lighter<00:03:15.299> or<00:03:15.660> match

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
have to light it with a lighter or match

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.009 
have to light it with a lighter or match
I<00:03:16.620> did<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.370> one<00:03:17.489> time<00:03:17.519> with<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> fire<00:03:18.060> steel<00:03:18.390> and

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
I did it one time with a fire steel and

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.590 
I did it one time with a fire steel and
I<00:03:19.230> think<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.530> was<00:03:19.620> by<00:03:19.709> pure<00:03:20.010> luck<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:21.360> other

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
I think that was by pure luck but other

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.530 
I think that was by pure luck but other
than<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> great<00:03:22.650> stove<00:03:23.540> it's

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
than that this is a great stove it's

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.030 
than that this is a great stove it's
basically<00:03:24.930> designed<00:03:25.440> for<00:03:25.709> mountain<00:03:26.010> climbing

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
basically designed for mountain climbing

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.380 
basically designed for mountain climbing
and<00:03:26.519> for<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.000> know<00:03:27.090> extreme<00:03:27.510> conditions<00:03:28.019> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
and for you know extreme conditions the

and for you know extreme conditions the
butane<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.540> propane<00:03:30.600> mixture<00:03:31.350> here<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.820> good

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
butane and propane mixture here is good

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.250 
butane and propane mixture here is good
for<00:03:33.560> minus-7<00:03:34.560> degrees<00:03:34.590> Celsius<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:36.260> for

for minus-7 degrees Celsius and for

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.750 
for minus-7 degrees Celsius and for
wintertime<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:38.370> not<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.670> be<00:03:38.730> that

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
wintertime it's not going to be that
