00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
are not comfortable that's why I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.950 
are not comfortable that's why I
actually<00:01:02.010> took<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.640> mattress<00:01:02.879> off<00:01:03.300> inner<00:01:03.600> off

actually took the mattress off inner off
of<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> bed<00:01:04.530> cuz<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.799> didn't<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.250> need<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
of the bed cuz I didn't really need it I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.090 
of the bed cuz I didn't really need it I
put<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.619> there's<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.860> mattress

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100

more<00:01:12.540> comfortable<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.950> threw

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
more comfortable and then I just threw

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.740

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
wouldn't look as messy so it might not

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.550 
wouldn't look as messy so it might not
be<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.450> best<00:01:18.570> thing<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> look<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.380> it's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
be the best thing to look at but it's

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.010 
be the best thing to look at but it's
still<00:01:19.680> very<00:01:19.920> comfortable<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.780> really

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
still very comfortable and that's really

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.690 
still very comfortable and that's really
what<00:01:22.140> matters

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
what matters

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.520 
what matters
not<00:01:23.700> too<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.939> changed<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.659> back<00:01:24.960> there

so<00:01:59.479> not<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> neatest<00:02:01.159> installation<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
so not the neatest installation in the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
so not the neatest installation in the
world<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:03.000> mean<00:02:03.149> what<00:02:03.420> they<00:02:03.540> didn't<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:03.990> fit

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
world I mean what they didn't really fit

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.620 
world I mean what they didn't really fit
the<00:02:04.380> rod<00:02:04.560> perfectly<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:06.030> it's<00:02:06.299> still<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.570> huge

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the rod perfectly but it's still a huge

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.550 
the rod perfectly but it's still a huge
improvement<00:02:07.409> over<00:02:07.439> what<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> had

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.870 

so<00:02:11.560> I'm<00:02:11.950> more<00:02:12.280> than<00:02:12.430> happy<00:02:12.670> with<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:14.880> ended

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880
