00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
just go ahead and open up awk so again

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.470 
just go ahead and open up awk so again
here<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:11.250> if<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.400> want<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.640> go<00:03:12.060> ahead<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.360> kill
