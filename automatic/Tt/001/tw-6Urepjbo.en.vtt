question<00:01:54.689> was<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.049> only<00:01:55.649> rich<00:01:55.920> people<00:01:55.979> can

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
question was that only rich people can

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
question was that only rich people can
afford<00:01:57.799> multiple<00:01:59.509> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.630> sim<00:02:00.810> cards<00:02:01.079> which

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
afford multiple you know sim cards which

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.929 
afford multiple you know sim cards which
was<00:02:01.469> not<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.920> consumer<00:02:02.280> truth<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> consumer

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
was not the consumer truth the consumer

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.480 
was not the consumer truth the consumer
truth<00:02:03.119> was<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.719> most<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> people<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.680> in

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
truth was and most of the people in in

truth was and most of the people in in
the<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> middle<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.329> lower<00:02:06.810> category

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the in the middle and lower category

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.960 
the in the middle and lower category
they<00:02:07.469> were<00:02:07.530> using<00:02:07.950> multiple<00:02:08.399> sim<00:02:08.550> cards<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
they were using multiple sim cards and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.180 
they were using multiple sim cards and
that's<00:02:09.479> how<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.660> first<00:02:09.929> dual<00:02:10.229> sim<00:02:10.500> phone<00:02:10.530> was

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
that's how the first dual sim phone was

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.830 
that's how the first dual sim phone was
born<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> that's<00:02:12.090> how<00:02:12.180> we<00:02:12.239> realize<00:02:12.569> there's<00:02:12.750> a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
born and that's how we realize there's a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.580 
born and that's how we realize there's a
humongous<00:02:13.379> put

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
humongous put

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.259 
humongous put
angel<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.360> if<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.629> can<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:18.000> know<00:02:18.030> work

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
angel and if we can just you know work

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.449 
angel and if we can just you know work
on<00:02:18.510> solving<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.140> problems<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.680> consumer<00:02:20.310> in

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
on solving the problems of consumer in

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:21.830 
on solving the problems of consumer in
the<00:02:20.580> day-to-day<00:02:20.730> life<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.690> work

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
the day-to-day life it's going to work

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.750 
the day-to-day life it's going to work
and<00:02:22.050> that's<00:02:22.260> how<00:02:22.410> we<00:02:23.099> started<00:02:23.280> incubating

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and that's how we started incubating

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.759 
and that's how we started incubating
