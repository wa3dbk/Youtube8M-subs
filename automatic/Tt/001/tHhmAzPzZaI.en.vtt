was actually longer than this

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.240 
was actually longer than this
it<00:00:28.050> was<00:00:28.260> probably<00:00:29.119> below<00:00:30.119> my<00:00:30.420> foot<00:00:30.810> no<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and then I chopped it off because it was

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.600
