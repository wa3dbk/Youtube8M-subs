00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
teenager gets to realize so I have so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
teenager gets to realize so I have so
much<00:00:31.650> potential<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.270> what<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.660> want

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
much potential and this is what I want

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.260 
much potential and this is what I want
to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.440> purpose<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.890> life<00:00:35.270> the

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
to do this is my purpose in life the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.450 
to do this is my purpose in life the
characters<00:00:36.719> were<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:37.050> an<00:00:37.170> age<00:00:37.440> when<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.399> were

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
characters were at an age when they were

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.020 
characters were at an age when they were
a<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.879> older<00:00:39.540> already<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> bit<00:00:40.710> more<00:00:40.860> mature

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
a bit older already so a bit more mature

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
a bit older already so a bit more mature
so<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.420> guess<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.840> story<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.320> also<00:00:43.649> deeper<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so I guess the story was also deeper the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.950 
so I guess the story was also deeper the
reason<00:00:44.730> why<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> love<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.239> much<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.899> because

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
reason why I love it so much is because

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.459 
reason why I love it so much is because
of<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:47.640> horror<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.510> actually<00:00:49.170> comes<00:00:49.350> with

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
of the horror that actually comes with

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.220
