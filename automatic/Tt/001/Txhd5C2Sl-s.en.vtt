to make a long smooth snake but it needs

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
to make a long smooth snake but it needs
to<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.470> an<00:01:31.590> even<00:01:31.950> thickness<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.610> whole<00:01:32.820> way

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to be an even thickness the whole way

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.510 
to be an even thickness the whole way
along<00:01:33.530> because<00:01:34.530> otherwise<00:01:34.770> your<00:01:35.009> border<00:01:35.340> will

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.790 
along because otherwise your border will
be<00:01:35.550> uneven<00:01:35.850> if<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.929> doesn't<00:01:37.170> work<00:01:37.259> first<00:01:37.530> time

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
be uneven if it doesn't work first time

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.109 
be uneven if it doesn't work first time
just<00:01:38.100> screw<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.429> up<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> roll<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> out<00:01:39.060> again

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
just screw it up and roll it out again

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.350 
just screw it up and roll it out again

starting at one corner press it along

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.060 
starting at one corner press it along
the<00:01:42.509> edges<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.020> red<00:01:43.200> giving<00:01:43.650> a<00:01:43.740> pinch<00:01:43.979> to
