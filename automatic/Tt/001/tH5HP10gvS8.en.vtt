food-grade<00:00:16.299> barrels<00:00:17.439> I<00:00:19.380> built<00:00:20.380> a<00:00:20.679> stand<00:00:21.460> for

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
food-grade barrels I built a stand for

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.300 
food-grade barrels I built a stand for
it<00:00:21.819> into<00:00:22.269> the<00:00:22.689> corner<00:00:23.109> of<00:00:23.349> my<00:00:23.529> garage<00:00:23.829> so<00:00:23.890> I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
it into the corner of my garage so I

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.489 
it into the corner of my garage so I
could<00:00:24.609> stack<00:00:24.849> them<00:00:25.060> one<00:00:27.479> semi<00:00:28.479> on<00:00:28.839> top<00:00:29.169> of<00:00:29.349> the

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:29.499 
could stack them one semi on top of the

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.620 
could stack them one semi on top of the
other<00:00:29.649> you<00:00:30.579> can<00:00:30.729> see<00:00:30.909> how<00:00:30.999> the<00:00:31.059> bottom<00:00:31.359> one

here the elbow fitting attached to the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.480 
here the elbow fitting attached to the
cap<00:00:53.050> that<00:00:53.230> goes<00:00:53.290> on<00:00:53.410> the<00:00:53.560> top<00:00:53.800> that's<00:00:54.130> where<00:00:54.310> my

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
cap that goes on the top that's where my

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.850 
cap that goes on the top that's where my
float<00:00:55.360> valve<00:00:55.630> I<00:00:55.780> made<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.990> video<00:00:56.200> on<00:00:56.350> how<00:00:56.560> to<00:00:56.710> do

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
float valve I made a video on how to do

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.430 
float valve I made a video on how to do
it<00:00:56.950> out<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.160> cap<00:00:58.140> that's<00:00:59.140> where<00:00:59.320> that's

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
it out of a cap that's where that's

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.430 
it out of a cap that's where that's
located<00:00:59.650> at<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:01.239> this<00:01:01.480> fills<00:01:01.750> up<00:01:01.900> from<00:01:02.260> my

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
located at so this fills up from my

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.249 
located at so this fills up from my
ro/di<00:01:03.250> unit<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:06.119> fills<00:01:07.119> up<00:01:07.210> with<00:01:07.240> water<00:01:07.329> and

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
ro/di unit and fills up with water and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
coming out from the bottom of the barrel

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.370 
coming out from the bottom of the barrel
there's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.190> bulkhead<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.940> then<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:22.200> Union

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
there's a bulkhead and then the Union

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.680 
there's a bulkhead and then the Union
going<00:01:22.800> into<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> tea<00:01:23.370> it's<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> water<00:01:24.450> goes

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
going into a tea it's the water goes

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.240 
going into a tea it's the water goes
that<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.280> goes<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.820> way<00:01:28.040> to<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.159> this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
that way or it goes this way to do this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.330 
that way or it goes this way to do this
this<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:30.150> ball<00:01:30.720> valve<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> end

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this way have ball valve just on the end

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.800 
this way have ball valve just on the end
of<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.460> hose<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> can<00:01:35.280> fill<00:01:35.580> up<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.940> top<00:01:36.660> of

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
of a hose so I can fill up the top of

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.990 
of a hose so I can fill up the top of
the<00:01:36.990> house<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.290> thought<00:01:37.440> where<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.830> one<00:01:38.509> if

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
the house I thought where that one if

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.910 
the house I thought where that one if
all<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.509> mean<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.869> could<00:01:43.229> white<00:01:43.440> hook<00:01:43.800> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
all right I mean I could white hook it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.859 
all right I mean I could white hook it
right<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:45.000> Sun<00:01:45.270> my<00:01:45.600> auto<00:01:46.560> top<00:01:46.860> off<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.869> or

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
if I need to make salt water like on the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.109 
if I need to make salt water like on the
end<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.220> this<00:01:59.369> all<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:02.119> threaded

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
end of this all that is is a threaded

I<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.420> threaded<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.110> most<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.410> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
I just threaded it in there most of the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.080 
I just threaded it in there most of the
way<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.959> then<00:02:13.260> there's<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.769> hose<00:02:13.980> barb<00:02:14.280> fitting

way and then there's a hose barb fitting

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.990 
way and then there's a hose barb fitting
on<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.300> end<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:16.550> that's<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> nozzle

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
on the end of here that's like a nozzle

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:35.730 
on the end of here that's like a nozzle
to<00:02:18.209> direct<00:02:18.570> water<00:02:18.780> flow

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.460 

and<00:02:38.650> it'll<00:02:39.650> fill<00:02:39.980> up<00:02:40.750> when<00:02:41.750> I've<00:02:41.900> got<00:02:42.050> my<00:02:42.200> on

this barrel right here there's another
bulkhead<00:03:13.910> above<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:14.570> one<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:16.220> comes<00:03:16.370> up<00:03:16.610> from

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
bulkhead above this one it comes up from

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.010 
bulkhead above this one it comes up from
the<00:03:16.850> bottom<00:03:17.230> into<00:03:18.230> a<00:03:18.260> tea<00:03:19.270> if<00:03:20.270> I'm<00:03:20.480> mixing<00:03:20.690> up

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
the bottom into a tea if I'm mixing up

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.110 
the bottom into a tea if I'm mixing up
salt<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:21.800> just<00:03:22.040> gonna<00:03:22.160> water<00:03:22.790> she's<00:03:23.000> gonna

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
salt it's just gonna water she's gonna

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.030 
salt it's just gonna water she's gonna
come<00:03:23.360> out<00:03:23.510> from<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:23.780> bottom<00:03:24.010> into<00:03:25.010> my<00:03:25.180> pump

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
come out from the bottom into my pump

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.490 
come out from the bottom into my pump
and<00:03:28.120> then<00:03:29.120> right<00:03:29.540> back<00:03:29.720> into<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.110> top<00:03:30.320> of<00:03:30.350> the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
and then right back into the top of the

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.780 
and then right back into the top of the
barrel<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:31.520> stir<00:03:31.730> up<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:32.060> salt<00:03:32.390> water<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:33.860> put

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
barrel to stir up the salt water I put

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.460 
barrel to stir up the salt water I put
it<00:03:34.880> into<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.090> had<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:35.660> come<00:03:35.810> into<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.020> tea<00:03:36.260> and

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
it into I had to come into a tea and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.990 
it into I had to come into a tea and
then<00:03:36.590> I<00:03:36.680> put<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:36.860> smaller<00:03:37.160> valve<00:03:37.460> on<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.760> side

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
then I put a smaller valve on that side

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.130 
then I put a smaller valve on that side
that's<00:03:38.660> just<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.200> case<00:03:39.410> if<00:03:39.739> at<00:03:40.040> any<00:03:40.580> point

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
that's just in case if at any point

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.160 
that's just in case if at any point
something<00:03:42.140> happens<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:44.300> can't<00:03:44.510> use<00:03:44.720> my

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
something happens and I can't use my

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.080 
something happens and I can't use my
pump<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.890> get<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.250> water<00:03:46.430> out<00:03:46.550> of<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.760> barrel

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
pump to get the water out of the barrel

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.300 
pump to get the water out of the barrel
or<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.750> do<00:03:48.500> whatever<00:03:48.709> I<00:03:48.860> might<00:03:48.980> need<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.190> do

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
or to do whatever I might need to do

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.940 
or to do whatever I might need to do
with<00:03:49.430> it<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:50.750> can<00:03:51.230> always<00:03:51.350> use<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.590> just<00:03:51.860> to

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
with it I can always use that just to

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.290 
with it I can always use that just to
drain<00:03:52.130> it<00:03:52.310> off<00:03:52.430> instead<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.910> having<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.270> just

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
drain it off instead of having to just

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.330 
drain it off instead of having to just
do<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.810> fitting<00:03:54.110> or<00:03:54.350> whatever<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.920> flooding

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
do a fitting or whatever and flooding

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.850 
do a fitting or whatever and flooding
out<00:03:55.459> my<00:03:55.610> garage

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.640 

so<00:04:00.490> that's<00:04:00.670> pretty<00:04:00.850> much<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.210> I<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:05.380> is<00:04:05.620> my

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
so that's pretty much it I this is my

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.850 
so that's pretty much it I this is my
little<00:04:06.100> pump<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.550> just<00:04:06.730> hadn't<00:04:07.000> laying<00:04:07.480> around

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.560 

it's<00:04:12.860> a<00:04:12.980> quiet<00:04:13.760> one<00:04:14.000> twenty-two<00:04:14.780> hundred

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
it's a quiet one twenty-two hundred

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.570 
it's a quiet one twenty-two hundred
names<00:04:17.570> kinda<00:04:17.900> ironic<00:04:18.019> cuz<00:04:18.620> I<00:04:18.950> don't<00:04:19.459> really

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
names kinda ironic cuz I don't really

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.520 
names kinda ironic cuz I don't really
think<00:04:19.670> they're<00:04:19.940> all<00:04:20.000> that<00:04:20.180> quiet<00:04:20.510> but<00:04:21.880> so

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
think they're all that quiet but so

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.040 
think they're all that quiet but so
that's<00:04:24.530> what<00:04:24.650> circulates<00:04:25.100> water<00:04:25.280> back<00:04:26.150> up<00:04:26.390> if

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
that's what circulates water back up if

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.470 
that's what circulates water back up if
I<00:04:27.350> decide<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:28.070> need<00:04:28.100> when<00:04:28.730> I<00:04:28.760> when<00:04:29.180> when

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
anymore I'm gonna hook a hose up to here

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.940 
anymore I'm gonna hook a hose up to here
my<00:04:44.360> sump<00:04:44.630> is<00:04:44.810> on<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.200> other<00:04:45.350> side<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.770> wall

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
my sump is on the other side of the wall

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.590 
my sump is on the other side of the wall
right<00:04:46.100> there<00:04:46.160> or<00:04:46.610> my<00:04:46.760> hull<00:04:46.910> takes<00:04:47.150> on<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.420> at

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
right there or my hull takes on this at

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.850 
right there or my hull takes on this at
the<00:04:47.660> wall<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:50.140> all<00:04:51.140> I'm<00:04:51.260> gonna<00:04:51.380> do<00:04:51.560> is<00:04:51.590> just

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
the wall and all I'm gonna do is just

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.770 
the wall and all I'm gonna do is just
put<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.220> hose<00:04:52.370> on<00:04:52.400> here

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
put the hose on here

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.030 
put the hose on here
run<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.410> right<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.770> wall<00:04:54.950> and<00:04:55.750> fill<00:04:56.750> it<00:04:56.840> up

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
run it right to the wall and fill it up

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.270 
run it right to the wall and fill it up
and<00:04:58.040> so<00:04:58.430> this<00:04:58.730> is<00:04:58.910> my<00:04:59.150> way<00:04:59.330> of<00:04:59.360> just<00:04:59.780> making

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
and so this is my way of just making

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.800 
and so this is my way of just making
water<00:05:01.280> changes<00:05:01.790> a<00:05:02.150> lot<00:05:02.600> easier<00:05:03.310> because

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
water changes a lot easier because

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.250 
water changes a lot easier because
number<00:05:05.810> one<00:05:05.990> having<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.980> do<00:05:07.460> water<00:05:07.730> changes<00:05:08.260> is

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
number one having to do water changes is

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.890 
number one having to do water changes is
not<00:05:09.610> the<00:05:10.610> funnest<00:05:10.820> part<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:12.400> doing<00:05:13.400> all<00:05:13.550> this

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
not the funnest part of doing all this

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.770 
not the funnest part of doing all this
this<00:05:14.900> finis<00:05:15.260> hobby

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
this finis hobby

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.540 
this finis hobby

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.100 
I mean I like the project stuff and then
also<00:05:33.290> the<00:05:33.500> payoff<00:05:33.800> is<00:05:34.010> just<00:05:34.600> enjoying<00:05:35.600> looking

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
also the payoff is just enjoying looking

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.450 
also the payoff is just enjoying looking
at<00:05:36.200> the<00:05:36.290> tape<00:05:37.090> but<00:05:38.090> this<00:05:38.780> was<00:05:39.190> took<00:05:40.190> me<00:05:40.310> about

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
at the tape but this was took me about

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.000 
at the tape but this was took me about
three<00:05:40.730> days<00:05:40.760> you<00:05:41.480> know<00:05:41.600> just<00:05:41.630> not<00:05:42.169> straight

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
three days you know just not straight

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
three days you know just not straight
but<00:05:43.120> three<00:05:44.120> days<00:05:44.330> of<00:05:44.510> just<00:05:44.720> working<00:05:44.900> with<00:05:45.140> it

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
but three days of just working with it

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.700 
but three days of just working with it
so<00:05:47.030> yeah<00:05:47.270> so<00:05:47.510> turned<00:05:47.840> out<00:05:47.960> pretty<00:05:48.050> good<00:05:48.350> the

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
so yeah so turned out pretty good the

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.409 
so yeah so turned out pretty good the
internet<00:05:49.010> probably<00:05:49.250> right<00:05:49.640> now<00:05:49.760> accepted<00:05:50.300> to

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
internet probably right now accepted to

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.840 
internet probably right now accepted to
a<00:05:50.450> surge<00:05:50.690> protector<00:05:51.070> but<00:05:52.070> eventually<00:05:52.580> I'm

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
a surge protector but eventually I'm

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.850 
a surge protector but eventually I'm
probably<00:05:53.090> going<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:53.450> run<00:05:54.169> it<00:05:54.410> through<00:05:54.440> the

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
probably going to run it through the

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.130 
probably going to run it through the
cords<00:05:55.190> of<00:05:55.280> the<00:05:55.310> wall<00:05:55.490> also<00:05:55.700> and<00:05:56.570> plug<00:05:56.900> it<00:05:57.020> in<00:05:57.110> my

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
cords of the wall also and plug it in my

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.120 
cords of the wall also and plug it in my
apex<00:05:57.880> just<00:05:58.990> so<00:05:59.990> that<00:06:00.230> when<00:06:00.350> I'm<00:06:00.470> inside<00:06:00.830> and

apex just so that when I'm inside and

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.280 
apex just so that when I'm inside and

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
when I'm in have the hose at the today

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.100 
when I'm in have the hose at the today
and<00:06:03.530> I'm<00:06:04.010> inside<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:04.640> I<00:06:04.700> want<00:06:04.880> to<00:06:05.030> kick<00:06:05.990> the

who's gonna be my next project I don't
know<00:06:18.590> what's<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:18.860> time<00:06:19.040> frame<00:06:19.250> when<00:06:19.460> this

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:47.620 
got it and I don't know what I'm going
to<00:06:46.040> do<00:06:46.160> is<00:06:46.280> that<00:06:46.490> I'm<00:06:46.850> already

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
to do is that I'm already

to do is that I'm already
I<00:06:47.660> originally<00:06:48.470> I<00:06:48.800> was<00:06:49.010> going<00:06:49.190> to<00:06:49.460> make<00:06:49.699> it<00:06:49.850> into

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
I originally I was going to make it into

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.790 
I originally I was going to make it into
a<00:06:52.330> quarantine<00:06:53.330> where<00:06:53.840> if<00:06:53.900> I<00:06:53.990> buy<00:06:54.139> new<00:06:54.169> fish<00:06:54.560> or

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
a quarantine where if I buy new fish or

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.390 
a quarantine where if I buy new fish or
whatever<00:06:54.970> but<00:06:56.740> already<00:06:57.740> I've<00:06:57.949> kind<00:06:58.160> of<00:06:58.220> gotten

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 
whatever but already I've kind of gotten

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.590 
whatever but already I've kind of gotten
a<00:06:58.520> little<00:06:58.729> overboard<00:06:59.560> with<00:07:00.560> it<00:07:00.590> and<00:07:01.010> I<00:07:01.600> drilled

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
a little overboard with it and I drilled

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.790 
a little overboard with it and I drilled
it<00:07:02.780> I<00:07:03.770> had<00:07:04.340> a<00:07:04.430> song<00:07:05.050> I'm<00:07:06.050> kind<00:07:06.320> of<00:07:06.410> come<00:07:06.680> up<00:07:06.710> with

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 
it I had a song I'm kind of come up with

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.180 
it I had a song I'm kind of come up with
this<00:07:07.039> idea<00:07:07.460> for<00:07:07.789> like<00:07:08.150> a<00:07:08.500> double<00:07:09.500> decker<00:07:09.740> sup

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
this idea for like a double decker sup

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.920 
this idea for like a double decker sup
because<00:07:10.639> it's<00:07:10.850> kind<00:07:11.060> of<00:07:11.090> low<00:07:11.240> on<00:07:11.270> space<00:07:11.660> in

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
because it's kind of low on space in

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.909 
because it's kind of low on space in
here<00:07:12.490> so<00:07:13.630> right<00:07:14.630> there<00:07:14.870> will<00:07:14.990> be<00:07:15.020> like<00:07:15.289> this<00:07:15.770> is

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
here so right there will be like this is

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.540 
here so right there will be like this is
something<00:07:16.100> I<00:07:16.250> use<00:07:16.430> for<00:07:16.639> a<00:07:16.669> refugium<00:07:18.220> one<00:07:19.220> tank

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
something I use for a refugium one tank

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.010 
something I use for a refugium one tank
ago<00:07:20.380> there's<00:07:21.380> just<00:07:21.530> a<00:07:21.590> small<00:07:21.710> little<00:07:22.160> one<00:07:23.020> but

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020 
ago there's just a small little one but

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.110 
ago there's just a small little one but
anyway<00:07:24.440> that's<00:07:25.220> probably<00:07:25.639> what<00:07:25.789> I'll<00:07:25.910> be

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
anyway that's probably what I'll be

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.330 
anyway that's probably what I'll be
doing<00:07:26.419> next<00:07:26.539> but<00:07:26.919> they<00:07:27.919> do<00:07:28.010> with<00:07:28.130> any

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.340 
doing next but they do with any
