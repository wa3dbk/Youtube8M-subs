00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.130
 and the architecture you can touch it 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.840
 you can only see it you can touch it 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.089
 you can feel you can live it 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.179
 will be inside her not when she 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:15.669
 projected a set where the 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.490
 structures come from below 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.840
 I mean you're up 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.840
 parking lots are on top of a 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.950
 mall you already have this base 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:30.310
 this basement usually gives you some 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.829
 structures that are not made 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.320
 for the function that you are programmed 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:40.060
 are made to store cars or for 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.060
 do business the structure can you 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.280
 give a proportion that is not interesting 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.770
 for the project that you want 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.540
 develop in this case the structure 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.070
 we thought it was too much 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.739
 heavy a very coarse shape very fat in 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.720
 relation to his height everything we did 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.010
 we went 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.130
 pass account that slices the building in 2 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.970
 and then if I could express it with 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.060
 the hands after we turn or move 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.659
 the back half and the same half 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.350
 back then we went up when doing 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.350
 this game 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.420
 You get a couple of very slender figures 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.580
 a pair of very slender plates that you 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.880
 improve the proportion to the mass that you 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.340
 they gave in a very radical way and I 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.819
 I would say that the building contributes 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 certain simplicity and with little pretension 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:43.179
 to be noticed but to be a 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.850
 very light very simple structure that 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.909
 It allows 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.390
 will give the commercial area and everything 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.700
 it's entertainment a lot more value 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.470
 important I would tell you that we 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.720
 we really do not have a desire for 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.500
 have a style I think we 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.500
 we are very focused 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.450
 in solving a problem of everything that 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.990
 promotes another what this project 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.290
 New South set is for the benefit of the 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.290
 people
