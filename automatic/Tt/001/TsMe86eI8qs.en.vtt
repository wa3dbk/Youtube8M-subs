welcome<00:00:08.190> to<00:00:08.340> amp<00:00:08.520> test<00:00:08.880> Tuesday<00:00:11.450> we're<00:00:12.450> going

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
welcome to amp test Tuesday we're going

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.699 
welcome to amp test Tuesday we're going
to<00:00:12.660> do<00:00:12.719> something<00:00:13.020> a<00:00:13.080> little<00:00:13.170> bit<00:00:13.289> different

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:13.709 
to do something a little bit different

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.070 
to do something a little bit different
this<00:00:13.799> week<00:00:14.150> basically<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.270> got<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.840> shop

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
this week basically we got the shop

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.130 
this week basically we got the shop
Radio<00:00:16.470> shop<00:00:17.070> boom<00:00:17.310> box<00:00:17.720> speakers<00:00:18.720> are<00:00:18.840> taking

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
Radio shop boom box speakers are taking

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.759 
Radio shop boom box speakers are taking
off<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.350> sides<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.859> because<00:00:21.439> I've<00:00:22.439> got<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
off the sides of it because I've got the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.829 
off the sides of it because I've got the
wires<00:00:22.949> hooked<00:00:23.220> up<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.419> ran<00:00:24.599> across

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
wires hooked up and then I ran across

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.390 
wires hooked up and then I ran across
and<00:00:25.320> hooked<00:00:25.560> up<00:00:25.679> to<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> speakers<00:00:26.189> in<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and hooked up to the speakers in the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.810 
and hooked up to the speakers in the
shop<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.359> basic<00:00:27.839> shop<00:00:28.050> system<00:00:28.609> ran<00:00:29.609> by<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
shop so basic shop system ran by the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.870 
shop so basic shop system ran by the
boombox

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:45.710 

[Music]

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.820 

I<00:00:46.550> had<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.730> boombox<00:00:48.720> for<00:00:48.960> about<00:00:49.140> five<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.710> six

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
I had this boombox for about five or six

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.740 
I had this boombox for about five or six
years<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.490> have<00:00:50.730> no<00:00:50.910> idea<00:00:51.180> how<00:00:51.390> much<00:00:51.510> power

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
years so I have no idea how much power

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.750 
years so I have no idea how much power
it's<00:00:51.960> supposed<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.200> put<00:00:52.380> out<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.310> you<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.550> me

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it's supposed to put out but you know me

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
it's supposed to put out but you know me
I<00:00:53.970> pulled<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.990> up<00:00:55.050> if<00:00:55.200> I<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.380> once<00:00:55.560> per<00:00:55.650> channel

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
I pulled it up if I do once per channel

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.370 
I pulled it up if I do once per channel
10%<00:00:57.500> distortion<00:00:59.720> so<00:01:00.720> I<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.990> know<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.170> all

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
10% distortion so I don't know about all

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.900 
10% distortion so I don't know about all
that<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.860> we'll<00:01:02.220> throw<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> dyno

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that but we'll throw it up on the dyno

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.750 
that but we'll throw it up on the dyno
anyways<00:01:04.100> alright<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.280> dug<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.490> little<00:01:05.580> bit

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
anyways alright so I dug a little bit

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.250 
anyways alright so I dug a little bit
deeper<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.480> you<00:01:06.570> look<00:01:06.750> down<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.230> little

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
deeper if you look down just a little

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.400 
deeper if you look down just a little
bit<00:01:07.470> further<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:11.390> can<00:01:12.390> see<00:01:12.450> 80<00:01:12.840> watts<00:01:13.110> at

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
bit further you can see 80 watts at

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.640 
bit further you can see 80 watts at
under<00:01:14.220> 1%<00:01:14.400> distortion<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.440> go<00:01:16.530> ahead

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
under 1% distortion so we can go ahead

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.859 
under 1% distortion so we can go ahead
and<00:01:16.770> run<00:01:16.980> our<00:01:17.010> certified<00:01:17.490> test<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.750> she

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and run our certified test and if she

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.320 
and run our certified test and if she
does<00:01:19.020> 80<00:01:19.260> watts<00:01:19.580> then<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.729> not<00:01:20.820> too<00:01:21.030> bad<00:01:21.180> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
does 80 watts then it's not too bad of

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.760 
does 80 watts then it's not too bad of
course<00:01:21.450> let's<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> thousand<00:01:22.290> Hertz<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:22.650> we

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
course let's out a thousand Hertz and we

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
course let's out a thousand Hertz and we
do<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> track<00:01:23.340> for<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:25.729> we'll<00:01:26.729> use<00:01:26.760> track

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
do have a track for that we'll use track

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.800 
do have a track for that we'll use track
9<00:01:28.700> alright<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.940> as<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.420> in<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
9 alright so as you can see in the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.469 
9 alright so as you can see in the
manual<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.200> says<00:01:31.259> 150<00:01:31.890> watts<00:01:32.070> per<00:01:32.280> channel<00:01:32.479> 300

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
manual it says 150 watts per channel 300

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.469 
manual it says 150 watts per channel 300
watts<00:01:33.630> total<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.320> 10%<00:01:34.650> THD<00:01:35.460> that's<00:01:36.210> pretty

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
watts total but at 10% THD that's pretty

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.330 
watts total but at 10% THD that's pretty
big<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:37.200> that's<00:01:37.380> sort<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.710> their<00:01:37.830> way<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.009> guess

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
big so that's sort of their way I guess

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.430 
big so that's sort of their way I guess
of<00:01:38.520> inflating<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> numbers<00:01:39.390> without<00:01:39.509> telling

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
of inflating the numbers without telling

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.120 
of inflating the numbers without telling
a<00:01:40.500> fib<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.430> 10%<00:01:42.060> distortion<00:01:42.840> 300<00:01:43.680> watts<00:01:43.830> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
a fib so 10% distortion 300 watts I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.400 
a fib so 10% distortion 300 watts I
don't<00:01:44.729> really<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.810> back<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.229> thing

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
don't really know the back of this thing

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.680 
don't really know the back of this thing
says<00:01:46.710> 210<00:01:47.340> watts<00:01:47.580> total<00:01:48.000> power<00:01:48.150> consumption

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
says 210 watts total power consumption

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.750 
says 210 watts total power consumption
so<00:01:49.350> let's<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.650> if<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.890> thing<00:01:50.070> does<00:01:50.220> 150

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
so let's see if this thing does 150

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.610 
so let's see if this thing does 150
watts<00:01:50.940> per<00:01:51.150> channel<00:01:51.180> let's<00:01:52.050> see<00:01:52.230> if<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> does

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
watts per channel let's see if it does

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.490 
watts per channel let's see if it does
150<00:01:53.130> watts<00:01:53.310> total<00:01:53.700> let's<00:01:54.450> see<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.720> does<00:01:54.870> 210

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
150 watts total let's see if it does 210

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:36.119 
150 watts total let's see if it does 210
total

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:58.309 

well<00:02:36.700> to

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:29.620 

well<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.280> 102

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.710 

so<00:03:30.230> it's<00:03:30.410> way<00:03:30.590> short<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.040> 150<00:03:31.640> watts<00:03:31.820> times<00:03:32.390> two

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
so it's way short of 150 watts times two

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.500 
so it's way short of 150 watts times two
but<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:34.070> doesn't<00:03:34.400> matter<00:03:34.490> if<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:35.150> look<00:03:35.300> deep

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
but it doesn't matter if you look deep

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.820 
but it doesn't matter if you look deep
enough<00:03:35.720> in<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.930> specs<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.260> can<00:03:36.380> see<00:03:36.620> that

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
enough in the specs you can see that

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.160 
enough in the specs you can see that
it's<00:03:36.980> 80<00:03:37.190> watts<00:03:37.460> times<00:03:37.790> two<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.300> that's<00:03:38.720> at<00:03:38.930> 6

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
it's 80 watts times two and that's at 6

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.020 
it's 80 watts times two and that's at 6
ohms<00:03:39.380> we<00:03:39.620> dropped<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:39.980> down<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.130> 4<00:03:40.430> ohms<00:03:40.670> and<00:03:40.940> it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
ohms we dropped it down to 4 ohms and it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.490 
ohms we dropped it down to 4 ohms and it
did<00:03:41.180> well<00:03:41.450> above<00:03:41.810> what<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:42.140> was<00:03:42.260> supposed<00:03:42.470> to

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.620 
did well above what it was supposed to
do<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:42.920> would<00:03:43.430> say<00:03:43.580> that<00:03:43.760> probably<00:03:44.000> if<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.450> had<00:03:44.600> a

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
do I would say that probably if I had a

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.510 
do I would say that probably if I had a
6<00:03:44.960> own<00:03:45.110> load<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.500> put<00:03:45.650> on<00:03:45.770> it<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:46.160> would<00:03:46.430> be

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
6 own load to put on it it would be

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.070 
6 own load to put on it it would be
almost<00:03:46.700> exactly<00:03:46.940> where<00:03:47.450> it<00:03:47.570> should<00:03:47.750> be<00:03:47.870> course

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
almost exactly where it should be course

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.390 
almost exactly where it should be course
when<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.260> bought<00:03:48.500> this<00:03:48.680> thing<00:03:48.740> there<00:03:49.100> was<00:03:49.250> no

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
when I bought this thing there was no

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.920 
when I bought this thing there was no
such<00:03:49.580> thing<00:03:49.610> as<00:03:49.820> an<00:03:50.000> AB<00:03:50.120> dyno<00:03:50.360> so<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.660> didn't

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
such thing as an AB dyno so I didn't

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.230 
such thing as an AB dyno so I didn't
save<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.230> box<00:03:51.440> but<00:03:52.160> more<00:03:52.700> than<00:03:52.790> likely<00:03:52.850> the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
save the box but more than likely the

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.050 
save the box but more than likely the
Box<00:03:53.420> said<00:03:53.690> 300<00:03:54.290> Watts<00:03:54.470> on<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:55.160> side<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.580> so

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
Box said 300 Watts on the side of it so

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.810 
Box said 300 Watts on the side of it so
we<00:03:56.420> know<00:03:56.540> that's<00:03:57.200> but<00:03:57.770> still<00:03:58.100> in<00:03:58.340> the

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
we know that's but still in the

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.570 
we know that's but still in the
book<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.120> says<00:03:59.270> 80<00:03:59.540> watts<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.950> more<00:04:01.460> than

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
book it says 80 watts and it more than

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.180 
book it says 80 watts and it more than
did<00:04:01.760> that<00:04:01.970> so<00:04:02.690> in<00:04:03.020> my<00:04:03.140> opinion<00:04:03.230> this<00:04:03.950> thing

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
did that so in my opinion this thing

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.640 
did that so in my opinion this thing
does<00:04:04.400> pass
