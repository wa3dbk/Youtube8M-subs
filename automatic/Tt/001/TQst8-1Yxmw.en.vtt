00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.750 
ugly that's part of the ghost stuff this
ghost<00:02:29.989> stuff<00:02:30.469> sounds<00:02:30.889> totally<00:02:31.159> different

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
ghost stuff sounds totally different

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.509 
ghost stuff sounds totally different
than<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.750> Ronin<00:02:33.139> stuff<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.799> Ronin<00:02:34.129> stuff<00:02:34.340> is

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
than the Ronin stuff the Ronin stuff is

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.089 
than the Ronin stuff the Ronin stuff is
something<00:02:34.879> totally<00:02:35.120> different<00:02:35.540> off<00:02:36.099> from

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
something totally different off from

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.750 
something totally different off from
what<00:02:37.310> this<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.810> spirit<00:02:39.500> ghost<00:02:39.709> stuff<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.250> um

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.240 

yeah<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:44.269> it's<00:02:44.780> different<00:02:45.049> off<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:45.650> set

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
yeah so it's different off so I set

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.649 
yeah so it's different off so I set
names<00:02:46.459> there<00:02:46.669> I<00:02:46.700> think<00:02:46.879> this<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.209> just<00:02:47.359> what

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:47.659 
names there I think this is just what

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.199 
names there I think this is just what
they<00:02:47.750> saw<00:02:48.019> there<00:02:48.290> but<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.769> don't<00:02:49.010> think<00:02:49.250> he<00:02:50.030> says

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
they saw there but I don't think he says

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.509 
they saw there but I don't think he says
the<00:02:50.389> general<00:02:50.870> theme<00:02:51.169> so<00:02:51.859> there<00:02:52.099> might<00:02:52.219> be<00:02:52.280> like

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
the general theme so there might be like

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.920 
the general theme so there might be like
some<00:02:52.730> different<00:02:53.060> stuff<00:02:53.269> there<00:02:53.540> that's<00:02:53.780> what

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
some different stuff there that's what

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.920 
some different stuff there that's what
I'm<00:02:53.989> thinking<00:02:54.489> because<00:02:55.719> there's<00:02:56.719> probably

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
I'm thinking because there's probably

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.479 
I'm thinking because there's probably
gonna<00:02:57.019> be<00:02:57.139> ronan<00:02:57.560> sets<00:02:57.799> for<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.069> shadow<00:02:58.400> of

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
gonna be ronan sets for the shadow of

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
Ronan I know I'm not too excited about

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.869 
Ronan I know I'm not too excited about

fighting<00:03:36.769> ghosts<00:03:37.729> I<00:03:38.720> don't<00:03:39.199> think<00:03:39.259> they'll<00:03:39.530> be

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
fighting ghosts I don't think they'll be

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.080 
fighting ghosts I don't think they'll be
just<00:03:39.919> like<00:03:40.069> they<00:03:40.250> are<00:03:40.340> at<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.549> top<00:03:40.699> I<00:03:40.909> think

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
just like they are at the top I think

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.849 
just like they are at the top I think
the<00:03:41.180> least<00:03:41.329> have<00:03:41.659> certain<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.109> have<00:03:42.620> certain

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
the least have certain to have certain

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.610 
the least have certain to have certain
ways<00:03:43.220> or<00:03:43.579> abilities<00:03:44.030> I<00:03:44.239> mean<00:03:44.750> somehow<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.199> bet

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
ways or abilities I mean somehow I bet

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.429 
ways or abilities I mean somehow I bet
they<00:03:45.769> have<00:03:46.009> to<00:03:46.220> be<00:03:46.340> physical<00:03:47.079> somehow<00:03:48.079> so<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
they have to be physical somehow so the

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.330 
they have to be physical somehow so the
ninja<00:03:48.680> can<00:03:48.829> actually<00:03:49.099> fight<00:03:49.430> them<00:03:49.699> but<00:03:50.389> I<00:03:50.419> mean

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
ninja can actually fight them but I mean

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.199 
ninja can actually fight them but I mean
there's<00:03:52.340> there<00:03:52.639> they're<00:03:52.819> gonna<00:03:52.909> they're

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.879

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
ghosts so the name is therefore sets

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.710

that's next month so I know this is a
lot<00:05:10.040> of<00:05:10.070> talking<00:05:10.520> but<00:05:10.700> this<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.510> some<00:05:11.690> pretty

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
lot of talking but this is some pretty

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.310 
lot of talking but this is some pretty
big<00:05:12.050> news<00:05:12.229> for<00:05:12.700> later<00:05:13.700> on<00:05:13.940> this<00:05:14.150> year<00:05:14.320> seems

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
big news for later on this year seems

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.900 
big news for later on this year seems
like<00:05:15.530> doesn't<00:05:15.800> be<00:05:15.860> another<00:05:16.070> season<00:05:16.460> 2<00:05:16.610> because

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
like doesn't be another season 2 because

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.800 
like doesn't be another season 2 because
if<00:05:17.060> it's<00:05:17.240> every<00:05:17.539> week<00:05:17.750> for<00:05:18.710> the<00:05:19.150> episodes<00:05:20.150> for

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
if it's every week for the episodes for

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.080 
if it's every week for the episodes for
the<00:05:20.870> tournament<00:05:21.050> it's<00:05:21.380> going<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.560> go<00:05:21.680> quicker

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
the tournament it's going to go quicker

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.840 
the tournament it's going to go quicker
it's<00:05:23.090> going<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.680> probably<00:05:24.680> take<00:05:24.889> the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
it's going to probably take the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.010 
it's going to probably take the
tournament<00:05:26.240> of<00:05:26.300> elements<00:05:26.360> i<00:05:26.690> think<00:05:26.900> it's

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
tournament of elements i think it's

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.379 
tournament of elements i think it's
about<00:05:27.110> half<00:05:27.440> of<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.620> year<00:05:28.030> so<00:05:29.030> it's<00:05:29.180> one

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
about half of the year so it's one

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.540 
about half of the year so it's one
season<00:05:29.780> in<00:05:29.870> half<00:05:30.110> of<00:05:30.229> the<00:05:30.289> year<00:05:30.500> there<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:30.950> the

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
season in half of the year there and the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.710 
season in half of the year there and the
rest<00:05:31.789> of<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.000> year<00:05:32.120> is<00:05:32.300> going<00:05:32.389> to<00:05:32.450> be<00:05:32.539> this

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
rest of the year is going to be this

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.870 
rest of the year is going to be this
other<00:05:32.870> stuff<00:05:33.320> let<00:05:33.620> me<00:05:33.740> see<00:05:33.979> here<00:05:34.220> maybe<00:05:34.460> that's

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 
other stuff let me see here maybe that's

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.029 
other stuff let me see here maybe that's
that's<00:05:35.180> what<00:05:35.330> I'm<00:05:35.419> guessing<00:05:35.840> so<00:05:36.680> it's<00:05:36.830> kind<00:05:37.010> of

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
that's what I'm guessing so it's kind of

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.370 
that's what I'm guessing so it's kind of
like<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:38.180> one<00:05:38.210> year<00:05:38.600> with<00:05:38.750> season<00:05:39.200> one<00:05:39.229> and

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
like the one year with season one and

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.890 
like the one year with season one and
two<00:05:39.550> so<00:05:40.550> this<00:05:41.000> is<00:05:41.120> a<00:05:41.150> really<00:05:41.360> big<00:05:41.599> year

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
two so this is a really big year

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.770 
two so this is a really big year
apparently<00:05:42.169> for<00:05:42.710> Ninjago<00:05:43.240> very<00:05:44.240> very<00:05:44.570> big

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
apparently for Ninjago very very big
