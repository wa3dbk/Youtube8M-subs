30<00:02:07.960> milliliters<00:02:08.349> of<00:02:08.739> water<00:02:09.190> onto<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.970> sponge

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
30 milliliters of water onto the sponge

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.350 
30 milliliters of water onto the sponge
slowly<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.440> evenly<00:02:11.920> okay<00:02:12.849> that's<00:02:13.090> how<00:02:13.269> you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.920 
slowly and evenly okay that's how you
use<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:15.340> will<00:02:15.489> just<00:02:15.760> turn<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.120> on<00:02:16.239> to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
use it and I will just turn it on to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.960 
use it and I will just turn it on to
show<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.200> guys<00:02:17.500> how<00:02:17.830> loud<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.940> is<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:21.069> I'm

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
show you guys how loud this is and I'm

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.789 
show you guys how loud this is and I'm
going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> use<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.480> AC<00:02:22.660> adapter<00:02:23.319> again<00:02:23.769> I

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
going to use the AC adapter again I

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.000 
going to use the AC adapter again I
recommend<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.790> AC<00:02:24.970> adapters<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.890> air

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
recommend the AC adapters just the air

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:36.370 
recommend the AC adapters just the air
flow<00:02:27.220> which<00:02:27.340> is<00:02:27.519> much<00:02:27.819> stronger

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.610 

all<00:02:36.890> right<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.720> on<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.140> off<00:02:39.230> dial

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
all right so this is the on and off dial

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.650 
all right so this is the on and off dial
and<00:02:39.920> I'm<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.190> going<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.370> turn<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.880> to<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
and I'm just going to turn it on to the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.330 
and I'm just going to turn it on to the
max<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:46.280> feels<00:02:46.870> really<00:02:47.870> nice

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
max and it feels really nice

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.290 
max and it feels really nice
this<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.840> find<00:02:51.319> it<00:02:51.470> it's<00:02:51.640> better<00:02:52.640> than<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:53.060> fan

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
this is I find it it's better than a fan

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.630 
this is I find it it's better than a fan
now<00:02:53.599> it<00:02:53.750> doesn't<00:02:54.019> replace<00:02:54.140> an<00:02:54.560> AC<00:02:55.069> but<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.489> do

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
now it doesn't replace an AC but I do

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.880 
now it doesn't replace an AC but I do
find<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.209> it's<00:02:56.420> better<00:02:56.720> than<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.230> fan<00:02:57.590> because

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
find that it's better than a fan because

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.190 
find that it's better than a fan because
it<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.840> know<00:02:59.959> gives<00:03:00.290> off<00:03:00.530> cool<00:03:00.980> air<00:03:01.930> but<00:03:02.930> again

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
it you know gives off cool air but again

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.860 
it you know gives off cool air but again
this<00:03:03.410> does<00:03:04.190> not<00:03:04.340> work<00:03:04.580> as<00:03:04.819> well<00:03:05.120> if<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.660> live

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
this does not work as well if you live

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.589 
this does not work as well if you live
in<00:03:05.989> an<00:03:06.110> area<00:03:06.319> where<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:07.010> incredibly<00:03:07.640> humid

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.319 

so<00:03:11.140> this<00:03:11.349> is<00:03:11.499> how<00:03:11.650> well<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.099> is<00:03:12.249> okay<00:03:12.819> so<00:03:12.879> I'm

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
so this is how well it is okay so I'm

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.150 
so this is how well it is okay so I'm
gonna<00:03:13.510> let<00:03:13.659> you<00:03:13.719> guys<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:14.760> have<00:03:15.760> fun<00:03:15.819> shopping
