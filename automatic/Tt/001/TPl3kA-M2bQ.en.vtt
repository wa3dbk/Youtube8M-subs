 I continued to repair but I do not want to 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.609
 let me walk a little bit 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.380
 tattoos 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.239
 here we go now 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.000

 red area I go down and it's gone 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.650

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.650
 look hop the trophy it's displayed in 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.079
 top right inappropriate use 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.700
 it's very simple why not darken 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.189
 in the judge pile to unlock it after 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.140
 put yourself under cover look towards 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.609
 this one we'll crack hat it's 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.159
 settled and it's over 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.569
 this is a simple challenge that is 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.819
 who and who is very easy to use 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.129
 in the east have mostly a little bit more 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.780
 far for the following challenges go on the 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.579
 next challenge is brave or 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.579
 stupid then you put in an area 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.389
 everything that is very deep here is marked 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.000
 by black spots 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.889
 so you will certainly recognize the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.239
 video that was present in my 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.659
 Last episode 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:31.659
 so just dive to over 60 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.069
 or 70 meters deep you can 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.739
 help you with a syringe 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.040
 look at europe the challenge appeared on the 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.260
 trophy and the brave or stupid that 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.829
 it is well said here and more I found 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.680
 an olic title 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.010
 go we find ourselves all a neighbor 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.620
 challenge 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.540
 go we jump for the next trophy 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.120
 it's the stone always wins 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.299
 to achieve it is simple enough 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.459
 to throw a pebble 3 or more times 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.019
 in the same place and so the enemy is going 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.030
 come see what's going on you have to 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.099
 let him come and let him go 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.019
 resume his position as soon as he has resumed 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.879
 his position you relaunch the pebble to 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.349
 pretty much in the same place and it makes you 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.629
 that several times in a row 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.090
 and here is the trophy unlocked so 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.579
 I concede that it is quite long and 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.120
 boring, but good gosh must pay 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.549
 take his time 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.530
 that's it for locks thrown pebbles 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.639
 and wait for them to come back so 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.440
 maybe some of them 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.750
 wanted more stealth here that does not play 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.490
 that the stones and the bow will have already 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.570
 realized but for all the others 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.820
 do it you'll see it's good 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.430
 nice ob you see he came back 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.789
 see where I threw my pebbles and the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.570
 trophy should be here soon 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:40.760
 lapierre always win 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.520
 it's great to eminent is to 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.650
 the following trophies and the next 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.350
 trophy it's nothing seen coming 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.280
 so you stay on the first one there you 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.770

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.570

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.360

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.099
 house here you put your marker and 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.099

 executed by the horla it is obligatory 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.000
 so you'll see you have to post to 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.410
 side of a hut to do this you 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.030
 eliminate the guards that are nearby 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.409
 to be quieter 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.209
