00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.780
 I had already introduced you as finally 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.240
 drunk summer shows the easter room tac 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.300
 I wanted to do it you did not have it 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.880
 not seen I wanted to go of course 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:32.800
 how to make furniture here you go 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.579
 but today I started you 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.379
 a computer or and brought it must 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.100
 way too much something tells me if 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:53.410
 never you are so I represented this 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:56.170
 does it so it's super practical I 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:03.250
 find that super nice that makes 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:07.540
 of course the image of your mounts buy 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.970
 so wanted that's not it at all 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.200
 complicated to make Tuesday did not actually make you 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.680
 just take a piece of paper 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.009
 white polo shirt that you want that is folded 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:22.270
 so I was lucky that the show 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.970
 was already folded and that in fact one can 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.259
 snatched in two so if one day I 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.799
 I'm sick of the keyboard and ben will be done table 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:35.380
 ecology will be the game the winter on 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.799

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.409

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:46.450
 Fusse td images images like this 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.369
 so that I was found on a catalan 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.369
 that you show atalante struggles 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.440

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:13.480

 on 20 finally one on the other to make 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.050

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.790

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:16.520
 I hang up on messages too much head to 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.520

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:41.640
 not too much the montaillou boyfriend and 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.300

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:49.169
 of course the laptop I do not I 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.760
 did not understand anything but I did not have 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.640
 really do nothing the printer nor to 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:57.750
 the computer I left in hand I the 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.580
 cutting and myself wounds on a 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.000
 little catalog there were ten 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.070
 nations that to see how was that l 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.770
 iphone and I have them dolls 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:13.290
 so it's really a tool a must not 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:15.930
 look very far and so I had to 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.060
 cut a little cheap and what is good 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.390
 is that if you want to make a 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.870
 recording for example is a 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:28.080
 offense is the life of a crazy crazy teen 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.540
 the little phone for the mail is at 7 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:37.070
 like seven new messages that's too much 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.070
 here I put it to you with prisa 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:47.260
 then I did two other things 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:51.040
 which he has my way and silas 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:53.860
 neeposh the ugliest Arab world who 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.530
 can always say that he was laughing for 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.080
 that I have for it is for a girl that 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.250
 you do not like if there I am a little 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:07.750
 missed because it's he knows the 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:10.540
 through if if that's where I got them 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:16.780
 facts I took a little bit 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:20.020
 I took double sided and so I 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:25.750
 took a slap and 10 double-sided I 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.710
 took a cardboard like a sheet 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:32.290
 hardcover 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:34.870
 I cut in more than 6 he's cut a 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.380
 small and I put the double all the 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.310
 do and january the thing that is but 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.790
 I had a small flaw 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.700
 simply 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.860
 it's not complicated when I saw 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.450
 acquired galley to do something that 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.090
 the prints and where I thought oh the 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:51.070
 governed by a common point I do and 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.520
 then in the end I unlocked as 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.870
 it still has meaning we follow so 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:04.150
 I will go back to everything I have 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:07.570
 done from the beginning so that that makes it 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.640
 three phones that I had shown this 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:13.870
 morning 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:21.610
 but that's all my collection 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:28.780
 i did and i'm me like lidya tgv 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:30.580
 to take but unfortunately for the 

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.060
 telly I have not done the TV yet 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:36.900
 as too much damage says we fart at the 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.900
 smav to the listened
