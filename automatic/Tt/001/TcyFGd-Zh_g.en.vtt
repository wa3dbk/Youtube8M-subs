00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
than ten percent band rate meaning that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.550 
than ten percent band rate meaning that
you<00:00:18.210> actually<00:00:18.390> have<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> good<00:00:19.080> chance<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560

playing them getting them every game and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.599 
playing them getting them every game and
climbing<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.920> as<00:00:23.070> always<00:00:23.369> we're

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
climbing with them so as always we're

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.950 
climbing with them so as always we're
going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.880> starting<00:00:24.119> at<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.390> top<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
going to be starting at the top of the

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.089 
going to be starting at the top of the
map<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.350> then<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> be<00:00:25.859> working

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
map and then we're going to be working

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.890 
map and then we're going to be working
our<00:00:26.460> way<00:00:26.490> down<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.269> we're<00:00:27.359> gonna<00:00:27.449> start<00:00:27.779> with

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
our way down and we're gonna start with

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.019 
our way down and we're gonna start with
renekton<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> good<00:00:28.890> old<00:00:29.010> croc<00:00:29.310> has<00:00:29.519> come<00:00:29.849> back

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
renekton the good old croc has come back

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.999 
renekton the good old croc has come back
and<00:00:30.330> he's<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.720> strong<00:00:31.050> at<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.320> moment<00:00:31.349> he<00:00:31.890> has

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and he's so strong at the moment he has

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.069 
and he's so strong at the moment he has
a<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.910> good<00:00:33.149> lane<00:00:33.360> phase<00:00:33.630> like<00:00:33.930> he

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
a really really good lane phase like he

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
a really really good lane phase like he
can<00:00:34.260> crush<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> lane<00:00:34.829> harder<00:00:35.250> than<00:00:35.370> probably

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
can crush a lane harder than probably

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
can crush a lane harder than probably
any<00:00:35.940> other<00:00:36.120> top<00:00:36.510> laner<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.110> he<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.350> has

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
any other top laner because he just has

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
any other top laner because he just has
so<00:00:37.800> much<00:00:38.040> base<00:00:38.340> damage<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.120> lot<00:00:39.270> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
so much base damage and a lot of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.299 
so much base damage and a lot of
sustained<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.110> his<00:00:40.230> Q<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.620> well<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
sustained with his Q as well the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.040 
sustained with his Q as well the
misconception<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.090> led<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.480> him<00:00:42.750> kind<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
misconception that led to him kind of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.869 
misconception that led to him kind of
having<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> downfall<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.309> renekton<00:00:44.730> does

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
having a downfall is the renekton does

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.549 
having a downfall is the renekton does
nothing<00:00:45.360> mid<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.660> late<00:00:45.780> game<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
nothing mid to late game and this is

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.380 
nothing mid to late game and this is
completely<00:00:47.100> different<00:00:47.579> now<00:00:47.700> partly<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.210> how

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
completely different now partly with how

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
can start to one-shot people now this is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.210 
can start to one-shot people now this is
really<00:01:13.049> good<00:01:13.350> because<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.770> means<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.070> can

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
really good because it means you can

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.740 
really good because it means you can
build<00:01:14.400> damage<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.880> Lane<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.479> stomp

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
build damage in Lane and you can stomp

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.300 
build damage in Lane and you can stomp
your<00:01:15.930> lane<00:01:16.080> opponent<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> really

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
your lane opponent you can get a really

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
your lane opponent you can get a really
huge<00:01:17.640> lead<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.240> then<00:01:18.360> when<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.630> comes<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
huge lead but then when it comes to

get them ahead the biggest problem with
annie<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:07.260> she's<00:04:07.470> very<00:04:07.829> very<00:04:08.100> reliant<00:04:08.549> on

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
annie is that she's very very reliant on

annie is that she's very very reliant on
her<00:04:08.970> flash<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.510> guarantee<00:04:09.900> a<00:04:09.930> good<00:04:10.170> altimas

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
her flash to guarantee a good altimas

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.500 
her flash to guarantee a good altimas
she<00:04:10.950> has<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.280> get<00:04:11.370> distortion<00:04:11.880> early<00:04:12.239> really

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
she has to get distortion early really

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.870 
she has to get distortion early really
which<00:04:12.660> is<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.870> 475<00:04:13.829> gold<00:04:14.310> down<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.639> drain

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
which is a 475 gold down the drain

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.729 
which is a 475 gold down the drain
because<00:04:14.910> she<00:04:15.420> needs<00:04:15.660> her<00:04:15.810> flash<00:04:16.079> as<00:04:16.260> often<00:04:16.590> as

into<00:04:18.690> this<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.079> well<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.560> she's<00:04:19.829> really

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
into this as well is that she's really

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.099 
into this as well is that she's really
not<00:04:20.519> very<00:04:20.579> mobile<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.269> sometimes<00:04:21.959> you're

right for this one I'm going to be using
vein<00:04:34.740> that<00:04:35.010> vein<00:04:35.250> is<00:04:35.400> one<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.610> these<00:04:35.730> champions

vein that vein is one of these champions
where<00:04:36.479> she<00:04:36.690> is<00:04:36.750> only<00:04:37.080> as<00:04:37.440> good<00:04:37.560> as<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:38.160> are

with her like if you are bad with vain
then<00:04:40.350> you<00:04:40.560> will<00:04:40.800> be<00:04:40.979> bad<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.400> you<00:04:41.490> won't<00:04:41.669> have

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
are really good with her then you'll

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.090 
are really good with her then you'll
have<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.150> huge<00:04:45.570> impact<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.169> game<00:04:46.380> a<00:04:46.710> lot<00:04:47.070> of

have a huge impact in the game a lot of
people<00:04:47.190> are<00:04:47.430> probably<00:04:47.580> going<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.910> be<00:04:48.000> like

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
people are probably going to be like

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.540 
people are probably going to be like

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
probably crushed by her veins to explain

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.180 
probably crushed by her veins to explain
it<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:55.080> we'll<00:04:55.290> look<00:04:55.410> at<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.620> most<00:04:55.800> popular

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
grazed because he has his passive and

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.210 
grazed because he has his passive and
he's<00:05:09.300> pretty<00:05:09.479> tanky<00:05:10.020> and<00:05:10.260> also<00:05:10.560> has<00:05:10.770> so<00:05:11.040> much

he's pretty tanky and also has so much

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
enough time to kill him there's a big

enough time to kill him there's a big
reason<00:05:15.150> why<00:05:15.360> I<00:05:15.690> put<00:05:16.110> her<00:05:16.229> in<00:05:16.260> this<00:05:16.470> list

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
reason why I put her in this list

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.170 
reason why I put her in this list

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
because in three hours matchups you

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.120 
because in three hours matchups you
should<00:05:18.360> win<00:05:18.600> three<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.169> them<00:05:19.320> you<00:05:19.440> can<00:05:19.710> win<00:05:20.010> if

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
should win three of them you can win if

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.409 
should win three of them you can win if
you<00:05:20.160> play<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.460> right<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.970> one<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.270> them<00:05:21.360> is

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
you play it right and one of them is

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.090 
you play it right and one of them is
just<00:05:21.479> going<00:05:21.720> to<00:05:21.780> be<00:05:21.840> really<00:05:22.200> hard<00:05:22.440> this<00:05:22.889> covers

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
just going to be really hard this covers

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.740 
just going to be really hard this covers
up<00:05:23.340> her<00:05:23.460> weakest<00:05:23.940> phase<00:05:24.120> in<00:05:24.300> the<00:05:24.389> game<00:05:24.570> which

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
up her weakest phase in the game which

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.719 
up her weakest phase in the game which
is<00:05:24.900> her<00:05:25.229> lane<00:05:25.440> phase<00:05:25.710> and<00:05:26.010> can<00:05:26.220> set<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.550> up<00:05:26.580> for

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
is her lane phase and can set you up for

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.909 
is her lane phase and can set you up for
a<00:05:26.970> really<00:05:27.449> really<00:05:27.479> strong<00:05:27.960> mid<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.500> late<00:05:28.680> game

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
a really really strong mid to late game

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.010 
a really really strong mid to late game
Fane<00:05:29.430> can<00:05:29.639> pretty<00:05:29.820> much<00:05:29.910> carry<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.389> game<00:05:30.630> on<00:05:30.840> her

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
Fane can pretty much carry a game on her

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.659 
Fane can pretty much carry a game on her
own<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.440> as<00:05:31.530> we<00:05:31.680> just<00:05:31.889> said<00:05:32.070> her<00:05:32.250> lane<00:05:32.430> phase

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
own and as we just said her lane phase

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.700 
own and as we just said her lane phase
is<00:05:32.880> not<00:05:33.150> as<00:05:33.270> bad<00:05:33.450> as<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:33.750> think<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.139> is<00:05:34.200> the

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
is not as bad as you think it is the

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.440 
is not as bad as you think it is the
problems<00:05:35.039> with<00:05:35.190> vein<00:05:35.430> is<00:05:35.700> that<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:35.970> can<00:05:36.270> be

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
problems with vein is that you can be

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.029 
problems with vein is that you can be
put<00:05:36.630> it<00:05:36.720> in<00:05:36.870> lane<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.440> can<00:05:37.710> get<00:05:37.860> behind

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
put it in lane and you can get behind

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.860 
put it in lane and you can get behind
especially<00:05:38.460> if<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.030> enemy<00:05:39.360> support<00:05:39.750> is

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
especially if the enemy support is

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.659 
especially if the enemy support is
playing<00:05:40.139> a<00:05:40.260> kill<00:05:40.530> Lane<00:05:40.710> something<00:05:41.340> a<00:05:41.460> lot<00:05:41.639> of

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
playing a kill Lane something a lot of

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:43.070 
playing a kill Lane something a lot of
people<00:05:41.760> don't<00:05:42.120> think<00:05:42.240> about<00:05:42.419> is<00:05:42.720> vein<00:05:42.930> is

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
people don't think about is vein is

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.659 
people don't think about is vein is
really<00:05:43.560> weak<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:43.950> a<00:05:43.979> wee<00:05:44.220> damage<00:05:44.550> in

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
really weak to a wee damage in

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.339 
really weak to a wee damage in
teamfights<00:05:44.910> like<00:05:45.389> you<00:05:45.539> have<00:05:45.750> to<00:05:45.930> be<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:46.080> little

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
teamfights like you have to be a little

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.020 
teamfights like you have to be a little
bit<00:05:46.470> closer<00:05:46.740> so<00:05:46.950> you're<00:05:47.190> not<00:05:47.370> as<00:05:47.520> safe<00:05:47.789> as

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
bit closer so you're not as safe as

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.300 
bit closer so you're not as safe as
other<00:05:48.240> IDs<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.870> AOE<00:05:49.349> damage<00:05:49.440> that's<00:05:50.130> not

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
other IDs and AOE damage that's not

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.490 
other IDs and AOE damage that's not
necessarily<00:05:50.880> aimed<00:05:51.150> at<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.479> can<00:05:51.720> really<00:05:52.260> harm

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
necessarily aimed at you can really harm

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.440 
necessarily aimed at you can really harm
your<00:05:52.770> damage<00:05:53.070> output<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.820> final<00:05:54.090> thing<00:05:54.240> is

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
your damage output the final thing is

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.089 
your damage output the final thing is
she<00:05:54.660> is<00:05:54.690> just<00:05:54.990> one<00:05:55.169> of<00:05:55.200> the<00:05:55.320> hardest<00:05:55.650> ideas<00:05:55.950> our

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
she is just one of the hardest ideas our

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.890 
she is just one of the hardest ideas our
place<00:05:56.280> she's<00:05:56.310> very<00:05:56.789> mechanically<00:05:57.270> intensive

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
place she's very mechanically intensive

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.210 
place she's very mechanically intensive
which<00:05:58.050> means<00:05:58.289> you<00:05:58.440> have<00:05:58.650> to<00:05:58.680> make<00:05:58.979> good

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
which means you have to make good

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.500 
which means you have to make good
decisions<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.849> you<00:06:00.030> have<00:06:00.210> to<00:06:00.360> be<00:06:00.479> good

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
decisions and you have to be good

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.510 
decisions and you have to be good
mechanically<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.380> actually<00:06:01.710> pull<00:06:01.889> her<00:06:02.039> off<00:06:02.070> a

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
mechanically to actually pull her off a

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.400 
mechanically to actually pull her off a
comparing<00:06:03.270> supporters<00:06:03.690> is<00:06:03.780> actually<00:06:04.110> really

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
comparing supporters is actually really

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.779 
comparing supporters is actually really
difficult<00:06:04.620> because<00:06:05.099> they're<00:06:05.370> all<00:06:05.490> kind<00:06:05.729> of

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
difficult because they're all kind of

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.460 
difficult because they're all kind of
good<00:06:05.940> at<00:06:05.970> different<00:06:06.270> things<00:06:06.539> but<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.289> one<00:06:07.440> I

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
good at different things but the one I

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.230 
good at different things but the one I
want<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.740> highlight<00:06:07.889> is<00:06:08.160> Nautilus<00:06:08.760> here's<00:06:09.120> a

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
want to highlight is Nautilus here's a

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.480 
want to highlight is Nautilus here's a
really<00:06:09.570> high<00:06:09.840> kill<00:06:10.110> potential<00:06:10.410> like<00:06:10.830> really

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
really high kill potential like really

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.219 
really high kill potential like really
high<00:06:11.669> in<00:06:11.700> Lane<00:06:12.090> he<00:06:12.360> has<00:06:12.450> really<00:06:12.810> good<00:06:13.050> lock

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:13.229 
high in Lane he has really good lock

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.600 
high in Lane he has really good lock
down<00:06:13.440> in<00:06:13.560> crowd<00:06:13.770> control<00:06:13.800> as<00:06:14.250> well<00:06:14.430> which

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
down in crowd control as well which

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.219 
down in crowd control as well which
helps<00:06:14.639> with<00:06:15.030> that<00:06:15.060> but<00:06:15.389> part<00:06:15.630> of<00:06:15.720> it<00:06:15.840> is<00:06:15.900> just

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
helps with that but part of it is just

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:18.050 
helps with that but part of it is just
because<00:06:16.500> he's<00:06:16.620> so<00:06:16.830> tanky<00:06:17.280> and<00:06:17.520> he<00:06:17.639> does<00:06:17.820> a<00:06:17.849> lot

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
because he's so tanky and he does a lot

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.330 
because he's so tanky and he does a lot
of<00:06:18.120> damage<00:06:18.330> as<00:06:18.599> well<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:19.289> really<00:06:19.680> dumb<00:06:20.010> thing

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
of damage as well the really dumb thing

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.830 
of damage as well the really dumb thing
and<00:06:20.550> the<00:06:20.669> thing<00:06:20.700> I<00:06:20.970> hate<00:06:21.000> about<00:06:21.450> paying

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
and the thing I hate about paying

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.810 
and the thing I hate about paying
against<00:06:22.080> him<00:06:22.349> is<00:06:22.560> that<00:06:22.800> he<00:06:22.979> can<00:06:23.190> solo<00:06:23.639> the

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
against him is that he can solo the

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.969 
against him is that he can solo the
enemy<00:06:24.120> ad<00:06:24.270> at<00:06:24.720> early<00:06:25.050> levels<00:06:25.380> like<00:06:25.590> if<00:06:25.800> you

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
enemy ad at early levels like if you

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.680 
enemy ad at early levels like if you
trade<00:06:26.370> with<00:06:26.580> him<00:06:26.729> and<00:06:26.940> leveled<00:06:27.180> like<00:06:27.300> two<00:06:27.510> and

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
trade with him and leveled like two and

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.969 
trade with him and leveled like two and
three<00:06:28.020> you're<00:06:28.320> actually<00:06:28.440> probably<00:06:28.710> going<00:06:28.919> to

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
three you're actually probably going to

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.770 
three you're actually probably going to
come<00:06:29.099> out<00:06:29.220> on<00:06:29.250> top<00:06:29.610> that's<00:06:30.180> just<00:06:30.479> his<00:06:30.630> lane

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
come out on top that's just his lane

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.450 
come out on top that's just his lane
phase<00:06:31.020> and<00:06:31.229> I<00:06:31.260> think<00:06:31.530> honesty<00:06:31.919> is<00:06:31.950> one<00:06:32.220> of<00:06:32.340> the

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
phase and I think honesty is one of the

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.610 
phase and I think honesty is one of the
strongest<00:06:32.880> kill<00:06:33.240> lanes<00:06:33.479> in<00:06:33.720> Lane<00:06:34.200> right<00:06:34.440> now

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
strongest kill lanes in Lane right now

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.050 
strongest kill lanes in Lane right now
but<00:06:34.889> when<00:06:35.010> we<00:06:35.099> get<00:06:35.220> to<00:06:35.340> teamfights<00:06:35.760> he<00:06:35.940> has

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
but when we get to teamfights he has

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.580 
but when we get to teamfights he has
really<00:06:36.450> good<00:06:36.570> engage<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.229> he<00:06:37.380> can<00:06:37.500> actually

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
really good engage and he can actually

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.560 
really good engage and he can actually
peel<00:06:37.979> really<00:06:38.280> well<00:06:38.430> as<00:06:38.580> well<00:06:38.789> the<00:06:39.240> problems

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
peel really well as well the problems

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:41.450 
peel really well as well the problems
with<00:06:39.750> playing<00:06:40.020> Nautilus<00:06:40.530> is<00:06:40.680> that<00:06:41.010> he

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
with playing Nautilus is that he

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.340 
with playing Nautilus is that he
only<00:06:41.639> goes<00:06:41.910> in<00:06:42.180> like<00:06:42.330> he<00:06:42.479> has<00:06:42.600> no<00:06:42.870> off<00:06:43.169> switch

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
only goes in like he has no off switch

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.930 
only goes in like he has no off switch
and<00:06:43.740> he's<00:06:43.889> not<00:06:43.919> read<00:06:44.250> that<00:06:44.280> good<00:06:44.699> when<00:06:44.850> he's

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:44.940 
and he's not read that good when he's

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.240 
and he's not read that good when he's
behind<00:06:45.090> he<00:06:45.840> can't<00:06:46.110> do<00:06:46.289> that<00:06:46.319> much<00:06:46.620> in<00:06:46.830> a<00:06:46.919> weaker

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
behind he can't do that much in a weaker

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.740 
behind he can't do that much in a weaker
lane<00:06:47.430> so<00:06:47.729> you<00:06:47.789> don't<00:06:48.120> really<00:06:48.240> want<00:06:48.479> to<00:06:48.539> pair

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
lane so you don't really want to pair

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.240 
lane so you don't really want to pair
him<00:06:48.840> with<00:06:48.900> someone<00:06:49.229> who<00:06:49.470> just<00:06:49.620> wants<00:06:49.740> to<00:06:49.949> farm

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.250 
him with someone who just wants to farm

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.339 
him with someone who just wants to farm
and<00:06:50.580> he<00:06:50.759> has<00:06:50.970> like<00:06:51.150> no<00:06:51.509> fun<00:06:51.810> playing<00:06:51.870> against

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
and he has like no fun playing against

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.260 
and he has like no fun playing against
sustained<00:06:52.770> and<00:06:53.099> no<00:06:53.280> fun<00:06:53.610> playing<00:06:53.639> against
