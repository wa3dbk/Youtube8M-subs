with<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.989> breaker<00:03:16.230> itself<00:03:16.680> or<00:03:16.980> that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
with the breaker itself or that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.370 
with the breaker itself or that
appliance<00:03:17.730> remember<00:03:18.720> these<00:03:18.870> are<00:03:19.019> rated<00:03:19.230> by

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
appliance remember these are rated by

appliance remember these are rated by
amps<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.919> is<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.099> 15<00:03:20.519> amp<00:03:20.669> breaker<00:03:20.849> if<00:03:21.480> you're

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
amps this is a 15 amp breaker if you're

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.089 
amps this is a 15 amp breaker if you're
trying<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.930> plug<00:03:22.169> something<00:03:22.440> into<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.799> or

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
trying to plug something into it or

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.099 
trying to plug something into it or
multiple<00:03:23.519> things<00:03:23.760> into<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.090> same<00:03:24.299> circuit

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
multiple things into the same circuit

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.020 
multiple things into the same circuit
that's<00:03:25.530> more<00:03:25.799> than<00:03:25.950> 15<00:03:26.280> amps<00:03:26.609> you're<00:03:26.819> going<00:03:26.970> to

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
that's more than 15 amps you're going to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.240 
that's more than 15 amps you're going to
trip<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.750> need<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.079> unplug<00:03:28.620> that<00:03:28.950> at

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
trip it so you need to unplug that at

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.800 
trip it so you need to unplug that at
least<00:03:29.579> one<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> appliances<00:03:30.389> to<00:03:30.510> get<00:03:30.660> down

you'll<00:03:45.419> see<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.660> light<00:03:45.840> turn<00:03:46.079> on<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.620> checking

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
you'll see the light turn on is checking

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.400 
you'll see the light turn on is checking
itself<00:03:47.359> when<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.389> light<00:03:48.599> goes<00:03:48.780> off<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.290> know

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
itself when the light goes off you know

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.190 
itself when the light goes off you know
that's<00:03:49.590> working<00:03:49.919> properly<00:03:50.840> as<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.989> said

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
that's working properly as I said

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.750 
that's working properly as I said
earlier<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.799> have<00:03:52.829> deifies<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.549> all<00:03:53.639> your

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
earlier we have deifies and all your

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.520 
earlier we have deifies and all your
wear<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.239> like<00:03:54.540> your<00:03:54.690> bathroom<00:03:55.139> in<00:03:55.260> your<00:03:55.290> house

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
wear is like your bathroom in your house

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.539 
wear is like your bathroom in your house
outside<00:03:56.629> if<00:03:57.629> you<00:03:57.840> trip<00:03:58.109> it<00:03:58.290> your<00:03:59.129> hair<00:03:59.310> dryer

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
outside if you trip it your hair dryer

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.460 
outside if you trip it your hair dryer
that's<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.910> common<00:04:00.239> problem<00:04:00.450> I'll<00:04:01.230> demonstrate

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
that's a common problem I'll demonstrate

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.589 
that's a common problem I'll demonstrate
the<00:04:02.129> test<00:04:02.340> button<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:02.879> see<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.150> light<00:04:03.329> comes

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
the test button you see the light comes

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.039 
the test button you see the light comes
on<00:04:04.370> press<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.519> again<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:06.000> should<00:04:06.269> reset<00:04:06.750> the

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
on press it again it should reset the

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.390 
on press it again it should reset the
light<00:04:07.230> comes<00:04:07.500> off<00:04:07.709> if<00:04:07.980> not<00:04:08.129> check<00:04:08.790> your<00:04:08.970> brake

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
light comes off if not check your brake

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.190 
light comes off if not check your brake
and<00:04:09.489> like<00:04:09.670> a<00:04:09.700> Shinji<00:04:10.150> earlier<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.780> still<00:04:11.019> keeps

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
and like a Shinji earlier it still keeps

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.199 
and like a Shinji earlier it still keeps
tripping<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:12.370> could<00:04:12.549> be<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.700> problem<00:04:13.090> that

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
tripping it could be a problem that

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.149 
tripping it could be a problem that
appliance<00:04:13.540> or<00:04:13.989> without<00:04:14.500> Latour<00:04:14.950> break
