00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.420
 very good girls very good guys today 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.230
 reigned and we are in a new news 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.600
 as you can see it still continues with 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.939
 this is awesome allergy costs no longer 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.539
 I know if it is lack or constipated but 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.940
 good butt so you know I hope 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.610
 that you value being here with everyone 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.920
 you and watch all because 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.109
 new microsoft has confirmed that it is 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.890
 working improving the graphics of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.499
 xbox one optimizing the cpu and is that the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.469
 constant career not for being the console 

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:42.569
 more advanced in the graphic aspect 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.639
 Microsoft seems to further increase its 

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:46.800
 bet since you're working on 

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:50.249
 improve wang graphics by optimizing 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.409
 the gpu well something in what we have been able 

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.350
 get thanks to gaming bold that has 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.780
 posted that those from microsoft by good 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.879
 are orienting to be done right now 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.920
 with professional people who can contribute 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.080
 something from that terrain from me from what 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.090
 microsoft is looking for an engineer 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.100
 expert in the optimization of 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.080
 graphic performance on all the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.850
 architecture gpu one of the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.619
 most curious requirements is that 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.680
 seek to advance in the optimization of 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.420
 framerate or frame rate per second 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.100
 working closely with the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.960
 developers and understanding the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.960
 technical problems of these and the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.500
 performance requirements the truth 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.939
 is that by forming a lot of people 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.420
 questioned the graphic performance of 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:37.880
 xbox guard that we remember is compared 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.860
 very much with playstation 4 saying that 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.310
 He pointed out how much more powerful 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.140
 graphically not but now microsoft 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.479
 he is fighting to improve the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.880
 performance of the gpu and all the themes 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.700
 related as the framerate then 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.590
 good microsoft will try to prove that 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.580
 above all it is being taken very seriously 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.430
 the evolution of the console 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.740
 and especially with those updates 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.900
 what are they really doing 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.450
 awesome that the updates 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.149
 monthly of the console as they are noticed 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.090
 the improvements that are introduced and that 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.770
 I must say the truth and so 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.450
 thanks for being there like and favorites 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.350
 comment and share and see you in the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.350
 next chao
