hey<00:00:01.170> guys<00:00:01.380> it's<00:00:01.800> Nick<00:00:02.070> Pembroke<00:00:02.639> on<00:00:03.449> the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
hey guys it's Nick Pembroke on the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.210 
hey guys it's Nick Pembroke on the
screen<00:00:04.200> here<00:00:04.650> you've<00:00:05.430> got<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.879> nerf<00:00:06.210> red<00:00:06.750> dots

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
screen here you've got to nerf red dots

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.560 
screen here you've got to nerf red dots
but<00:00:08.220> this<00:00:08.340> piece<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.700> junk<00:00:08.910> doesn't<00:00:09.179> even<00:00:09.420> get

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
but this piece of junk doesn't even get

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.080 
but this piece of junk doesn't even get
close<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> what<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:11.370> delivering<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:11.969> it

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
close to what it to delivering what it

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.250 
close to what it to delivering what it
promises<00:00:12.620> it's<00:00:13.620> red<00:00:14.009> dot<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.639> more<00:00:15.480> just<00:00:15.900> I

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
promises it's red dot is more just I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.779 
promises it's red dot is more just I
don't<00:00:16.920> know<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.699> light<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:19.789> shines

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
don't know it's just a light that shines

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.970 
don't know it's just a light that shines
I<00:00:21.300> mean<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.630> not<00:00:21.990> even<00:00:22.199> close<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.439> being<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I mean it's not even close to being a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.179 
I mean it's not even close to being a
red<00:00:23.189> dot<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.869> had<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> laser<00:00:25.500> pointer<00:00:25.769> sitting

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
red dot so I had a laser pointer sitting

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.480 
red dot so I had a laser pointer sitting
around<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.720> I<00:00:27.720> decided<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.439> make<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.890> well<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
around and I decided to make a well a

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.660 
around and I decided to make a well a
real<00:00:29.970> red<00:00:30.330> Det<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:31.700> is<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:33.180> accurate<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
real red Det this is not accurate and

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.299 
real red Det this is not accurate and
the<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.210> laser<00:00:37.050> pointer<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.739> isn't<00:00:38.160> accurate

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
the the laser pointer one isn't accurate

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
the the laser pointer one isn't accurate
either<00:00:38.760> just<00:00:39.210> want<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> let<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.570> guys<00:00:39.690> know

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
either just want to let you guys know

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.290 
either just want to let you guys know
that<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.100> don't<00:00:41.340> know<00:00:41.399> if<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.579> can<00:00:41.700> see<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that but I don't know if you can see the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.930 
that but I don't know if you can see the
laser<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.960> there<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> center

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
laser in there it's right in the center

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.130 
laser in there it's right in the center
I<00:00:45.480> took<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> reflective<00:00:46.800> covering<00:00:48.140> just

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I took out the reflective covering just

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.010 
I took out the reflective covering just
to<00:00:49.200> make<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.410> more<00:00:49.530> accurate<00:00:50.840> even<00:00:51.840> though<00:00:51.930> it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
to make it more accurate even though it

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.340 
to make it more accurate even though it
won't<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.260> perfectly<00:00:52.739> accurate<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:54.260> when<00:00:55.260> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
won't be perfectly accurate but when you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
won't be perfectly accurate but when you
take<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> apart<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:56.969> thinking<00:00:57.180> about

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
take it apart if you're thinking about

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.810 
take it apart if you're thinking about
doing<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:58.520> when<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.609> open<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:01.820> you've

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
doing this when you open it up you've

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
doing this when you open it up you've
got<00:01:03.320> this<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.559> slider<00:01:05.189> thing<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.350> this

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
got this like slider thing and this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.240 
got this like slider thing and this
holds<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.040> LED<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.760> place<00:01:11.570> basically<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
holds the LED in place basically I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.690 
holds the LED in place basically I
unscrewed<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.280> circuit<00:01:15.000> board<00:01:15.240> from<00:01:16.170> this

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
unscrewed the circuit board from this

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.859 
unscrewed the circuit board from this
holding<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.790> cut<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:20.970> down<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
holding thing and cut this down and the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.270 
holding thing and cut this down and the
laser<00:01:22.110> pointer<00:01:22.560> when<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> take<00:01:22.979> out<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
laser pointer when you take out the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.460 
laser pointer when you take out the
batteries<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.030> fit<00:01:24.780> right<00:01:25.170> over<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:26.340> um<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
batteries it fit right over this um I

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.160 
batteries it fit right over this um I
didn't<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.740> don't<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> soldering<00:01:29.729> gun<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.659> I

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
didn't I don't have a soldering gun so I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.760 
didn't I don't have a soldering gun so I
use<00:01:31.799> hot<00:01:32.130> glue<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.520> make<00:01:32.759> my<00:01:32.939> connections<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
use hot glue to make my connections I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.179 
use hot glue to make my connections I
cut<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.950> wires<00:01:35.189> from<00:01:35.970> here<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:39.860> hooked<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.009> up

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
cut the wires from here and hooked it up

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
cut the wires from here and hooked it up
to<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:42.659> laser<00:01:42.869> pointer<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:45.299> black<00:01:45.600> wire<00:01:46.079> goes

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to the laser pointer the black wire goes

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.550 
to the laser pointer the black wire goes
to<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.950> spring<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.939> batteries<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
to the spring on the batteries and the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.969 
to the spring on the batteries and the
red<00:01:49.799> wire<00:01:50.040> goes<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:51.259> ground<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.619> like

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
red wire goes to ground which is like

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:59.060 
red wire goes to ground which is like
the<00:01:53.159> metal<00:01:53.490> any<00:01:54.149> metal<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:56.719> I<00:01:57.719> had<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.799> tape

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the metal any metal and I had to tape

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.480 
the metal any metal and I had to tape
the<00:01:59.310> button<00:01:59.729> down<00:01:59.939> on<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.750> laser<00:02:01.020> pointer<00:02:01.560> I

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
the button down on the laser pointer I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.480 
the button down on the laser pointer I
had<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.210> tape<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> down<00:02:03.600> shut<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.250> it'll

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
had to tape it down shut so that it'll

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.330 
had to tape it down shut so that it'll
the<00:02:05.880> switch<00:02:06.149> will<00:02:06.329> always<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:07.190> but<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the switch will always be on but the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.559 
the switch will always be on but the
real<00:02:08.520> switch<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.450> one

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
real switch is this one

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.860 
real switch is this one
this<00:02:10.719> actually<00:02:10.929> turns<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.439> the<00:02:11.590> laser<00:02:12.159> it<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.510> a

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
this actually turns on the laser it is a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.459 
this actually turns on the laser it is a
real<00:02:14.319> laser<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:16.480> if<00:02:16.599> I<00:02:16.749> move<00:02:16.930> this<00:02:17.170> really

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:17.469 
real laser and if I move this really

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.259 
real laser and if I move this really
quick<00:02:17.969> I'm<00:02:18.969> about<00:02:19.420> ten<00:02:20.200> feet<00:02:20.469> away<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.790> it'll

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
quick I'm about ten feet away but it'll

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.890 
quick I'm about ten feet away but it'll
go<00:02:22.480> it'll<00:02:22.659> go<00:02:22.989> really<00:02:23.170> far<00:02:23.560> it's<00:02:24.549> it's<00:02:24.909> a<00:02:25.299> laser

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
go it'll go really far it's it's a laser

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.530 
go it'll go really far it's it's a laser
pointer<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:29.370> going<00:02:30.370> back<00:02:30.639> to<00:02:30.879> over<00:02:31.239> here<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
pointer so going back to over here the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.800 
pointer so going back to over here the
battery<00:02:34.900> pack<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:35.590> right<00:02:36.219> here<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:37.599> is

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
battery pack is right here and this is

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.559
