someone gave me to get 75 mining in

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.560 
someone gave me to get 75 mining in
three<00:00:56.190> weeks<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> still<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.149> week

much as far as i know so i don't know
what<00:01:04.830> exactly<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> say<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
what exactly I'm going to say in this

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.300 
what exactly I'm going to say in this
video<00:01:06.720> I'll<00:01:06.840> give<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> my<00:01:07.680> goals<00:01:07.979> my

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
video I'll give you my goals my

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670

then<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.830> guess<00:01:11.010> we'll<00:01:11.159> call<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> day<00:01:12.060> but<00:01:13.130> I

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
then I guess we'll call it a day but I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
then I guess we'll call it a day but I
only<00:01:14.430> need<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.760> four<00:01:15.000> hundred<00:01:15.090> thousand

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
only need about four hundred thousand

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.539 
only need about four hundred thousand
more<00:01:15.900> experience<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.710> mining<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.369> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
more experience for mining and that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.190 
more experience for mining and that
definitely<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.390> difficult<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:19.020> get

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
definitely will not be difficult to get

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.469 
definitely will not be difficult to get
I<00:01:19.470> am<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.720> collect<00:01:21.990> them<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
am planning on making about 2500 steel

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.569 
am planning on making about 2500 steel
bars<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.020> am<00:01:28.439> getting<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.829> 5,000<00:01:29.460> coal

going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.890> 2500<00:01:32.579> iron<00:01:32.780> from

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
going to go and get 2500 iron from

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.460 
going to go and get 2500 iron from
anywhere<00:01:34.860> probably<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.360> doing<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:37.229> extra

then I'm gonna superheat all actually
i'm<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> room<00:01:44.340> craft<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.420> i

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
i'm going to room craft first and then i

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.139 
i'm going to room craft first and then i
will<00:01:45.689> superheat<00:01:46.200> item<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.460> create<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.119> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
will superheat item to create all of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
will superheat item to create all of
those<00:01:48.329> steel<00:01:48.540> bars<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.960> let<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.649> tie
