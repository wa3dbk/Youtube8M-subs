00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.319 
and a half to five minutes each side on
that<00:01:48.380> medium<00:01:49.380> heat<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.250> we're<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> be

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that medium heat now we're going to be

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630 
that medium heat now we're going to be
placing<00:01:51.869> in<00:01:52.020> our<00:01:52.290> eggs<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.159> just<00:01:53.369> straight

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
placing in our eggs so just straight

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.670 
placing in our eggs so just straight
into<00:01:53.880> middle<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.329> easier<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> from

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
into middle it's easier to do this from

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.580 
into middle it's easier to do this from
a<00:01:55.799> bowl<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.520> pop<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.820> straight<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.590> don't

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
a bowl just pop it straight in don't

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.800 
a bowl just pop it straight in don't
worry<00:01:58.740> about<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.070> side<00:01:59.759> goes<00:02:00.030> over<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> top<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
worry about if side goes over the top it

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
worry about if side goes over the top it
doesn't<00:02:01.259> matter<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.590> we're<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:01.890> going

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
doesn't matter because we're not going

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.010 
doesn't matter because we're not going
to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.219> using<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.700> anyway<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.630> basically

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
to be using that anyway but basically

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.330 
to be using that anyway but basically
what's<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.439> happen<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> middle<00:02:05.159> now

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
what's going to happen in the middle now

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.150 
what's going to happen in the middle now
is<00:02:05.579> that's<00:02:05.850> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.329> cook<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:07.740> we're<00:02:08.039> going

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
is that's going to cook and we're going

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.559

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
to leave it there for that for another

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.910 
to leave it there for that for another
four<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.170> five<00:02:10.410> minutes

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
four to five minutes
