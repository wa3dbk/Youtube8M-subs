00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
was really smart covered all of his uh

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.860 
was really smart covered all of his uh
all<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.549> tk's<00:03:43.120> options<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.659> he<00:03:43.719> actually

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
all of tk's options and he actually

all of tk's options and he actually
short<00:03:44.290> hopped<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:44.950> think<00:03:45.159> into<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.640> one<00:03:45.849> the

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
short hopped I think into that one the

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:49.319 
short hopped I think into that one the
Phe<00:03:46.750> can<00:03:46.900> do<00:03:46.959> more<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.230> that<00:03:48.060> it's<00:03:49.060> got<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.269> be

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
Phe can do more of that it's got to be

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:50.699 
Phe can do more of that it's got to be
more<00:03:49.480> careful<00:03:49.540> about<00:03:49.930> that<00:03:50.049> well<00:03:50.319> maybe<00:03:50.530> not

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
more careful about that well maybe not

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.300 
more careful about that well maybe not
if<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.760> joints<00:03:52.030> gonna<00:03:52.180> hope<00:03:52.420> that's<00:03:52.689> yeah

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
if that joints gonna hope that's yeah

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.399 
if that joints gonna hope that's yeah

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
off though I was very unfortunate but

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.699 
off though I was very unfortunate but
he's<00:04:16.959> trying<00:04:17.109> to<00:04:17.199> get<00:04:17.289> him<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.560> near

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
he's trying to get him with the near

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.259 
he's trying to get him with the near
there<00:04:17.949> so<00:04:18.099> he<00:04:18.160> can<00:04:18.310> get<00:04:18.400> him<00:04:18.519> into<00:04:18.699> a<00:04:18.729> combo<00:04:19.120> but

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
there so he can get him into a combo but

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.509 
there so he can get him into a combo but
instead<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.139> uh<00:04:20.380> that<00:04:20.769> charged

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
instead that that uh that charged

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.850 
instead that that uh that charged
neutral<00:04:22.240> v<00:04:22.419> did<00:04:22.720> 18<00:04:23.199> when<00:04:23.470> he<00:04:23.500> was<00:04:23.680> deep

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
neutral v did 18 when he was deep

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.820 
neutral v did 18 when he was deep
breathing<00:04:24.190> it<00:04:24.759> only<00:04:24.970> said<00:04:25.210> 16<00:04:25.840> when<00:04:26.320> he<00:04:26.349> wasn't

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
breathing it only said 16 when he wasn't

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.189 
breathing it only said 16 when he wasn't
so<00:04:27.070> that's<00:04:27.610> weird<00:04:27.849> it's<00:04:28.660> not<00:04:28.750> much<00:04:28.930> more

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
so that's weird it's not much more

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.870 
so that's weird it's not much more
damage<00:04:29.560> you<00:04:29.889> can<00:04:30.009> deep<00:04:30.220> breathe<00:04:30.460> multiple

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
damage you can deep breathe multiple

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.969 
damage you can deep breathe multiple
times<00:04:31.090> alright<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:31.630> can<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:31.870> keep<00:04:32.199> deep

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
times alright so you can just keep deep

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.050 
times alright so you can just keep deep
breathing<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.400> being<00:04:33.580> stronger<00:04:33.970> and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
breathing and being stronger and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.520 
breathing and being stronger and
stronger<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.539> don't<00:04:34.720> know<00:04:34.810> actually<00:04:35.020> I've

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
stronger I don't know actually I've

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.070 
stronger I don't know actually I've
never<00:04:35.770> tried<00:04:36.099> I<00:04:36.400> think<00:04:36.639> you<00:04:36.729> can<00:04:36.910> cuz<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.810> next

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
never tried I think you can cuz the next

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.810 
never tried I think you can cuz the next
charge<00:04:38.349> after<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.830> initial<00:04:39.070> one<00:04:39.280> is<00:04:39.490> takes

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
charge after the initial one is takes

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
charge after the initial one is takes
longer<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.750> saw<00:04:41.080> maybe<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:43.240> might<00:04:43.360> be<00:04:43.510> it<00:04:43.659> I

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
longer so I saw maybe that might be it I

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.450 
longer so I saw maybe that might be it I
don't<00:04:44.260> think<00:04:44.409> we'll<00:04:44.470> ever<00:04:44.530> see<00:04:44.919> somebody<00:04:45.190> to

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
don't think we'll ever see somebody to

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.189 
don't think we'll ever see somebody to
two<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.880> two<00:04:46.479> they<00:04:46.690> would<00:04:46.780> have<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.930> be<00:04:47.020> left

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.760 
two of two they would have to be left
alone<00:04:47.320> for<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.800> long<00:04:48.010> time<00:04:48.930> going<00:04:49.930> really<00:04:50.139> low<00:04:50.470> I

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
alone for a long time going really low I

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.860 
alone for a long time going really low I
was<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.039> kind<00:04:51.610> of<00:04:51.639> scary<00:04:51.909> it<00:04:52.300> was<00:04:52.449> scary<00:04:52.599> I

rules vary and any % that TK puts on him

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.870 
rules vary and any % that TK puts on him
it's<00:05:05.830> gonna<00:05:05.919> be<00:05:06.099> percent<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.520> he's<00:05:06.669> going<00:05:06.819> to

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
it's gonna be percent that he's going to

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.730 
it's gonna be percent that he's going to
regret<00:05:07.030> he's<00:05:07.840> got<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:07.960> be<00:05:08.050> really<00:05:08.319> careful<00:05:08.349> how

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
regret he's got to be really careful how

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.890 
regret he's got to be really careful how
he<00:05:08.770> approaches<00:05:09.130> this<00:05:09.370> length<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:09.910> feel<00:05:10.690> like<00:05:10.750> if

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
he approaches this length I feel like if

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.210 
he approaches this length I feel like if
he<00:05:10.960> just<00:05:10.990> sits<00:05:11.199> back<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:11.530> shoots<00:05:11.860> those<00:05:12.009> Sun

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
he just sits back and shoots those Sun

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.360 
he just sits back and shoots those Sun
Salutations<00:05:12.789> he<00:05:12.880> should<00:05:13.060> be<00:05:13.150> okay<00:05:14.190> but<00:05:15.190> dash

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
Salutations he should be okay but dash

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.370 
Salutations he should be okay but dash
tach<00:05:15.580> barely<00:05:16.000> missed<00:05:16.210> yeah<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:17.259> probably

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
tach barely missed yeah that probably

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.480 
tach barely missed yeah that probably
that<00:05:17.650> that<00:05:18.160> would<00:05:18.430> have<00:05:18.520> ended<00:05:18.789> it<00:05:19.120> had<00:05:20.490> all

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
that that would have ended it had all

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.059 
that that would have ended it had all
right<00:05:21.639> just<00:05:21.940> guess<00:05:22.780> he<00:05:22.900> tried<00:05:23.020> to<00:05:23.110> get<00:05:23.919> him

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
right just guess he tried to get him

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.899 
right just guess he tried to get him

projectile<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.199> I'm<00:05:35.530> not<00:05:35.710> surprised<00:05:36.159> that

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
projectile so I'm not surprised that

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.499 
projectile so I'm not surprised that
they're<00:05:36.430> kind<00:05:36.610> of<00:05:36.639> just<00:05:36.819> sitting<00:05:37.060> back<00:05:37.150> TK

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
they're kind of just sitting back TK
