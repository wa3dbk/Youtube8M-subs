really weird catching a catfish with the
plastic<00:01:38.820> warm<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> rapids<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.259> really

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
plastic warm in the rapids is really

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.920 
plastic warm in the rapids is really
mind-boggling<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:41.970> he<00:01:42.270> put<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> really<00:01:42.689> big

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
mind-boggling but he put up a really big

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.039 
mind-boggling but he put up a really big
fight<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.790> how<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> how<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> get<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.630> footage<00:01:45.840> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
fight and how I how I get this footage I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.450 
fight and how I how I get this footage I
had<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.290> little<00:01:46.470> remote<00:01:46.829> on<00:01:46.950> my<00:01:47.040> hand<00:01:47.280> where

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
had this little remote on my hand where

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
had this little remote on my hand where
I<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.820> push<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.060> remote<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.049> set

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
I would push the remote like I would set

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.080 
I would push the remote like I would set
the<00:01:49.380> hook<00:01:49.470> catch<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> fish<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:50.850> would

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the hook catch the fish and then I would

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.450 
the hook catch the fish and then I would
press<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> remote<00:01:52.229> thing<00:01:52.590> record<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> battle

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
press the remote thing record the battle

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.469 
press the remote thing record the battle
and<00:01:53.549> that's<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> guys<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.119> seeing<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and that's what you guys are seeing the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.910 
and that's what you guys are seeing the
fish<00:01:54.899> fight<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.680> miss<00:01:55.799> about

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
fish fight you actually miss about

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
fish fight you actually miss about
probably<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.640> 45<00:01:56.880> seconds<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.509> go<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.780> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
probably like 45 seconds I go all the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.810 
probably like 45 seconds I go all the
way<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> rapids<00:01:58.350> before<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.130> actually

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
way down the rapids before I actually

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.389 
way down the rapids before I actually
turned<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:00.750> GoPro<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.350> he<00:02:01.950> snapped<00:02:02.219> off

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
turned on my GoPro and he snapped off

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.830 
turned on my GoPro and he snapped off
right<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:02.969> here's<00:02:03.119> another<00:02:03.210> fish<00:02:03.659> this

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
right there and here's another fish this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.270 
right there and here's another fish this
was<00:02:03.990> probably<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> biggest<00:02:04.530> bass<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> day

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
was probably the biggest bass of the day

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
was probably the biggest bass of the day
that<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.490> caught<00:02:05.820> he<00:02:06.659> put<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.990> really<00:02:07.170> good

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that I caught he put up a really good

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.690 
that I caught he put up a really good
fight<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.829> guys<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.160> tell<00:02:08.369> he's<00:02:08.520> going

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
fight as you guys can tell he's going

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.880 
fight as you guys can tell he's going
crazy<00:02:10.129> but<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:11.640> bed

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
crazy but the one bed

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.140 
crazy but the one bed
thing<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.130> didn't<00:02:12.310> have<00:02:12.430> my<00:02:12.520> GoPro<00:02:12.880> I<00:02:12.940> didn't

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
thing I didn't have my GoPro I didn't

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.400 
thing I didn't have my GoPro I didn't
have<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.360> tilted<00:02:13.660> down<00:02:13.840> more<00:02:14.020> show<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.290> guys

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
have it tilted down more show you guys

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.320 
have it tilted down more show you guys
can't<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:14.890> see<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.160> fish<00:02:15.400> but<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.120> think

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
can't really see the fish but I think

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.480 
can't really see the fish but I think
right<00:02:16.600> here<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:16.959> bass<00:02:17.470> might<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.100> two<00:02:18.280> pounds

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
right here this bass might be two pounds

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.610 
right here this bass might be two pounds
i'm<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:18.910> too<00:02:19.060> sure<00:02:19.090> he's<00:02:19.420> pretty<00:02:19.810> pretty<00:02:20.440> good

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
i'm not too sure he's pretty pretty good

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440 
i'm not too sure he's pretty pretty good
size<00:02:20.830> in<00:02:21.040> my<00:02:21.160> opinion<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:22.060> i<00:02:22.180> said<00:02:22.240> the
