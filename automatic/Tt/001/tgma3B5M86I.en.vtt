00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
here we go now we're going to set the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.220 
here we go now we're going to set the
phone<00:02:34.209> down<00:02:34.239> let<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.019> do<00:02:35.200> its<00:02:35.230> thing<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:40.230> this

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
phone down let it do its thing and this

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.250 
phone down let it do its thing and this
is<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.620> we're<00:02:42.489> changing<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.180> an<00:02:43.360> iPad<00:02:43.720> baseband

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
is it we're changing to an iPad baseband

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.430 
is it we're changing to an iPad baseband
this<00:02:45.129> part<00:02:45.430> may<00:02:46.150> take<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> little<00:02:46.629> while<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:47.200> mean

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
this part may take a little while I mean

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.289 
this part may take a little while I mean
five<00:02:47.799> ten<00:02:48.160> minutes<00:02:48.489> tops<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:48.970> hopefully<00:02:49.269> I

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
five ten minutes tops so hopefully I

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.539 
five ten minutes tops so hopefully I
have<00:02:49.480> enough<00:02:49.510> video<00:02:49.810> time<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:51.340> show<00:02:51.489> you

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
have enough video time to to show you

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.479 
have enough video time to to show you
the<00:02:51.700> whole<00:02:51.879> thing<00:02:51.909> and<00:02:52.920> what<00:02:53.920> exactly<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
the whole thing and what exactly the

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.210 
the whole thing and what exactly the
iPhone<00:02:54.910> will<00:02:55.060> be<00:02:55.150> doing<00:02:55.709> after<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:56.829> is<00:02:57.010> done

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
iPhone will be doing after this is done

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.640 
iPhone will be doing after this is done
here<00:02:57.519> I<00:02:57.810> mean<00:02:58.810> it's<00:02:58.900> basically<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.349> like

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
here I mean it's basically just like

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.229 
here I mean it's basically just like
jailbreaking<00:03:00.250> except<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:00.849> you're<00:03:01.030> just

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.089 
jailbreaking except for you're just
changing<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.430> baseband<00:03:04.470> ok<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:05.799> here<00:03:06.010> we're

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
changing the baseband ok so here we're

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.110 
changing the baseband ok so here we're
going<00:03:06.129> to<00:03:06.370> show<00:03:06.459> you<00:03:06.549> all<00:03:06.700> what<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.910> phone's

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
normally you see during the jailbreak

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.879 
normally you see during the jailbreak
process<00:03:25.349> ok<00:03:26.349> so<00:03:26.769> it's<00:03:26.919> doing<00:03:27.549> this<00:03:27.669> thing

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
the reason why we're changing the

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.589 
the reason why we're changing the
baseband<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.280> for<00:03:48.280> unlocking<00:03:49.000> purposes

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
baseband is for unlocking purposes

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.750 
baseband is for unlocking purposes
there's<00:03:49.870> there<00:03:50.230> are<00:03:50.380> some<00:03:50.829> base<00:03:51.220> bands<00:03:51.549> that

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
there's there are some base bands that

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.110 
there's there are some base bands that
are<00:03:51.790> not<00:03:52.120> supported<00:03:52.690> by<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.840> ultra<00:03:53.410> snow

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
are not supported by the ultra snow

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.150 
are not supported by the ultra snow
software<00:03:55.120> through<00:03:55.329> Cydia<00:03:55.859> so<00:03:56.859> you<00:03:56.950> will<00:03:57.040> have

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
software through Cydia so you will have

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.559 
software through Cydia so you will have
to<00:03:57.280> change<00:03:57.579> it<00:03:57.730> through<00:03:57.910> red<00:03:58.150> snow

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.410 

let's<00:04:02.870> see<00:04:03.080> replacing<00:04:03.890> kernel<00:04:04.159> effects<00:04:04.760> it's

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
let's see replacing kernel effects it's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.229 
let's see replacing kernel effects it's
on<00:04:05.629> its<00:04:05.810> way<00:04:05.870> and<00:04:06.860> then<00:04:07.459> after<00:04:07.640> we're<00:04:07.909> done<00:04:08.060> I'm

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
going to show y'all what it now says in

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.500 
going to show y'all what it now says in
the<00:04:12.069> in<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.220> settings<00:04:13.610> portion<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.360> can

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
the in the settings portion so you can

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.870 
the in the settings portion so you can
see<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.870> it's<00:04:15.019> actually<00:04:15.260> been<00:04:15.709> changed<00:04:16.040> to

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
see that it's actually been changed to

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.060 
see that it's actually been changed to
an<00:04:17.299> iPad<00:04:17.660> baseband<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.320> then<00:04:18.470> I'm<00:04:18.590> going<00:04:18.889> to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
an iPad baseband and then I'm going to

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.939 
an iPad baseband and then I'm going to
run<00:04:19.489> an<00:04:19.549> ultra<00:04:19.880> snow<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.900> finish<00:04:21.350> the<00:04:21.530> unlock

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
run an ultra snow to finish the unlock

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:25.689 
run an ultra snow to finish the unlock
on<00:04:22.280> this<00:04:22.610> phone<00:04:22.850> and<00:04:23.199> again<00:04:24.199> this<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.530> a<00:04:24.699> Apple
