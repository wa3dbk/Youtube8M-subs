have been doing various experiments on
my<00:00:08.760> test<00:00:09.450> world<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.960> my<00:00:10.650> latest<00:00:10.920> one<00:00:11.309> was<00:00:11.630> a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
my test world and my latest one was a

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.269 
my test world and my latest one was a
new<00:00:12.870> design<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.889> mob<00:00:14.130> system<00:00:14.780> and<00:00:16.279> let's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
new design for a mob system and let's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:27.259 
new design for a mob system and let's
have<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> look<00:00:21.289> it's<00:00:22.580> quite<00:00:23.580> big<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:26.269> very

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
have a look it's quite big but very

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
have a look it's quite big but very
simple<00:00:27.930> design<00:00:28.550> very<00:00:29.550> clean<00:00:30.289> is<00:00:31.910> very

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
simple design very clean is very

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.389 
simple design very clean is very
low-tech<00:00:33.590> no<00:00:34.590> Pistons<00:00:35.930> literally<00:00:36.930> just

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
low-tech no Pistons literally just

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.280 
low-tech no Pistons literally just
blocks<00:00:38.870> signs<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.860> some<00:00:41.040> ladders<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.510> that

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
blocks signs and some ladders and that

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.180 
blocks signs and some ladders and that
is<00:00:43.590> basically<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:46.010> these<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.190> my<00:00:47.219> spawn<00:00:47.670> pats

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
is basically it these are my spawn pats

is basically it these are my spawn pats
one<00:00:50.190> white<00:00:50.780> weird<00:00:51.780> science<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.340> mobs

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
one white weird science so that the mobs

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.580 
one white weird science so that the mobs
take<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> stroll<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.949> stair<00:00:56.399> cases<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
take a stroll down the stair cases the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.150 
take a stroll down the stair cases the
point<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.190> whole<00:00:59.460> setup<00:00:59.879> was<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:01.920> bring

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
point of this whole setup was to bring

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.920 
point of this whole setup was to bring
mobs<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.300> ground<00:01:03.570> level<00:01:05.330> from<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.420> sky<00:01:06.630> trap

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
mobs to ground level from a sky trap

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.620 
mobs to ground level from a sky trap
without<00:01:07.320> them<00:01:07.740> taking<00:01:08.159> any<00:01:08.549> damage<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
without them taking any damage on the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.940 
without them taking any damage on the
way<00:01:10.070> so<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.640> never<00:01:11.850> drop<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.479> than<00:01:12.950> two

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
way so they never drop more than two

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.850 
way so they never drop more than two
blocks<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.549> height<00:01:15.259> now<00:01:16.259> when<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.680> down

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
blocks in height now when they get down

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.960 
blocks in height now when they get down
to<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.280> section<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.450> middle<00:01:19.580> they<00:01:20.580> drop

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
to this section in the middle they drop

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
to this section in the middle they drop
down<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.689> whole<00:01:22.560> series<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.130> ladders<00:01:25.040> to<00:01:26.040> give

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
down a whole series of ladders to give

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.289 
down a whole series of ladders to give
them<00:01:26.369> safe<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.320> fall<00:01:28.650> slowly<00:01:29.299> down

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
them safe for so they fall slowly down

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.170 
them safe for so they fall slowly down
to<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> bottom<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.340> then<00:01:32.340> on<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> sides<00:01:32.880> here

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
to the bottom and then on the sides here

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.780 
to the bottom and then on the sides here
the<00:01:36.180> same<00:01:36.420> thing<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:37.619> dropped<00:01:37.950> two<00:01:38.220> steps<00:01:38.549> at

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the same thing they dropped two steps at

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.149 
the same thing they dropped two steps at
a<00:01:38.820> time

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
a time

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.739 
a time
little<00:01:40.700> signs<00:01:40.999> to<00:01:41.329> encourage<00:01:41.810> them<00:01:42.049> and

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
little signs to encourage them and

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:48.609 
little signs to encourage them and
eventually<00:01:44.749> they<00:01:45.200> make<00:01:45.409> it<00:01:45.560> down<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:46.069> three<00:01:47.619> by

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
eventually they make it down to three by

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.690 
eventually they make it down to three by
two<00:01:50.020> exit<00:01:51.020> hole<00:01:52.869> down<00:01:53.869> here<00:01:54.399> right<00:01:55.399> now<00:01:55.549> I've

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
two exit hole down here right now I've

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.190 
two exit hole down here right now I've
got<00:01:55.969> the<00:01:56.420> non<00:01:57.189> endermen<00:01:58.509> walking<00:01:59.509> into<00:01:59.689> a<00:01:59.869> lava

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
got the non endermen walking into a lava

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.219 
got the non endermen walking into a lava
pit<00:02:00.640> just<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.969> keep<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.929> spawns<00:02:03.259> guide<00:02:03.619> and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
pit just to keep the spawns guide and

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.979 
pit just to keep the spawns guide and
right<00:02:06.229> now<00:02:06.439> I'm<00:02:06.649> sparing<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.640> end<00:02:07.789> iment<00:02:08.119> it's

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
right now I'm sparing the end iment it's

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.080 
right now I'm sparing the end iment it's
just<00:02:09.170> one<00:02:09.319> of<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> methods<00:02:09.679> of<00:02:10.009> separation<00:02:10.700> by

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
just one of the methods of separation by

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.729 
just one of the methods of separation by
using<00:02:11.330> their<00:02:11.629> height<00:02:11.900> they<00:02:12.200> can't<00:02:12.470> fall

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
using their height they can't fall

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.990 
using their height they can't fall
through<00:02:13.099> because<00:02:13.280> it's<00:02:13.640> sunny<00:02:13.849> too<00:02:14.780> high

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
through because it's sunny too high

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.390 
through because it's sunny too high
anyway<00:02:17.769> after<00:02:18.769> talking<00:02:19.010> with<00:02:19.280> red<00:02:20.239> eyes<00:02:20.269> and

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
anyway after talking with red eyes and

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.750 
anyway after talking with red eyes and
seeing<00:02:22.400> his<00:02:22.700> set<00:02:23.690> up<00:02:23.840> where<00:02:24.140> he<00:02:24.349> was<00:02:24.670> doing<00:02:25.670> a

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
seeing his set up where he was doing a

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.910 
seeing his set up where he was doing a
separation<00:02:26.360> system<00:02:26.810> based<00:02:27.110> on<00:02:27.349> mob<00:02:27.650> health

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
separation system based on mob health

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.869 
separation system based on mob health
one<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.549> things<00:02:28.730> he<00:02:28.910> mentioned<00:02:29.360> was<00:02:29.629> the

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
one of the things he mentioned was the

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.000 
one of the things he mentioned was the
unpredictability<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:32.150> full<00:02:32.660> damage<00:02:33.079> and<00:02:33.349> how

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
unpredictability of full damage and how

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.729 
unpredictability of full damage and how
different<00:02:34.489> mobs<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.319> suffered<00:02:36.319> different

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
different mobs have suffered different

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.890 
different mobs have suffered different
amounts<00:02:37.129> of<00:02:37.250> full<00:02:37.489> damage<00:02:37.879> after<00:02:38.239> coming<00:02:38.780> out

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
amounts of full damage after coming out

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.729 
amounts of full damage after coming out
of<00:02:38.959> his<00:02:39.170> mob<00:02:39.470> trap<00:02:40.420> so<00:02:42.129> this<00:02:43.540> basically

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
of his mob trap so this basically

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.620 
of his mob trap so this basically
negates<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:46.840> problem<00:02:47.840> completely<00:02:48.319> because

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
negates that problem completely because

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.940 
negates that problem completely because
none<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.660> these<00:02:50.900> guys<00:02:51.170> are<00:02:51.200> taking<00:02:51.739> damage

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
none of these guys are taking damage

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.349 
none of these guys are taking damage
from<00:02:53.739> all<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.859> way<00:02:54.950> at<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.099> top<00:02:55.160> down<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.239> the

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
from all the way at the top down to the

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.699 
from all the way at the top down to the
bottom<00:02:56.769> not<00:02:57.769> even<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.280> half<00:02:58.579> a<00:02:58.819> heart<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.530> once

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
bottom not even a half a heart so once

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.140 
bottom not even a half a heart so once
you<00:03:00.829> get<00:03:00.950> them<00:03:01.099> down<00:03:01.250> here<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.639> can<00:03:01.849> do<00:03:02.000> with

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
you get them down here you can do with

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.849 
you get them down here you can do with
them<00:03:02.329> as<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:02.569> will<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.910> can<00:03:05.500> split<00:03:06.500> them<00:03:06.680> off

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
them as you will you can split them off
