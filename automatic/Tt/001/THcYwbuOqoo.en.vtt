that<00:00:54.930> your<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.649> style<00:00:55.920> has<00:00:56.309> changed<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that your your style has changed a

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.590 
that your your style has changed a
little<00:00:57.000> bit<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> years<00:00:59.449> you<00:01:00.449> know<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
little bit over the years you know I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.770 
little bit over the years you know I
guess<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:02.359> kind<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> stay

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
guess that's because kind of to stay

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.710 
guess that's because kind of to stay
true<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.559> know<00:01:04.680> let<00:01:05.309> me<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.720> paraphrase

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
true you know let me just paraphrase

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.580 
true you know let me just paraphrase
what<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.470> said<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:10.049> stay<00:01:10.229> true<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
what you just said to to stay true to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.620 
what you just said to to stay true to
yourself<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.420> know<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
yourself you have to have you know you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.719 
yourself you have to have you know you
have<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> find<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.619> style<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.340> really

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
have to find that style that really

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
have to find that style that really
reflects<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.540> as<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> person<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.740> guess<00:01:16.920> as

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
reflects you as a person and I guess as

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.539 
reflects you as a person and I guess as
you<00:01:17.369> grow<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.170> over<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you grow in you know over time you

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.060 
you grow in you know over time you
change<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> person<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.960> therefore<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.799> art

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
change as a person so therefore your art

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.810 
change as a person so therefore your art
would<00:01:23.310> evolve<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.780> true<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.369> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
would evolve is that true I think so you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.630 
would evolve is that true I think so you
know<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.330> think<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:28.920> sure<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
know I think that's it I'm sure the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
know I think that's it I'm sure the
people<00:01:29.820> who<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.420> say<00:01:30.659> oh<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> used<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.500> like

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
