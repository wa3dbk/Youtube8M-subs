and<00:00:20.839> 994<00:00:21.320> being<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:21.619> largest<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.220> then<00:00:22.400> you

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
and 994 being the largest and then you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.900 
and 994 being the largest and then you
have<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:22.869> 990<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:23.900> then<00:00:24.199> the<00:00:24.439> 988<00:00:25.130> on<00:00:25.339> the

one<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> biggest<00:00:44.879> machines<00:00:45.359> I've<00:00:45.510> been

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
one of the biggest machines I've been

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.530

around

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:01:00.350 

at<00:00:51.540> the<00:00:51.629> comparison<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.260> that's<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.770> d-10<00:00:59.360> so

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
at the comparison and that's a d-10 so

is just the plate that probably just

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.960 
is just the plate that probably just
