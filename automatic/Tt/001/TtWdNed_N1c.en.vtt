take a look at the dock itself so this

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.280 
take a look at the dock itself so this
is<00:02:44.459> what<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.700> looks<00:02:44.910> like<00:02:45.120> still<00:02:45.959> wrapped<00:02:46.140> in

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
is what it looks like still wrapped in

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:19.400 
is what it looks like still wrapped in
plastic<00:02:49.340> take<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.489> off<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:18.600> here<00:03:18.900> we<00:03:19.109> have

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
plastic take that off so here we have

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.849 
plastic take that off so here we have
the<00:03:19.799> actual<00:03:20.160> 30-pin<00:03:21.150> dock<00:03:21.180> connector<00:03:21.859> let's
