00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
in or out of doors so how does it all

in or out of doors so how does it all
come<00:01:10.140> together<00:01:10.320> like<00:01:10.920> this<00:01:11.240> pretty<00:01:12.240> sweet<00:01:12.510> as

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
come together like this pretty sweet as

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510

long as you don't walk into any walls I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.090 
long as you don't walk into any walls I
guess<00:01:14.700> ok<00:01:15.689> maybe<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.080> just<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.409> little<00:01:16.439> goofy

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
