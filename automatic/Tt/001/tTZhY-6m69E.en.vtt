your own winter wonderland now what
we're<00:00:10.050> going<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.769> by<00:00:10.980> using<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.550> sharp

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
we're going to do is by using a sharp

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.959 
we're going to do is by using a sharp
paring<00:00:12.540> knife<00:00:12.870> and<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.650> spoon<00:00:13.860> we're<00:00:14.700> going<00:00:14.730> to

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
paring knife and a spoon we're going to

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.910 
paring knife and a spoon we're going to
make<00:00:15.150> various<00:00:15.570> marks<00:00:16.020> in<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.500> cookie<00:00:16.770> dough

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
make various marks in the cookie dough

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.250 
make various marks in the cookie dough
to<00:00:17.490> show<00:00:17.699> different<00:00:18.150> textures<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
to show different textures so this is a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.810 
to show different textures so this is a
really<00:00:19.560> cool<00:00:19.740> way<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.160> making<00:00:20.490> it<00:00:20.580> look<00:00:20.609> as

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
really cool way of making it look as

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
really cool way of making it look as
though<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.119> house<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.630> made<00:00:22.260> out<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.590> brick

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
though your house is made out of brick

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.269 
though your house is made out of brick
or<00:00:23.279> wood<00:00:24.090> something<00:00:25.050> different<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:26.189> will

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
or wood something different that will

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.570 
or wood something different that will
give<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.699> lot<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.289> interest<00:00:28.369> visually<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
give it a lot of interest visually and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970 
give it a lot of interest visually and
it's<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.810> look<00:00:30.929> really<00:00:31.410> neat<00:00:31.619> so

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it's just going to look really neat so

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.160 
it's just going to look really neat so
what<00:00:32.250> you're<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:33.110> actually<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
what you're going to do actually the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.560 
what you're going to do actually the
first<00:00:34.320> thing<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.040> take<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.270> roof

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
first thing you can do is take the roof

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.069 
first thing you can do is take the roof
and<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.860> can<00:00:38.370> make<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> tiled<00:00:39.480> look<00:00:39.809> by

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and you can make it have a tiled look by

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
and you can make it have a tiled look by
taking<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> bowl<00:00:40.710> of<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.950> spoon<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.550> you're

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
taking the bowl of a spoon and you're

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.819 
taking the bowl of a spoon and you're
going<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> gently<00:00:43.110> press<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:44.570> the<00:00:45.570> edge<00:00:45.829> just

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
going to gently press in the edge just

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.150 
going to gently press in the edge just
like<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> keep<00:00:49.890> doing

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
like this and you're going to keep doing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.400 
like this and you're going to keep doing
it<00:00:50.629> throughout<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.809> entire<00:00:52.110> roof<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.170> it

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
it throughout the entire roof so that it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.630 
it throughout the entire roof so that it
looks<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.680> you've<00:00:55.980> got<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.670> tiles<00:00:58.640> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
looks like you've got little tiles that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.200 
looks like you've got little tiles that
are<00:00:59.699> making<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:01.260> structure<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.309> roof<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
are making the structure of the roof and

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.280 
are making the structure of the roof and
you<00:01:03.619> want<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.680> do<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:04.979> an<00:01:05.070> offset<00:01:05.489> pattern

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
you want to do it in an offset pattern

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.240 
you want to do it in an offset pattern
so<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.040> though<00:01:08.159> they're

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so that they look as though they're

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.390 
so that they look as though they're
overlapping<00:01:09.260> just<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
overlapping just as you would have on a

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.109 
overlapping just as you would have on a
house<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> another<00:01:14.250> technique<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.970> can

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
house so another technique that you can

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.370 
house so another technique that you can
do<00:01:15.830> do<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> go<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> your<00:01:18.600> wall

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
do do you want to go to one of your wall

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.490 
do do you want to go to one of your wall
pieces<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.540> you're<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.990> carefully

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
pieces and you're going to carefully

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
pieces and you're going to carefully
score<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> edge<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.280> knife<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:27.060> when

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
score the edge with the knife now when

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.319 
score the edge with the knife now when
you're<00:01:27.570> cutting<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.710> all<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:30.180> do

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
you're cutting in all of these you do

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.950 
you're cutting in all of these you do
not<00:01:30.450> ever<00:01:30.720> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.439> all<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.799> way<00:01:32.040> through

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
not ever want to go all the way through

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.249 
not ever want to go all the way through
you're<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.140> lightly<00:01:34.560> scoring<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.520> top<00:01:36.259> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you're just lightly scoring the top so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.719 
you're just lightly scoring the top so
that<00:01:37.439> when<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> bakes

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
that when it bakes

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.359 
that when it bakes
and<00:01:40.539> get<00:01:40.659> those<00:01:40.810> lines<00:01:41.110> so<00:01:41.619> then<00:01:41.829> for<00:01:42.070> this<00:01:42.159> one

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
and get those lines so then for this one

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.139 
and get those lines so then for this one
we're<00:01:42.579> going<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.820> do<00:01:43.229> Prix<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.610> also<00:01:45.789> want

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
we're going to do Prix and you also want

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.319 
we're going to do Prix and you also want
to<00:01:46.180> have<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.539> offset<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:48.969> looks<00:01:49.149> as

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
to have it offset so that it looks as

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.740 
to have it offset so that it looks as
though<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.570> bricks<00:01:49.780> are<00:01:51.179> stacked<00:01:52.179> on<00:01:52.479> top<00:01:52.509> of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
though the bricks are stacked on top of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.460 
though the bricks are stacked on top of
each<00:01:52.990> other<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:54.729> another<00:01:55.090> thing<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:56.259> you

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
each other now another thing that you

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.980 
each other now another thing that you
can<00:01:56.679> do<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:58.060> make<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.329> look<00:01:58.450> as<00:01:58.720> though<00:01:58.840> your

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
can do is make it look as though your

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.050 
can do is make it look as though your
house<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.319> made<00:01:59.500> out<00:01:59.530> of<00:01:59.740> wood<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.220> for<00:02:00.909> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
house is made out of wood and for that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.330 
house is made out of wood and for that
it's<00:02:01.299> going<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.539> be<00:02:01.689> similar<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.530> your<00:02:03.100> brick

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
it's going to be similar to your brick

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.270 
it's going to be similar to your brick
effect<00:02:04.500> except<00:02:05.500> you're<00:02:05.649> going<00:02:05.679> to<00:02:05.890> be<00:02:05.979> going

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
effect except you're going to be going

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.990 
effect except you're going to be going
up<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.939> down<00:02:09.149> instead<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.330> from<00:02:10.569> side<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.019> side

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
up and down instead of from side to side

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.009 
up and down instead of from side to side
so<00:02:13.000> you're<00:02:13.150> going<00:02:13.299> to<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:14.010> lengthwise<00:02:15.010> lines

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
so you're going to have lengthwise lines

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.220 
so you're going to have lengthwise lines
cut<00:02:17.019> into<00:02:17.410> your<00:02:17.530> dough<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.450> then<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.690> make<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
cut into your dough and then to make the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.460 
cut into your dough and then to make the
wood<00:02:21.040> ends<00:02:21.870> you're<00:02:22.870> just<00:02:23.049> going<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.319> do<00:02:23.440> a

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
wood ends you're just going to do a

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.460 
wood ends you're just going to do a
random<00:02:23.680> length<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.840> don't<00:02:26.019> want<00:02:26.140> them<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.380> be

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
random length you don't want them to be

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.270 
random length you don't want them to be
too<00:02:26.650> perfect

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
too perfect

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160 
too perfect
and<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.090> don't<00:02:28.269> want<00:02:28.390> them<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:28.720> match<00:02:28.900> up

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
and you don't want them to match up

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.039 
and you don't want them to match up
either<00:02:29.500> because<00:02:30.130> like<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.430> know<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.819> house<00:02:31.630> if

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
being used it's going to be at odd ends

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.390 
being used it's going to be at odd ends
they're<00:02:44.500> not<00:02:44.620> going<00:02:44.829> to<00:02:44.889> be<00:02:45.010> perfectly

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
they're not going to be perfectly

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.420 
they're not going to be perfectly
aligned<00:02:45.760> with<00:02:45.850> one<00:02:46.090> another<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.100> these<00:02:48.250> are

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
aligned with one another so these are

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.699 
aligned with one another so these are
just<00:02:48.519> some<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.030> cool<00:02:49.870> ideas<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.560> can
