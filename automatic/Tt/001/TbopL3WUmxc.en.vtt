phones here and I just wanted to give

phones here and I just wanted to give
you<00:00:53.010> guys<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.610> quick<00:00:53.640> look<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.449> how<00:00:54.750> it

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
you guys just a quick look to see how it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.200 
you guys just a quick look to see how it
compares<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.870> contrasts<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.430> looking<00:01:00.059> at

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
compares and contrasts so looking at

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.680 
compares and contrasts so looking at
them<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.469> think<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.690> now

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
them you can see I think that the now

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.980 
them you can see I think that the now
remember<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.150> left<00:01:06.150> hand<00:01:06.270> side<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
remember here on the left hand side is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.870 
remember here on the left hand side is
where<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.619> our<00:01:07.650> sender<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
where we have our sender and on the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.100 
where we have our sender and on the
right<00:01:09.060> hand<00:01:09.210> side<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.570> where<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> eye

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
right hand side is where we have the eye

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.260 
right hand side is where we have the eye
Mouse<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.250> sender<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.580> definitely

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
Mouse so the sender is definitely

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.300 
Mouse so the sender is definitely
thinner<00:01:12.659> um<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.250> eye<00:01:14.280> moss<00:01:14.900> and<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:17.130> eye

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
thinner um then the eye moss and the eye

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.570 
thinner um then the eye moss and the eye
Moss<00:01:18.020> appears<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.439> curve<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.070> bit<00:01:20.220> less

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
Moss appears to curve a little bit less

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.850 
Moss appears to curve a little bit less
on<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> edges<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.720> would<00:01:22.020> say<00:01:24.439> both<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.470> them

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
on the edges I would say both of them

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.569 
on the edges I would say both of them
have<00:01:26.070> excellent<00:01:26.759> screen<00:01:27.240> clarity<00:01:31.130> very<00:01:32.130> very

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
have excellent screen clarity very very

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
have excellent screen clarity very very
attractive<00:01:33.390> screen<00:01:33.659> protectors<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.500> both

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
attractive screen protectors in both

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.760 
attractive screen protectors in both
cases<00:01:35.360> let's<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.600> look<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.079> real<00:01:37.320> quick<00:01:37.590> at

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
cases let's just look here real quick at

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.039 
cases let's just look here real quick at
the<00:01:39.650> cinder<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.369> sender<00:01:42.240> just<00:01:42.570> going<00:01:42.930> around

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the cinder so sender just going around

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.530 
the cinder so sender just going around
here<00:01:43.770> we've<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.040> our<00:01:44.100> nice<00:01:44.820> curved<00:01:45.390> edges

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
here we've got our nice curved edges

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.420 
here we've got our nice curved edges
it's<00:01:48.540> very<00:01:48.750> very<00:01:49.020> pretty

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.280 

it<00:01:53.430> only<00:01:53.610> point<00:01:54.000> two<00:01:54.240> millimeters<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.020> really

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
it only point two millimeters it really

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.240 
it only point two millimeters it really
is<00:01:55.409> quite<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.799> thin<00:01:56.369> screen<00:01:56.970> protector

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
is quite a thin screen protector

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.940 
is quite a thin screen protector
particularly<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.490> this<00:02:00.440> tempered<00:02:01.440> glass<00:02:01.560> edge

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
particularly of this tempered glass edge

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.980 
particularly of this tempered glass edge
to<00:02:02.250> edge<00:02:02.430> point<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.360> really<00:02:03.659> really<00:02:03.930> thin

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
to edge point to is really really thin

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.660 
to edge point to is really really thin
also<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.050> notice<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.860> home<00:02:08.310> button

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
also you notice that the home button

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.960 
also you notice that the home button
although<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:10.310> some<00:02:11.310> kind<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.819> an

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
although there is some kind of an

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.000 
although there is some kind of an
indentation<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.959> not<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.500> much<00:02:13.680> because

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
indentation it's not that much because

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.229 
indentation it's not that much because
point<00:02:14.430> two<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.120> thick<00:02:17.000> now<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.090> eye

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
point two is not that thick now the eye

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.570 
point two is not that thick now the eye
Moss<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:22.020> would<00:02:22.230> arguably<00:02:22.650> provide<00:02:23.310> better

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
Moss it would arguably provide better

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.180 
Moss it would arguably provide better
protection<00:02:23.820> because<00:02:24.630> it's<00:02:24.810> thicker<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
protection because it's thicker the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.050 
protection because it's thicker the
edges<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.120> don't<00:02:27.870> hug<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:29.430> iPhone

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
edges of it don't hug of the iPhone

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.509 
edges of it don't hug of the iPhone
quite<00:02:30.390> as<00:02:30.630> much<00:02:30.900> maybe<00:02:31.410> because<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.100> is<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
quite as much maybe because this is a

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.350 
quite as much maybe because this is a
thicker<00:02:33.360> screen<00:02:33.750> protector<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.470> don't<00:02:34.739> know<00:02:34.890> um

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
thicker screen protector I don't know um

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.729 
thicker screen protector I don't know um
the<00:02:36.360> cinder<00:02:36.810> does<00:02:37.050> look<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> little<00:02:37.500> bit

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the cinder does look a little bit

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.220 
the cinder does look a little bit
sleeker<00:02:38.310> on<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.569> phone<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:42.050> certainly<00:02:43.050> don't

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
sleeker on the phone I certainly don't

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.270 
sleeker on the phone I certainly don't
think<00:02:43.380> anyone<00:02:43.830> could<00:02:45.530> dislike<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.830> eye<00:02:46.860> Moss

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
think anyone could dislike the eye Moss

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130 
think anyone could dislike the eye Moss
I<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.970> eye<00:02:48.000> Moss<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.360> great<00:02:48.660> deal<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.080> is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
I like the eye Moss a great deal this is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.290 
I like the eye Moss a great deal this is
actually<00:02:49.620> on<00:02:49.769> my<00:02:49.950> phone<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.580> I've<00:02:50.670> really

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
actually on my phone and I've really

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.949 
actually on my phone and I've really
really<00:02:51.780> been<00:02:51.810> enjoying<00:02:52.080> using<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:53.040> eye<00:02:53.069> Moss

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
really been enjoying using the eye Moss

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.420 
really been enjoying using the eye Moss
but<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:54.989> will<00:02:55.410> say<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.269> cinder<00:02:57.410> does<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.829> I

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
but I will say that the cinder does as I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.930 
but I will say that the cinder does as I
said<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.700> think<00:02:59.910> hug<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.480> edges<00:03:00.780> better<00:03:01.019> and

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
said I think hug the edges better and

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.490 
said I think hug the edges better and
it's<00:03:02.940> thinner<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:05.989> depends<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.079> what<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.470> like

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
it's thinner so depends on what you like

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.319 
it's thinner so depends on what you like
really<00:03:08.480> both<00:03:09.480> really<00:03:10.019> nice<00:03:10.230> choices<00:03:10.820> um<00:03:11.820> again

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
really both really nice choices um again

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.880 
really both really nice choices um again
it's<00:03:12.360> on<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.900> six<00:03:13.140> plus<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.860> eye
