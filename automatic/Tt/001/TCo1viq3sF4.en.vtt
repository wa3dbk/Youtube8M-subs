 Any beginning you can take some 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.520
 small rail 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.600
 educational park in Tomsk or buy it in 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.600

 well and 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.939
 if you can be blamed because 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.890
 this is the basis for entering 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.800
 board slide well on backside words slang 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.420
 the fact that you click this you drive 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.010
 here on the back foot to come forward 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.040
 a little bit and download half 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:20.730
 monastery nose reward you drive up 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:25.019
 parallel back 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.019
 you can already understand right away 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.440
 Primorye I jointing very wildly pretty 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.160
 common to part she care 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:42.700
 but i will be safe but personally 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:44.770
 did forward endured so that if something 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.740
 went wrong i could jump forward I 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:51.450
 I saw where I would usually fall set 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.450
 the villain it turns out that you jump 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.830
 so it is better to jump a little bit 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.830
 went wrong 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.300
 the more small relay if you will 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.280
 forward 5 2 jump to the camp and 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.940
 since he is short and the eggs are not 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.630
 hit 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.480
 sana is important especially for guys here they are 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.070
 walked in the carriage back you go anyway 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.920
 tailbone powerful gulnara 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.640
 better not to wear without a period, you 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.380
 feel this balance of you already 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.160
 performance but again for learn from 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.770
 small rivers 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.770
 to stand up for went not to jump 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.520
 the worst thing is to jump on it 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:55.030
 there is a low weight you can jump on it 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:57.070
 sharks him you can not keep the most 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.650
 the worst thing to jump clearly 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.430
 but this is the most literate if you don't even 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.430
 afraid to cancel 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:16.050
 the middle 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:19.940
 the other will not be able to keep the balance not 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.940
 it turned out 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:35.720
