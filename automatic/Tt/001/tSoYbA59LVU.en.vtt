00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.579
 pour some milk there 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.220
 it is generally better to add cream to it 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.010
 cream recipes are usually added but 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.870
 I have no cream and do not want very fat 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.329
 make soup because because of the cream he 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:29.030
 Still, this is a very nutritious 100 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.459
 milliliters of milk is also about for 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.000

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.959

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:51.230
 more creamy and that's it 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.940

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.740
 potatoes 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:39.840
