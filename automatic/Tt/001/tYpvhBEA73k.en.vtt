box<00:02:52.050> and<00:02:52.440> virtually<00:02:53.250> bulletproof<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
box and virtually bulletproof in the

box and virtually bulletproof in the
right<00:02:54.000> hands<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:55.680> gives<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.980> four

right hands and that gives you four

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.280 
right hands and that gives you four
clutchless<00:02:56.550> changes<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.210> every<00:02:57.390> single<00:02:57.570> gear
