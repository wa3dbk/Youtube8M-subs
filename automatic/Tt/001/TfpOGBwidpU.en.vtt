00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
entire cannon so I'll start off with the

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.040 
entire cannon so I'll start off with the
bottom<00:00:29.300> piece<00:00:30.490> it<00:00:31.490> is<00:00:31.730> held<00:00:32.450> together<00:00:32.689> by<00:00:35.050> this

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
bottom piece it is held together by this

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.869 
bottom piece it is held together by this
one<00:00:36.410> by<00:00:36.620> one<00:00:36.649> piece<00:00:37.190> with<00:00:38.769> the<00:00:39.769> studs<00:00:40.460> on<00:00:40.640> all

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
one by one piece with the studs on all

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.819 
one by one piece with the studs on all
four<00:00:41.210> sides<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:41.839> is<00:00:42.019> very<00:00:42.350> good<00:00:42.499> in<00:00:42.800> that

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
four sides so that is very good in that

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.329 
four sides so that is very good in that
way<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.399> it<00:00:44.089> has<00:00:44.120> this<00:00:44.749> new<00:00:45.350> piece<00:00:45.769> that<00:00:45.800> Lego

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
way and it has this new piece that Lego

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.209 
way and it has this new piece that Lego
has<00:00:46.489> made<00:00:46.670> call<00:00:46.969> it<00:00:47.420> some<00:00:47.690> it's<00:00:48.289> like<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.679> record

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
has made call it some it's like a record

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.130 
has made call it some it's like a record
player<00:00:49.579> and<00:00:50.319> so<00:00:51.319> you<00:00:51.379> can<00:00:51.649> fit<00:00:52.309> a<00:00:52.460> stud<00:00:53.140> right

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
player and so you can fit a stud right

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.759 
player and so you can fit a stud right
on<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.859> top<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.339> in<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:55.940> bottom<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.469> that's<00:00:57.620> a

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
on the top and in the bottom so that's a

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.860 
on the top and in the bottom so that's a
benefit<00:00:58.629> next<00:00:59.629> part<00:00:59.989> is<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:01.280> barrel<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.149> to

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
benefit next part is the barrel and to

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.430 
benefit next part is the barrel and to
put<00:01:03.079> this<00:01:03.199> piece<00:01:03.469> back<00:01:03.499> here<00:01:04.129> first<00:01:05.110> this<00:01:06.110> is

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
put this piece back here first this is

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.969 
put this piece back here first this is
at<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.920> end<00:01:07.100> dish<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:09.259> create<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:12.380> end<00:01:12.590> of

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
at the end dish to create the the end of

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.959 
at the end dish to create the the end of
it<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:13.280> you<00:01:13.520> can<00:01:13.689> place<00:01:14.689> a<00:01:15.820> cannon<00:01:16.820> ball

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
it so you can place a cannon ball

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.399 
it so you can place a cannon ball
shootin<00:01:17.689> out<00:01:17.869> and<00:01:19.329> he<00:01:20.329> basically<00:01:20.689> uses<00:01:21.259> the

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
shootin out and he basically uses the

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.950 
shootin out and he basically uses the
same<00:01:21.860> technique<00:01:23.259> with<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:24.829> 1<00:01:25.159> by<00:01:25.340> 1<00:01:25.750> studs<00:01:26.750> on

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
same technique with the 1 by 1 studs on

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.350 
same technique with the 1 by 1 studs on
all<00:01:27.110> four<00:01:27.409> sides<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.310> yeah<00:01:28.579> as<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.180> could

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
all four sides so yeah as you could

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.090 
all four sides so yeah as you could
probably<00:01:29.570> tell<00:01:29.869> I<00:01:29.930> really<00:01:30.469> like<00:01:30.649> this<00:01:30.860> piece

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
probably tell I really like this piece

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.080 
probably tell I really like this piece
