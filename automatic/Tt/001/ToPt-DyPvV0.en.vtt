yo<00:00:05.430> guys<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:05.640> is<00:00:05.970> orbit<00:00:06.299> here<00:00:06.480> tgn<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.080> in

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
yo guys this is orbit here tgn and in

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.839 
yo guys this is orbit here tgn and in
this<00:00:07.410> video<00:00:07.710> I'm<00:00:07.919> going<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.099> be<00:00:08.220> answering<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
this video I'm going to be answering the

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.600 
this video I'm going to be answering the
question<00:00:09.300> what<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.290> best<00:00:10.620> fastest

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
question what is the best fastest

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.450 
question what is the best fastest
movement<00:00:12.509> route<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.870> DC<00:00:13.200> Universe<00:00:13.320> Online<00:00:13.799> so

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
movement route in DC Universe Online so

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.129 
movement route in DC Universe Online so
first<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.880> all<00:00:14.969> we<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.330> three<00:00:15.750> movement

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
first of all we have three movement

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.680 
first of all we have three movement
types<00:00:16.350> demonstrated<00:00:17.340> by<00:00:17.490> myself<00:00:18.000> SuperSpeed

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
types demonstrated by myself SuperSpeed

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.359 
types demonstrated by myself SuperSpeed
thunder<00:00:19.439> almond<00:00:19.770> flight<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.330> balcan<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
thunder almond flight and balcan is

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.939 
thunder almond flight and balcan is
acrobatics<00:00:23.480> now<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.930> all<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.320> did<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.710> have<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
acrobatics now we all we did is have a

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
acrobatics now we all we did is have a
bog-standard<00:00:26.310> raise<00:00:26.910> point-a<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.449> point-b

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
bog-standard raise point-a to point-b

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
bog-standard raise point-a to point-b
okay<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.429> you'll<00:00:29.580> notice<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.150> super

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
okay and what you'll notice is super

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.020 
okay and what you'll notice is super
speed<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> fast<00:00:31.830> acceleration<00:00:32.610> three

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
speed got the fast acceleration three

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
speed got the fast acceleration three
two<00:00:33.239> one<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.750> go

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
two one and go

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.860 
two one and go
super<00:00:35.550> speed<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.940> always<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.450> jump<00:00:36.719> out

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
super speed is always going to jump out

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.660 
super speed is always going to jump out
in<00:00:36.899> front<00:00:37.260> because<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.680> has<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> fastest<00:00:38.460> kind

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
in front because it has the fastest kind

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
in front because it has the fastest kind
of<00:00:38.760> acceleration<00:00:39.329> into<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.530> closely

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of acceleration into it then closely

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.889 
of acceleration into it then closely
behind<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.790> flight<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.629> then

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
behind will be flight and then

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200 
behind will be flight and then
acrobatics<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.100> slowest<00:00:44.550> acceleration

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
acrobatics as the slowest acceleration

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
acrobatics as the slowest acceleration
out<00:00:45.360> 4/3<00:00:46.170> movement<00:00:46.530> types<00:00:46.710> okay<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.730> can

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
out 4/3 movement types okay this can

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
out 4/3 movement types okay this can
come<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.180> handy<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.809> loads<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> loads<00:00:49.440> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
come in handy with loads of loads of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.799 
come in handy with loads of loads of
different<00:00:49.710> stuff<00:00:50.070> PPP<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.449> nodes<00:00:51.629> and

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
different stuff PPP get into nodes and

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
different stuff PPP get into nodes and
stuff<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.289> acceleration<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> big<00:00:53.370> point<00:00:53.610> now

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
stuff so acceleration is a big point now

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.720 
stuff so acceleration is a big point now
we'll<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:55.020> into<00:00:55.050> top<00:00:55.530> speed<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> more

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
we'll go into top speed this is more

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.110 
we'll go into top speed this is more
more<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.539> do<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.930> open<00:00:58.320> mode<00:00:58.500> kind<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.859> stuff

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
more to do with open mode kind of stuff

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.950 
more to do with open mode kind of stuff
so<00:01:00.120> coming<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.230> first<00:01:01.469> place<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.949> um

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
so coming in first place is um

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.600 
so coming in first place is um
acrobatics<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.229> fastest<00:01:04.739> movement<00:01:05.159> type<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
acrobatics the fastest movement type of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300 
acrobatics the fastest movement type of
them<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.210> terms<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.080> top<00:01:07.409> speed<00:01:07.740> then

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
them all in terms of top speed then

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.670 
them all in terms of top speed then
you've<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.700> super<00:01:08.939> speed<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.140> second

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you've got super speed is the second

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.800 
you've got super speed is the second
fastest<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> flight<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.060> slowest<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
fastest and flight is the slowest of the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
fastest and flight is the slowest of the
three<00:01:13.049> powers<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.950> top<00:01:14.250> speed<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.880> again<00:01:15.420> if

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
three powers with top speed and again if

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.510 
three powers with top speed and again if
you<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> look<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.400> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you know you have to look at what you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
you know you have to look at what you
what<00:01:17.850> you're<00:01:17.970> doing<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.509> your<00:01:18.540> cards<00:01:18.990> if

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
what you're doing with your cards if

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
what you're doing with your cards if
you're<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:20.159> open<00:01:20.310> world<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.360> are

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
you're out in open world and you are

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
you're out in open world and you are
farming<00:01:22.080> or<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.280> you're<00:01:23.520> constantly

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
farming or you know you're constantly

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.240 
farming or you know you're constantly
going<00:01:24.299> from<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.990> side<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> city<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
going from one side of the city to the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
going from one side of the city to the
other<00:01:26.280> acrobatics<00:01:27.240> might<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.840> good<00:01:28.320> power

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
other acrobatics might be a good power

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.310 
other acrobatics might be a good power
for<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.130> example<00:01:29.570> okay<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:31.079> let's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
for you for example okay so now let's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.219 
for you for example okay so now let's
talk<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.790> maneuverability<00:01:32.790> okay<00:01:33.659> flight

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
talk about maneuverability okay flight

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.859 
talk about maneuverability okay flight
I'd<00:01:34.500> say<00:01:34.890> has<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.310> best<00:01:35.600> maneuverability<00:01:36.600> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
I'd say has the best maneuverability you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080 
I'd say has the best maneuverability you
can<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.409> kind<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.860> go<00:01:38.040> around<00:01:38.159> you've<00:01:38.880> got

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
can really kind of go around you've got

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
can really kind of go around you've got
lots<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> control<00:01:39.840> over<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.200> character

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
lots of control over your character

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
lots of control over your character
super<00:01:41.340> speed<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.150> quite<00:01:42.390> tangled<00:01:42.840> up

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
super speed you can get quite tangled up

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.440 
super speed you can get quite tangled up
in<00:01:43.140> different<00:01:44.100> odds<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.460> ends<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> cracks<00:01:45.119> in

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
in different odds and ends and cracks in

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.249 
in different odds and ends and cracks in
the<00:01:45.659> walls<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.049> stuff

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the walls and stuff

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.740 
the walls and stuff
same<00:01:46.829> with<00:01:47.040> acrobatics<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.000> honest<00:01:48.299> so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
same with acrobatics to be honest so

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.539 
same with acrobatics to be honest so
there's<00:01:48.990> certain<00:01:49.380> points<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> little

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
there's certain points that get a little

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.030 
there's certain points that get a little
bit<00:01:50.790> confusing<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> control<00:01:52.290> these<00:01:52.409> powers

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
bit confusing to control these powers

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.030 
their super speed after the doors opened
okay<00:02:21.840> which<00:02:21.990> reaches<00:02:22.350> slower<00:02:22.560> than<00:02:22.770> super

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
okay which reaches slower than super

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.750 
okay which reaches slower than super
speed<00:02:23.250> at<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.490> point<00:02:24.530> okay<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.800> that's<00:02:26.580> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
speed at that point okay so that's that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.430 
speed at that point okay so that's that
now<00:02:27.240> what<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:27.600> will<00:02:27.720> actually<00:02:27.870> see<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.290> this

now what you will actually see is this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.200 
now what you will actually see is this
is<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.770> second<00:02:29.160> clip<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.910> just<00:02:30.090> a

is the second clip and this is just a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.350 
is the second clip and this is just a

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
see flight and acrobatics are a similar

speed<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:44.280> super<00:02:44.820> speed<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.720> tad<00:02:46.260> time

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
speed but super speed is just a tad time

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.580 
speed but super speed is just a tad time
quicker<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.180> time<00:02:48.390> around<00:02:48.570> so<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:49.080> just

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
quicker on this time around so is just

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.890 
quicker on this time around so is just
kind<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.920> creeping<00:02:50.310> away

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
kind of creeping away

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.870

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
need to note note down in terms of super

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.350 
need to note note down in terms of super

speed and flight in acrobatics super

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.170 
speed and flight in acrobatics super
speed<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.840> probably<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.620> best<00:03:01.890> at<00:03:02.130> kiting<00:03:02.940> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
speed is probably the best at kiting and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.030 
speed is probably the best at kiting and
getting<00:03:03.630> away<00:03:03.750> from<00:03:03.900> your<00:03:04.230> targets<00:03:04.620> that's

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
getting away from your targets that's

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.980 
getting away from your targets that's
why<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.250> lot<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.670> PvP<00:03:06.150> players<00:03:06.420> are<00:03:06.660> super

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
speed you can do that double jump and

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.430 
speed you can do that double jump and
you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.150> avoid<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.450> lot<00:03:09.660> damage<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.230> get<00:03:10.320> away
