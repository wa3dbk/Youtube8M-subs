00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
in part three the most important part of

in part three the most important part of
the<00:00:04.560> system<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:05.250> me<00:00:05.810> maybe<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.259> Peter

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
the system to me maybe it is the Peter

the system to me maybe it is the Peter
maybe<00:00:07.740> not<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.610> loudspeakers<00:00:09.300> tell<00:00:09.510> us<00:00:09.599> about

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
maybe not the loudspeakers tell us about

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.919 
maybe not the loudspeakers tell us about

the loudspeaker this is a loudspeaker is

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.839 
the loudspeaker this is a loudspeaker is
what<00:00:13.110> model<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.590> what<00:00:13.769> price<00:00:13.980> point<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
what model and what price point this is

the IND SEC signature the C stands for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.240 
the IND SEC signature the C stands for

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
cobalt which actually is a federalist

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
cobalt which actually is a federalist
normal<00:00:20.670> because<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.090> using<00:00:21.630> an<00:00:21.869> eco<00:00:22.260> magnet

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740

very great thought that he put into the

what<00:00:58.980> we've<00:00:59.220> done<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.700> we've<00:01:00.060> refined<00:01:00.810> every

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
what we've done is we've refined every

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.650 
what we've done is we've refined every

we've<00:01:12.870> sort<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.260> refined<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.100> refined<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
we've sort of refined and refined and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.450 
we've sort of refined and refined and
refined<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.479> greatest<00:01:15.990> discovery<00:01:16.560> really

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
refined the greatest discovery really

refined the greatest discovery really
came<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:18.150> when<00:01:18.890> by<00:01:19.890> mistake<00:01:20.369> somebody<00:01:20.700> made

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
came when when by mistake somebody made

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.450 
came when when by mistake somebody made
a<00:01:21.060> port<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.660> was<00:01:21.750> too<00:01:21.900> small<00:01:22.290> on<00:01:23.040> their

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
a port that was too small on their

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.540 
a port that was too small on their
prototype<00:01:24.000> speakers<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.979> stopped<00:01:26.340> him<00:01:26.460> in

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:26.550 
prototype speakers and I stopped him in

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.999 
prototype speakers and I stopped him in
the<00:01:26.670> corner<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.240> realized<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> base<00:01:28.619> on

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the corner and realized that the base on

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
the corner and realized that the base on
the<00:01:29.220> improve<00:01:29.580> dramatically<00:01:30.320> it's<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.410> bit<00:01:31.560> like

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the improve dramatically it's a bit like

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.290 
the improve dramatically it's a bit like
the<00:01:31.830> land<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.100> invented<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.090> by

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
the land of invented the on that by

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.969 
the land of invented the on that by
dropping<00:01:33.720> three<00:01:33.990> eggs<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.530> floor<00:01:34.800> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
dropping three eggs on the floor and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.639 
dropping three eggs on the floor and
that<00:01:35.130> was<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.430> he<00:01:35.520> had<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:35.700> eat<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.990> he<00:01:37.259> had<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
that was all he had to eat so he had to

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.260 
that was all he had to eat so he had to
make<00:01:37.830> something<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:40.940> you<00:01:41.940> know<00:01:42.060> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
make something with it I you know that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.680 
make something with it I you know that
really<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.899> made<00:01:43.170> me<00:01:43.410> realized<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.250> that

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
really really made me realized that that

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.740 
really really made me realized that that
using<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.869> room<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:48.030> parameters<00:01:48.720> of

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
using the room and and the parameters of

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.859 
using the room and and the parameters of
the<00:01:49.140> room<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:50.360> reinforcements<00:01:51.360> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.539> base

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the room as reinforcements in the base

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.969 
the room as reinforcements in the base
and<00:01:52.289> as<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.580> way<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.990> reducing<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:57.979> sensitivity

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
and as a way of reducing the sensitivity

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.830 
and as a way of reducing the sensitivity
that<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.399> speaker<00:01:59.670> has<00:02:00.030> two<00:02:00.660> different

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that the speaker has two different

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.859 
that the speaker has two different
promise<00:02:01.440> because<00:02:02.429> most<00:02:02.729> rooms<00:02:03.149> have<00:02:03.569> a<00:02:03.599> very

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
promise because most rooms have a very

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.859 
promise because most rooms have a very
similar<00:02:04.319> behavior<00:02:05.270> when<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> look<00:02:06.569> from<00:02:06.720> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
similar behavior when you look from the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.869 
similar behavior when you look from the
corner

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
corner

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.369 
corner
and<00:02:09.879> we'll<00:02:10.119> turn<00:02:10.420> around<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.750> do<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.080> big<00:02:11.230> as

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:11.379 
and we'll turn around and do that big as

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:18.960 
and we'll turn around and do that big as
