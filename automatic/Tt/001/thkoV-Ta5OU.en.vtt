these are the Cuisinart 2 and 4 sliced
stainless<00:00:03.840> hybrid<00:00:04.440> toasters<00:00:05.009> they<00:00:05.759> have<00:00:05.910> a

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
stainless hybrid toasters they have a

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.810 
stainless hybrid toasters they have a
really<00:00:06.210> nice<00:00:06.480> modern<00:00:06.990> look<00:00:07.250> black<00:00:08.250> accent

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820

construction<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:12.120> on<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.509> inside<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.860> I

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
construction here on the inside like I

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.430 
construction here on the inside like I
mentioned<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.790> 4<00:00:15.150> slice<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.870> this

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
mentioned this is the 4 slice and this

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.070 
mentioned this is the 4 slice and this
is<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.800> 2<00:00:16.980> slice<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.420> major<00:00:18.630> difference

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
is the 2 slice so the major difference

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.800 
is the 2 slice so the major difference
between<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.650> two<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.250> four<00:00:21.000> Slice<00:00:21.270> model

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
between the two is the four Slice model

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.950 
between the two is the four Slice model
actually<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:23.250> independent<00:00:24.150> toasters<00:00:24.660> in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
actually is two independent toasters in

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.620 
actually is two independent toasters in
one<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.769> two<00:00:26.189> slots<00:00:26.939> over<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:27.449> and

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
one so you have two slots over here and

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.230 
one so you have two slots over here and
two<00:00:28.170> slots<00:00:28.410> over<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.070> each<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:30.090> these

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
two slots over here and each of these

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.410 
two slots over here and each of these
areas<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:31.109> their<00:00:31.320> own<00:00:31.500> control<00:00:32.099> systems<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
areas have their own control systems so

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.690 
areas have their own control systems so
that<00:00:33.630> enables<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> toast<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.280> bagel

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that enables you to toast like a bagel

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.750 
that enables you to toast like a bagel
over<00:00:35.969> here<00:00:36.300> I'm<00:00:36.450> really<00:00:37.050> thin<00:00:37.440> toast<00:00:38.309> over

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
over here I'm really thin toast over

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.819 
over here I'm really thin toast over
here<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.660> do<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> exactly<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.649> same

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
here and you can do it exactly the same

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.700 
here and you can do it exactly the same
time<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.430> different<00:00:42.090> settings<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.320> let's<00:00:43.530> look

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
time at different settings so let's look

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.400 
time at different settings so let's look
at<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.980> control<00:00:44.370> panel<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.629> your

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
at the control panel this is your

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
at the control panel this is your
carriage<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.190> press<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.700> down<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.239> engage

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
carriage you press this down to engage

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.590 
carriage you press this down to engage
the<00:00:48.809> toaster<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.940> when<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.030> hit<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> cancel

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the toaster and when you hit the cancel

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
the toaster and when you hit the cancel
button<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.320> pops<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.719> cancels<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
button it pops up and that cancels the

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.650 
button it pops up and that cancels the
toasting<00:00:56.070> function<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.090> suddenly<00:00:57.539> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
toasting function so if suddenly you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
toasting function so if suddenly you
decide<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.170> eggs<00:00:58.320> aren't<00:00:58.559> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> be<00:00:58.920> done

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
decide your eggs aren't going to be done

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.560 
decide your eggs aren't going to be done
at<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> right<00:00:59.489> time<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
at the right time and you don't want the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.720 
at the right time and you don't want the
toast<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.020> cold<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:02.010> cancel<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
toast to be cold you can cancel it and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.109 
toast to be cold you can cancel it and
then<00:01:02.879> restart<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.600> later<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> let's<00:01:05.850> look<00:01:06.000> at

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
then restart it later so let's look at

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.370 
then restart it later so let's look at
some<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.540> features<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.039 
able to take let's say a frozen bagel
which<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.880> obviously<00:01:27.360> denser<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.990> thicker

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
which is obviously denser and thicker

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.560 
which is obviously denser and thicker
than<00:01:28.619> toast<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.090> actually<00:01:30.360> take<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
right out of the freezer and put it in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.429 
right out of the freezer and put it in
the<00:01:32.400> toaster<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.180> what's<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> happen

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
the toaster and what's going to happen

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
the toaster and what's going to happen
is<00:01:34.650> it'll<00:01:34.890> first<00:01:35.220> defrost<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.970> bagel<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
is it'll first defrost the bagel and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.600 
is it'll first defrost the bagel and
then<00:01:36.720> it'll<00:01:36.930> toast<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> don't<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
then it'll toast it so you don't have to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.969 
then it'll toast it so you don't have to
do<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.970> two<00:01:39.119> separate<00:01:39.509> steps<00:01:39.810> I'm<00:01:40.799> gonna

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
do it in two separate steps I'm gonna

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130 
do it in two separate steps I'm gonna
cancel<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.119> say<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.960> just

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
cancel this so you can say and I just
