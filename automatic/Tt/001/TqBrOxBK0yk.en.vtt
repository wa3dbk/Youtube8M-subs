00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.900
 hello gorgeous welcome in the channel and 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.250
 good today we are going to talk about the circulen 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.559
 which are the contact lenses that I said that 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.900
 order online and it has arrived 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.300
 precisely today I teach you more or less 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.490
 how am I going to do with how are we going to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.770
 open how we are going to conserve them and how 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.610
 we are going to put them has reached me in 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.370
 a small packet like that where two 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.900
 little gifts that I really do not know what they are 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.719
 I have to find out and I have to 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.130
 look at it because this is not brought as a 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.190
 thing 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.990
 here that is for the hair but it is not 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.650
 exactly what it's for and this 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.300
 still not the open thing has brought me in the 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.040
 packet circulate them in a little box 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.620
 good 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.940
 a decoration as well as a little bag and 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.300
 then apart it has brought me as a 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 little card 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.740
 thanking the order 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.520
 giving thanks 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.350
 even signed here to goal and the truth 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.920
 that very well very 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.020
 very kind, well, I tell you that in 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.020
 the page where I asked is in this one 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.360
 Anyway, I'll leave the website 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.000
 of information forgive the contact lenses 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.390
 they have one year they are a year long 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.740
 and it has cost me I do not know about 21 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.240
 22 euros that passes that are in dollars 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 you have to use the 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.790
 converter to change dollars to 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.110
 euros or where they live and in the currency is 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.150
 very safe the page has arrived 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.659
 approximately 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.340
 in three weeks at most a month 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.890
 The truth is that it has not been much 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.659
 but it's logical they come from far away and 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.079
 we are going to open it and we are going 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.079
 contracts 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.890
 they come in laps we're going any 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.890
 to break trips to tepito 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.940
 they come here 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 in a few little things like that 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.110
 like a piglet comes a plastic 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.510
 specific so I do not know 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.210
 break and nothing and come in two 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.700
 individual jars as you can see there 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.590
 come two zeros that means that no 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.130
 you have no graduation you can ask 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.830
 on this page with rusted with itself 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.830
 well what's wrong with me today mouth or 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.080
 no graduation 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.220
 obviously recording but so that 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.310
 you know for the girls who have the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.110
 nation 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.940
 and we're going to open it first, we're going to 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.170
 remove 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.110
 Let's see 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.110
 the stopper cited that is not pulled 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.790
 and the bean recommended the hairpin 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.129
 because it had broken 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.200
 and the open so you have to have 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.540
 be careful because this pricks a little 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.730
 if we would stay like this 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.220
 now I teach color and everything 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.170
 and this is why we are going to do the same 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.280
 can help with the fork because if 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.990
 do not 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.390
 the way 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.630
 since my first time opening the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.840
 and so 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.490
 he has not opened it more than perfect life 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.810
 well I tell you that when it is 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.130
 open 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.770
 you do not leave the color more or less 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.590
 when it is already open we can not 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.330
 put we have to let the 6 rest 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.460
 balls from 4 to 6 hours 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.000
 advisable to take them out here comes a 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.400
 liquid 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.030
 why he had won that liquid there 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.680
 than throwing it you have to renew the liquid and 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.840
 I bought this liquid in a 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.200
 new optics 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.910
 the brand 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.950
 and what I 'm going to do is that I'm going to 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.360
 throw it out 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.360
 in the bottle that has come 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.510
 what to throw in the little bottle 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.019
 and now yes 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.400
 with the hands very very very clean 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.759
 here as a 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.759
 I throw it in my hand 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.210
 and we're going to rinse it a little bit 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.670
 What he is doing is rinsing it 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.350
 little bit 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.350
 and now that they are rinse ditas 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.770
 I put it in your little bottle 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.009
 this is the color that I have asked for 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.009
 you see 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.160
 like a green 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.660
 perfect and once we have it 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.690
 We have to let it rest 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.780
 that's 4 in 36 hours we leave them 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.390
 rest and then if we can try it 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.130
 we can put it on and so we can do 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.960
 anything before is not recommended 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.030
 because it is necessary that I know 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.190
 clean that they stay there their time quoted 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.010
 so that they can not be cleaned 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.720
 well they come from a water I do not know but I have 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.090
 understood that the golden water comes is not 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.970
 It is advisable to put it on and you have to leave it 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.620
 here a while so that with the water 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.590
 specific this you buy that super 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.380
 good that moisturizes 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.870
 and it takes away everything the powder has 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.850
 and all things, it is recommended 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.680
 wait for those little balls I'm also the 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.470
 Patient for putting me on I 'm crazy like that 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.540
 that I hope another video putting me the 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.400
 that you do not see is a cool makeup like that 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.260
 with the circular but this video is 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.920
 tried to treat them circulate such and 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:02.170
 as they open as they are saved and what 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.080
 of the time you have to wait not 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.330
 I tell you that they are more or less of a year 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.790
 example if in that year I put them on 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.330
 almost almost almost daily that actually 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.190
 they do not owe either every day and 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.639
 not all the hours of the day either 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.219
 must be 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.020
 but for example putting two friends with 

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:23.150
 I do not wear it for a week, 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.129
 use jce every week is necessary 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.289
 change the water the water that comes in 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.870
 the little bottle of people because if not the 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.180
 water can dry out, it can disappear 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.520
 with time and the athleti is already stubborn and 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.229
 since you have to throw it away so it's 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.479
 It is necessary to be vigilant in that sense 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.909
 if you do not put it in at least take the 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:43.189
 water to put on the skin and not 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:45.229
 dry out and nothing else 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.090
 I think I told you pretty much all 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.219
 If you have any questions or questions 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.199
 and I always will answer it if I do not 

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:53.539
 He does not answer them because I do not 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:56.810
 like to give information that I think is not 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:58.069
 good or not knowing so I hope that you 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.330
 have liked this video if you like this 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.069
