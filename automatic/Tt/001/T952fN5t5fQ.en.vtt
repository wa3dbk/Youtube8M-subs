00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.819
 hydraulic pumps 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.910
 the only bombardment is a device that transfers the liquid that energy 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.230
 from a certain source usually the electric motor 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.360
 to transport it from one point to another within a building system of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.589
 cold water 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:18.560
 therefore 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.020
 part of the energy received by good successful water in the form of energy 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.380
 kinetic elegy or both 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.850
 thus causing increase in its pressure gained flow velocity 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.240
 the most commonly used hydraulic pumps in cold water 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.810
 of flops centrifuges or cardinal 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.680
 in these pumps the energy supplied is mostly kinetic liquid 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.010
 resulting from the development of purely centrifugal forces in the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.660
 liquid 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.989
 due to the rotational movement of a rich period 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.340
 or all of face-to-face with short passes 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.030
 due to the rotation movement imposed by the electric author rotor through 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.739
 an axis 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 the water that lie in three steps inside the other 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.710
 is drawn by the centrifugal action from the center to the periphery 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.480
 this phenomenon causes a depression in the center of the fighter responsible for 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.020
 Intake flow of water pump through suction inlet 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.490
 also causes an acceleration of the driven liquid by slipping over 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.369
 his passion is an opposite end to the center 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.289
 where the doctor leaves at high speed and leaves the pump housing that 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.280
 involves the author 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.010
 towards the exit of repression 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.369
 as the chamber the outlet duct of the housing 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.650
 called scroll 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.130
 has a divergent format or 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.960
 in the direction of flow in this region. 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.090
 kinetic energy present in water 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
 turns into energy depression 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.380
 once installed in a hydraulic system 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.789
 to centrifugal pumps only turns the 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.379
 strictly necessary to overcome the resistance presented to the outflow 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.780
 that is 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.800
 the load losses and to overcome the geometric difference the static author is 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800
 high water between the end points of the pipe 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.619
 where is inserted 

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:25.109
 in figure illustration attitude a 'bomb' center was this flag of the 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.700
 the lower reservoir liquid containing water in the 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.000
 to a reservoir raised through piping that flows into point b 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.700
 open atmosphere 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.349
 and therefore under atmospheric pressure situated in the delta g meters above 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:45.059
 when installing a pressure gauge at point b it will accuse the effective pressure of the hand 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:46.440
 metric equal to zero 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.540
 indicating being in the water being discharged with speed and not squid 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.770
 at its point of destination with equal atmospheric pressure 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.030
 by taking the actual pressure reading indicated by another pressure gauge 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:00.419
 installed at the right point 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.670
 immediately downstream of the pump 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.950
 this pasta paulo corresponding to a geometric gradient delta g 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.809
 plus the pressure drop in delta claw delta tubing 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:16.739
 this pumping situation is done on a certain flow, proving 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.579
 that I will not fight the bomb there was conversion of part of the kinetic energy 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.409
 present in the water energy depression but precisely because of the need of the flow 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.260
 to overcome the geometric difference of the installation 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.079
 and the load losses in the outflow 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.259
 on the other hand if the elevated reservoir quota was reduced 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:40.709
 so that the repression pipe passes water out with speed not 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.029
 Lula in a point of roberto atmosphere like new visible geometric delta g line 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:48.169
 lower than the previous situation 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.809
 the monument installed at that point will also indicate the effective pressure 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:52.949
 equal to zero 

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.949
 similar to what happened at point b 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:58.879
 to this new situation 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.269
 obama running one on the subway set up at her right point chanti 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.900
 will indicate a new value 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.930
 lower than the previous situation 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.719
 corresponding to the new geometric gradient delta g line 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.469
 plus the new pressure drop in the pressure pipe 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.879
 delta hf 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.139
 however it is noted that for this new situation 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.810
 the repressed flow greater than that verified in the initial situation 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.020
 proving that a smaller portion of the kinetic energy 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.780
 was converted into energy depression by the pump or to strictly 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.659
 necessary to overcome the new geometric gradient and the new load loss in the 

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:38.909
 repression 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.909
 as there is comparatively more kinetic energy in this case 

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:45.740
 Most speed printed net mass 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.790
 as a consequence, the pump 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.340
 therefore 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.360
 with a flow and the pressure in the exit of the ball resulting in installment 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.070
 proportion of the energy transferred by the liquid in the form 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.349
 respectively 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.360
 kinetic energy and energy depression to a client and direct dependence between 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.360
 these two quantities 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.720
 however the total pressure energy provided by the pump the flow 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.120
 is not just limited to the pressure pipe 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.040
 part of it employed to also overcome in the losses of load lives in the pipe 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.110
 suction 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.379
 which added up the pressure losses in the settling pipe and alves level 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:32.949
 geometric total pessutÃ£o at the time sent metric of the pump as shown 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.800
 expression two points of the 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.020
 where hiv is equal to the turan metric of the pump has meters of water column 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.360
 delta hs 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.580
 is equal to the total distributed head loss in the pipe 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.419
 suction in meters of water column 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.190
 delta hrt is equal to the total distributed load loss located in the 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:56.499
 repression pipe also meters of water column 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:01.580
 delta gs is equal geometric difference in suction pipe and meters 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.099
 and delta gr 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.939
 is equal to a geometric difference in the pressure pipe in meters
