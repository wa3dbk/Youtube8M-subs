in one of the cool features with the new

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.590 
in one of the cool features with the new
equipment<00:02:41.770> is<00:02:41.980> they're<00:02:42.490> very<00:02:42.520> very<00:02:43.150> heavily

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
equipment is they're very very heavily

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.050 
equipment is they're very very heavily
sealed<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.560> protect<00:02:44.740> them<00:02:45.100> from<00:02:45.310> moisture<00:02:45.880> and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
sealed to protect them from moisture and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.430 
sealed to protect them from moisture and
rust<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.420> things<00:02:46.630> like<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.200> when<00:02:47.320> they

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
rust and things like that so when they

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.260 
rust and things like that so when they
first<00:02:47.620> arrive<00:02:47.980> they<00:02:48.550> kind<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.940> look<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.090> a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
first arrive they kind of look like a

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.630 
first arrive they kind of look like a
satellite

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.180 

the<00:02:57.150> equipment<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.720> actually<00:02:57.900> bolted<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.980> its

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the equipment is actually bolted to its

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.610 
the equipment is actually bolted to its
pallet<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.150> you<00:03:00.210> bring<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.690> in<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.230> pallet

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
pallet so you bring it in on the pallet

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.350 
pallet so you bring it in on the pallet
and<00:03:01.800> then<00:03:02.010> unbolt<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.700> from<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.970> pallet<00:03:03.300> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
and then unbolt it from the pallet and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.220 
and then unbolt it from the pallet and
pick<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.570> up<00:03:03.750> from<00:03:03.870> there

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
pick it up from there

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.830 
pick it up from there

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
now we had just had the lathes down in

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.609 
now we had just had the lathes down in
the<00:04:56.239> middle<00:04:56.419> of<00:04:56.509> the<00:04:56.569> room<00:04:56.749> for<00:04:56.989> a<00:04:57.019> moment<00:04:57.199> so

from the front in order to put it into
position<00:05:02.299> the<00:05:02.809> lathes<00:05:03.019> is<00:05:03.199> actually<00:05:03.739> heavier

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
position the lathes is actually heavier

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.189
