they've made their pan before they put
it<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.979> little<00:01:44.310> tough<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.610> see<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.000> he's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.810 
it down a little tough to see that he's
got<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> rip<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:45.899> here<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.220> probably<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
got a rip in here of the probably I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.170 
got a rip in here of the probably I
don't<00:01:47.939> know<00:01:48.030> 1/8<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:49.220> 3/16<00:01:50.220> wide<00:01:50.430> strip<00:01:50.939> of

wood he's using that as a back name and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230 
wood he's using that as a back name and
then<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.259> flat<00:01:55.500> sill<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.969> put

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
then this is your flat sill and they put

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.260 
then this is your flat sill and they put
a<00:01:57.420> grace<00:01:58.290> Vicor<00:01:58.829> corner<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.670> first<00:01:59.969> so

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
a grace Vicor corner in there first so

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
a grace Vicor corner in there first so
this<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.140> plastic<00:02:01.619> piece<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.070> sits

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
this is just a plastic piece that sits

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.370 
this is just a plastic piece that sits
in<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.490> corner<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.390> when<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:03.899> make

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
in the corner so that when they make

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
in the corner so that when they make
this<00:02:04.619> slit<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.880> they're<00:02:06.149> in

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
this slit right here and they're in

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.869 
this slit right here and they're in
there<00:02:06.659> beetle<00:02:06.990> base<00:02:07.140> tape<00:02:07.590> if<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.610> window

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
there beetle base tape if that window

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.520 
there beetle base tape if that window
does<00:02:09.090> leak<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.660> not<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.379> on

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
does leak it's not going to get in on

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.969 
does leak it's not going to get in on
this

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
this

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.009 
this
it's<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> leak<00:02:11.550> down<00:02:11.819> across<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
it's going to leak down across this and

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.410 
it's going to leak down across this and
you<00:02:13.470> can<00:02:13.590> see<00:02:13.739> the<00:02:13.830> Tyvek<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:15.030> flashed

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
you can see the Tyvek is is flashed

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.149 
you can see the Tyvek is is flashed
correctly<00:02:16.080> underneath<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:16.980> water

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
correctly underneath there so if water

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
leaks out of that window it's going to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.960 
leaks out of that window it's going to
hit<00:02:19.019> that<00:02:19.200> corner<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.890> stay<00:02:20.159> on<00:02:20.340> top<00:02:20.670> of<00:02:20.700> the
