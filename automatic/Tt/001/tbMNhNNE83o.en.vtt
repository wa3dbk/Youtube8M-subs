format now once I have this I can turn

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.750 
format now once I have this I can turn
this<00:02:10.649> into

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
this into

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.259 
this into
extruded<00:02:12.480> text<00:02:12.900> let's<00:02:13.739> do<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:13.980> 3d<00:02:14.879> extrusion

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
extruded text let's do that 3d extrusion

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.530 
extruded text let's do that 3d extrusion
so<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.019> go<00:02:16.049> this<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.590> why<00:02:16.909> I<00:02:17.909> didn't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
so there you go this is why I didn't

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.910 
so there you go this is why I didn't
really<00:02:18.659> care<00:02:18.900> about<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.230> color<00:02:19.439> because<00:02:19.739> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
really care about the color because I

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.740 
really care about the color because I
was<00:02:20.189> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> change<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.849> into<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.420> plastic

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
was going to change it into the plastic

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.619 
was going to change it into the plastic
by<00:02:22.170> default<00:02:22.590> anyway<00:02:23.069> as<00:02:23.700> soon<00:02:23.819> as<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.150> went<00:02:24.329> into

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
by default anyway as soon as I went into

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.589 
by default anyway as soon as I went into
the<00:02:24.750> extrusion<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.220> there<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.459> go<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.420> that's

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
the extrusion so there you go so that's

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.750 
the extrusion so there you go so that's
kind<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.870> cool<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.409> if<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.099> want<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.489> can

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
kind of cool and if you want you can

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.520 
kind of cool and if you want you can
also<00:02:29.879> then<00:02:30.150> play<00:02:30.480> around<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.989> each<00:02:31.170> letter

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
also then play around with each letter

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.130 
also then play around with each letter
we<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.670> go<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.909> silhouette<00:02:33.510> where<00:02:34.019> your

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
we do that go to silhouette where your

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.770 
we do that go to silhouette where your
says<00:02:34.290> eps<00:02:34.940> turn<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.060> into<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.329> spline<00:02:36.750> object

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
says eps turn that into a spline object

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.690 
says eps turn that into a spline object
i've<00:02:37.440> shown<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.739> how<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.370> one<00:02:38.670> of

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
i've shown you how to do that in one of

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.729 
i've shown you how to do that in one of
my<00:02:38.849> previous<00:02:39.060> videos<00:02:39.359> if<00:02:40.170> you<00:02:40.319> open<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.590> up

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
my previous videos if you open it up

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.220 
my previous videos if you open it up
you'll<00:02:41.549> see<00:02:41.790> them<00:02:42.030> all<00:02:42.209> now<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.870> their<00:02:43.079> own

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
you'll see them all now in their own

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.920 
you'll see them all now in their own
separate<00:02:43.859> track<00:02:44.579> line<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.209> can<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.780> some

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
separate track line so you can have some

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.550 
separate track line so you can have some
fun<00:02:46.879> changing<00:02:47.879> each<00:02:48.090> letter<00:02:48.659> independently

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
fun changing each letter independently

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.229 
fun changing each letter independently
and<00:02:49.799> if<00:02:50.010> you're<00:02:50.159> watching<00:02:50.370> really<00:02:50.849> get<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.120> on

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
and if you're watching really get in on

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.839 
and if you're watching really get in on
it<00:02:51.269> go<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> your<00:02:52.230> pen<00:02:52.500> tool<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.980> you'll<00:02:53.639> see

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
it go to your pen tool and you'll see

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.240 
it go to your pen tool and you'll see
all<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:54.239> notes<00:02:54.510> come<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:54.980> zoom<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.099> on<00:02:56.220> that

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
all the notes come up zoom in on that

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.280 
all the notes come up zoom in on that
all<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.970> notes<00:02:57.209> come<00:02:57.450> up<00:02:57.599> and<00:02:57.780> then<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.930> can

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
all the notes come up and then you can

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.970 
all the notes come up and then you can
then<00:02:58.879> change<00:02:59.879> these<00:03:00.629> nodes<00:03:01.260> if<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.739> hold<00:03:01.920> down

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
then change these nodes if you hold down

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.910 
then change these nodes if you hold down
the<00:03:02.190> Alt<00:03:02.459> key<00:03:02.549> anyone<00:03:03.420> along<00:03:03.659> the<00:03:03.870> line<00:03:04.109> press

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
the Alt key anyone along the line press

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.250 
the Alt key anyone along the line press
once<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.579> with<00:03:05.700> your<00:03:05.819> left<00:03:06.030> mouse<00:03:06.209> button<00:03:06.659> it

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
once in with your left mouse button it

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.720 
once in with your left mouse button it
adds<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.799> new<00:03:08.010> node<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:09.030> that's<00:03:09.299> pretty<00:03:09.780> cool

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
adds a new node so that's pretty cool

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.819 
adds a new node so that's pretty cool
let's<00:03:11.730> go<00:03:11.940> back<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:13.019> way<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.440> looked<00:03:13.739> when

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
let's go back to the way it looked when

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.030 
let's go back to the way it looked when
I<00:03:14.069> first<00:03:14.280> imported<00:03:14.909> it<00:03:15.000> there<00:03:15.359> you<00:03:15.450> go<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.659> tell

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
I first imported it there you go to tell

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.280 
I first imported it there you go to tell
easy<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:18.000> really<00:03:18.419> is<00:03:18.750> i<00:03:18.780> mean<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.079> can<00:03:19.199> have

easy this really is i mean you can have
a<00:03:19.349> ton<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.620> fun<00:03:19.889> with<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.519> while<00:03:20.730> i'm<00:03:20.849> here

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
a ton of fun with that so while i'm here

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.530 
a ton of fun with that so while i'm here
a<00:03:21.840> lot<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.560> you<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.739> asked<00:03:23.040> me<00:03:23.069> lights<00:03:24.030> what

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
a lot of you have asked me lights what

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.030 
a lot of you have asked me lights what
about<00:03:24.629> lights<00:03:24.959> i<00:03:25.169> see<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.440> light<00:03:25.560> tab<00:03:25.799> what

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
about lights i see the light tab what

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.280 
about lights i see the light tab what
does<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.250> do<00:03:26.400> all<00:03:27.060> right<00:03:27.209> let's<00:03:27.449> go<00:03:27.720> make<00:03:28.260> sure

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
does it do all right let's go make sure

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.500 
does it do all right let's go make sure
you<00:03:28.560> highlight<00:03:28.799> it<00:03:29.129> i'll<00:03:29.340> close<00:03:29.669> all<00:03:29.879> this<00:03:30.060> on

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
you highlight it i'll close all this on

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.509 
you highlight it i'll close all this on
to<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.780> actual<00:03:30.900> spline<00:03:31.319> track<00:03:31.650> and<00:03:31.919> then

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
to the actual spline track and then

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.240 
to the actual spline track and then
click<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:32.970> lights<00:03:33.419> tab<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.590> you<00:03:34.799> can't<00:03:35.040> see

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
click the lights tab and you can't see

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.220 
click the lights tab and you can't see
any<00:03:35.400> difference<00:03:35.730> at<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.970> moment<00:03:36.329> because

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
any difference at the moment because

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.890 
any difference at the moment because
this<00:03:37.829> here<00:03:38.519> there's<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.879> zoom<00:03:39.060> in<00:03:39.180> on<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.299> that

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
this here there's a zoom in on that that

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.250 
this here there's a zoom in on that that
is<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.379> light<00:03:40.590> track<00:03:41.599> position<00:03:42.599> but<00:03:42.959> it's

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
is the light track position but it's

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.650 
is the light track position but it's
also<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.949> pivot<00:03:44.459> point<00:03:44.790> position<00:03:45.299> so<00:03:45.510> they're

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
also the pivot point position so they're

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.780 
also the pivot point position so they're
overlapping<00:03:46.019> each<00:03:46.319> other<00:03:46.470> if<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.340> move<00:03:47.760> this

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
overlapping each other if I move this

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.119 
overlapping each other if I move this
slowly<00:03:48.569> and<00:03:48.930> then<00:03:48.989> you<00:03:49.199> can<00:03:49.379> see<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.739> I'm<00:03:49.949> going

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
slowly and then you can see it I'm going

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.180 
slowly and then you can see it I'm going
to<00:03:50.190> zoom<00:03:50.250> back<00:03:50.430> out<00:03:51.500> we've<00:03:52.500> left<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:52.980> right

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
to zoom back out we've left and right

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.580 
to zoom back out we've left and right
and<00:03:53.400> then<00:03:53.699> you<00:03:53.819> can<00:03:54.000> see<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.299> I'm<00:03:54.659> physically
