pretty white then we'll uphill straight

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.219 
pretty white then we'll uphill straight
line<00:01:10.260> planning<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.450> it's<00:01:12.450> full<00:01:12.600> speed<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.170> a

line planning and it's full speed for a
small<00:01:13.619> pump<00:01:14.659> then<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.780> go<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.320> great

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
small pump then we go for great

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.289 
small pump then we go for great
then<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:20.090> have<00:01:20.240> small<00:01:21.369> pump<00:01:22.369> again<00:01:22.729> then<00:01:23.180> we

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
then you have small pump again then we

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.450 
then you have small pump again then we
have<00:01:23.420> peak<00:01:23.689> tabletop<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.770> biggest<00:01:25.100> one<00:01:25.250> in

in a small pump again pull left hand
side<00:01:40.100> speeds<00:01:42.760> then<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:43.940> have<00:01:44.090> table<00:01:44.480> top

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
side speeds then you have table top

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.870 
side speeds then you have table top
again<00:01:44.930> then<00:01:45.770> it's<00:01:45.950> going<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.130> be<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.430> first<00:01:46.640> up

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
again then it's going to be the first up

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.010

he'll<00:01:47.120> drag<00:01:47.600> race<00:01:48.550> full<00:01:49.550> speed<00:01:49.850> up<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:50.600> small

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
he'll drag race full speed up then small

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.320 
he'll drag race full speed up then small
jump<00:01:51.410> in<00:01:51.620> the<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.130> hill<00:01:52.310> straight<00:01:53.150> to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
jump in the up in the hill straight to

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.200 
jump in the up in the hill straight to
the<00:01:53.420> course<00:01:53.710> then<00:01:54.710> it's<00:01:54.860> calling<00:01:55.190> down<00:01:55.940> here

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
the course then it's calling down here

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.190 
the course then it's calling down here
very<00:01:56.720> big<00:01:57.020> jump<00:01:57.050> in<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.590> down<00:01:57.770> here<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:59.200> then

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
very big jump in the down here and then

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.190 
very big jump in the down here and then
install<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.830> new<00:02:01.250> course<00:02:02.150> for<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.600> left<00:02:02.810> we

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
install the new course for the left we

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.940 
install the new course for the left we
have<00:02:03.350> two<00:02:03.710> lines<00:02:03.980> over<00:02:04.280> there<00:02:04.510> jumps<00:02:05.510> over

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
have two lines over there jumps over

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.500 
have two lines over there jumps over
then<00:02:06.950> we<00:02:07.070> have<00:02:07.220> again<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.730> hop<00:02:07.940> Hill<00:02:08.180> full

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
then we have again in hop Hill full

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.100 
then we have again in hop Hill full
speed<00:02:09.399> but<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.580> all<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.240> way<00:02:11.360> straight<00:02:11.420> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
speed but it's all the way straight and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.660 
speed but it's all the way straight and
hard<00:02:13.010> left<00:02:14.000> turn<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.740> then<00:02:16.100> it's<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:16.580> be

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
hard left turn and then it's going to be

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.410 
hard left turn and then it's going to be
full<00:02:16.880> speed<00:02:17.240> down<00:02:17.450> here<00:02:18.790> also<00:02:19.790> with<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.420> jump

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
full speed down here also with that jump

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.640 
full speed down here also with that jump
back<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.780> starting<00:02:24.110> line
