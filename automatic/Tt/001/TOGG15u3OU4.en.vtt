because it seems like they just having
these<00:01:19.710> guys<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.070> out<00:01:20.220> there<00:01:20.400> look<00:01:20.939> at<00:01:21.090> matches

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
and you know they're they're coming out

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.230 
and you know they're they're coming out
and<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.159> not<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> rhyme<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.210> reason

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and it's not really a rhyme or reason

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
and it's not really a rhyme or reason
for<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> right<00:01:24.990> now<00:01:25.049> I'm<00:01:25.409> sure<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:25.979> going<00:01:26.100> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
for it right now I'm sure it's going to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
for it right now I'm sure it's going to
pick<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.490> some<00:01:26.670> momentum<00:01:26.790> but<00:01:27.180> right<00:01:27.420> now<00:01:27.540> it

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
pick up some momentum but right now it

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.390 
pick up some momentum but right now it
just<00:01:27.689> seems<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.049> there's<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.100> even<00:01:29.159> really

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
just seems like there's not even really

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.399 
just seems like there's not even really
