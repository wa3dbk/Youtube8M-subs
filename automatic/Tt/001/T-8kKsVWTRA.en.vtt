it back in its exact original condition

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.930 
it back in its exact original condition
originally<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.009> was<00:01:25.159> a<00:01:25.190> kind<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.640> an<00:01:25.759> ugly

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
originally it was a kind of an ugly

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.200 
originally it was a kind of an ugly
light<00:01:26.500> silver<00:01:27.500> that<00:01:27.619> had<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.770> blue<00:01:28.070> hue<00:01:29.000> to<00:01:29.180> it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
light silver that had a blue hue to it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.929 
light silver that had a blue hue to it
and<00:01:29.479> lipstick<00:01:30.200> red<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.470> tears<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.340> had<00:01:31.820> to

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
and lipstick red and tears so I had to

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.300 
and lipstick red and tears so I had to
keep<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.270> car<00:01:32.479> in<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.720> same<00:01:32.930> genre<00:01:33.259> being<00:01:34.220> a

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
keep the car in the same genre being a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.060 
keep the car in the same genre being a
grey<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.020> anthracite<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.830> worked

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
grey and so this anthracite I worked

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.380 
grey and so this anthracite I worked
with<00:01:37.250> Nissan<00:01:37.970> they<00:01:38.899> helped<00:01:39.170> me<00:01:39.319> with<00:01:39.350> colors

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
with Nissan they helped me with colors

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.370 
with Nissan they helped me with colors
samples<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.569> could<00:01:41.720> go<00:01:41.869> through<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.170> pick

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
samples that I could go through and pick

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.340 
samples that I could go through and pick
so<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.190> anthracite<00:01:43.580> color<00:01:43.970> then<00:01:44.240> has<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.020> warm

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
so the anthracite color then has a warm

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.520 
so the anthracite color then has a warm
hue<00:01:45.619> to<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.799> that<00:01:46.039> marries<00:01:46.429> into<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.530> interior

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
hue to it that marries into the interior

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.010 
hue to it that marries into the interior
