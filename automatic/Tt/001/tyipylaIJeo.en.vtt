everybody I talked to they love it
because<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.900> thing<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.170> if<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:39.800> don't<00:02:39.830> have

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100

image<00:02:40.460> stabilizer<00:02:41.360> on<00:02:41.690> your<00:02:42.290> lens<00:02:42.500> you're

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
image stabilizer on your lens you're

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.780 
image stabilizer on your lens you're
going<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.340> be<00:02:43.520> like<00:02:44.260> taking<00:02:45.260> videos<00:02:46.070> on<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.610> go

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
going to be like taking videos on the go

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.030 
going to be like taking videos on the go
and<00:02:47.060> it's<00:02:47.630> going<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.780> be<00:02:47.870> very<00:02:47.900> very<00:02:48.410> shaky

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
and it's going to be very very shaky

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.980 
and it's going to be very very shaky
even<00:02:49.670> with<00:02:49.850> it<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.240> have<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.480> hold<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.720> camera

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
even with it you have to hold the camera

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.860 
even with it you have to hold the camera
still<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:51.560> with<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.820> can<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:53.270> know<00:02:53.390> you

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
still but with it you can you know you

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.040 
still but with it you can you know you
don't<00:02:54.020> need<00:02:54.200> a<00:02:54.230> tripod<00:02:54.970> for<00:02:55.970> videos<00:02:56.360> you

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
don't need a tripod for videos you

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800 
don't need a tripod for videos you
definitely<00:02:57.320> need<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:57.830> and<00:02:58.070> also<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.180> an<00:02:59.330> f4

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
definitely need it and also it's an f4

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.890 
definitely need it and also it's an f4
which<00:03:00.320> means<00:03:00.650> it's<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.970> aperture<00:03:02.390> stays<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
which means it's the aperture stays the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.790 
which means it's the aperture stays the
same<00:03:03.190> from<00:03:04.960> whether<00:03:05.960> you<00:03:06.140> zoom<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.530> or<00:03:06.650> not

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
same from whether you zoom it or not

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.550 
same from whether you zoom it or not
like<00:03:07.490> the<00:03:07.640> kit<00:03:07.880> lens<00:03:07.910> it<00:03:08.480> doesn't<00:03:09.020> do<00:03:09.140> that<00:03:09.290> it

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
like the kit lens it doesn't do that it

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.040 
like the kit lens it doesn't do that it
sucks<00:03:09.920> meaning<00:03:10.610> anything<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.540> doesn't<00:03:11.720> suck

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
that is called the wide-angle sigma 10

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.010 
videos and you can zoom in in and out a
lot<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.970> know<00:04:05.000> i<00:04:05.330> would<00:04:05.690> get<00:04:05.840> this

lot and you know i would get this

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.710 
lot and you know i would get this
there's<00:04:06.230> also<00:04:06.410> 24<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.520> I<00:04:07.550> think<00:04:07.880> 70<00:04:08.330> millimeter

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
there's also 24 to I think 70 millimeter

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.250 
there's also 24 to I think 70 millimeter
which<00:04:09.350> is<00:04:09.560> f<00:04:09.740> 2.8<00:04:10.270> which<00:04:11.270> means<00:04:11.540> you<00:04:11.870> can<00:04:12.050> take

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
which is f 2.8 which means you can take

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
that was 24 this one a lot and the

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.149 
that was 24 this one a lot and the

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
greatest thing about the canyon lens is

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.480 
greatest thing about the canyon lens is
is<00:05:27.370> for<00:05:27.789> videography<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:28.870> film<00:05:29.229> you<00:05:30.130> can<00:05:30.340> do

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
is for videography and film you can do

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.050 
is for videography and film you can do
depth<00:05:30.729> of<00:05:30.970> field<00:05:31.570> see<00:05:32.050> how<00:05:32.110> you<00:05:32.229> can<00:05:32.440> focus<00:05:33.060> you

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
depth of field see how you can focus you

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.689 
depth of field see how you can focus you
know<00:05:34.090> manually<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:34.900> this<00:05:35.530> manual<00:05:35.979> focus<00:05:36.460> is

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
know manually and this manual focus is

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.879 
know manually and this manual focus is
you<00:05:36.880> know<00:05:36.970> used<00:05:37.240> to<00:05:37.389> be<00:05:37.479> used<00:05:37.750> on<00:05:37.990> like<00:05:38.530> twenty

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
you know used to be used on like twenty

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.980 
you know used to be used on like twenty
thirty<00:05:39.099> thousand<00:05:39.550> dollar<00:05:39.669> cameras<00:05:40.150> but<00:05:40.870> you

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
thirty thousand dollar cameras but you

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.430 
thirty thousand dollar cameras but you
can<00:05:41.110> do<00:05:41.289> it<00:05:41.320> with<00:05:41.500> dslrs<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.580> I<00:05:43.240> know<00:05:43.440> nikon

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
can do it with dslrs and I know nikon

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.670 
can do it with dslrs and I know nikon
nikon<00:05:44.889> has<00:05:44.949> the<00:05:45.610> same<00:05:45.789> thing<00:05:46.060> now<00:05:46.240> but<00:05:46.680> people

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
nikon has the same thing now but people

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.589 
nikon has the same thing now but people
are<00:05:47.770> saying<00:05:47.979> that<00:05:48.310> Canyon<00:05:49.060> is<00:05:49.150> much<00:05:49.330> better

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
are saying that Canyon is much better

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.129 
are saying that Canyon is much better
and<00:05:49.840> it's<00:05:50.530> also<00:05:50.710> much<00:05:51.130> better<00:05:51.430> a<00:05:51.870> more<00:05:52.870> cost

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
and it's also much better a more cost

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.240 
and it's also much better a more cost
effective<00:05:53.710> but<00:05:54.550> definitely<00:05:55.509> the<00:05:56.259> canyon<00:05:56.650> 7d

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
effective but definitely the canyon 7d

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.060 
effective but definitely the canyon 7d
is<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:58.840> best<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.289> think<00:05:59.530> right<00:05:59.650> now<00:05:59.830> because

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
is the best I think right now because

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.469 
is the best I think right now because
you<00:06:00.190> can<00:06:00.340> do<00:06:00.490> 1080p<00:06:02.250> 30<00:06:03.250> frames<00:06:03.969> per<00:06:04.060> second

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
you can do 1080p 30 frames per second

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.589 
you can do 1080p 30 frames per second
and<00:06:04.599> also<00:06:04.750> you<00:06:04.990> can<00:06:05.139> do<00:06:05.289> seven<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:07.000> can<00:06:07.150> do<00:06:07.270> 60

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
and also you can do seven you can do 60

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:11.159 
and also you can do seven you can do 60
frames<00:06:07.840> per<00:06:07.990> second<00:06:08.530> at<00:06:08.650> 720p<00:06:09.219> which<00:06:09.909> the<00:06:10.570> more

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
frames per second at 720p which the more

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.459 
frames per second at 720p which the more
expensive<00:06:11.500> 5d<00:06:12.190> mark<00:06:12.490> two<00:06:12.789> or<00:06:13.389> three<00:06:13.630> doesn't

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
expensive 5d mark two or three doesn't

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:17.820 
expensive 5d mark two or three doesn't
do<00:06:14.620> and<00:06:14.889> also<00:06:15.190> even<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:15.639> 1d<00:06:16.090> can't<00:06:16.449> do<00:06:16.599> that<00:06:16.830> I
