now<00:00:50.620> already<00:00:50.920> what<00:00:51.579> makes<00:00:51.789> it<00:00:51.910> different<00:00:52.090> well

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
now already what makes it different well

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.299

it<00:00:53.079> does<00:00:53.289> mix<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.620> whole<00:00:53.770> thing<00:00:53.980> with<00:00:54.129> the

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.189 
it does mix the whole thing with the
omen<00:00:54.760> so<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:55.120> guess<00:00:55.329> at<00:00:55.510> least<00:00:55.539> it's<00:00:55.840> not<00:00:55.899> doing

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
omen so I guess at least it's not doing

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.990 
omen so I guess at least it's not doing
another<00:00:56.379> ghosty<00:00:56.890> haunted<00:00:57.309> house<00:00:57.460> type<00:00:57.760> thing

to put down the camera if something

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.840

crazy happened and intervene with it
we'll<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.270> run<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.630> hell<00:02:31.810> away<00:02:32.010> now<00:02:33.010> I'm<00:02:33.250> in

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
we'll just run the hell away now I'm in

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.430 
we'll just run the hell away now I'm in
two<00:02:33.580> minds<00:02:33.820> about<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.240> movie<00:02:34.600> it<00:02:34.900> looks<00:02:34.930> okay

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
two minds about this movie it looks okay

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.170 
two minds about this movie it looks okay
but<00:02:35.470> as<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.920> said<00:02:35.980> I'm<00:02:36.280> getting<00:02:36.460> a<00:02:36.700> little<00:02:36.820> bored

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
but as I said I'm getting a little bored

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.390 
but as I said I'm getting a little bored
with<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.420> whole<00:02:37.600> POV<00:02:38.140> footage<00:02:38.380> thing<00:02:38.800> but<00:02:39.280> then

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
with a whole POV footage thing but then

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.370 
with a whole POV footage thing but then
again<00:02:39.550> it<00:02:39.940> is<00:02:40.270> doing<00:02:40.570> something<00:02:40.810> other<00:02:41.170> than

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
again it is doing something other than

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.170 
again it is doing something other than
just<00:02:41.530> copying<00:02:41.920> paranormal<00:02:42.460> activity<00:02:42.940> as

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
just copying paranormal activity as

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.940 
just copying paranormal activity as
seems<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.690> be<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.840> norm<00:02:43.930> these<00:02:44.260> days<00:02:44.320> so<00:02:44.920> I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
seems to be the norm these days so I

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.470 
seems to be the norm these days so I
guess<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.310> does<00:02:45.490> have<00:02:45.670> that<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:46.030> for<00:02:46.180> it

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
guess it does have that going for it

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.450 
guess it does have that going for it
still<00:02:47.170> when<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> best<00:02:47.860> thing<00:02:48.010> for<00:02:48.040> me<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
still when the best thing for me in the

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.010 
still when the best thing for me in the
trailer<00:02:48.670> was<00:02:48.940> listening<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.360> Etta<00:02:49.660> James

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020

singing<00:02:50.320> at<00:02:50.560> last<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.760> doesn't<00:02:52.030> really

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
singing at last then that doesn't really

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.790 
singing at last then that doesn't really
say<00:02:52.390> much<00:02:52.420> about<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.870> movie<00:02:53.140> really<00:02:53.560> grabbing

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
say much about the movie really grabbing

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.620 
say much about the movie really grabbing
my<00:02:53.980> attention<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:54.640> unless<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.450> film

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
my attention and unless the film

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.210 
my attention and unless the film
culminates<00:02:56.200> in<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.440> scene<00:02:56.620> where<00:02:56.860> we<00:02:56.890> get<00:02:57.100> to

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
culminates in a scene where we get to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.770 
culminates in a scene where we get to
