just like on the one before yell bow
this<00:01:37.350> should<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> fulcrum<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.250> should

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this should be that fulcrum it should

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.679 
this should be that fulcrum it should
just<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.549> stationary<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> you're<00:01:39.509> just

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just be stationary and you're just

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.380 
just be stationary and you're just
extending<00:01:39.930> from<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.409> joint<00:01:40.759> fulcrum<00:01:41.759> man<00:01:41.970> we

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
extending from that joint fulcrum man we

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.270 
extending from that joint fulcrum man we
need<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.630> define<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.990> fulcrum<00:01:43.530> means<00:01:43.770> because

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
need to define a fulcrum means because

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590 
need to define a fulcrum means because
these<00:01:44.430> YouTube<00:01:44.790> guys<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.240> don't<00:01:45.329> know<00:01:45.479> what

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
these YouTube guys they don't know what

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
these YouTube guys they don't know what
the<00:01:45.659> hell<00:01:45.780> fulcrum<00:01:46.229> means<00:01:46.439> when<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.920> talk

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the hell fulcrum means when you talk

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.140 
the hell fulcrum means when you talk
about<00:01:47.130> fulcrum<00:01:47.729> it's<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:49.110> a
