00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.059
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.410
 today we have guest core Matiaske was a 'dr 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.730
 international 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.460
 successful 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.549
 Photographers 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.660
 first the country 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.820
 are with us 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.170
 and Mr. Gruber is one 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.180
 the first of these or below 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.980
 Dr the new eBook 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.510
 the f2 8 400 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.180
 in July is in version 2 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.820
 therefore has 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.820
 But he also did not pick up for the new Action and 2 8 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.070
 the Alster 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.070
 402 8 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.780
 of course, always 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.780
 Nature photography is very popular 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.990
 not on that percent 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.580
 to make money 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.690
 sent a whole delegation 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.850
 just under a kilo and a half 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.870
 she can save here 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.360
 and say 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.050
 now make the job much easier 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.280
 Frank Hoffmann for a long time in itself 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.520
 I wanted 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 to demand legitimacy 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.040
 certainly very good with it 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.289
 without a tripod you work 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.569
 furthermore he is 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.569
 bitter tears 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.599
 that's just digital high-resolution 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.569
 SR DRS calculated 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.389
 at both predecessor model 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.769
 Integralis listed here is valid 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.769
 with these and many other public urinals 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:32.009
 had Barcelona 

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:36.219
 Cameron Diaz Seger is not the wallet photographer 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.109
 preconfigured that means you certainly have to be some as a pro 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:40.960
 settings 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.360
 in front of the grave take care of the camera keeping combination 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.289
 with such a great pass Super Glide 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.169
 can you explain us briefly 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.119
 how to adjust the camera in combination with this new lens 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.059
 yes of course you try 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.059
 the little chamber wants 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.189
 then we get our limits 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.579
 there decides 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.629
 respectively 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.629
 Recordings have come to the optimum result 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.749
 next to these purely configuration settings, I have myself 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.239
 in Vienna 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.259
 Settings for the BBC station 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.259
 to get quick access to it 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.269
 if yes where speed 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.919
 but at the top 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.609
 that sports doctor may well be different that minister 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:33.099
 must change 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.259
 She often traveled to functions that were previously often laborious 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.169
 To go in hand if objects push before or not you have to 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.009
 fast may change a bit slowly maybe very much 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.859
 slowly 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.089
 such is a function that needs so often 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:49.669
 The Tigers are going very high up 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:52.369
 Why 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.219
 very well after guided tours modern 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.939
 determine if the marriage 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.239
 if you did that-word reck 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.189
 back to the House of Lords main focus here is Nokia n8 Utility should be there 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.249
 in the chart also the one athletes 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.639
 the transmitter network as I also very fast custom under certain circumstances 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.179
 must change very quickly 

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:13.959
 is the savior continuing with expanded 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.150
 Harsefeld 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.849
 Pauli looks here too 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:22.109
 Ball sports like political grade "good" and only 4 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.580
 Bravo transfer a lot of horizontal tails 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.419
 around the many themselves 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:28.710
 in my experience 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.580
 if you now use free field left and right 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.610
 it can be that one answers to get better pictures 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.050
 and 9 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.719
 Environment 7 give the Heidfeld some spectators 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.719
 the producers are these people needed 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:44.050
 Arndt because of districts 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.780
 besides a few other things 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.999
 to have 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.979
 very important point for me to stay as it is 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.979
 and be a bracelet of my favorite bunch 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.279
 if I have to work someone very well mode at stotel agree 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.900
 to 99 percent of it is omitted 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.180
 Why 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.180
 I'm using percent HF tone 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:12.249
 to focus 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.569
 so it's always my team Milram configured in the setting like that 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.819
 with the album were focused 

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:24.790
 the trigger that the depressed mean so that the pressed 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.790
 Â«We are allowed to set the momentum the correct exposure 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.100
 An advanced features in the killer at the beginning is from the 3 0 over 2 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.740
 80 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.509
 very reserved 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.920
 it is this as 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.920
 Stock Kassel 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.430
 Premiere position 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.139
 and now put too deep again 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.089
 is distributed 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:50.900
 to stop the time 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.900
 mainly dapd zoom at the only market 4 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.220
 in the parking lot everything else 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.419
 switch 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.129
 Here I want too 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:04.099
 fast forward 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.629
 of 1 4 million to switch to fire protection you can also with others 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.110
 Occupy functions 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.059
 for example, a storage 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:14.059
 which makes sense and another 500 dead 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.910
 or a quick change from Ryser to fire protection 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.910
 there are no limits knows 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.520
 then they want to commit to commit in practice 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.909
 why 200 stopped 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:40.559
 sell as possible 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.189
 yes the weather conditions are 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:57.330
 not optimally it rains and 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.969
 is a bit cloudy 

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:01.230
 Sense the results 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.230
 Made with a lot of snow from the road 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.189
 all pictures 

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:09.289
 pop starlet 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.270
 through the fast autofocus 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.189
 in principle considered correct 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:17.189
 I hope that I arrived there 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.659
 today is final in the last few days together what to say 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.979
 absolutely satisfied 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.969
 a clear development 

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:30.960
 Predecessor 402 8 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.770
 Make 1 as 2 this time 

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.990
 at 7 like no other 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.399
 weight loss 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:40.399
 the books fill the picture quality is outstanding 

00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:44.369
 move and had there sometimes on the site 

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:49.759
 the manicured should 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.289
 t
