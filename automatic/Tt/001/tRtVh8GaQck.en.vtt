00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that's the reason why I'm running long

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.620 
that's the reason why I'm running long
barrel<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> increase<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.240> range<00:01:45.390> by

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
barrel and just to increase the range by

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.899 
barrel and just to increase the range by
a<00:01:45.659> little<00:01:45.990> bit<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.320> yeah<00:01:47.159> but<00:01:47.340> basically<00:01:47.670> guys

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
a little bit and yeah but basically guys

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
a little bit and yeah but basically guys
I<00:01:48.210> ended<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.659> getting<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> 96<00:01:49.710> kill<00:01:49.950> streak<00:01:50.250> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
I ended up getting a 96 kill streak and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.450 
I ended up getting a 96 kill streak and
I<00:01:50.850> believe<00:01:50.909> three<00:01:51.689> swarms<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.409> one<00:01:52.619> life<00:01:52.799> so
