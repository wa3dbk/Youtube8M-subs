00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
by bestest this year so I was really

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.240 
by bestest this year so I was really
looking<00:00:06.810> forward<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:07.109> try<00:00:07.350> them<00:00:07.529> they're<00:00:08.220> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
looking forward to try them they're a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.450 
looking forward to try them they're a
short<00:00:08.580> season<00:00:08.790> variety<00:00:09.450> because<00:00:10.309> we<00:00:11.309> only

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
short season variety because we only

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.419 
short season variety because we only
have<00:00:11.670> about<00:00:11.700> three<00:00:12.210> months<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:13.070> real<00:00:14.070> summer

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
up here so we can't grow the longer

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.529 
up here so we can't grow the longer
righties<00:00:17.160> they<00:00:17.369> typically<00:00:18.150> grow<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
righties they typically grow in the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.400 
righties they typically grow in the
farther<00:00:18.779> south<00:00:19.640> when<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.730> come<00:00:21.410> they're
