00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:10.050
 now a different employee in the field of 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.480
 training here in Guarani in Campinas 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:17.000
 we hear about afa River 150 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.810
 in fact the variation of the same theme 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.900
 headlight adjustment 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.670
 what a lot of people are picking up by pulling 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.590
 fairing dismount leave everything 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.939
 loose 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.649
 I do not think I want to leave a story 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:43.290
 13,000 miles here. 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:45.930
 in 1983 3 thousand km and without surprises because 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.710
 was to expect death really 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.809
 very good, only one difference is making 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 32 with liter 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.629
 I do not know if it's because of the fuel 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.649
 I changed myself putting podium with br 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:05.610
 95 octane suddenly can a 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.220
 difference and does not have an explanation of 30 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.369
 went on to make 32 really excellent 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.770
 in relation to the lighthouse does not 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.650
 turn off to absolutely nothing if 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.000
 connecting to unscrew nothing is too much 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.049
 simple with the bike on the jirau trestle 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.049
 handlebar to the left 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.350
 I thought you'd adjust the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:43.229
 headlight turns one side over the other spoke up 10 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 our simple simple too 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.329
 remember that the pomegranate is now 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.570
 launching a new line 2014 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.450
 the similarity of the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.280
 firemen on duty there 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.360
 see far more that I see again that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.520
 practically the same bike same design 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.710
 or made in the same place 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.739
 the tank will make a novelty for the most 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.500
 tuned, folks earned a hug 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.270
 more forward and back and remembering 3 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.350
 In km the bike is perfect is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.800
 perfect settle a hug until 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.800
 next
