00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.970
 add and worldwide 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.260
 attention deficit disorder with or without 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.330
 hyperactivity for 1 in 20 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 young people with children who and attention too 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.570
 have a short disorder but not 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.070
 Being hyperactive is also spoken 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.750
 from hdd 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.359
 the disorder can end life at home 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 strongly influence school and with friends 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.590
 symptoms such as inattention 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.119
 impulsivity and hyperactivity 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.890
 the negative impact on it 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.689
 ability of someone to be his or her 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.300
 to steer and to act 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.950
 concentrate without being distracted 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.110
 some are skeptical about the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.329
 disorder but by neuroimaging of the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.190
 brains investigation by brain scans 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.200
 found that ADHD symptoms 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.850
 related to a series 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.399
 deviations in development and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.170
 functioning of the brain 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.469
 let's start with the cerebral cortex 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.210
 the outer layer of the brains, the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.010
 cerebral cortex that play an important role 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.640
 plays in the brain functions that work with 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.489
 memory 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.020
 thinking attention and dealing with language 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.600
 in normal development 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.740
 slowly increase our maximum thickness 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.810
 thickness to reach in the teens 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.070
 Brain scans have been shown in children 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.229
 with ADD 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 the cerebral cortex on the frontal and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.549
 temporal brain regions on average 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.350
 slower to grow those areas that are whole 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.159
 important for memory and it 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 act in a planned way as opposed to 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.860
 people without ADHD are with people with 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.380
 ADD the frontal cortex and others 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.090
 parts of the brain and often smaller 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.950
 all these parts of the brain work 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.290
 not autonomous but work intensively 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.810
 together to form networks for the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.520
 control of tasks such as language 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.520
 attention regulation and motor skills 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.399
 the degree of difference in activity 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.079
 between those different networks 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.360
 translates into different 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.189
 brain functions 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.539
 so falls for example while now to 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.430
 watch this video 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.439
 observe an increased activity 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.090
 in the brain networks for processing 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.039
 of information 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.909
 but a reduced activity in the 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.189
 networks 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.349
 responsible for the daydreaming mind 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.479
 won ring 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.239
 for people with ADD, the effect of 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.890
 these networks are disrupted 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.310
 connections between the networks 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.959
 broken and when we interacted 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.459
 between these networks up close 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.350
 see 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.350
 there is a disturbed issue 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.549
 of dopamine and noradrenaline 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.780
 two chemicals that 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.549
 be responsible for it 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.209
 exchanging signals between 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.209
 brain cells 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.549
 when children with ADD have certain tasks 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.040
 are usually some of them 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.390
 their brain networks under activated 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.549
 while others are over again 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.260
 activate global research 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.090
 has shown that in the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 development and functioning of the brain 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.290
 for persons with ADD 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.239
 major differences occur today 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.220
 it is currently impossible to via 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.630
 brain scans diagnose this 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.430
 condition 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.440
 However the more we find out about it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.940
 adhd and the brain 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.739
 the better we are able to 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.620
 Understand symptoms that affect children 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.160
 battling with ADD every day in life 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.720
 to have 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.720
 and the better we can help him
