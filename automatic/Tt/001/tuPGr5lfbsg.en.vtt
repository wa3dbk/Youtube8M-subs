really developed an affection for for

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.859 
really developed an affection for for
the<00:01:22.740> whole<00:01:22.890> aesthetic<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.970> genre<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> I

the whole aesthetic of the genre and I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.840 
the whole aesthetic of the genre and I
always<00:01:25.680> thought<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.100> there<00:01:26.369> had<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.670> be<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
always thought there there had to be a

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.219 
always thought there there had to be a
way<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.840> bring<00:01:28.280> that<00:01:29.280> aesthetic<00:01:29.850> into<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
way to to bring that aesthetic into a

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.460 
way to to bring that aesthetic into a
modern-day<00:01:31.229> comedic<00:01:32.070> setting<00:01:32.729> without

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
modern-day comedic setting without

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.200 
modern-day comedic setting without
changing<00:01:34.470> really<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> Western<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.030> if

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
changing really what a Western is so if

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.550 
changing really what a Western is so if
you<00:01:36.329> always<00:01:36.570> had<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.930> thing<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> you'd<00:01:37.380> like

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you always had the thing that you'd like

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.460 
you always had the thing that you'd like
to<00:01:37.740> set<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.130> comedy<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> western<00:01:39.750> genre<00:01:39.900> is

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to set a comedy in in a western genre is

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.810 
to set a comedy in in a western genre is
if<00:01:40.590> something<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.860> comes<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.159> recently<00:01:41.490> or
