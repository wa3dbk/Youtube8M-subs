00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.620
 you 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.380
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.600
 we are in a new important news 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.099
 Many of you told me that you wanted 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.230
 to talk about the subject and attention 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.720
 all because this is what I have 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.450
 found and what is known up to 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.910
 these hours one as they say are and 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.029
 prohibits the resale of games or the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.579
 second hand in its terms of use and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.410
 many people are throwing themselves away 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.450
 hands to the head saying yes this 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.309
 will imply that they will not be able to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.250
 elbows sell second hand 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.660
 nothing is to be clear now they are 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.550
 terms of use 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.800
 they have to before the law and so to speak 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.629
 some way almost everything even the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.269
 movies tell you that you can not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.429
 sell that etc. etcetera you know 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.289
 they are terms of use 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.050
 It must be said that precision 4 is not going to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.359
 include trm or anti second hand or anything 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.730
 of those thousand chickens in vinegar or areas 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.899
 in samoa or anything like that just 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.730
 computer entertaiment you know updated 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.830
 this November the terms of use 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.750
 you already know that they must accept 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.750
 access different services 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.240
 playstation network a clause in 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.210
 these terms expressly prohibit the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.370
 resale of second-hand games 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.050
 thing that has been there now you know 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.330
 credit in the company has realized 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.860
 but this has been there for 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.740
 a lot of time even in games 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.530
 previous in playstation 2 in in expos 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.630
 this update also becomes 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.810
 Terms of use are due to the fact that 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.220
 accept the players say you should not 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.620
 resell the hardware software 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.330
 nor the downloadable software to the being that 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.610
 have our express authorization 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.650
 and the editor's in case they were 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.420
 different from us despite 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.150
 incorporate this clause whose link I'm going 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.190
 to put description 3 or 4 the new 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.410
 console from the Japanese company makes us 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.360
 regret with technical limitations that 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.610
 block combos second hand 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.820
 what players can we can 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.640
 exchange our games without any 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.340
 problem so that the measure seems to be 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.230
 because the measure is focused on the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.730
 buying and selling second-hand games 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.519
 even though 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.580
 that the sun connection does not include 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.110
 no kind of special lock puts 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.930
 difficult that this situation is 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.060
 situation is officially controlled 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.629
 therefore you do not have to have any 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.299
 fear 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.220
 neeson and will ban the second hand 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.750
 or anything like that because that depends 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.209
 of third-party stores like gamestop 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.860
 woods by etc. etcetera is worth so 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.450
 you know how always forming the 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.950
 last synthesis some doubt we will continue 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.989
 reporting on this subject as you go 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.569
 being more information and you know 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.140
