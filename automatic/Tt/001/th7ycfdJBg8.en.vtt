00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
think of myself as a British artist and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.530 
think of myself as a British artist and
I've<00:01:45.509> never<00:01:45.689> had<00:01:45.930> much<00:01:46.590> come<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.729> way<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.270> terms

of like shows in Britain so I'd like to
do<00:01:51.810> something<00:01:52.680> big<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.549> Britain<00:01:53.909> actually<00:01:54.509> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
do something big in Britain actually the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.670 
do something big in Britain actually the
speech<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:55.020> great<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> was<00:01:55.530> really

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
speech was great and it was really

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.319 
speech was great and it was really
interesting<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.219> said<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.460> making<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
interesting what you said about making a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940 
interesting what you said about making a
difference<00:01:57.630> to<00:01:57.689> British<00:01:57.990> culture<00:01:58.439> yeah<00:01:58.710> which

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
difference to British culture yeah which

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.499 
difference to British culture yeah which
I<00:01:59.250> guess<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> Turner<00:02:00.000> Prize<00:02:00.060> debate

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
I guess is what the Turner Prize debate

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.030 
I guess is what the Turner Prize debate
that's<00:02:00.810> how<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.229> yourself<00:02:01.320> an<00:02:01.710> artist

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that's how you see yourself an artist

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.200 
that's how you see yourself an artist
and<00:02:02.189> that's<00:02:02.369> why<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> thought<00:02:02.759> we'd<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.060> all

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
and that's why I thought we'd it all

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.580 
and that's why I thought we'd it all
right<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> most<00:02:03.659> disappointing<00:02:04.259> thing<00:02:04.439> for

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
completely slates you but I had this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.080 
completely slates you but I had this
idea<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.990> would<00:02:31.620> make<00:02:32.040> work<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.700> had

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
idea that I would make work that had

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.560 
idea that I would make work that had
some<00:02:33.720> effect<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.250> maybe<00:02:35.550> this<00:02:35.940> maybe<00:02:36.270> this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
some effect and maybe this maybe this

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.030 
some effect and maybe this maybe this
tells<00:02:36.870> me<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.140> maybe<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.410> ever<00:02:37.650> don't<00:02:37.860> know

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
tells me that maybe I ever don't know

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.720 
tells me that maybe I ever don't know
but<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:39.240> by<00:02:39.540> my<00:02:39.750> art<00:02:40.050> world<00:02:40.290> peers<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.520> maybe

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
but it is by my art world peers so maybe

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.020 
but it is by my art world peers so maybe
it<00:02:41.850> isn't<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.300> still<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:42.930> know<00:02:43.970> portunity<00:02:44.970> to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
it isn't I still don't know portunity to

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.240 
it isn't I still don't know portunity to
do<00:02:45.240> more<00:02:45.750> work<00:02:45.930> that<00:02:46.170> has<00:02:46.290> that's<00:02:46.740> when<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.100> get
