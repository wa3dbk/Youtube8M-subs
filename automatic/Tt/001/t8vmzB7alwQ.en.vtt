 Welcome to Summoners, the League of Legends Lore, featuring, Graves, the Outlaw 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.572
 Malcolm Graves was born behind a tavern in Bilgewater and was left there with a bottle of enriched milk. 

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:20.997
 During his childhood, he survived the pirate slums using every dirty trick he possessed. 

00:00:20.997 --> 00:00:27.713
 Determined to build a new life, he found the first ship to the continent that could hide on board. 

00:00:27.713 --> 00:00:39.252
 However, the gloomy realities of the world forced him to prolong his life in the unpleasant underworld of city-states, jumped the boundaries whenever things got too hot. 

00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:48.716
 In a high-stakes game of cards, he faced Twisted Fate. The two turned four aces in the final hand. 

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:52.251
 It was the first time a swindler had found his equal. 

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:57.805
 The two formed an alliance, cheating at the tables and splitting in the alleys afterwards. 

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:04.842
 Together they ran the streets - accumulating tokens, decks, and accusations. 

00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:14.655
 Unfortunately Graves made the mistake of earning a huge sum of Dr. Aregor Priggs, an official and high-level Zaunita businessman. 

00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:19.608
 When Priggs discovered how he had played, he became obsessed with revenge. 

00:01:19.608 --> 00:01:32.713
 He knew that Twisted Fate had an uncontrollable urge to master spells and he readily offered an exchange: delivering Graves in exchange for a record in a procedure that would fulfill his desire. 

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:40.320
 Twisted Fate accepted at once - he and Graves knew the risks of this partnership, but the offer was too good. 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:51.380
 As soon as captured, Priggs took Graves to a place built to arrest men whose crimes - or more precisely their punishments - were made to stay away from others. 

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:58.520
 Graves had endured years of prison at the hands of Zaun's most unscrupulous guards before he escaped. 

00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:05.440
 One of his fellow detainees introduced him to a gunsmith who modified his shotgun exactly the way he wanted. 

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:13.640
 After visiting Priggs, Graves joined the League of Legends with two targets: Twisted Fate and the change. 

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:21.880
