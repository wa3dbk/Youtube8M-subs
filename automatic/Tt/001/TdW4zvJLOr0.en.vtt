00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.379
 I will show you how to prepare a sofa a goal of a future for the 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:05.080
 ratio 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.920
 so why such a sofa must a first product this product 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.539
 is called interesting stripper 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.979
 as its name says it says it is to say that it will lift the varnish 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.639
 leather and fat 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.130
 that is to say that will raise all the fat that leather could 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.070
 return during his life 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.410
 we will use the second product that is called ready for the race the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.599
 we approach a product that opens the ports of leather 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.599
 which will facilitate the penetration of color 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.629
 to strip grease and we will use a content cloth 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.290
 and that the product does not debate a disaster 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.450
 with haircuts is to five neighborhood kids indeed thanks to the leather 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.040
 in order to prepare it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.740
 Provence 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.730
 if you see that once is not paid the figure libye and sal the others 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.560
 were 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.620
 become more and more blog so 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.380
 specific to the convention 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.020
 we will go to the second phase, that is to say, to the passage of 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.750
 approach 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.910
 I advise you for its part to use but if stone 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.270
 a year ago plastic lids and if someone for the applicator provided 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 in the kit 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.280
 I poured the format close to a plastic container I unite with my 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.280
 time for conventional plastic lid sensors 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.860
 he deserves some safe preforms 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.090
 mangou a point more than land 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.030
 I retain in excess 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.540
 on the other side the funds thanks to the lid and then that I apply but we 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.649
 foresees skirmishes on the leather a not so much of course 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.150
 you see that we 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.140
 penetrating the product 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.780
 loved his eardrum 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.240
 of yesterday use the cover made to remove the excess 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.830
 to see the company pass correctly all simple 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.160
 too much a meter to the public fortune 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.500
 it takes several applications for prepared mobiles 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
 the support 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.940
 and that's how 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 we finish preparing a seat 

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.900
 I now pass the third step, that is, the coloring 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.560
 so to color the sofa 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 we will use the same shops for the passage of the loan for 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.550
 do not approach this to say 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.820
 a container and a plastic lid and so as a springboard for 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.669
 applicators that is provided I remind you in the team 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.529
 I paid the resident color damant and one of a cycle 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.450
 so I'm using it now 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.769
 - the independent 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.799
 johnny b slightly less taxes in front of the ecologists like this 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.989
 a little more 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:38.979
 following 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.009
 the musicolor excess water I'm retiring thanks 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.439
 covered hamon 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.009
 and then I will apply 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:50.009
 my color on the leather like this site 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.869
 we take a little color 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.279
 I tap again to remove the excess 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.589
 ppg a click on the leather 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.359
 spent the first time you notice 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.719
 for lack of small bubbles if it is small bubble is when you wear too much 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:13.520
 soaked 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.170
 so for you so far we still find on their ability to 5 of 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.599
 remove the excess 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.599
 in his colors and then you come back 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:26.329
 in the same place to attract just these little bubbles like this 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.989
 then you continue your ration 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.310
 the leather the tops to a smooth surface that I advise you to cross 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.630
 many things this will save you 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.580
 to have missed out on a little bashing so have a color of the words 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.869
 gene 

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:46.429
 I applied but two hits and eco and we can see that our 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:48.699
 fine leather and our homogeneous colors 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:49.919
 p uniform 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.309
 we will now move to the 4th and final step of their coloring 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.449
 that is fixing 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:56.620
 we use 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.470
 at active qg a world that is represented a good ground ball that 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.169
 we pass in the following way without mercy 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.209
 about 2 5 km from the fief 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.299
 in support of 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.809
 jevtana not knowing too much and not continuously 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:14.469
 the title satay his novels of what is color 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.269
 on the surface and making a 66 card 

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:23.629
 after complete drying of the products that is to say it is that they take advantage of it 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:24.150
 he said 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.220
 we can because the difference between our front sofa 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.360
 you can see that with the application of the products we 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.989
 Let's find all the nobility of leather
