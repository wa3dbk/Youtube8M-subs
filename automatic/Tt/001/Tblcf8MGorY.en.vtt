paved with diamonds now let's take a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.570 
paved with diamonds now let's take a
closer<00:00:44.160> look<00:00:45.470> the<00:00:46.470> pave<00:00:46.739> style<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.280> form<00:00:47.520> of

closer look the pave style is a form of

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.190 
closer look the pave style is a form of
bead<00:00:47.790> setting<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.720> first<00:00:48.960> thing<00:00:49.110> to

bead setting the first thing to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
bead setting the first thing to
understand<00:00:49.470> about<00:00:49.500> bead<00:00:49.860> setting<00:00:50.129> is<00:00:50.340> that

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
understand about bead setting is that

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.130 
understand about bead setting is that
the<00:00:50.610> gems<00:00:50.879> are<00:00:51.059> set<00:00:51.239> directly<00:00:51.720> into<00:00:52.050> the

the gems are set directly into the

the gems are set directly into the
surface<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.680> metal<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.730> how<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.030> bead

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
surface of the metal so how is bead

surface of the metal so how is bead
setting<00:00:54.480> done<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.800> hole<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.280> drilled

stone then the gym is placed into that
impression<00:01:03.690> then<00:01:04.649> the<00:01:04.800> jeweler<00:01:05.100> uses<00:01:05.430> a

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
impression then the jeweler uses a

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.180 
impression then the jeweler uses a
finely<00:01:05.940> pointed<00:01:06.270> tool<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:07.080> push<00:01:07.350> tiny<00:01:07.830> bits<00:01:08.070> of

finally<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> jeweler<00:01:11.430> finishes<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> metal

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
finally the jeweler finishes the metal

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570 
finally the jeweler finishes the metal
by<00:01:12.600> rounding<00:01:13.259> and<00:01:13.350> smoothing<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> into<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> bead

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
by rounding and smoothing it into a bead

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.200 
by rounding and smoothing it into a bead

metal holding the gems in there is a
greater<00:01:36.990> chance<00:01:37.290> than<00:01:37.560> falling<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.280> they

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
greater chance than falling out if they

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.609 
greater chance than falling out if they
weren't<00:01:38.760> set<00:01:39.000> properly<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.510> begin<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.960> or<00:01:40.229> if

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
weren't set properly to begin with or if

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.859 
weren't set properly to begin with or if
the<00:01:40.740> ring<00:01:40.920> gets<00:01:41.100> hit<00:01:41.280> particularly<00:01:41.640> hard

the ring gets hit particularly hard

the ring gets hit particularly hard
however<00:01:42.869> since<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.799> gems<00:01:44.010> are<00:01:44.190> so<00:01:44.430> small<00:01:44.790> they

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
however since the gems are so small they

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.700 
however since the gems are so small they
are<00:01:45.240> generally<00:01:45.689> fairly<00:01:46.049> inexpensive<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
are generally fairly inexpensive to

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.370 
are generally fairly inexpensive to
replace<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:48.450> takeaway<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:48.900> is<00:01:49.290> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
replace the takeaway here is that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.289 
replace the takeaway here is that
cheaply<00:01:49.860> made<00:01:50.130> pave<00:01:50.610> jewelry<00:01:50.939> will<00:01:51.060> likely

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
cheaply made pave jewelry will likely

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.030 
cheaply made pave jewelry will likely
end<00:01:51.570> up<00:01:51.630> costing<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.170> more<00:01:52.200> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.560> long<00:01:52.619> run

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
end up costing you more in the long run

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.310 
end up costing you more in the long run
if<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.000> pave<00:01:54.240> look<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:54.960> better<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
if you like the pave look it's better to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.960 
if you like the pave look it's better to
pay<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.770> extra<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.400> beginning<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
pay a little extra in the beginning and

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.480 
pay a little extra in the beginning and
end<00:01:57.299> up<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.600> quality<00:01:57.960> piece<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:59.220> now<00:01:59.430> you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
end up with a quality piece so now you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.399 
end up with a quality piece so now you
know<00:01:59.790> all<00:01:59.820> about<00:02:00.090> bead<00:02:00.540> setting<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.960> how<00:02:01.320> if

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
know all about bead setting and how if

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.200 
know all about bead setting and how if
you<00:02:01.500> put<00:02:01.530> several<00:02:02.009> bead<00:02:02.310> set<00:02:02.580> gems<00:02:02.880> close
