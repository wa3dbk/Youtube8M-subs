00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.460
 hi all this is a guide to 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.559
 survival to teach everything that 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.860
 we need to know in the video game is 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:10.809
 trenc the deep 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.150
 The first thing I'm going to teach is how 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.270
 crafter all the objects of the game 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.789
 The materials we need are 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.759
 woods and leaves of palm trees rocks 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.169
 and rope that is extracted from the yucca for 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.689
 create objects we put all the 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.059
 materials together on the ground and with the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.610
 clikar mouse and we can already create our 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:35.250
 object in this case to create an ax 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.470
 we need a trunk a stone and one 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.470
 of rope and we have our cross 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.280
 I'm going to create a hammer for it 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.489
 we need two stones a trunk and a 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.489
 rope 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.850
 the hammer is used to make things 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.850
 later 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.840
 now I'm going to build a knife for 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.580
 we have to work the stone 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.460
 we take a normal rock and we give it to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.420
 an ax or with a machete and we have 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.670
 the worked rock 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.890
 to build the knife we ​​need 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 a rock worked a trunk and a 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.100
 rope 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.510
 to make a spear we need two 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.790
 trunks a rope and a stone 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.470
 worked 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.470
 the spear serves us to fish 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.750
 I'm going to explain how to make a field one 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.340
 campfire the campfire has three levels the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.229
 First 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.619
 is this that we are going to build with six 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.619
 trunks 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.600
 and now to improve it we have to 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600
 Add 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.940
 6 rock 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.700
 we put them on the ground next to the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.400
 campfire and we can improve it by the second 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.940
 level and now we're going to add three feet 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.940
 three trunks 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.950
 in rope 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.450
 and with this we would have the campfire 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.450
 improved to the maximum 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.210
 Now I will explain the basics 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.850
 basic of the game 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.220
 by pressing the f we see our clock and if 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.540
 we click once we see our level of 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.540
 health of hunger and thirst 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.220
 to recover from thirst we have a 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.040
 water bottle from the beginning that 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 we can drink the infinite water not 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 spend this water bottle 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.420
 the other way we have to get rid of 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.370
 the thirst is drinking the water from the coconuts 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.980
 We can find the coconuts in the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.800
 palm trees with the soil we have to 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:28.640
 cut it and when I put that I do not 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.490
 we can drink 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.280
 we take care of it and we can see each other 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.030
 or we can also eat it we return it 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.030
 shorten 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.739
 and now we can command 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.270
 we can also eat crabs we are going to 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.100
 look for one 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.900
 we can only eat the crabs 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.900
 browns the greens are poisonous 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.390
 when we have a crab we go to the 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.700
 improved bonfire 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.470
 we turn it on and we can put the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.470
 crab inside to cook 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.610
 when we got this noise that is already 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.079
 done and we can take it and see you with 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.470
 This can also be done with what 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.470
 we fish 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.180
 I will teach how to fish when 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.500
 let's have the spear we can catch all 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.750
 the fish there 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.030
 in water 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.070
 there are some that are poisonous and others that 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.750
 not all that have colors 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.860
 I recommend not to catch them because 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:43.340
 as you see if you look at my arm 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.139
 I ate one of colors and poisoned gave me 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.800
 an allergic reaction or something like that and I 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.470
 they came out a lot of gusts 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.259
 it is best to eat well-known fish 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.060
 like sardines and things like that 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.060
 they can eat even raw 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.370
 here you see the welts that came out 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.350
 for eating the colorful fish 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.930
 all the objects that we may need 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.070
 of game like compass the parts of the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.910
 motor axes and others are in the 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.040
 shipwrecks 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.690
 we have to search the boats 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.690
 sunk and get objects 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.729
 if you want to know how to make a boat 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.259
 Engine click the link below the 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.130
 I have in another video explained step to 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.130
 step how to do it 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.539
 and if you want to know how to make a house 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.129
 click on the following link that I have 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.820
 also another video explaining all the 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:45.770
 parts of the house 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.540
 I hope the video has been of 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.540
 utility and until next time
