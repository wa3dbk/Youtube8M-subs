00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
carry a film on their shoulders but even

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.570 
carry a film on their shoulders but even
he<00:04:05.420> is<00:04:05.569> fully<00:04:05.900> aware<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.740> this<00:04:07.010> juggernaut

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
he is fully aware that this juggernaut

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.830 
he is fully aware that this juggernaut
won't<00:04:08.180> last<00:04:08.450> forever

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.690 

it's<00:04:12.840> a<00:04:12.900> very<00:04:13.049> difficult<00:04:13.260> answer<00:04:14.159> to<00:04:14.280> give<00:04:14.459> but

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
it's a very difficult answer to give but

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.930 
it's a very difficult answer to give but
right<00:04:14.939> now<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.450> would<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:15.989> that<00:04:16.820> you<00:04:17.820> know

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
right now I would think that you know

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.259 
right now I would think that you know
five<00:04:18.750> six<00:04:19.009> whatever<00:04:20.009> years<00:04:20.250> four<00:04:20.759> five<00:04:21.030> six

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
five six whatever years four five six

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.950 
five six whatever years four five six
years<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.900> then<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:23.330> would<00:04:24.330> just<00:04:24.539> like<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.720> walk

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
years and then I would just like to walk

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.570 
years and then I would just like to walk
away<00:04:25.580> for<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.610> while<00:04:26.820> do<00:04:27.300> nothing<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:29.310> know

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
away for a while do nothing and you know

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.939 
away for a while do nothing and you know
mold<00:04:29.759> myself<00:04:30.240> into<00:04:30.539> a<00:04:30.570> into<00:04:31.080> into<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> different

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
mold myself into a into into a different

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.110 
mold myself into a into into a different
zone<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.720> maybe<00:04:33.720> come<00:04:34.020> back<00:04:34.229> in<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.800> in<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.880> a

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
zone and maybe come back in a in in a

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.210

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
very strong as a very strong character

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.120 
very strong as a very strong character
as<00:04:38.759> as<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.330> De<00:04:39.449> Niro's<00:04:39.780> of<00:04:40.020> you<00:04:41.009> know

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
as as the De Niro's of you know

as as the De Niro's of you know
Hollywood<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.850> things<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.210> this<00:04:43.370> but<00:04:44.370> the

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 
Hollywood and things like this but the

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.029 
Hollywood and things like this but the
point<00:04:45.330> is<00:04:45.539> that<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:46.289> is<00:04:46.440> what<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.590> feel<00:04:46.830> today

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
point is that this is what I feel today

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.390 
point is that this is what I feel today
but<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.530> walk<00:04:49.740> away<00:04:49.979> before<00:04:50.130> you

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
but that that you walk away before you

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.460 
but that that you walk away before you
are<00:04:50.520> kicked<00:04:50.729> out<00:04:50.910> but<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.020> fact<00:04:52.259> is<00:04:52.440> that

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
are kicked out but the fact is that

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.860 
are kicked out but the fact is that
nobody<00:04:53.430> knows<00:04:53.639> that<00:04:53.699> when<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.330> point<00:04:54.660> at

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
nobody knows that when that point at

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.510 
nobody knows that when that point at
