00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.030
 was a model that we advise to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.950
 use then it is a more 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.130
 that tinkers with a bit of a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.379
 urban land with a land plot 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.039
 but not a cross aggressiveness 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.289
 country 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.600
 she is composed of spring is an option 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.430
 also the haunting or spring of 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.920
 different natures and she also has 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.869
 an option to adjust the preload of the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.880
 spring to suit you according to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.619
 with your preference in relation to 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.570
 hardness that the suspension works in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.149
 August the number is 1 practically one 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.940
 bomb of a polymer that would be 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.219
 practically a rubber and he works 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.890
 together with the spring that takes place 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.469
 spring all the energy you put her 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.899
 returns you to compress the spring returns the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.210
 elastomer it already has a bit of a 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.980
 cushioning people is slower than 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.510
 spring if you like a longer suspension 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.399
 fast is ideal you use it only 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.859
 with ball if you prefer a suspension 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 that have a little more damping the 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.899
 ideal is to merge the ball with a 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.899
 shadow 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.590
 You have to do it only once in a while. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.120
 opened to give a modified then 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.010
 works with grease and was usually 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.050
 mounted in this way and mainly by 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.210
 account of the ball and she also did not 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.270
 chemical influence if you use the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.160
 correct spelling and what happens with 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.550
 elastomer time the fact that it is a 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.350
 rubber it has a deterioration is 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.540
 more or less the period of one year he 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 ask for some of his properties already 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.290
 of damping to hold and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.690
 to work with the ball the ball is not the ball is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.670
 an item that lasts a long period 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.680
 but I'm better off with each one 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.720
 year and should occur in the other care 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 of this expression, which is the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.740
 the more external we recommend is 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.830
 always clean the rods then 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.210
 a soft cloth and follow united make the 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.399
 cleaning of this region where 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.550
 usually we have personal calls from 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.920
 guard dust that holds the dirt so he 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.780
 retains dirt and this dirt may 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.970
 small abrasive particles such as 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.380
 example where where during work 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.149
 the suspension can come to the letter 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.860
 special treatment of asia then gives 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.259
 always a lamp then the trail in that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.380
 region and the arts is cool is another 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.470
 interesting fact to have is to check the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.930
 effect of these rear 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 Suspension clamping is important that the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.990
 always have the security of having a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.420
 outdoor shot well set 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.280
 So we advise that if you 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.990
 made a very aggressive peeling or 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.819
 suddenly every month is a verified 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.590
 in the postage on a new inspection is 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.450
 recommending that it is correct that people 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.680
 assembled the ideal team is to do this 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.680
 according to the hospital
