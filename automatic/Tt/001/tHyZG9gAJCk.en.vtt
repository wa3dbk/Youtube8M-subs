 here we are with the package of the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.070
 While the company we're going to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:32.790
 open it and we will remove the case 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 as you can appreciate is the ultra 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.059
 flip for iphone 5 and what are we going to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.629
 do now is unpack it for 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.760
 avoid fighting with the package is and I'm going to 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.769
 cut here and take out the stickers that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.030
 they have the sides and just to 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.739
 that you did not see as danger I with 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.600
 the box between reached then 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.200
 I'm in making the case let's see 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.200
 what else does the package bring us here 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:06.180
 and here a guide will suffice some 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.950
 other products and it's just that or 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.890
 they do not have a screensaver 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.570
 because as you can see it comes with this 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.250
 frontal guard then now if what 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.980
 what we are going to do is install our 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.540
 iphone 5 before installing the iphone 5 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.480
 Let's talk a little about the case 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.830
 comes in four colors in orange in 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.920
 blue with what you are good at 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.470
 the gray and white moments is the leather 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.210
 synthetic on the outside 10 of 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.630
 Microfiber on the inside for 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.600
 protect the device and that does not 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.190
 scratched that is smooth to the touch in the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.880
 back you can see this 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.180
 hard plastic and the cost of this case 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.940
 is 37 with 99 hours and what we're going to 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.840
 do is install it 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.840
 to the buttons and one wrote and we felt 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 the device came as 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.230
 we just close the lid is not 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.120
 smart just in case 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.340
 and let's talk a little about accessibility 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.710
 that you want to find that by 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.050
 this end you will have access to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
 Volume buttons like the minute without 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.250
 no problem from the top 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.410
 you are going to have a large building in 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.990
 where you can control what is the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.640
 snack button paid for here 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.980
 we also have another anpe hole 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.110
 the headset talking microphone and the 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.600
 connector on the back you 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.550
 you want to find a broad efficient for 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.130
 they want to do the flash camera and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.940
 the secondary microphone you can 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:39.420
 see in the design that has the logo 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.400
 of spiegel and something very interesting that 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.840
 many people feel a little 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.970
 discomfort at the moment the answer 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.670
 phone in this way not then now 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.010
 you are going to be able to keep these 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.770
 closed will be able to answer the 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.870
 phone and without needing 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.340
 and keep this open as you go 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.470
 to have here this building to be able 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.270
 listen as we have the microphone 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.460
 you are not going to have any problem 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.270
 to be able to answer and talk on the phone 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.860
 with the case closed when we talk 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.630
 of security you can appreciate from 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.510
 that the back was going to be 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.460
 safe from scratches, but not from falls 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.010
 because these are materials a 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.650
 hard plastic therefore does not absorb the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.690
 impact on the front you 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.340
 they have this clip that is going to help too 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.470
 to protect the screen in case 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.320
 you do not place on surfaces 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.730
 flat on the sides or let's say on the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.670
 top and bottom 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.920
 is exposed but in the corners 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.110
 as you can appreciate is the 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.420
 protected but always when one 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.000
 uses this type of cases as it is 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.250
 advisable to keep it maybe in 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.150
 another box like for example this here 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.060
 that will help protect 100% the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.550
 device or smart cell phone or 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.080
 something also that is beneficial is the 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.180
 made of you are going to have here in the 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.350
 part of the film a slot to place 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.600
 whether they are credit cards 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.700
 as well as personal cards in this 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.040
 case of the mode but possibly three 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.810
 up to a maximum of four and this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.000
 way in case the outputs of the 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.560
 home only with your cell phone and not with 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.790
 credit card or some wallet 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.550
 For you will be able to place 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.800
