00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.060
 very good 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.570
 my name is francisco heads 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.979
 I am a student of chemical engineering 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.979
 son of the doctor of sciences misa 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.070
 the sky that could be them 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.050
 give them puna 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.140
 explain briefly 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.569
 in what it consists 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.060
 the development ocde 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.720
 corn production 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 on genetically basis 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.620
 what the packers do to develop the criollos 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.590
 an uncle of yours 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.390
 sd the union 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.440
 of a corn 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.840
 moon corn species 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 another corn 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 the corn 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.330
 the closure period has ended 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.080
 the next month villa 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.420
 and that spike 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.840
 when falling 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.160
 on 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.840
 the country about the country plant 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.440
 what produces 3 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.340
 Cob 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 is to mix 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 another type of corn 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 for that reason they wait for doubt 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.690
 sent a disc 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.520
 the other 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 all kinds of media 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 i one is mixed generated 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.390
 tend to be better than their predecessors 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.950
 n the issue is eclectic 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.100
 there are those who are recessive ipc but are those who dominate 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.700
 the most powerful 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.190
 a powerful gene 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.690
 They ask that although it is 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.479
 the previous 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.100
 true 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.660
 of the previous production 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.680
 that is only that they were the best 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.530
 i 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.900
 that's why hybrids have to be better 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.090
 I'm selling more to give a small example 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
 pÃ©rez as for example when 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.309
 more people a person 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:09.989
 have eyes 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.929
 let's say brown 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.849
 has a son with the blue-eyed person 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.349
 it is impossible for him 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.889
 assume it 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.059
 in the next 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.539
 check 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:26.539
 the dominant gene 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.989
 the only way that 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.989
 be taken out with 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.939
 is that it has a predecessor 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:39.939
 have 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.929
 that is the same also with hard work 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:45.759
 We closed the deal 

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:48.759
 cougars in montevideo d 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.329
 it was an example 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.329
 what days ago 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.569
 instead of that before 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.489
 produces corn and 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.979
 at very high temperature 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.229
 10 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.229
 I feel so much water is needed and poetry 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.839
 what the father does before this act 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 who of some plant that exists a lot 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.359
 drought 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.359
 along with the one that produces a lot 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:39.139
 the join them can leave joint a plant that exists more 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.519
 and at the same time serving 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.909
 produce a lot 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.909
 and that is very favorable 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.699
 is very good 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.309
 good here come into the matter transgenic 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:58.159
 a transgenic 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.719
 br 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.109
 a transgenic 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.109
 what has supposedly things to improve 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:08.269
 is that they have 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.269
 a protein 

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:14.869
 at the moment that 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.849
 a plan astra 3b converse the plant 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.740
 what you do basil bush 'the plague any plague 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.740
 is what allegedly expounded singh 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 since tests have been done that she 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.419
 compared beck corn that she 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.249
 It has been prepared in a normal way 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.209
 countries that are transgenic does not produce about 2 transgenics that 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.309
 they claim the fact that 

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:46.310
 pique are already going to end the famine 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.809
 already in when truth 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:49.150
 also 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.129
 experiments have been done with mice 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:54.659
 in which mice think 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.659
 transgenic corn 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.249
 they suffer from nuclear kidney problems 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.439
 they cause blood 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.110
 instead 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.680
 those who consume 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 Creole corn, like the one they produce and drink 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.669
 obviously normal does not have to happen to them happen to them 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.220
 there that is not all 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.220
 GMO producers 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.580
 for example the most pessimistic expo that only contagious uu 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.289
 never in transgenics 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.580
 well, hopefully 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.500
 will transmit the gene to the ears of the next generation 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.669
 transgenic with the same gene as the one that kills the beaches 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:46.339
 and that attacks and that in turn can also 

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:51.680
 but instead yes yes yes we see in that you 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.339
 steal street 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:55.949
 your people can put you in jail 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:59.189
 because for parents and that you stole your 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:01.300
 supposedly in 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.300
 Send genetics improved with breezes 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.189
 and supposedly the improvement 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:16.729
 the transgenic with him 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.369
 another is that nico esteve 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:21.180
 of schedules the fertilizer 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.180
 but it was already shown 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:27.650
 not be sustainable 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.650
 by way of 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.430
 that is real 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.699
 I say goodbye and respect 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:44.779
 been his wife
