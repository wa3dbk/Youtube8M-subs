I just got a pick in the endzone at the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
I just got a pick in the endzone at the
20-yard<00:00:27.869> line<00:00:28.050> with<00:00:28.289> only<00:00:28.439> 22<00:00:28.769> seconds<00:00:29.220> left

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
fast quarterback so I guess that's semi

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that play for me to throw and find a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889 
that play for me to throw and find a
receiver<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.210> what<00:01:48.420> happened<00:01:48.780> with

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
receiver just like what happened with

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.889 
receiver just like what happened with
Michael<00:01:49.110> Vick<00:01:49.490> let's<00:01:50.490> try<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.850> middle<00:01:51.659> pass

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
Michael Vick let's try this middle pass

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.590 
Michael Vick let's try this middle pass
to<00:01:52.140> Gronk<00:01:52.380> again<00:01:55.700> not<00:01:56.700> caught<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.409> far

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
to Gronk again not caught so so far

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.090 
to Gronk again not caught so so far
looks<00:02:00.600> like<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> mid<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.259> deep<00:02:01.469> pass<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:01.920> far

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
even before I had Michael Vick because I

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.410 
even before I had Michael Vick because I
just<00:02:44.640> needed<00:02:44.819> that<00:02:45.030> speed<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:47.150> catch<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.269> guys

anyway I think that's money so not
thrown<00:03:21.570> well<00:03:21.720> enough<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:23.190> no<00:03:23.880> one's<00:03:24.060> had<00:03:24.269> luck

thrown well enough but no one's had luck
on<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.840> pass<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:25.650> far<00:03:25.920> let's<00:03:26.910> try<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.150> find

on that pass so far let's try to find

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.449 
on that pass so far let's try to find
Gronk<00:03:27.870> again<00:03:30.829> coming<00:03:31.829> in<00:03:31.920> huh<00:03:32.040> from<00:03:32.280> there

right

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.960 
right
I<00:03:32.880> think<00:03:33.239> that's<00:03:33.420> money<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.340> Otto<00:03:35.549> Graham<00:03:35.760> and

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
I think that's money so Otto Graham and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.970 
I think that's money so Otto Graham and
Michael<00:03:36.209> Vick<00:03:36.390> both<00:03:36.750> made<00:03:37.049> great<00:03:37.470> passes

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
Michael Vick both made great passes

Michael Vick both made great passes
right<00:03:38.130> they're<00:03:41.630> trying<00:03:42.630> this<00:03:42.900> pass<00:03:43.230> again

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
right they're trying this pass again

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.670 
right they're trying this pass again
again<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.750> block<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.139> there<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.650> right

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
again the block is there on the right

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.770 
again the block is there on the right
unlike<00:03:47.130> last<00:03:47.310> time<00:03:47.489> D<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:47.850> branches<00:03:48.209> wide<00:03:48.389> open

I<00:04:20.250> did<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.639> comparison<00:04:21.060> video<00:04:21.390> because<00:04:21.690> it

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
I did this comparison video because it

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.529 
I did this comparison video because it
actually<00:04:22.140> just<00:04:22.320> validated<00:04:23.010> my<00:04:23.820> prior

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
actually just validated my prior

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.270 
actually just validated my prior
thoughts<00:04:24.930> because<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.470> already<00:04:25.650> taken<00:04:26.130> Tom

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
line up because I was happier with Otto

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.879 
line up because I was happier with Otto
Graham<00:04:29.629> so<00:04:30.629> let's<00:04:31.050> go<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.379> on<00:04:31.590> paper

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
more accurate in the short range but

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.939

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
that and more accurate in the midfield
but<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:47.789> guys<00:04:47.969> saw<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.180> both<00:04:48.719> Otto<00:04:49.259> Graham

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
but you guys saw that both Otto Graham

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.850

and<00:04:50.129> Michael<00:04:50.490> Vick<00:04:50.699> Vick<00:04:51.270> hit<00:04:51.719> drunk<00:04:52.050> in<00:04:52.289> the

and Michael Vick Vick hit drunk in the
middle<00:04:52.979> relatively<00:04:53.639> easily<00:04:53.819> so<00:04:54.689> that

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
middle relatively easily so that

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.540 
middle relatively easily so that
difference<00:04:55.469> really<00:04:55.710> isn't<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:56.129> noticeable

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
difference really isn't that noticeable

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.459 
difference really isn't that noticeable
and<00:04:56.849> Michael<00:04:57.419> Vick<00:04:57.569> actually<00:04:57.990> had<00:04:58.139> two

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
and Michael Vick actually had two

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.219 
and Michael Vick actually had two
defensive<00:04:58.979> backs<00:04:59.219> on<00:04:59.430> Drock<00:04:59.870> whereas<00:05:00.870> Otto

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
defensive backs on Drock whereas Otto

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.200 
defensive backs on Drock whereas Otto
Graham<00:05:01.469> only<00:05:01.710> had<00:05:01.860> one<00:05:02.069> so<00:05:02.310> he<00:05:02.520> still<00:05:02.819> threaded

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
Graham only had one so he still threaded

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.580 
Graham only had one so he still threaded
that<00:05:03.360> needle<00:05:04.400> but<00:05:05.400> let's<00:05:05.610> go<00:05:05.729> on<00:05:05.849> to<00:05:05.939> tom<00:05:06.120> brady

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
that needle but let's go on to tom brady

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.399 
that needle but let's go on to tom brady
surprisingly<00:05:07.590> everyone<00:05:08.340> knows<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.580> he<00:05:09.000> has

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
surprisingly everyone knows that he has

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.010 
surprisingly everyone knows that he has
the<00:05:10.409> best<00:05:10.860> throw<00:05:11.430> accuracy<00:05:12.000> but<00:05:12.330> we<00:05:12.719> really

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
the best throw accuracy but we really

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.420 
the best throw accuracy but we really
didn't<00:05:13.259> see<00:05:13.409> that<00:05:13.590> we<00:05:13.919> saw<00:05:14.129> it<00:05:14.310> could

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
didn't see that we saw it could

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.409 
didn't see that we saw it could
inconsistency<00:05:15.000> like<00:05:15.569> I've<00:05:15.719> been<00:05:15.900> seeing<00:05:16.169> and

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
inconsistency like I've been seeing and

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.059 
inconsistency like I've been seeing and
even<00:05:18.419> when<00:05:18.569> he<00:05:18.689> got<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.020> pass<00:05:19.199> off<00:05:19.409> he

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:20.069 
even when he got the pass off he

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.829 
even when he got the pass off he
couldn't<00:05:20.520> hit<00:05:20.639> drunk<00:05:20.939> with<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.270> dot

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:21.839 
couldn't hit drunk with the dot

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:24.860 
couldn't hit drunk with the dot
so<00:05:22.830> Tom<00:05:23.699> Brady's<00:05:24.000> just<00:05:24.180> not<00:05:24.330> fast<00:05:24.539> enough<00:05:24.689> to

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
so Tom Brady's just not fast enough to

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.519 
so Tom Brady's just not fast enough to
play<00:05:25.319> against<00:05:25.620> these<00:05:25.830> elite<00:05:26.279> defenses<00:05:26.879> and

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:27.529 
play against these elite defenses and

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.779 
play against these elite defenses and
even<00:05:28.529> when<00:05:28.680> he<00:05:28.710> is<00:05:28.889> he's<00:05:29.099> just<00:05:29.279> inconsistent

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
even when he is he's just inconsistent

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.110 
even when he is he's just inconsistent
and<00:05:30.300> he<00:05:31.110> fumbled<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.620> and<00:05:31.740> he's<00:05:32.189> fumbled<00:05:33.060> the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
and he fumbled it and he's fumbled the

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.029 
and he fumbled it and he's fumbled the
ball<00:05:33.240> more<00:05:34.229> times<00:05:34.529> than<00:05:34.710> any<00:05:34.889> other

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
ball more times than any other

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.499 
ball more times than any other
quarterback<00:05:35.370> I've<00:05:35.699> had<00:05:36.169> so<00:05:38.509> definitely

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
quarterback I've had so definitely

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.390 
quarterback I've had so definitely
validated<00:05:39.990> my<00:05:40.199> opinion<00:05:40.560> on<00:05:40.680> selling<00:05:41.009> him<00:05:41.099> tell

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
validated my opinion on selling him tell

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.639 
validated my opinion on selling him tell
me<00:05:41.430> if<00:05:41.580> you<00:05:41.639> guys<00:05:41.759> think<00:05:42.029> differently<00:05:42.389> but<00:05:42.649> so

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:43.649 
me if you guys think differently but so

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:46.249 
me if you guys think differently but so
far<00:05:43.860> through<00:05:44.069> my<00:05:44.219> many<00:05:44.639> experiences<00:05:45.300> I'm<00:05:45.599> not

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:46.259 
far through my many experiences I'm not

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.219 
far through my many experiences I'm not
happy<00:05:46.439> with<00:05:46.560> Tom<00:05:46.830> Brady<00:05:47.419> so<00:05:48.419> for<00:05:48.810> my<00:05:48.899> final

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
happy with Tom Brady so for my final

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.980 
happy with Tom Brady so for my final
thoughts<00:05:49.529> I<00:05:50.149> really<00:05:51.149> wanted<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.509> do<00:05:51.629> Aaron

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
thoughts I really wanted to do Aaron

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.990 
thoughts I really wanted to do Aaron
Rodgers<00:05:52.349> in<00:05:52.469> this<00:05:52.620> video<00:05:52.889> but<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.550> don't<00:05:53.849> have

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
Rodgers in this video but I don't have

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.089 
Rodgers in this video but I don't have
him<00:05:54.240> he's<00:05:54.839> basically<00:05:55.139> just<00:05:55.289> a<00:05:55.620> more<00:05:55.889> accurate

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
him he's basically just a more accurate

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.050 
him he's basically just a more accurate
Otto<00:05:56.610> Graham<00:05:56.909> so<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.509> better<00:05:57.779> Otto<00:05:58.080> Graham<00:05:59.060> but

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
Otto Graham so a better Otto Graham but

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.909 
Otto Graham so a better Otto Graham but
if<00:06:00.180> I<00:06:00.270> had<00:06:00.449> to<00:06:00.479> rate<00:06:00.899> these<00:06:01.229> three<00:06:01.620> players

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
if I had to rate these three players

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.010 
if I had to rate these three players
which<00:06:02.669> is<00:06:02.819> what<00:06:02.939> a<00:06:02.969> comparison<00:06:03.509> is<00:06:03.599> all<00:06:03.750> about

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
which is what a comparison is all about

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.589 
which is what a comparison is all about
I<00:06:04.199> would<00:06:04.289> put<00:06:04.560> Tom<00:06:04.830> Brady<00:06:05.099> and<00:06:05.310> last<00:06:05.610> because

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
I would put Tom Brady and last because

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.149 
I would put Tom Brady and last because
he's<00:06:06.750> just<00:06:06.990> not<00:06:07.169> fast<00:06:07.349> enough<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.830> get<00:06:07.949> those

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
he's just not fast enough to get those

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.480 
he's just not fast enough to get those
passes<00:06:08.610> off<00:06:08.759> against<00:06:09.180> elite<00:06:09.509> defenses<00:06:10.110> I

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.490 
passes off against elite defenses I

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.389 
passes off against elite defenses I
would<00:06:11.490> put<00:06:11.699> Otto<00:06:11.939> Graham<00:06:12.270> in<00:06:12.509> second<00:06:13.399> in

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:14.399 
would put Otto Graham in second in

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.100 
would put Otto Graham in second in
addition<00:06:14.759> to<00:06:14.879> not<00:06:15.000> being<00:06:15.180> fast<00:06:15.389> enough<00:06:15.659> still

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
addition to not being fast enough still

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.019 
addition to not being fast enough still
