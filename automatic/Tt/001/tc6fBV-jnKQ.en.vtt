probably either Gears of War 3 or the
battlefield<00:02:25.470> 3<00:02:25.620> beta<00:02:25.769> which<00:02:25.980> ever<00:02:26.129> comes<00:02:26.340> out

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519

first<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:27.480> they<00:02:27.780> have<00:02:27.959> not<00:02:28.110> announced

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379

the date for the battlefield 3 beta

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.180

although<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> believe<00:02:31.019> here's<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.010> words

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
although I believe here's the words

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.380 
although I believe here's the words
coming<00:02:32.370> out<00:02:32.489> pretty<00:02:32.670> late<00:02:32.760> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> month<00:02:33.120> so

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
coming out pretty late in the month so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.119 
coming out pretty late in the month so
i'm<00:02:33.510> assuming<00:02:33.629> battlefield<00:02:34.379> 3<00:02:34.590> will<00:02:34.739> probably

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
i'm assuming battlefield 3 will probably

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.610 
i'm assuming battlefield 3 will probably
beat<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> that'll<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.840> good<00:02:36.989> filled<00:02:37.470> some

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
beat it so that'll be good filled some

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.860 
beat it so that'll be good filled some
hype<00:02:37.769> up<00:02:37.920> for<00:02:38.069> battlefield<00:02:38.489> 3<00:02:38.700> that's<00:02:39.360> kind<00:02:39.840> of

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
hype up for battlefield 3 that's kind of

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.030 
hype up for battlefield 3 that's kind of
weird<00:02:40.019> though<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.379> fact<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.650> they<00:02:40.829> have

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
weird though the fact that they have

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.710 
weird though the fact that they have
that<00:02:41.190> beta<00:02:41.459> so<00:02:41.849> late<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.569> development

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that beta so late in the development

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.390 
that beta so late in the development
cycle<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.530> game<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:43.799> mean<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.099> they<00:02:44.220> really

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
cycle of the game I mean do they really

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.860 
cycle of the game I mean do they really
have<00:02:44.519> time<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.879> implement<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.510> lot<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.780> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
have time to implement a lot of the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.300 
have time to implement a lot of the
things<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.170> they're<00:02:46.379> going<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.650> learn<00:02:47.010> in

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
things that they're going to learn in

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.160 
things that they're going to learn in
debate<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> mean<00:02:48.359> yeah<00:02:48.480> sure<00:02:48.690> they<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.989> fix

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
debate I mean yeah sure they can fix

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.330 
debate I mean yeah sure they can fix
like<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.410> know<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:49.530> these<00:02:49.769> huge<00:02:50.040> gaping

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
like you know like these huge gaping

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.280 
like you know like these huge gaping
holes<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.879> code<00:02:51.120> or<00:02:51.329> whatever<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.959> know<00:02:51.989> just

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
holes in code or whatever you know just

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.530 
holes in code or whatever you know just
huge<00:02:52.859> bugs<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.459> flaws<00:02:53.670> within<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.150> system

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
huge bugs and flaws within the system

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420 
huge bugs and flaws within the system
but<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:55.319> really<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.650> enough<00:02:55.859> time<00:02:56.069> do<00:02:56.280> you

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
but it's really not enough time do you

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.039 
but it's really not enough time do you
know<00:02:56.519> maybe<00:02:56.760> correct<00:02:57.090> balancing<00:02:57.569> issues<00:02:57.690> at

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
know maybe correct balancing issues at

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.460 
know maybe correct balancing issues at
