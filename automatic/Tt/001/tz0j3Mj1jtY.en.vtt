00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.430 
crab and probably probably discover
something<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.690> have<00:03:05.780> not<00:03:05.930> seen<00:03:06.110> before

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
something that we have not seen before

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.130 
something that we have not seen before
so<00:03:07.220> for<00:03:07.400> me<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.820> most<00:03:08.330> difficult<00:03:08.540> dish<00:03:08.960> I

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
so for me the most difficult dish I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
so for me the most difficult dish I
think<00:03:09.410> would<00:03:09.530> be<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:10.930> galaxy<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.770> locks<00:03:12.980> up

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
think would be the galaxy the locks up

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.040 
think would be the galaxy the locks up
that<00:03:13.610> was<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.820> tough<00:03:14.420> one<00:03:14.600> because<00:03:14.720> there's<00:03:14.990> so

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
that was a tough one because there's so

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.310 
that was a tough one because there's so
many<00:03:15.110> variations<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:16.900> go<00:03:17.900> through<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
many variations and go through the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.250 
many variations and go through the
coconut<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.250> paste<00:03:19.550> the<00:03:20.330> shrimp<00:03:20.690> and<00:03:20.900> so<00:03:21.050> I

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
coconut the paste the shrimp and so I

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.010 
coconut the paste the shrimp and so I
was<00:03:21.950> struggling<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.460> knew<00:03:23.090> within<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.840> first

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
was struggling I knew within the first

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.960 
was struggling I knew within the first
45<00:03:24.290> minutes<00:03:24.440> that<00:03:24.920> were<00:03:25.340> slightly<00:03:25.610> running

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
45 minutes that were slightly running

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.480 
45 minutes that were slightly running
behind<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.360> that<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:27.410> I<00:03:27.560> changed<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> recipe

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
behind on that and I changed the recipe

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:29.980
