00:00:02.164 --> 00:00:03.847
 In non-cardiac heart disease 

00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:06.597
 there is some kind of birth defect. 

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:10.271
 Inborn means that man was born with him, 

00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:14.025
 but as a result the blood moves 

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.641
 on the left side of the heart to the right side of the heart. 

00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.531
 In this example you will see that we have a small hole here, 

00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.513
 in the wall between the left ventricle and the right ventricle. 

00:00:24.513 --> 00:00:28.213
 Once the pressure is higher in this left side, 

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:30.828
 which sends the blood through the whole body, 

00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:34.301
 this will cause the blood to move from the left 

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:36.608
 to the right ventricle. 

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:40.652
 My question is how doctors diagnose 

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:44.366
 a person with a non-cyanogenic heart defect? 

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:48.400
 One of the first things is that this can be heard. 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.181
 Let's draw a little ear here. 

00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:54.018
 You'll be able to hear it 

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:57.752
 and you will also be able to see it. 

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:01.817
 We will talk about how you can do these things. 

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:04.209
 Let's put a little puppy here. 

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.387
 You'll be able to hear it 

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:06.649
 and you will be able to see it. 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.668
 Think of hearing this way. 

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.941
 Let's say you have a garden hose. 

00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:13.404
 This is my garden hose 

00:01:13.404 --> 00:01:17.448
 and we have water flowing through this garden hose 

00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:19.531
 Suddenly we decide: 

00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:25.061
 "We'll make a small hole in the hose." 

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:27.932
 Here we have a small hole. 

00:01:27.932 --> 00:01:28.841
 What will happen? 

00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:31.533
 Of course, the water will spray on 

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:33.917
 places where you do not want to go, 

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:36.119
 as this one will spray in that direction. 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.922
 If you come in, you can hear it. 

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:40.781
 No? Yes, of course, it is logical. 

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:42.167
 How does the doctor do this? 

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:44.131
 The doctor can not put it 

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.075
 your ear right next to that hole. 

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:50.859
 What he can do is take the well-known one 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.749
 a less useful device, 

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.304
 called stethoscope. 

00:01:54.627 --> 00:01:56.915
 This end enters the doctor's ears. 

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:58.355
 Then is this tube, 

00:01:58.355 --> 00:01:58.855
 and then that part for the chest, 

00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:04.882
 where you can hear the sounds of the heart. 

00:02:05.144 --> 00:02:08.277
 Depending on the type of non-cyanotic heart disease, 

00:02:08.876 --> 00:02:10.668
 which this man could have, 

00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:13.577
 the doctor may hear the spraying either 

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:17.262
 some kind of characteristic sound that is 

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.360
 the result of this defect. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.689
 This process will give you a name for it, 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.302
 is called auscultation. 

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:28.231
 That's when the doctor comes 

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.453
 with the stethoscope and, since it is a birth defect, 

00:02:31.453 --> 00:02:33.142
 when the baby is born, 

00:02:33.142 --> 00:02:35.014
 he hears the sound of the heart 

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:37.748
 and says, "I hear something that does not 

00:02:37.748 --> 00:02:39.998
 I would like to hear. " 

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:43.668
 This is one way of listening to the heart. 

00:02:43.668 --> 00:02:45.495
 The heart can be seen. 

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:46.567
 How do we see the heart? 

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:47.975
 We'll take a picture. 

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:51.720
 Unfortunately, you can not just use a simple camera. 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.739
 You need a more expensive machine 

00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:58.377
 and this expensive machine will allow you 

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:02.680
 to visualize the chest area 

00:03:02.927 --> 00:03:06.628
 and that's as if we're taking a picture. 

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:08.115
 It's just a little different. 

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:10.584
 There will not be all these nice colors, 

00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:13.963
 but you can see the heart. 

00:03:13.963 --> 00:03:15.736
 This is my heart. 

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:20.661
 This is called chest X-ray. 

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:23.538
 You use the X-ray. 

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:25.159
 Put the baby in the X-ray. 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.317
 Take a picture and check 

00:03:27.317 --> 00:03:29.896
 whether there is any kind of structural defect, 

00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.565
 who should not be there. 

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:34.828
 This is a way of visualizing the heart. 

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:38.174
 There is a second way of visualizing the heart, which is even better. 

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:39.498
 You can take a picture 

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:41.883
 or take a video. 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.296
 In fetal and postnatal care - 

00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:55.640
 fetal is when the fetus is still in the womb of the mother, 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.740
 but postnatal is after the baby is born - 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.696
 you can make an echocardiogram. 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.539
 Echocardiogram. 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.527
 Sound waves are used 

00:04:12.527 --> 00:04:14.632
 and are projected on a screen, 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.013
 so the heart can be seen. 

00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:18.743
 You see the heart while it beats. 

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:21.480
 You'll see him cut short. You will see the valves close. 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.926
 You can also see real-time if there is 

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.393
 defects that should not be there. 

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.589
 This is number two. 

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.532
 We can visualize the heart by using either 

00:04:32.532 --> 00:04:37.911
 chest X-ray, or fetal or postnatal echocardiogram. 

00:04:38.203 --> 00:04:41.419
 There are other problems we can see 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:43.887
 in non-cyanotic heart disease. 

00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:47.100
 We said the blood passes from the left to the right 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.271
 Let's say there is more and more 

00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.272
 blood flowing to the right side, from where 

00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:55.122
 goes to the lungs. 

00:04:56.198 --> 00:04:58.417
 There is more blood that goes to the lungs, 

00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:01.686
 and part of it returns, but not so much blood goes into the body, 

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:03.874
 which will lead to the accumulation of 

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:07.939
 pressure in the lungs. 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.525
 If pressure build up in the lungs, 

00:05:10.525 --> 00:05:13.571
 this may affect the right side 

00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:19.269
 and cause pressure build-up there. 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:21.351
 If we have a build-up of pressure here, 

00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:23.936
 the ventricle has to do much more work. 

00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:26.493
 If you go to the gym and exercise, 

00:05:26.493 --> 00:05:28.026
 i. you do a lot of work, 

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:29.370
 what will happen to your muscles? 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.634
 They will be enlarged. 

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:32.556
 They will become significantly stronger. 

00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:35.591
 This will begin to happen in 

00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:40.566
 the right side where there is a larger heart muscle. 

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:43.449
 If you have a larger heart muscle, 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.487
 you will notice this when a doctor 

00:05:46.487 --> 00:05:49.003
 come and do 

00:05:49.003 --> 00:05:53.424
 electrocardiogram. 

00:05:53.424 --> 00:05:55.891
 We're doing an electrocardiogram. 

00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:59.362
 The cardiogram we look at 

00:05:59.362 --> 00:06:02.270
 the electrical signals through the heart. 

00:06:02.608 --> 00:06:05.435
 I'll sketch one. 

00:06:05.435 --> 00:06:07.981
 Now we have our R wave, 

00:06:07.981 --> 00:06:12.002
 then is the QRS complex, 

00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:14.582
 then is the T wave. 

00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:18.528
 Let's see, this is the R wave, 

00:06:19.127 --> 00:06:23.844
 QRS complex and then the T wave. 

00:06:23.844 --> 00:06:29.813
 P wave gives me electrical activity at the atrium. 

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:33.462
 Your QRS complex shows you the electrical one 

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:37.689
 activity of the ventricles. 

00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:39.856
 I will not go into detail. 

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:42.900
 For now, I'll just do it. 

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:46.533
 If you have the vectors enlarged 

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.095
 or right ventricle, 

00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:49.652
 what will the signal do? 

00:06:49.652 --> 00:06:51.662
 Do you expect to see the same signal, 

00:06:51.662 --> 00:06:54.065
 bigger signal or smaller signal? 

00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:55.705
 If you have a bigger muscle, 

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:59.011
 I would expect to see great 

00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:04.204
 a bigger signal here in the ventricles. 

00:07:04.204 --> 00:07:06.554
 If this affects the atrophy 

00:07:06.708 --> 00:07:09.701
 and has a greater right atrium, 

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.930
 then you may see this being larger, 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.001
 a little wider. 

00:07:15.216 --> 00:07:17.867
 There are typical things you can see 

00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:20.339
 of an electrocardiogram, 

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.979
 ESG or ECG, 

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.536
 depending on where you are. 

00:07:27.612 --> 00:07:29.835
 This can give you an indication 

00:07:29.835 --> 00:07:32.675
 whether there is any kind 

00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:36.490
 dysfunction in the heart as a result of 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.580
 the burden that has accumulated in the right ventricle 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.321
 and right atrium, and enlargement of these structures. 

00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.781
 You can hear it. You can see it. 

00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:49.736
 There are some functional things you can do 

00:07:49.736 --> 00:07:53.184
 to notice the electrocardiogram to help you 

00:07:53.184 --> 00:07:56.666
 to diagnose a non-cyanotic heart defect.
