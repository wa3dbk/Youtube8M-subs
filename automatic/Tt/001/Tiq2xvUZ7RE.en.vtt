when you're frustrated see for me I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
when you're frustrated see for me I
believe<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:50.910> two<00:00:51.480> underlying

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
believe that there's two underlying

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350 
believe that there's two underlying
problems<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> comes<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.820> any<00:00:54.000> type<00:00:54.329> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
problems when it comes to any type of

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
problems when it comes to any type of
disorder<00:00:54.719> there's<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.559> routes<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> ton

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
disorder there's two routes that a ton

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.939 
disorder there's two routes that a ton
of<00:00:56.879> eating<00:00:57.449> problems<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:58.050> stem<00:00:58.350> from<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
of eating problems can stem from and

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.000 
of eating problems can stem from and
that's<00:00:59.460> your<00:00:59.850> perception<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.960> yourself<00:01:01.770> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that's your perception on yourself and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
that's your perception on yourself and
on<00:01:02.160> your<00:01:02.309> body<00:01:02.520> image<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.149> then<00:01:03.690> there's

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
on your body image and then there's

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.490 
on your body image and then there's
perception<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.860> eating<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> food<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.960> so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
today I'm going to take the perception

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
series goes on like I said I believe

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
series goes on like I said I believe
there's<00:01:31.740> two<00:01:32.070> roots<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.119> problem<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.930> any

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
there's two roots of the problem for any

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
there's two roots of the problem for any
kind<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> disordered<00:01:34.920> eating<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.640> I'm

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
kind of disordered eating and so I'm

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.420 
kind of disordered eating and so I'm
going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.299> attack<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:37.290> first<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.250> that

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
going to attack the first one and that

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.450 
going to attack the first one and that
our<00:01:38.759> perception<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.720> food<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.470> eating<00:01:41.250> in

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
our perception on food and eating in

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.960 
our perception on food and eating in
general<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:43.490> just<00:01:44.490> feel<00:01:44.700> like<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.880> need

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
general and so I just feel like we need

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.250 
general and so I just feel like we need
to<00:01:45.030> go<00:01:45.180> back<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> base

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
to go back to the base

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.610 
to go back to the base
so<00:01:46.350> dude<00:01:46.530> was<00:01:46.800> seen<00:01:47.010> as<00:01:47.220> fuel<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.210> food<00:01:49.200> was

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
so dude was seen as fuel and food was

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.840
