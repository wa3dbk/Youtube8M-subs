00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
labyrinth and we will look at that right

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.270 
labyrinth and we will look at that right
here<00:03:34.019> again<00:03:35.019> that's<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.500> vestibulocochlear

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
here again that's the vestibulocochlear

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.599 
here again that's the vestibulocochlear
nerve<00:03:36.480> number<00:03:37.480> eight<00:03:37.870> as<00:03:38.680> it<00:03:38.920> comes<00:03:39.130> out<00:03:39.340> the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
nerve number eight as it comes out the

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.960 
nerve number eight as it comes out the
aural<00:03:40.319> oval<00:03:41.319> orifice<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.310> internal

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
aural oval orifice of the internal

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.110 
aural oval orifice of the internal
auditory<00:03:43.450> meatus<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.980> vestibular<00:03:45.819> branch

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
auditory meatus the vestibular branch

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.059 
auditory meatus the vestibular branch
emanates<00:03:46.750> from<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.230> vestibule<00:03:47.829> in

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
emanates from the vestibule in

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.490 
emanates from the vestibule in
semicircular<00:03:48.910> canals<00:03:49.389> while<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.230> cochlear

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
semicircular canals while the cochlear

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.160 
semicircular canals while the cochlear
branch<00:03:50.859> emanates<00:03:51.730> from<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.090> cochlear

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
branch emanates from the cochlear

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.020 
branch emanates from the cochlear
so<00:03:53.950> right<00:03:54.130> here<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.490> have<00:03:54.520> the<00:03:54.760> cochlear

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
so right here you have the cochlear

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.330 
so right here you have the cochlear
branch<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:56.590> over<00:03:56.830> here<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.160> have<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
branch and over here you have the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.199 
branch and over here you have the
vestibular<00:03:58.150> branch<00:03:59.160> the<00:04:00.160> internal<00:04:00.850> carotid

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
vestibular branch the internal carotid

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.340 
vestibular branch the internal carotid
artery<00:04:02.110> is<00:04:02.430> tagged<00:04:03.430> as<00:04:03.670> number<00:04:04.000> 20<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:05.110> is

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
artery is tagged as number 20 and is

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.140 
artery is tagged as number 20 and is
visible<00:04:05.860> as<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.130> passes<00:04:06.730> through<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
visible as it passes through the

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.170
