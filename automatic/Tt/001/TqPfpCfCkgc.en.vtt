00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
why that looks like that but also on the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.010 
why that looks like that but also on the
lifeguard<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.180> don't<00:01:33.360> know<00:01:33.479> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.689> know<00:01:33.810> from

series 2 they have this kind of like
Underpants<00:01:36.450> design<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.049> think<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.650> would

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
Underpants design I think that would

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.780 
Underpants design I think that would
have<00:01:37.920> been<00:01:38.040> perfect

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
have been perfect

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
have been perfect
you<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.479> for<00:01:40.579> also<00:01:41.579> forum<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.560> Plastic<00:01:43.560> Man

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
you know for also forum a Plastic Man

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.200 
you know for also forum a Plastic Man
although<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.280> went<00:01:44.490> with<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> new<00:01:44.850> 52

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
although they went with the new 52

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.749 
although they went with the new 52
design<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.380> mean<00:01:46.979> he<00:01:47.250> didn't<00:01:47.490> really<00:01:47.640> need

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
design so I mean he didn't really need

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.429 
design so I mean he didn't really need
the<00:01:47.939> Underpants<00:01:48.540> design<00:01:48.899> but<00:01:49.079> that's<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the Underpants design but that's what I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.170 
the Underpants design but that's what I
would<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.770> given<00:01:49.920> him<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> yeah<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.880> had

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
would have given him so yeah if I had

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.480 
would have given him so yeah if I had
that<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.689> then<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.530> Batman<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.310> I

I<00:02:10.649> don't<00:02:10.860> know<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.760> expensive<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
I don't know it's just expensive and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.370 
I don't know it's just expensive and
in<00:02:13.440> my<00:02:13.590> opinion<00:02:13.920> I<00:02:14.190> don't<00:02:14.460> really<00:02:14.990> want<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
in my opinion I don't really want the

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.860 
in my opinion I don't really want the
little<00:02:16.770> kid<00:02:17.070> set<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.700> kind<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.150> want<00:02:18.450> just

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the minifigures and I guess the parts in

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.420 
the minifigures and I guess the parts in
the<00:02:21.570> set<00:02:21.780> are<00:02:21.810> good<00:02:22.740> because<00:02:22.890> there's<00:02:23.250> some

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
the set are good because there's some

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
but then at least it adds value to the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.920 
but then at least it adds value to the
old<00:02:40.370> Batman<00:02:41.370> cowl<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:44.180> okay<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.240> now<00:02:45.630> we're

thinking of having the Bank Chuck from

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.780 
thinking of having the Bank Chuck from
the<00:03:42.180> spider-man<00:03:42.600> set<00:03:43.560> but<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> didn't<00:03:44.610> buy<00:03:44.760> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
the spider-man set but I didn't buy that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.260 
the spider-man set but I didn't buy that
set<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:45.980> yeah<00:03:46.980> one<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.430> features<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:47.880> this

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270

sadness<00:03:49.280> if<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.550> guys<00:03:50.700> haven't<00:03:51.030> said<00:03:51.300> I

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
sadness if you guys haven't said I

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.110 
sadness if you guys haven't said I
already<00:03:51.600> know<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.980> can't<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.790> window

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
already know you can't have the window

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.480 
already know you can't have the window
explode<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.530> thought<00:03:55.710> that<00:03:55.890> was<00:03:56.100> still

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
explode and I thought that was still

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.090 
explode and I thought that was still
accurate<00:03:56.820> feature<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.840> set<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.980> could

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
accurate feature of the set you could

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.850 
accurate feature of the set you could
have<00:03:59.220> like<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.640> glass<00:04:00.480> doors<00:04:00.810> explode<00:04:01.260> you

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
have like the glass doors explode you

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.940 
have like the glass doors explode you
can<00:04:02.040> open<00:04:02.400> this<00:04:02.550> go<00:04:02.850> in<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:02.970> bank<00:04:03.210> and<00:04:03.450> stuff

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
can open this go in the bank and stuff

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.680 
can open this go in the bank and stuff
I'm<00:04:04.950> sure<00:04:05.160> Lego<00:04:05.520> would<00:04:05.730> change<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.180> around<00:04:06.390> a

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
I'm sure Lego would change this around a

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.900 
I'm sure Lego would change this around a
little<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.320> then<00:04:07.920> there's<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.400> safe<00:04:08.670> in

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
just trying to control people with some

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.620 
just trying to control people with some
sort<00:04:28.590> of<00:04:28.680> like<00:04:28.890> radio<00:04:29.820> wave<00:04:30.120> or<00:04:30.450> something

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
sort of like radio wave or something

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.370 
sort of like radio wave or something
basically<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:32.420> that's<00:04:33.420> where<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.990> gave<00:04:34.230> me

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
basically and that's where it gave me

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.370 
basically and that's where it gave me
that<00:04:34.560> this<00:04:34.980> idea<00:04:35.430> that<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.360> should<00:04:36.750> use<00:04:37.170> these

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
that this idea that I should use these

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.370 
that this idea that I should use these
big<00:04:37.650> antennas<00:04:38.160> from<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.880> Hoth<00:04:39.240> Echo<00:04:39.600> Base<00:04:39.750> and

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
big antennas from the Hoth Echo Base and

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.290 
big antennas from the Hoth Echo Base and
I<00:04:40.440> updated<00:04:41.100> them<00:04:41.250> a<00:04:41.280> little<00:04:41.670> bit<00:04:41.820> so<00:04:42.150> they

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
I updated them a little bit so they

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.680 
I updated them a little bit so they
would<00:04:42.420> be<00:04:42.890> more<00:04:43.890> intimidating<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.240> have

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
would be more intimidating so you have

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.020 
would be more intimidating so you have
like<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.110> caution<00:04:46.560> tape<00:04:46.590> there<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.400> then

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
like the caution tape there and then

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.090 
like the caution tape there and then
that's<00:04:48.300> green<00:04:48.750> there<00:04:49.020> instead<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.440> just<00:04:49.530> plain

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
that's green there instead of just plain

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.370 
that's green there instead of just plain
gray<00:04:50.400> or<00:04:50.580> whatever<00:04:50.670> and<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.630> got<00:04:51.780> this<00:04:51.930> a<00:04:51.990> really

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
gray or whatever and I got this a really

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.440 
gray or whatever and I got this a really
cool<00:04:52.680> piece<00:04:52.980> this<00:04:53.190> is<00:04:53.400> actually<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> Lego<00:04:54.330> piece

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
cool piece this is actually a Lego piece

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.270 
cool piece this is actually a Lego piece
with<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.990> question<00:04:55.440> mark<00:04:55.620> on<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.800> for<00:04:56.160> the

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
with the question mark on it for the

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.090 
with the question mark on it for the
Riddler<00:04:56.640> it's<00:04:57.240> perfect<00:04:57.810> it's<00:04:58.230> not<00:04:58.350> from<00:04:58.860> Lego

there's<00:05:06.990> some<00:05:07.200> yellow<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:07.650> in<00:05:07.980> green<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:09.270> I

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
there's some yellow and in green so I

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.540 
there's some yellow and in green so I
think<00:05:09.480> overall<00:05:10.290> this<00:05:10.530> is<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.710> really<00:05:10.980> cool<00:05:11.190> set

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
think overall this is a really cool set

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.880 
think overall this is a really cool set
and<00:05:11.790> then<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.600> made<00:05:12.810> this<00:05:12.930> little<00:05:13.230> base<00:05:13.470> for<00:05:13.800> it

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
and then I made this little base for it

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.280 
and then I made this little base for it
so<00:05:14.040> be<00:05:14.220> planted<00:05:14.669> onto<00:05:14.940> a<00:05:14.970> building<00:05:15.390> so<00:05:15.870> if<00:05:15.990> Lego

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
so be planted onto a building so if Lego

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.720 
so be planted onto a building so if Lego
decides<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:16.919> know<00:05:17.040> we<00:05:17.220> don't<00:05:17.340> want<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.610> put

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
decides you know we don't want to put

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.190 
decides you know we don't want to put
the<00:05:17.880> bank<00:05:18.120> because<00:05:18.300> we<00:05:18.540> already<00:05:18.660> have<00:05:18.990> the

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
the bank because we already have the

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.290 
the bank because we already have the
bank<00:05:19.410> made<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.460> different<00:05:20.850> set<00:05:21.060> that's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
bank made and a different set that's

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.650 
bank made and a different set that's
retired<00:05:21.780> now<00:05:22.580> then<00:05:23.580> maybe<00:05:24.030> you<00:05:24.240> can<00:05:24.360> just<00:05:24.510> keep

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
retired now then maybe you can just keep

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.920 
retired now then maybe you can just keep
