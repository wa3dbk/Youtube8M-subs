demonstration of how this is used so

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.749 
demonstration of how this is used so
essentially<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.350> would<00:01:25.469> take<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.249> mixer<00:01:26.609> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
essentially you would take the mixer and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789 
essentially you would take the mixer and
you<00:01:26.969> would<00:01:27.090> plug<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.929> portable<00:01:28.439> devices

such as an iphone or maybe a sansa clip
player<00:01:32.069> and<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.509> plug<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:34.049> some

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
cables otherwise known as auxiliary

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.340 
cables otherwise known as auxiliary
cables<00:01:49.649> which<00:01:50.159> would<00:01:50.340> plug<00:01:50.549> into<00:01:50.579> each<00:01:50.909> device

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
cables which would plug into each device

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.840 
cables which would plug into each device
also<00:01:52.350> says<00:01:52.679> this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.039> a<00:01:53.159> plug-and-play<00:01:53.429> device

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
which means it does need batteries

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.039 
which means it does need batteries
essentially<00:01:57.149> what<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.450> would<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
essentially what you would do is you

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.899 
essentially what you would do is you
would<00:01:58.200> take<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.280> plug<00:01:59.490> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
would take this and you would plug the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.139 
would take this and you would plug the
out<00:02:00.179> into<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> hi-fi<00:02:01.649> system<00:02:02.310> or<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.850> set<00:02:03.060> of

all<00:04:18.900> very<00:04:19.680> very<00:04:20.070> well<00:04:20.370> made<00:04:20.580> so<00:04:21.269> going<00:04:21.660> over

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
all very very well made so going over

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.469 
all very very well made so going over
the<00:04:22.080> device<00:04:22.290> real<00:04:22.530> quickly<00:04:22.800> we<00:04:23.250> have<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:24.000> low

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
the device real quickly we have the low

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.020 
the device real quickly we have the low
mid<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:24.990> high<00:04:25.440> settings<00:04:25.890> for<00:04:26.340> each<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.820> the

which you can move up and down then on
the<00:05:08.490> top<00:05:08.850> we<00:05:09.750> have<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.320> headphone<00:05:11.030> impedance

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the top we have a headphone impedance

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.620 
the top we have a headphone impedance
setting<00:05:12.479> so<00:05:12.660> if<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.990> say<00:05:13.200> have<00:05:13.919> a<00:05:13.950> pair<00:05:14.280> of

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
setting so if you say have a pair of

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.570 
setting so if you say have a pair of
bare<00:05:15.630> dynamic<00:05:16.229> DT<00:05:17.810> 777<00:05:18.810> T<00:05:18.930> which<00:05:19.380> are<00:05:19.590> 250<00:05:20.430> ohm

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
bare dynamic DT 777 T which are 250 ohm

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.150 
bare dynamic DT 777 T which are 250 ohm
headphones<00:05:21.030> you<00:05:21.600> can<00:05:21.810> click<00:05:22.200> this<00:05:22.470> into<00:05:22.919> place

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
headphones you can click this into place

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.570 
headphones you can click this into place
so<00:05:23.639> that<00:05:23.820> will<00:05:24.030> support<00:05:24.510> that<00:05:25.310> power<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.520> needs

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
so that will support that power it needs

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.480 
so that will support that power it needs
to<00:05:26.970> drive<00:05:27.180> them<00:05:27.389> or<00:05:27.570> if<00:05:28.229> you<00:05:28.350> have<00:05:28.560> say<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:29.130> pair

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
to drive them or if you have say a pair

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.580 
to drive them or if you have say a pair
of<00:05:29.639> Apple<00:05:30.180> earbuds<00:05:30.360> she<00:05:31.110> don't<00:05:31.260> need<00:05:31.380> much

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.080 
of Apple earbuds she don't need much
power<00:05:31.860> at<00:05:32.010> all<00:05:32.100> to<00:05:32.250> drive<00:05:32.430> them<00:05:32.640> you<00:05:32.729> can<00:05:32.910> set

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
power at all to drive them you can set

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.990 
power at all to drive them you can set
it<00:05:33.120> to<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.450> lowest<00:05:33.600> setting<00:05:33.990> which<00:05:34.140> would<00:05:34.350> be

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
it to the lowest setting which would be

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.450 
it to the lowest setting which would be
around<00:05:36.050> 10<00:05:37.050> ohms<00:05:37.350> or<00:05:37.710> 30<00:05:38.100> ohms<00:05:38.630> then<00:05:40.220> here<00:05:41.220> it

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
around 10 ohms or 30 ohms then here it

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.640 
around 10 ohms or 30 ohms then here it
will<00:05:41.550> also<00:05:41.820> have<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.030> out<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:43.470> line<00:05:43.620> out

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
will also have the out the line out

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.250 
will also have the out the line out
which<00:05:43.919> goes<00:05:44.160> into<00:05:44.400> your<00:05:44.430> speakers<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.110> can

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
which goes into your speakers so you can

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.170 
which goes into your speakers so you can
DJ<00:05:46.530> with<00:05:46.710> and<00:05:46.919> then<00:05:47.340> on<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.610> back<00:05:47.760> it<00:05:48.060> gives
