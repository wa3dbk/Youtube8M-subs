00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.470
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.630
 position issue 27 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.059
 and first I would like to show you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.179
 interesting tactics on the map El Halluf 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.660
 for fast tanks right at the beginning of the battle 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.689
 drive to square a3 and wait here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.529
 opponents from the mountain do not just move 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.980
 get started 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 sniping everyone who pokes out 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.769
 on the harp and in general damage them if u 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.410
 your tank strong tower you can 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.420
 not bad yet to tank such a tactic 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.250
 will cause enemy tanks 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.020
 stop to shoot at you 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.829
 because they will be shocked by your 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.149
 boldness and in principle this is what you need 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.340
 because they do not have time for their 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.270
 positions will be there in one place 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.270
 crowd 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.059
 and maybe even shoot them orton 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.219
 and you can calmly troll 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.670
 opponents lean out put them 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.829
 damage highlight them well of course tactics 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.100
 risky but very funny and 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.780
 interesting 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.390
 Mostly this tactic is suitable for 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.229
 a platoon of fast tanks preferably from 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.900
 54 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.420
 or 60 twos because there are frontal 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.150
 shootout and without armor there will be extremely 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.479
 it is difficult of course you can try and 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.689
 alone come here but it is fraught with 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.060
 that you are just a saber crowd though if 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.850
 you will be helped by the allies seeing both cheerfully and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.729
 boldly you go on the attack then maybe 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 everything will turn out and the charge of cheerfulness is provided 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.340
 all day following location 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.220
 located on the map northwest in 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 square a7 you will need very much 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.590
 fast tank and help of several 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.570
 allies if you play a platoon then you 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.880
 easier since 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.579
 Sovzvodnye can help in general quite 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.149
 hard to come in here as you can see 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.920
 there is such a kind of train 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.560
 It turned out and still hellcat climbed 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 here I somehow showed similar 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.829
 position but here is the same with only 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.229
 another respon and really very 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.220
 interesting place you can ride here 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.590
 over the mountains and shoot over 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.130
 flat territory really from here 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.140
 just a stunning view opens and 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.630
 there is always someone to shoot at 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.000
 you shoot inviza because 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.310
 to light you here well, almost unreal 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.040
 if only opponents are too close 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.170
 will drive up and then you will light but here 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.710
 there is where to hide therefore it is not 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.510
 the problem for this position is very good 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.390
 hellcat fits because he has 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.860
 excellent masking and excellent angles 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.350
 vertical guidance 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.080
 and of course other fast tanks 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.540
 feels good here 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.370
 can realize themselves here because 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.320
 there is always a while to shoot 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.170
 the problem is just to 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.930
 someone helped you to get here not 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.910
 there will always be responsive allies 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.390
 who will help you and not all play 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.090
 cocked up but still the position is so 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.240
 chic and worth trying here 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.130
 climb and really opportunities 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.320
 there are a lot of you, not only 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.420
 you can shoot but you will 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.500
 be completely safe and 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.330
 see the whole map in full view 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.420
 further more interesting point on the map 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.760
 quiet coast squared g1 you 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.670
 need a fast tank preferably with 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.250
 good disguise and also you should 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.160
 lightly nudge your allies 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.310
 strive upward and once upon a time 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.430
 I showed this position maybe 5 years 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.280
 back about but since then already many in 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.350
 school went and probably no longer knows this 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.200
 position besides this card redid 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.970
 already a hundred times now here for you 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.010
 opens a huge amount 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.920
 opportunities you can shoot through 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.670
 colossal territory and at the same time a chance 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.220
 there is minimal here though if you 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.860
 and even see, you can quickly move out 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.500
 down the hill and hide behind the folds 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.690
 terrain in the whole place just 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.959
 amazing and besides it is not limited 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.479
 one square g1 you can 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.720
 move all the way around 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.620
 there in the square k1 to call in and in general 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.599
 no words just gorgeous 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.789
 the choice of technique for this point is obvious 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:31.539
 These are tanks with a good disguise so as not to 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.379
 it is desirable to have perks 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.139
 relevant were such as 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.659
 masking light well and also tank 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.360
 must be pretty quick of course 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.819
 quite difficult to get here but I 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.669
 I think soon when there Jobs 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.919
 Makes video for this position 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.590
 here will get quite a lot and you 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:55.180
 always help your allies and you 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.400
 you can calmly stand and snipe here 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.490
 further goes just gorgeous. on the map 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.099
 Karelia squared e7 you need 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.469
 less fast orton and paste and 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:09.550
 here in this place it would seem pretty 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.150
 simple position but at the same time extremely 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.789
 effective from here you can 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.819
 shoot three directions at once 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:19.129
 for example the square g3 where very often 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:22.310
 stand on the walls period enemy tanks and 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:25.009
 they are not aware that you can 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.699
 shoot the same way from here 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:31.610
 square b 6 there are all sorts of enemy 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.389
 C-shki and you can also on them 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.909
 throw on 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.699
 also from here you shoot well 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.919
 j5 square where very often attacks 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:43.069
 enemy tanks and you can without problems 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:45.580
 shoot them in a whole place just 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.529
 chic you're still here 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.740
 security well of course if opponents 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:54.800
 will attack then you just retreat and 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.560
 Stand on a standard position I hope 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.050
 do you like this place if you will 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:03.289
 use it I wish you good luck and 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.770
 I hope you can shoot a bunch here 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.460
 damage and last location on 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.639
 Today 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.339
 map polar square g7 you 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.800
 need any fast tank with good 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:18.620
 disguise and appropriate 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.589
 equipment of course tactics a bit 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.839
 risky going here in this place if 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:26.750
 there are no opponents then move forward 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:29.089
 forward here to this bush if you are up 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.000
 he got to assume that everything is in 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.940
 okay so how can you be fine here 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.270
 shine 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.950
 nor will your opponents see you 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.130
 very much depends on your allies 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:44.100
 from your aut and first of all if she 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.290
 will normally shoot then you get 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.360
 a lot of experience 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:50.610
 if you get up to taste then opponents are unlikely 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.300
 you will already see and you can calmly 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.360
 shine and the light on this map is extremely 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.810
 a dangerous thing that very often leads 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.790
 to victories for your team of course there is 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.960
 the risk that any enemy tank 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.200
 go by language 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.890
 but not the fact that he will light you therefore 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.170
 shine and friends on health and on this 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:16.050
