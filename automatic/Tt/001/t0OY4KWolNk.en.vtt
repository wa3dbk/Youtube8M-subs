00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.529
 it is very likely that you use 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.120
 ductile iron pipes at all 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.220
 days without even knowing it 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.719
 indeed the underground conduits that 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.940
 was making way for drinking water are 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.250
 cast in ductile iron the same is true 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.560
 for the sewer pipe that vents your 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.080
 wastewater the ductile iron is no longer 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.180
 flexible than the usual gray iron so 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.930
 under pressure they will fold before they get 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.840
 break ductile iron pipes do 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 handy are made of 90% metal 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.280
 recycled have a shelf life of 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.630
 several hundred years there 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.070
 production starts in the park at 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.140
 scrap from the pipe factory 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
 these old cars are on their way to 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 the shredder that he will reduce in 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.390
 Pieces factory sorts its pieces by 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.430
 material she rejects the plastic before 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.120
 aluminum and copper and keeps 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.320
 steel iron 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.620
 The factory also receives scrap metal 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.210
 demolished buildings and other sources 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.160
 once the chemical composition has been analyzed 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.840
 the shredded metal currant in 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.670
 consequence the operator of the crane 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.650
 uses an industrial magnet for 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.940
 welcome a specific thing of each type 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.940
 steel and iron 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.790
 and shredded metals go into a 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 shoal fed from no shape 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.850
 of coal at 1400 degrees Celsius the iron 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.690
 and steel liquefy and 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.060
 impurities are eliminated the workers 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.650
 then add magnesium gray iron 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.930
 ordinary becomes so cast 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.930
 ductile more resistant and more flexible 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.910
 the liquid cast iron flowing in a 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.220
 chute to a machine to sink it 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.720
 enters a centrifugal mold hours the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.800
 centrifugal force projects down payment 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.800
 against the walls of the mold 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.100
 street cooling system lowers 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.260
 the temperature of the walls so that the 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.110
 melting solidifies in seconds 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.149
 a useful extractor then a soot or 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.750
 ductile iron 6 meters long the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.460
 industry standard before every 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.800
 molding of workers inserts a shape 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.290
 round a nucleus in one end 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.240
 of the mold the fauna filled the void between 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.720
 the core and the mold thus forming a 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.550
 flared tip call a tulip in order to 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.710
 connect the pipes the installers 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.250
 inserts the plain end of a pipe into the 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.870
 tulip the previous word core 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.360
 also the end of the mold thus avoiding 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.640
 that the liquid iron does not flow during 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.410
 molding a rubber seal the one 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.820
 the binding the same machine to sink pu 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.620
 make pipes of different 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.970
 diameters by simply changing the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.970
 mold size inside 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.540
 once the pipe is extracted from the factory lepez 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.250
 measure the thickness of his parish so 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.040
 to ensure that they respect the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.959
 specifications the kernel is next 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.730
 removed by the end of the tulip 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.650
 as it is made of sand and resins 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.010
 plastics they disintegrate everything 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.010
 simply 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.310
 no 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.250
 this factory manufactures pipe 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.549
 different diameters but no matter the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.560
 cut 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.150
 the molding process remains the same 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.680
 it only takes less time to 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.209
 the smaller pipes because it is 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.209
 solidifies faster 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.920
 the freshly ground pipe the atheists 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.599
 about 800 degrees celsius however as soon 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.260
 they leave the mold its temperature 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.569
 fall 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.610
 this fast cooling before melting 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.909
 brittle I am or is going so directly 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.709
 in this gas annealing furnace 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.659
 this one warms it to 930 degrees 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.640
 celsius which alters the structure 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.459
 internal cast making it flexible to 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.349
 again the pipe then goes into a 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:09.420
 cooling chamber where he is 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:11.579
 sprinkled with cold water to prevent the 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.920
 corrosion attacks the cast iron inside 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:17.390
 is sprayed with cement to form the 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.390
 3 mm thick coating 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.199
 the interior is then equalized in 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.539
 rotating the pipe during 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:32.280
 few seconds and all the pipe is 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.820
 then bread both indoors and 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.070
 outdoors 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.199
 the surface is so those who 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.370
 allows the cement to harden during 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.350
 Next 24 hours 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.080
 this process also allows protection 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.789
 increased against the roulette and finally 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.860
 happy beautiful wines a demarcation 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.480
 around the right end of each 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.860
 pipe 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.720
 and it's a depth guide that 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.880
 allows the installation team to 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.100
 that the right end of the hose was 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.750
 tight or so deeply possible in 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.750
 the pipe tulip or following
