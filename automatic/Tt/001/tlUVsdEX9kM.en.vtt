 video more then find very well and 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.840
 today I bring you top 5 tanning 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 we go with the bronzers I already have 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.380
 correctors and illuminators that if not 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.059
 you've seen it, I'm going to leave you here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.880
 linked so that the checks 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.340
 this is a miniseries of those 25 that more 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.619
 I liked the illuminators 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.210
 correctors and now tanners like that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.189
 what good if you want to know what my 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.720
 Favorites, I invite you to watch the video and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.090
 vidic to all the teachers that I am going 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.070
 to show does not have any brightness are the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.649
 matte finish to my particular me 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.019
 they like the matte finish and the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.760
 shine I put it with an illuminator because 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.429
 there are bronzers that are very shiny if 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.440
 then it looks like like half will hit 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:44.999
 the faces and well that 's it depends on each 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.679
 taste and without order of preference 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.409
 start with this one of the brand courtois 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:52.350
 that is the brown without power and good this 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.649
 I love it is like tai ingredient of 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.479
 chocolate so it smells still smells 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.399
 even though I already have a little time with him and 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.139
 I've used it a lot and it's like a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.950
 chocolate tablet as you can see 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:06.380
 here it is marked as if it were 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.650
 the tablet and the truth is that I love 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.660
 this tan is very beautiful has a 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.240
 very soft texture has a very tone 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.060
 warm for light skins half me 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.340
 love and suddenly I get tired of him and what 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.190
 I keep and I know that it comes out again 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.740
 in me in my daily routines because it's 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.810
 terrific great and then the truth 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.970
 It has very good quality I like it a lot 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.850
 the bourgeois brand is very good 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.650
 products for face and good 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.920
 definitely this is has become 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.900
 in my top 5 of this video I will not leave 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.509
 back my color citi palette that is 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.490
 great effects point and how good 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.440
 I use the middle because it's like 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.440
 the one that adapts a little more to my skin 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.940
 this is a little darker and good 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.550
 when I want to do something much more 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.290
 marked already I go to this one but already it is more 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.700
 dark for my skin tone so 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.369
 Well, I'll take the middle one 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.200
 the color bronze and although it says 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.800
 bronze does not have any brightness is the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.690
 Matt finish is very good and the truth is 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.840
 like a lot to do the outline has 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.429
 a warm hue and yellows by 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.790
 what is not going to look like 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.739
 overloaded our face and is 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.379
 having a good time right now so 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.810
 listen to a ruidazo is not going to see very 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.269
 loaded on my face so that's why I 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.250
 I really like the tonality I 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.010
 preference I use those that have a 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.700
 yellow finish instead of those that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.549
 they have red or very intense coffee because 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.040
 tend to look very artificial in the 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.739
 face so it's better to go to this 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.840
 kind of colors and well if you 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.939
 you are a little bit more dark then you have left 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.250
 pretty good this tone here in some 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.590
 small amounts to little touches what 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.780
 you can apply better so 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.879
 well this would be the number 2 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.709
 939 with the next one that is is not 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.319
 precisely a bronzer because it has 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.299
 a cold tone and this I use it a lot 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.730
 in winter when I do not want to see me 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.280
 tanned but I want to give contour to 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.959
 face then he used this nyc that the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.200
 truth is that it is very good and it is in the 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.950
 tone everything is a flush and good is like 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.120
 they see totally a cold very cold tone 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.830
 that does not compare to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.410
 hence, I am teaching you 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.250
 this is a cold tone completely and it 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.200
 You see how as off but this is very 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.140
 good trick for when it's winter and 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.470
 they want their face to be outlined 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.300
 in a more natural way without seeing 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.490
 exaggeratedly because in winter they fall 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.960
 the tones of the skin and already one can not 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.390
 apply as the equal bronzer 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.790
 so so this is great for those 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.010
 Seasons is very beautiful it is very 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.630
 pigmented also has as I say 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.410
 a background 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.350
 grayish a little cold and it's very 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.010
 recommended for clear skins half 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.440
 It is very good and it is narrow what 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.600
 has recommended a lot and that is easy 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.480
 to find lately is the new york 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.820
 color and this is from here the smoot skin is 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.750
 a bronze face power and it 's in the tone 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.230
 sony and it's a lovely tone is 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.290
 is the perfection of the outline in this 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.450
 dust I love is very good has a 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.880
 quite pretty pigmentation pretty 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.260
 acceptable and as you see all these have 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.350
 the same hue that is 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.270
 this warm coffee is suddenly a 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.220
 little more raised the tone a bit more 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:37.810
 clarito this for example I gave them color is 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.700
 almost equal to this one is very similar 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.770
 and well all this kind of 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.530
 bronzers help us a lot to give 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.540
 contour to shape our face to 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.690
 that does not look even that it looks more 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.870
 three-dimensional that has a little more than 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.820
 way and well then this is terrific 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.720
 I say they find it already I think that this 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.250
 brand in walmart and sambors and it's super 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.410
 economic the truth I recommend it 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.600
 quite touristy and the next one would be 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.580
 from this palette here that is from to face 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.700
 and is an issue two years ago but 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.010
 You can find this bronzer in a 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.740
 individual and it's called affirms on facebook 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.290
 and good comes very complete I have a 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.900
 full review of this palette 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.030
 with a make-up that I made them ago 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.590
 a while and well I think I have two 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.169
 or three I'll leave them here in the 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.970
 health over here on the screen and the one that 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.370
 I like it a lot, this one here is the 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.100
 Soleil chocolate and good is very very 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.340
 already known this bronzer is great 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.139
 is the matte finish has that tonality 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.100
 with a lovely yellow base that leaves you 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:43.630
 a very nice super elaborate look has 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.270
 a texture 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.730
 to apply is blurred as if 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.820
 nothing and the truth is that I love has 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.920
 very good quality rumors and 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.190
 bronzers of the to face brand so 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.100
 I recommend them very much they are super 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.020
 beautiful, very well, I say very precious 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.840
 and good to have them in this palette together 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.750
 the truth is that it is a very good 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.390
 investment when they go out especially in 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.370
 special Christmas editions so 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.370
 good and finally girls I love you 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.840
 add a plus a pylon and what are these 

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.700
 that they have also seen in several of 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.650
 my videos and these are from here of the 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.810
 brand set 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.030
 it's the sound club I did not want to do it like 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.800
 Mainly, I did not want to 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.420
 like in the top 5 because this is this 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.310
 Mark no longer get it here in Mexico 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.710
 but they are definitely the 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.130
 sunbathers of the most wonderful thing that 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.010
 I have found and this brand is very 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.410
 good them because they took away the truth 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.810
 that I have the two that are for skin 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.430
 clear and for skin a little bit more brown 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.320
 and good obviously to the clear skin 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.390
 I've been finishing it is already super 

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.600
 damaged the poor man has a tonality 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.270
 Precious very adaptable for skins 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.030
 clear 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.400
 it's wonderful smells like a delicious part 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.200
 the formula and this one here that is for 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.000
 skins a little bit more brown then good 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.100
 so well girls I hope you have 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.660
