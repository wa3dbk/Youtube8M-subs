for a minecraft survival island anyways
the<00:00:32.520> reason<00:00:32.759> why<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.880> chose<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.450> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
the reason why I chose this one is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.930 
the reason why I chose this one is
because<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.800> an<00:00:34.980> island<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.550> too

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
because it is not on an island it's too

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.819 
because it is not on an island it's too
high<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.570> air<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.739> not

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
high up in the air it's like so it's not

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.500 
high up in the air it's like so it's not
like<00:00:38.010> I'm<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.489> really<00:00:38.790> pretty<00:00:39.120> much<00:00:39.300> close

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

temple right x bond that could be a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
temple right x bond that could be a
deterrent<00:00:49.469> i'm<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.890> sure<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:50.579> guys

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
interesting to add to the challenge of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
interesting to add to the challenge of
trying<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> conquer<00:00:57.829> probably<00:00:58.829> dig

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
trying to conquer probably dig

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.869 
trying to conquer probably dig
underneath<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.579> i'm<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.329> sure<00:01:00.390> how<00:01:01.670> crazy<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
underneath it i'm not sure how crazy it

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.850 
underneath it i'm not sure how crazy it
would<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:03.989> animals<00:01:04.350> squatting<00:01:04.799> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
would be you got animals squatting in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.210 
would be you got animals squatting in
here<00:01:04.979> mostly<00:01:05.430> sheep<00:01:06.530> I'm<00:01:07.530> sure<00:01:07.830> eventually

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
here mostly sheep I'm sure eventually

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.670 
here mostly sheep I'm sure eventually
you'll<00:01:08.909> come<00:01:09.090> across<00:01:09.210> cows<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.990> other<00:01:10.110> things

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that will spawn on here because it is

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.730 
that will spawn on here because it is
considered<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.450> Plains<00:01:12.689> biome<00:01:12.869> right<00:01:13.290> no

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
forest which they should spawn maybe not

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.789 
forest which they should spawn maybe not
as<00:01:16.080> many<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.830> they<00:01:16.950> should<00:01:17.220> still<00:01:17.460> spawned

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
as many but they should still spawned

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.120 
as many but they should still spawned

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.080 
it's a little weird ravine it goes like
this<00:01:58.440> comes<00:01:59.280> back<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.940> then<00:02:00.570> goes<00:02:00.900> this<00:02:01.080> way

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
this comes back and then goes this way

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.400

I've<00:02:03.090> never<00:02:03.360> seen<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.690> ravine<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.200> this

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
I've never seen a ravine like this

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.499 
I've never seen a ravine like this
before<00:02:04.800> I'm<00:02:05.009> sure<00:02:05.430> people<00:02:05.610> other<00:02:05.940> people<00:02:06.030> have

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509

my<00:02:10.380> previous<00:02:10.890> seed<00:02:11.190> video<00:02:11.459> where<00:02:11.670> was<00:02:11.819> five

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
my previous seed video where was five

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.930 
my previous seed video where was five
ravines<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.100> all<00:02:14.100> connected<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.700> each<00:02:14.730> other

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
ravines and all connected to each other

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.710 
ravines and all connected to each other
but<00:02:15.180> still<00:02:15.480> pretty<00:02:15.660> pretty<00:02:16.380> neat<00:02:17.480> one<00:02:18.480> last

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
but still pretty pretty neat one last

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.780 
but still pretty pretty neat one last
look<00:02:19.050> at<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.230> surrounding<00:02:19.800> areas<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:22.790> there

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
look at the surrounding areas and there

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.570

we<00:02:23.910> go<00:02:23.940> I've<00:02:24.300> obviously<00:02:25.019> got<00:02:25.470> pig<00:02:26.040> spawning<00:02:26.370> on

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
we go I've obviously got pig spawning on

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.979 
we go I've obviously got pig spawning on
here<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.940> obviously<00:02:27.150> will<00:02:27.510> get<00:02:27.660> animal

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
here so you obviously will get animal

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.090 
here so you obviously will get animal

i'll let you guys explore this possible
cave<00:02:47.400> system<00:02:47.850> i'm<00:02:48.420> not<00:02:48.870> sure<00:02:49.049> if<00:02:49.140> that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
cave system i'm not sure if that

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.870 
cave system i'm not sure if that
actually<00:02:49.709> leads<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> que<00:02:50.280> system<00:02:50.640> or<00:02:50.760> not

or<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.599> least<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.930> seem<00:03:59.170> like<00:03:59.200> I<00:03:59.470> said<00:03:59.650> before

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
or the least I seem like I said before

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.420 
or the least I seem like I said before
was<00:04:00.099> three<00:04:00.970> trees<00:04:01.470> anyways<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.829> think<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.280> showed

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
was three trees anyways I think I showed

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.119 
was three trees anyways I think I showed
you<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.670> yep<00:04:04.590> that's<00:04:05.590> pretty<00:04:05.709> much<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:05.950> for

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
you the yep that's pretty much it for

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
whether I should stick to doing seeds of

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:55.650 
whether I should stick to doing seeds of
like<00:05:52.720> five<00:05:53.080> or<00:05:53.580> doing<00:05:54.580> the<00:05:54.669> singular<00:05:55.090> seed

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660
