on<00:00:49.289> both<00:00:50.219> sides<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.440> laying<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
on both sides of this laying on the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.670 
on both sides of this laying on the
computer<00:00:53.270> this<00:00:54.270> side<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.510> probably<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.079> ideal

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
computer this side is probably not ideal

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.400 
computer this side is probably not ideal
but<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:57.059> most<00:00:57.390> people<00:00:57.690> should<00:00:57.899> try<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
but I think most people should try and

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
but I think most people should try and
cap<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.739> over<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.460> they<00:01:00.359> can't<00:01:00.660> really<00:01:00.809> see
