00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.539
 two 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.030
 hello how about my name soles and together 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.830
 let's share a lot of recipes 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.420
 super rich and easy that can not be 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.879
 lose and they will see that they will leave 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.950
 just as I look at what we are going to 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.950
 make today the famous velvet red 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.079
 look at the costs that are 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.149
 very good super close and fresh with the 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.519
 cream that we put on top later 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.440
 They will want to die right now we're going 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.540
 to begin with the first step, which is 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.630
 shake you 'll see that it 's super simple 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 let's do it 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.550
 we are going to place in a butter bowl in 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.590
 point to ointment with sugar and essence of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 vanilla to achieve a super cream 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.030
 creamy and very pale 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.030
 and now if we beat cream 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.930
 great we have our butter 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.870
 burned and now what we 're going to do is 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.160
 add the egg and the yolk we put a 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:13.030
 whole enterite egg we separated the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.650
 clear of the yolk I have this gadget 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.930
 super cute but if you can 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.210
 do as grandma did there is no 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.740
 no problem and it is perfect 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.740
 and now we beat 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.500
 well very well our preparation is 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.780
 very good now the only thing that is missing is 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.800
 integrate the dry ingredients we have 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:43.610
 flour 40 baking soda and cocoa 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.370
 we have a faria we are going to place a 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.510
 spoonful of cocoa a teaspoon of 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.250
 baking soda 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.380
 all this I only have previously 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.800
 sifted you also do it at home 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.400
 and with enveloping movements let's go 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.380
 mixing with our milk here I have 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.020
 a jug with milk what we are going to 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.110
 do with this milk is a little secret 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.420
 we added a few drops of lemon what 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.610
 that will achieve this is that our 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.470
 ken capers with a super bark but 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.380
 sing later I'm going to show you and 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.470
 we win we keep integrating very well 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.150
 all the edges from the bottom up 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:27.540
 achieve a homogeneous preparation 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.250
 there you are, see how they are doing good 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.620
 girls this is the last step and the most 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.989
 important let's put the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.299
 coloring what will give you the typical 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.569
 characteristic of red velvet network 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:43.120
 and velvet we grab a teaspoon 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.290
 we integrate it, we can help with a 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.950
 little stick 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.830
 and mix with patience we mix 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.569
 we mix 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.349
 see how it is forming 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.359
 with enveloping movements with desire and 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.230
 do not worry if you do not see it so red 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.670
 because in the oven the intensity goes up and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.249
 they stay just as they have to be 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.319
 Now it's time for cooking 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.959
 what we are going to need is a mold 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.030
 like this one of cupcakes that you're going to 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.099
 need yes or yes because it is essential 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.769
 so that the preparation is maintained 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.780
 inside the pirates that we are going to 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.849
 use in this case I have red and 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.849
 white but can be any color 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.140
 let's complete the pilotines 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.770
 to three quarters of its entirety 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.220
 because if not in the oven when they rise 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.220
 they are going to overflow 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.989
 well now if we are going to take them to 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.470
 oven we need a preheated oven 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:51.010
 at 200 degrees and we're going to leave it during 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.010
 20 minutes 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.940
 Well, well, look how they looked like 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.950
 they have to leave, it 's good that 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.560
 are so raised so that after 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.450
 we can decorate more easily what 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.580
 what are we going to use 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.489
 is a cream of cream -based cheese 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.010
 Milk and cream cheese can use this 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.860
 peak looks curly so that it is super 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.950
 fun then what are we going to do 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.689
 is to place it here so that it still looks 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.709
 plus 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:31.709
 and very little 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.520
 we give him a little run and to give him the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.960
 final touch we place a sugar rose 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.280
 which is made with rubber paste look 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.590
 they saw how easy it is to make these 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.870
 remains to see this crazy pate with a 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.490
 friend together teach the meetings or if not 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.129
 prepare your child for a 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.319
 birthday for a meeting you will see 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:58.300
 that are going to be super good just 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.889
 girls now yes I say goodbye I hope that 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.840
 They have loved sharing this 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.669
 moment with me I hope the next 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.400
 to continue enjoying a lot of 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.400
