hello<00:00:00.329> everyone<00:00:00.750> and<00:00:00.780> welcome<00:00:01.079> in<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:01.890> video

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hello everyone and welcome in this video

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.350 
hello everyone and welcome in this video
we're<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.399> be<00:00:02.490> talking<00:00:02.700> about<00:00:02.909> dual

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
we're going to be talking about dual

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.510 
we're going to be talking about dual
mass<00:00:03.659> flywheel<00:00:03.689> x'<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.859> reason<00:00:05.279> dual

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
mass flywheel x' and the reason dual

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.610 
mass flywheel x' and the reason dual
mass<00:00:05.730> flywheel<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:06.330> exist<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:07.109> actually<00:00:07.470> very

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
mass flywheel is exist is actually very

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.200 
mass flywheel is exist is actually very
similar<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.309> reason<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:08.849> will<00:00:09.000> see

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
similar to the reason that you will see

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.870 
similar to the reason that you will see
Springs<00:00:09.690> inside<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.530> clutch<00:00:10.740> disks<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.429> this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
Springs inside of clutch disks and this

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.759 
Springs inside of clutch disks and this
is<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.150> reduce<00:00:12.269> torsional<00:00:13.049> vibration<00:00:13.590> through

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
is to reduce torsional vibration through

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.709 
is to reduce torsional vibration through
the<00:00:13.860> drivetrain<00:00:14.340> now<00:00:15.000> where<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.450> done<00:00:15.660> on

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
the drivetrain now where it's done on

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.620 
the drivetrain now where it's done on
clutch<00:00:16.230> disks<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:17.100> dual<00:00:17.730> mass<00:00:17.910> flywheel<00:00:17.940> does

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
clutch disks a dual mass flywheel does

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.179 
clutch disks a dual mass flywheel does
it<00:00:18.750> earlier<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> process<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
it earlier in the process so that

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.830 
it earlier in the process so that
vibration<00:00:20.850> never<00:00:21.000> actually<00:00:21.180> gets<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
vibration never actually gets to the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.750 
vibration never actually gets to the
clutch<00:00:22.020> disc<00:00:22.230> itself<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.220> actually<00:00:23.400> within

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
clutch disc itself it's actually within

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.730 
clutch disc itself it's actually within
the<00:00:23.910> flywheel<00:00:24.420> before<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> reaches<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the flywheel before it reaches the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.310 
the flywheel before it reaches the
transmission<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.029> input<00:00:27.240> shaft<00:00:27.689> okay

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
transmission and that input shaft okay

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290 
transmission and that input shaft okay
so<00:00:28.380> how<00:00:28.650> does<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> dual<00:00:29.279> mass<00:00:29.519> flywheel<00:00:29.550> work

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so how does a dual mass flywheel work

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.580 
so how does a dual mass flywheel work
well<00:00:30.570> first<00:00:30.869> let's<00:00:31.109> look<00:00:31.230> at<00:00:31.349> all<00:00:31.470> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
well first let's look at all the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.080 
well first let's look at all the
components<00:00:32.070> involved<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.610> then<00:00:32.880> talk<00:00:33.059> about

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
components involved and then talk about

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
components involved and then talk about
the<00:00:33.390> process<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.950> we're<00:00:35.100> looking

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
the process of it so here we're looking

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.860 
the process of it so here we're looking
at<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> dual<00:00:35.790> mass<00:00:35.969> flywheel<00:00:36.000> it<00:00:36.510> gets<00:00:36.690> its

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
at the dual mass flywheel it gets its

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200 
at the dual mass flywheel it gets its
name<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.680> has<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.129> masses<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.059> we

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
name because it has two masses so we

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.510 
name because it has two masses so we
have<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.570> first<00:00:39.809> mass<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.800> outer<00:00:41.010> portion

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
have this first mass this outer portion

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.010 
have this first mass this outer portion
as<00:00:41.640> I've<00:00:41.820> drawn<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.480> second<00:00:42.899> mass

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
as I've drawn here in this second mass

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.810 
as I've drawn here in this second mass
the<00:00:43.410> inner<00:00:43.559> portion<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:44.070> I've<00:00:44.250> drawn<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the inner portion as I've drawn here and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
the inner portion as I've drawn here and
this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.450> simple<00:00:45.809> way<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> looking<00:00:46.200> at

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
this is a very simple way of looking at

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
this is a very simple way of looking at
it<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.739> course<00:00:46.980> there's<00:00:47.160> many<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.520> complex

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
it of course there's many more complex

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
it of course there's many more complex
ways<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.480> done<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.289> an<00:00:49.559> easy

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
ways it can be done but this is an easy

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.100 
ways it can be done but this is an easy
way<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.010> understand<00:00:50.520> how<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.850> works<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.870> then

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
way to understand how it works so then

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.110 
way to understand how it works so then
these<00:00:52.410> two<00:00:52.800> masses<00:00:53.250> one's<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> be

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
these two masses one's going to be

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.090 
these two masses one's going to be
attached<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> first<00:00:54.809> mass<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.860> flywheel

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
attached the first mass of the flywheel

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.770 
attached the first mass of the flywheel
will<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.610> attached<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> crank<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
will be attached to the crank this is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.110 
will be attached to the crank this is
what<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.500> blue<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> second

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
what it is in blue and then the second

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.090 
what it is in blue and then the second
mass<00:01:00.270> will<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.079> attached<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:02.010> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
mass will be attached to what is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.310 
mass will be attached to what is
essentially<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.359> transmission<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.170> it's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
essentially the transmission so it's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.770 
essentially the transmission so it's
going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:05.070> other<00:01:05.189> side<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
going to be the other side of it so this

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.020 
going to be the other side of it so this
second<00:01:07.200> mass<00:01:07.350> will<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.130> side<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
second mass will be on this side the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.510 
second mass will be on this side the
blue<00:01:09.210> mass<00:01:09.420> will<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:10.020> side<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.310> as

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
blue mass will be on this side and so as

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
blue mass will be on this side and so as
you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:13.110> rotate<00:01:13.320> freely<00:01:13.890> from

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
you can see they can rotate freely from

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.890 
you can see they can rotate freely from
one<00:01:14.430> another<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.060> there's<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.509> spring

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
one another but there's this spring

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.800 
one another but there's this spring
within<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.970> first<00:01:18.210> mass<00:01:18.479> starts

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
within it so as this first mass starts

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.120 
within it so as this first mass starts
to<00:01:18.930> rotate<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> start

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
to rotate it's going to start

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.280 
to rotate it's going to start
compressing<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.790> spring<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.140> will

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
compressing this spring and so this will

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
compressing this spring and so this will
be<00:01:22.380> rotating<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.520> then<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:23.909> spring

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
be rotating this way so then that spring

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.609 
be rotating this way so then that spring
will<00:01:24.390> start<00:01:24.630> pushing<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> second<00:01:25.470> mass

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
will start pushing on the second mass

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.010 
will start pushing on the second mass
and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.250> force<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.939> start<00:01:27.180> rotating<00:01:27.630> but

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
and then force it to start rotating but

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
and then force it to start rotating but
as<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.409> gets<00:01:28.500> these<00:01:28.770> pulses<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.729> Springs

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
as it gets these pulses these Springs

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.060 
as it gets these pulses these Springs
are<00:01:30.360> going<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> balance<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
are going to balance that out so that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
are going to balance that out so that
the<00:01:32.189> second<00:01:32.549> mass<00:01:32.670> doesn't<00:01:32.970> vibrate<00:01:33.240> quite<00:01:33.720> as

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
the second mass doesn't vibrate quite as

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.289 
the second mass doesn't vibrate quite as
much<00:01:34.159> so<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> vibration<00:01:36.000> doesn't

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
much so that that vibration doesn't

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
much so that that vibration doesn't
reach<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.630> transmission<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.250> look<00:01:38.520> at

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
reach the transmission so if you look at

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.060 
reach the transmission so if you look at
the<00:01:39.420> torsional<00:01:39.869> vibration<00:01:40.350> now<00:01:40.680> engines

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the torsional vibration now engines

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.219 
the torsional vibration now engines
don't<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> perfectly<00:01:42.659> even<00:01:43.020> power

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
don't have a perfectly even power

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.499 
don't have a perfectly even power
delivery<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.189> power<00:01:44.399> strokes<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.420> if

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
delivery you have power strokes so if

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.060 
delivery you have power strokes so if
you<00:01:45.600> have<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> four-stroke<00:01:46.259> engine<00:01:46.710> you're

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you have a four-stroke engine you're

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.609 
you have a four-stroke engine you're
getting<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.610> power<00:01:47.850> stroke<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.960> every<00:01:48.990> 180

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
getting one power stroke for every 180

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.780 
getting one power stroke for every 180
degrees<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.189> crankshaft<00:01:50.310> rotation<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:52.200> these

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
degrees of crankshaft rotation so these

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.469 
degrees of crankshaft rotation so these
vibrations<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:53.939> what's<00:01:54.149> hitting<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
vibrations are what's hitting the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
vibrations are what's hitting the
flywheel<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.680> has<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.979> absorb<00:01:56.280> that

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
flywheel and it has to absorb that

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.700 
flywheel and it has to absorb that
vibration<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.960> first<00:01:58.200> mass<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.590> look

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
vibration so the first mass will look

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.469 
vibration so the first mass will look
something<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.030> because<00:02:00.329> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
something like this and then because the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.569 
something like this and then because the
second<00:02:00.840> mass<00:02:00.960> has<00:02:01.200> those<00:02:01.409> Springs<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.520> are

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
second mass has those Springs that are

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.609 
second mass has those Springs that are
absorbing<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.570> energy<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.170> kind

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
absorbing some of that energy and kind

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
absorbing some of that energy and kind
of<00:02:04.680> oscillating<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.340> forth<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.119> won't

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
of oscillating back and forth you won't

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.900 
of oscillating back and forth you won't
get<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.659> much<00:02:06.899> through<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.069> second<00:02:08.459> mass<00:02:08.640> as

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
get as much through the second mass as

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.570 
get as much through the second mass as
far<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.509> vibration<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.979> if<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
far as vibration so if you think of it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.790 
far as vibration so if you think of it
as<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.599> output<00:02:13.050> from<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
as this is the output from the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.220 
as this is the output from the
engine<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.340> vibrating<00:02:14.700> like<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
engine and it's vibrating like this and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.800 
engine and it's vibrating like this and
this<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.370> input<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.150> transmission

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
this is the input to the transmission

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.510 
this is the input to the transmission
the<00:02:18.990> output<00:02:19.710> is<00:02:19.890> going<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.100> be<00:02:20.220> kind<00:02:20.430> of

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
the output is going to be kind of

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.710 
the output is going to be kind of
bouncing<00:02:20.880> back<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.210> forth<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.600> those

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
bouncing back and forth with those

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.320 
bouncing back and forth with those
Springs<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.980> engine<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.520> then<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.030> input

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
Springs of the engine and then the input

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.670 
Springs of the engine and then the input
of<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> transmission<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.410> be<00:02:25.500> much

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
of the transmission is going to be much

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.350 
of the transmission is going to be much
more<00:02:25.950> smooth<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> course<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.240> all

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
more smooth now of course this is all

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.570 
more smooth now of course this is all
happening<00:02:27.570> while<00:02:27.960> it's<00:02:28.170> rotating<00:02:28.830> but<00:02:29.430> that's

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
happening while it's rotating but that's

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.920 
happening while it's rotating but that's
essentially<00:02:30.060> what<00:02:30.210> it's<00:02:30.330> going<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.480> look<00:02:30.570> like

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
essentially what it's going to look like

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.950 
essentially what it's going to look like
and<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:32.490> reason<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> done<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.660> actually

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
and the reason this is done is actually

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.570 
and the reason this is done is actually
to<00:02:34.110> prevent<00:02:34.410> as<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.740> mentioned<00:02:35.190> torsional

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
to prevent as I mentioned torsional

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460 
to prevent as I mentioned torsional
vibration<00:02:36.090> from<00:02:36.570> reaching<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.080> drivetrain

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
vibration from reaching the drivetrain

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.860 
vibration from reaching the drivetrain
so<00:02:38.340> what<00:02:38.670> are<00:02:38.790> some<00:02:38.820> scenarios<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.600> which<00:02:39.630> you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
so what are some scenarios in which you

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.730 
so what are some scenarios in which you
would<00:02:39.930> want<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.350> this

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
would want to do this

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.910 
would want to do this
well<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.780> diesel<00:02:42.780> engines<00:02:43.080> for<00:02:43.320> example<00:02:43.770> they

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
well the diesel engines for example they

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.320 
well the diesel engines for example they
have<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.070> lot<00:02:44.280> more<00:02:44.310> vibration<00:02:44.940> as<00:02:45.090> they<00:02:45.210> have

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
have a lot more vibration as they have

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.170 
have a lot more vibration as they have
higher<00:02:45.510> torques<00:02:45.960> low<00:02:46.950> rpm<00:02:47.430> engines<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.060> if

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
higher torques low rpm engines so if

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.360 
higher torques low rpm engines so if
you're<00:02:48.300> at<00:02:48.450> idle<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.620> can<00:02:49.800> actually<00:02:49.950> you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
you're at idle and you can actually you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.220 
you're at idle and you can actually you
know<00:02:50.490> using<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:51.030> system<00:02:51.330> like<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:52.050> might

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
know using a system like this you might

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.620 
know using a system like this you might
be<00:02:52.290> able<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.650> lower<00:02:52.860> your<00:02:53.040> idle<00:02:53.400> speed<00:02:53.730> because

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
be able to lower your idle speed because

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.970 
be able to lower your idle speed because
you<00:02:54.750> won't<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.050> as<00:02:55.170> much<00:02:55.290> vibration

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
you won't have as much vibration

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.860 
you won't have as much vibration
reaching<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> transmission<00:02:57.420> things<00:02:57.690> like

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
reaching the transmission things like

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.550 
reaching the transmission things like
that<00:02:59.240> even<00:03:00.240> when<00:03:00.390> you<00:03:00.510> do<00:03:00.660> decouple<00:03:01.080> from<00:03:01.230> it

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
that even when you do decouple from it

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.070 
that even when you do decouple from it
you<00:03:01.650> can<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.040> know<00:03:02.210> lower<00:03:03.210> that<00:03:03.390> idle<00:03:03.750> speed

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
you can you know lower that idle speed

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.410 
you can you know lower that idle speed
so<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.160> benefit<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.760> also<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
so it is one benefit of it also it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.390 
so it is one benefit of it also it
allows<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.930> use<00:03:07.110> lower<00:03:07.560> cylinder<00:03:08.070> counts

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
allows you to use lower cylinder counts

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.650 
allows you to use lower cylinder counts
and<00:03:08.520> this<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.760> certainly<00:03:09.030> something<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
and this is certainly something that the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.200 
and this is certainly something that the

engines and lower cylinder counts as a

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.380 
engines and lower cylinder counts as a

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
way of reducing fuel consumption and so

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.390 
way of reducing fuel consumption and so
with<00:03:18.750> lower<00:03:18.989> cylinder<00:03:19.500> counts<00:03:19.800> unfortunately

be<00:03:35.790> maintenance<00:03:36.270> often<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.070> when<00:03:38.340> you

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
be maintenance often you know when you

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.440 
be maintenance often you know when you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
get a a clutch replaced with a dual mass

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.970 
get a a clutch replaced with a dual mass
flywheel<00:03:42.480> oftentimes<00:03:43.380> they'll<00:03:43.530> say<00:03:43.709> you<00:03:43.770> have

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
flywheel oftentimes they'll say you have

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.860 
flywheel oftentimes they'll say you have
to<00:03:44.070> replace<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.790> flywheel<00:03:45.180> as<00:03:45.330> well<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.780> this

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
to replace the flywheel as well and this

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.720 
to replace the flywheel as well and this
can<00:03:46.020> be<00:03:46.080> very<00:03:46.260> expensive<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:47.370> reason<00:03:47.640> behind

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
can be very expensive the reason behind

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.640 
can be very expensive the reason behind
that<00:03:47.970> is<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.360> more<00:03:48.420> difficult<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.989> machine<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
that is it's more difficult to machine a

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.400 
that is it's more difficult to machine a
dual<00:03:50.100> mass<00:03:50.280> flywheel<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.390> be<00:03:51.570> done<00:03:51.840> but

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
dual mass flywheel it can be done but

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.350 
dual mass flywheel it can be done but
often<00:03:52.709> time<00:03:52.920> repair<00:03:53.280> shops<00:03:53.520> will<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.850> say<00:03:53.970> we

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
often time repair shops will just say we

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.840 
often time repair shops will just say we
don't<00:03:54.510> want<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.690> try<00:03:54.930> we'll<00:03:55.590> just<00:03:55.950> swap<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.640> out

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
don't want to try we'll just swap it out

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.570 
don't want to try we'll just swap it out
with<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.090> new<00:03:57.560> new<00:03:58.560> dual<00:03:58.770> mass<00:03:58.950> flywheel<00:03:58.980> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
with a new new dual mass flywheel and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.060 
with a new new dual mass flywheel and
that<00:03:59.970> can<00:04:00.180> be<00:04:00.330> very<00:04:00.540> costly<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.500> they<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.739> serve

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
that can be very costly so they do serve

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.130 
that can be very costly so they do serve
a<00:04:02.100> very<00:04:02.430> valuable<00:04:02.790> purpose<00:04:03.270> but<00:04:04.080> that

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
a very valuable purpose but that

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.750 
a very valuable purpose but that
disadvantage<00:04:04.770> could<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.130> cost<00:04:05.580> in

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
disadvantage could be a cost in

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.970 
disadvantage could be a cost in
maintenance<00:04:06.030> now<00:04:06.840> one<00:04:07.080> other<00:04:07.200> thing<00:04:07.380> I<00:04:07.800> did

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
maintenance now one other thing I did

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.350 
maintenance now one other thing I did
not<00:04:08.130> yet<00:04:08.310> mention<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:08.850> may<00:04:09.090> find

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
not yet mention is you may find

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.509 
not yet mention is you may find
different<00:04:09.600> types<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.170> Springs<00:04:10.500> within<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.430> you

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
different types of Springs within it you

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.070 
different types of Springs within it you
could<00:04:11.640> have<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.790> soft<00:04:12.060> spring<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.630> hard<00:04:12.870> spring

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
could have a soft spring and hard spring

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.770 
could have a soft spring and hard spring
or<00:04:13.380> combination<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.430> those<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.300> basically

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
or combination of those and basically

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.420 
or combination of those and basically
the<00:04:16.260> soft<00:04:16.470> spring<00:04:16.709> will<00:04:16.859> be<00:04:16.950> done<00:04:17.160> for<00:04:17.340> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
the soft spring will be done for the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.699 
the soft spring will be done for the
lower<00:04:17.580> torques<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.780> also<00:04:19.109> like<00:04:19.260> starting<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
lower torques and also like starting the

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.920 
lower torques and also like starting the
engine<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.190> reduce<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.549> vibration<00:04:21.150> whereas

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
engine to reduce that vibration whereas

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.630 
engine to reduce that vibration whereas
the<00:04:22.049> hard<00:04:22.229> Springs<00:04:22.590> will<00:04:23.039> be<00:04:23.190> used<00:04:23.460> for

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
the hard Springs will be used for

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.029 
the hard Springs will be used for
dampening<00:04:24.180> out<00:04:24.360> those<00:04:24.600> higher<00:04:24.930> torques<00:04:25.410> when

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
dampening out those higher torques when

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:26.780 
dampening out those higher torques when
you're<00:04:26.160> really<00:04:26.340> mad

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
you're really mad

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.250 
you're really mad
on<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.940> throttle<00:04:27.330> so<00:04:27.720> if<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.020> have<00:04:28.110> any

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
on the throttle so if you have any

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.480 
on the throttle so if you have any
questions<00:04:28.590> or<00:04:28.680> comments<00:04:28.860> feel<00:04:29.160> free<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.400> leave
