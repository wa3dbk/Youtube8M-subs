00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
start up the match with a vector with a

start up the match with a vector with a
silencer<00:00:09.450> stopping<00:00:10.290> power<00:00:10.410> scavenger<00:00:10.980> and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
silencer stopping power scavenger and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.390 
silencer stopping power scavenger and
ninja<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.660> eventually<00:00:13.139> changed<00:00:13.799> classes<00:00:13.980> I

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
ninja but I eventually changed classes I

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010 
ninja but I eventually changed classes I
think<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.790> ends<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.089> like<00:00:15.299> four<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.690> three<00:00:15.870> with

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
think I ends up like four and three with

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.470 
think I ends up like four and three with
the<00:00:16.080> vector<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.550> get<00:00:17.550> pissed<00:00:17.789> off<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.240> go<00:00:18.359> on

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the vector I get pissed off and I go on

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.900 
the vector I get pissed off and I go on
a<00:00:18.539> rampage<00:00:18.960> with<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.410> sniper<00:00:20.039> rifle<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:20.730> bare

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
entertaining to watch I I wasn't really

entertaining to watch I I wasn't really
actually<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.870> wasn't<00:00:37.050> at<00:00:37.260> all<00:00:37.790> attempting<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
actually it wasn't at all attempting to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.200 
actually it wasn't at all attempting to
upload<00:00:39.390> this<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.809> any<00:00:39.930> way<00:00:40.050> shape<00:00:40.170> or<00:00:40.500> form<00:00:40.559> or

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
upload this in any way shape or form or

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.170 
upload this in any way shape or form or
even<00:00:42.210> record<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> look<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.860> later

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
even record this and look at it later

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
even record this and look at it later
but<00:00:45.180> after<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.780> had<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> actually<00:00:47.100> another

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

here<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:14.280> using<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.670> vector<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.210> need<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.750> use

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
here I'm using a vector I need to use

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.560 
here I'm using a vector I need to use
stopping<00:01:16.290> power<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> vector<00:01:17.360> because<00:01:18.360> it

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
stopping power with a vector because it

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
stopping power with a vector because it
doesn't<00:01:18.869> do<00:01:18.960> much<00:01:19.320> damage<00:01:19.530> at<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:19.860> sort<00:01:20.159> of

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
doesn't do much damage at all sort of

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.850 
doesn't do much damage at all sort of
like<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.400> ACR<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> submachine<00:01:21.420> gun<00:01:21.860> class

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
like the ACR of the submachine gun class

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.810 
like the ACR of the submachine gun class
setup<00:01:23.240> here<00:01:24.240> um<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.960> you're<00:01:25.229> using<00:01:25.409> tool<00:01:25.820> usps

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
setup here um if you're using tool usps

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.670 
setup here um if you're using tool usps
never<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.479> fire<00:01:28.200> them<00:01:28.350> together<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
never actually fire them together like

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.980 
never actually fire them together like
this<00:01:28.920> always<00:01:29.220> burst<00:01:29.640> fire<00:01:29.909> with<00:01:30.299> individual

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
this always burst fire with individual

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.289 
this always burst fire with individual
that<00:01:31.650> way<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.189> reload<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.880> at<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.030> time

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
that way you can reload one at a time

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.440 
that way you can reload one at a time
and<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> actually<00:01:33.900> saves<00:01:34.229> your<00:01:34.500> ass<00:01:35.119> there<00:01:36.119> was

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
and it actually saves your ass there was

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270 
and it actually saves your ass there was
just<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.960> fail<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.740> part<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.189> were<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
just a fail on my part there were a

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940 
just a fail on my part there were a
couple<00:01:38.310> fails<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.950> was

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
couple fails and this is actually I was

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.440 
couple fails and this is actually I was
thinking<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.579> rage<00:01:41.820> quitting<00:01:42.180> when<00:01:42.270> i<00:01:42.329> was

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
thinking of rage quitting when i was

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.920 
thinking of rage quitting when i was
playing<00:01:42.630> smash<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.770> i<00:01:43.979> do<00:01:44.040> many<00:01:44.549> many<00:01:45.000> times<00:01:45.420> if

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
playing smash as i do many many times if

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
lot in large maps especially because

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.539 
lot in large maps especially because
