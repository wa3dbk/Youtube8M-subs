00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.290
 good day in this video is demonstrated 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.599
 budget and fairly accurate method 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.509
 measuring squirt density of water 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.000
 solution 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.820
 The science method is called stain metric 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.730
 despite the scary name method 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 simple and straightforward 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.960
 The main problem is the available scales with 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.630
 discreteness of measurement 1 100 grams and 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.630
 such scales when buying over the Internet 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.100
 will cost about $ 15 well 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.390
 natural and time to deliver scales 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.700
 abroad in order to determine 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.550
 percentage of alcohol in alcohol 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.520
 water solution must be measured 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.620
 solution density by solution density 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.460
 uniquely determined by interest 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.109
 dimensions its alcohol content in a given 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.020
 case for determining the density 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.439
 the original solution is measured by the weight of one 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.150
 the same volume of the original solution and 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:10.799
 same volume distilled water 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.049
 water as volumes is taken completely 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.549
 filled five millimeter 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.860
 milliliter disposable syringe 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.040
 It should be noted that the liquid and FSB persons 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 must be selected not by risk but to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 the final fill syringe is 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.200
 reduce measurement error and so 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.600
 proceed to the measurement of the first dimension 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:41.700
 determine without alcohol aqueous solution 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:46.700
 completely filled with a syringe it can 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.740
 good to see when viewing the video clip 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.380
 we do the next three measurements too 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.619
 most only for distilled water 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.079
 why was it measured three times water 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.509
 in order to show reproducible with 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.640
 measurement results 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.860
 foot measurements taken now calculate 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.950
 density of alcohol aqueous solution 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.950
 divide the weight of the alcohol solution by weight 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.049
 distilled water and get when 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.360
 this is the density of the pepper solution 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:24.569
 kilograms poured our case divide 4 and 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:29.180
 81 by 578 481 is the weight of water alcohol 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:33.000
 solution 578 weight distilled water 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.010
 the syringe is filled and as a result we receive 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.440
 density of 8 and 32 kilograms per liter is 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.220
 corresponds to 89 percent by volume 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.220
 water wash 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.209
 relative measurement error 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:53.380
 it turns out not less it turns out less 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:57.100
 one percent is pretty accurate 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.490
 Finally, we note that the method is convenient because 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.560
 it is relatively accurate and that for 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.130
 measurement requires rather small 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.680
 amount of solution and in principle this 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.970
 the method is available to almost everyone who 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:18.310
 has availability 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:20.170
 about 15 dollars for 30 knives about 500 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.250
 rubles 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.250
 we have all the best
