so very simple case go ahead and take
the<00:02:37.120> iphone<00:02:37.390> 5<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.100> stick<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.130> in<00:02:39.430> there<00:02:39.640> I'm

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
the iphone 5 and stick it in there I'm

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.830 
the iphone 5 and stick it in there I'm
not<00:02:40.330> sure<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:41.170> not<00:02:41.230> sticking<00:02:41.709> very<00:02:42.040> well

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
not sure it's not sticking very well

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.620 
not sure it's not sticking very well
maybe<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.020> have<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.350> take<00:02:44.800> some<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:46.360> others

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
maybe you have to take some the others

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.030 
maybe you have to take some the others
are<00:02:46.750> protective<00:02:47.200> film<00:02:47.440> on<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:47.920> we'll

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
are protective film on this so we'll

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.190 
are protective film on this so we'll
take<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.430> off<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:51.130> very<00:02:51.340> sticky<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.200> they

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
take that off it's very sticky and they

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.830 
take that off it's very sticky and they
said<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.620> there's<00:02:53.830> no<00:02:54.130> residual<00:02:57.840> sticking

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
said that there's no residual sticking

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.740 
said that there's no residual sticking
on<00:02:58.959> this<00:02:59.170> just<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.650> case<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.070> do<00:03:00.450> want<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.570> take

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
on this just in case you do want to take

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.570 
on this just in case you do want to take
this<00:03:01.930> back<00:03:02.170> out<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:03.010> we're<00:03:03.160> just<00:03:03.190> going<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.489> go

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
this back out so we're just going to go

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.810 
this back out so we're just going to go
ahead<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.350> try<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:05.470> line<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.040> up<00:03:06.220> as<00:03:06.430> best

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
ahead and try and line this up as best

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.390 
ahead and try and line this up as best
as<00:03:07.060> we<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.570> on<00:03:08.580> camera<00:03:10.530> hopefully<00:03:11.530> we<00:03:12.100> do<00:03:12.250> this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
as we can on camera hopefully we do this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:22.009 
as we can on camera hopefully we do this
right<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.870> camera<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.380> there<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:18.160> that

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.350 

actually<00:03:23.040> works<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:24.130> well<00:03:24.370> it's<00:03:24.760> not<00:03:24.910> moving

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
actually works very well it's not moving

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.360 
actually works very well it's not moving
at<00:03:25.510> all<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:26.560> was<00:03:26.650> fairly<00:03:26.950> simple

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
at all that was fairly simple

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.030 
at all that was fairly simple
installation<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.239> let's<00:03:28.600> try<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:28.959> close<00:03:29.140> it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.090 

alright<00:03:33.040> cool<00:03:33.310> so<00:03:33.610> that's<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.709> very<00:03:35.709> simple

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
alright cool so that's it very simple

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.170 
alright cool so that's it very simple
case<00:03:36.370> as<00:03:36.670> you<00:03:37.480> can<00:03:37.600> see<00:03:37.840> super<00:03:38.320> thin<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.180> it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
case as you can see super thin and it

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.240 
case as you can see super thin and it
has<00:03:40.360> access<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:43.110> speaker<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:45.070> phone

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
has access to the speaker the phone

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.819 
has access to the speaker the phone
speaker<00:03:45.579> at<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> top<00:03:45.940> and<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.420> small<00:03:47.170> camera

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
speaker at the top and the small camera

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.720 
speaker at the top and the small camera
and<00:03:48.489> again<00:03:49.049> the<00:03:50.049> 8<00:03:50.440> megapixel<00:03:50.650> back<00:03:51.280> facing

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
and again the 8 megapixel back facing

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.699 
and again the 8 megapixel back facing
camera<00:03:52.120> with<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.630> flash<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.380> additional

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
camera with the flash and the additional

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.580 
camera with the flash and the additional
microphone<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.790> that's<00:03:55.030> really<00:03:55.840> a<00:03:55.870> nice<00:03:56.230> case

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
microphone so that's really a nice case

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.449 
microphone so that's really a nice case
nice<00:03:57.220> and<00:03:57.459> slim<00:03:58.620> magnetic<00:03:59.620> clasp<00:03:59.920> so<00:04:00.310> it's

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
nice and slim magnetic clasp so it's

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.580

very<00:04:00.579> easy<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.000> open<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.390> to<00:04:01.930> access<00:04:02.440> the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
very easy to open and to access the

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.259 
very easy to open and to access the
phone<00:04:02.769> like<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.130> said<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:05.170> very<00:04:06.160> nice<00:04:06.310> case<00:04:06.579> so

we're<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.450> going<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.750> throw<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.170> stuff

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
aside and get to the second part of the

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.250 
aside and get to the second part of the
unboxing<00:04:13.810> video

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.190 

this<00:04:17.260> one<00:04:17.940> actually<00:04:18.940> can't<00:04:19.420> remember<00:04:20.550> is<00:04:22.200> Mac

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
this one actually can't remember is Mac

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.120 
this one actually can't remember is Mac
os10<00:04:23.820> version<00:04:24.820> 10.1<00:04:25.540> I<00:04:25.990> think<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:26.890> was

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
os10 version 10.1 I think this was

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.020 
os10 version 10.1 I think this was
version<00:04:27.670> Jaguar

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
version Jaguar

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.340 
version Jaguar
and<00:04:30.590> as<00:04:31.590> you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.890> see<00:04:31.920> it<00:04:32.690> is<00:04:33.690> in<00:04:33.990> its<00:04:34.200> original

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
and as you can see it is in its original

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.700 
and as you can see it is in its original
cellophane<00:04:35.250> packaging<00:04:36.140> so<00:04:37.140> I<00:04:37.170> guess<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.530> is

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
cellophane packaging so I guess this is

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.120 
cellophane packaging so I guess this is
a<00:04:37.740> little<00:04:38.010> bit<00:04:38.130> of<00:04:38.220> a<00:04:38.310> vintage<00:04:38.520> tech<00:04:39.650> 3<00:04:40.650> video

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
a little bit of a vintage tech 3 video

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.800 
a little bit of a vintage tech 3 video
as<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.210> is<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.780> vintage<00:04:43.500> piece<00:04:44.160> of<00:04:44.460> Apple<00:04:45.000> not

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
as this is a vintage piece of Apple not

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.760 
as this is a vintage piece of Apple not
gear<00:04:46.320> but<00:04:46.760> software<00:04:47.760> technology<00:04:48.510> this<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.960> Mac

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
gear but software technology this is Mac

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.910

os10<00:04:50.270> 10.1<00:04:51.270> like<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:51.690> said<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.230> this<00:04:52.500> is<00:04:52.740> the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
os10 10.1 like I said and this is the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.570 
os10 10.1 like I said and this is the
upgrade<00:04:53.460> CD<00:04:53.850> version<00:04:54.570> if<00:04:55.530> I<00:04:55.740> can<00:04:55.980> get<00:04:56.280> that<00:04:56.430> out

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
upgrade CD version if I can get that out

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.060 
upgrade CD version if I can get that out
of<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:56.760> glare<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:58.110> that's<00:04:58.290> really<00:04:58.500> cool<00:04:58.830> and

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
of the glare so that's really cool and

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.550 
of the glare so that's really cool and
it's<00:04:59.130> still<00:04:59.430> in<00:04:59.640> its<00:05:00.140> protective<00:05:01.140> cellophane

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
it's still in its protective cellophane

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.780 
it's still in its protective cellophane
packaging<00:05:02.010> so<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:02.280> has<00:05:02.400> never<00:05:02.520> been<00:05:02.640> opened

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
packaging so this has never been opened

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.640 
packaging so this has never been opened
before<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:03.780> let's<00:05:03.990> see<00:05:04.140> what<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.290> says<00:05:04.380> on<00:05:04.620> the
