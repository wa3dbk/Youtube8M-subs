00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 so hello everyone with you plan hide and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.310
 Today I want to talk about how 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.230
 increase gaming performance 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.550
 maynkravt world of warcraft world of 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.799
 tanks and dota2 and then for this 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.870
 We go to the computer properties of the systems and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.210
 today will show you all known to me 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.029
 ways maybe their more new me 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.710
 I know only a few are allowed 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.930
 go computer properties 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.359
 additional system parameters 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.170
 extra speed and 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.199
 speed click parameters 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.430
 we go further visual effects you 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.020
 will stand his camp and value by 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.370
 default or secured already 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.899
 you put secured better 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.450
 performance will not be put so 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.730
 how do i remove the rights myself pledged so he 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.540
 will refuse without aero timon will refuse my 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.730
 work table 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.350
 then you can see the paging file 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.940
 virtual memory for this we go 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.129
 additionally virtual memory 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.149
 change you you stand automatically 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.800
 play paging file size file size 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.180
 swap can be placed on any of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.039
 two discs or 2 press and but you 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.470
 case it is drive c o press and point 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:10.580
 sizes you will write here and here you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.740
 look written recommended 8008 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.479
 1992 megabytes you put on 1 less 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:22.350
 what is recommended that you have there 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:24.390
 let's say 5600 643 at says height 5642 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.340
 megabytes and maximum size 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.759
 put this one that is recommended to put 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 more than recommended not advised 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.610
 not recommended further go to the panel 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.590
 control and nvidia 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.509
 all nvidia control panel looks like 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.700
 differently on my case like this but y 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.030
 all have parameters 3d go parameters 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.770
 3d control options 3d 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.420
 consider and the graphics processor you would have 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.369
 are either auto selection or something else 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.710
 push high performance 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.140
 nvidia processor further see if u 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.170
 you intel core processor then you can 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.090
 these card from intel core m and it will 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.189
 eat all the performance before you 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.899
 See where the GPUs and 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.350
 on the wife click on where the graphic 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.810
 processors and here here choose 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.760
 jig force yes your video card 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.360
 english son video tick off 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.230
 farther 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.200
 vertical axis vertically 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.150
 sync pulses turn off triple 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:25.580
 buffering turn on then press 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.530
 apply close and further for those u

 who go lag micro panel 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.300
 java program management 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.490
 I'm here java control panel 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:50.260
 go general temporary internet files

 pressing settings we set but 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.540
 only 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.110
 temporary files we put 30 stalin 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.470
 maximum press ok 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.530
 apple then go to java here click

 elif and here in this line at runtime 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.570
 parameter hurry this code I'll leave 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:21.500
 in the description and four bit system then 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:28.060
 write ms xs 1024 mlm their 48 if you 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:31.730
 32 bit system I mean 512m space x 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.510
 xx 1024 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:39.440
 click ok apple ok next if you have

 additional boot option here 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.959
 if you have more than one core already 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.980
 he is big i 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.530
 the leader that is you have multicore 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.320
 processor press the number of processes and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.090
 choose as many processors as u 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.650
 I have you der that is my case it is 4 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.050
 maximum memory is not recommended 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.640
 because windows at every 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.240
 restarting the topic will give out your 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.430
