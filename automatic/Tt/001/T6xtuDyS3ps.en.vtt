00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.290
 hey people and welcome to 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.450
 a new first impression this time too 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.610
 a twelve episodes of anime genre action 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.530
 a bit drama and a bit 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.559
 splatter and the second season is 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.070
 already announced for october 2015 and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 the speech is from or like nostra and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.920
 Here we get a fictional world 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.050
 see in the both humans as well 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.279
 vampires live and right at the beginning of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.260
 story breaks an extreme 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 dangerous virus from that almost the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.490
 extinguish complete humanity and only 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.260
 those of the thirteenth year of life 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.189
 can not have completed this 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.840
 virus survive 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.250
 but the survival is not 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.329
 much better than most of them 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.340
 are from the vampires in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.700
 taken captive in a lower 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.410
 city ​​and there as living 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 Blood bag abuses the vampires 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.140
 completely discriminate against the 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.690
 Humanity and of course are vampires 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.280
 and human natural enemies and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.289
 want to kill each other 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.390
 also youtube or an orphanage 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.129
 is grown up together with his 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.690
 Target siblings captured and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.520
 also in this underground city 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.859
 brought but he would like to work with 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080
 his friends from this underground 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.890
 flee instead 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.229
 I would like to meet barrios first and foremost 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.270
 look at the first episode separately 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.010
 because the following ones have consequences 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 a slightly different narrative style and 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.580
 then play in a slightly different way 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.840
 world but then later the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.340
 first episode tells just this 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.960
 history from because of the virus and 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.369
 this underground place and that the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.270
 children are enslaved there and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.830
 be misused 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.990
 and now especially liked that 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 one has thus seen the discrimination 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 like the vampires the little kids 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.439
 treat how they exploit 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.150
 besides, the story had an extreme 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.700
 airbus tells me personally fast 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.710
 very liked and had the first follow 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 then in itself another twist on 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.329
 At the end I also found the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.549
 first episode serves mainly to 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.520
 times to clarify the situation 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.990
 how are the vampires to the humans 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.759
 you just do not know exactly what 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 when ampera that's about there is one 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.640
 history many different things 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.630
 the glorious sun gives it the sun 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.679
 burn in the sun 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.509
 there is the propagate 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.490
 take other people white it 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.229
 the plants will continue by 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.950
 they bite people and then they have to 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.390
 but kill 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.880
 There are many different ones 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.590
 Tell me what vampires like here 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.560
 it is not very clear to know 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.910
 in any case not the cute vampires and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.470
 then of course it was an extreme 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.410
 character introduction of our 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.930
 all heroes of the friends he has 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.540
 of papers to know the more specific 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 to learn and then you can do the end and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.329
 I have to do the second episode now 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 to be able to enter 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.950
 spoil the end of the first episode 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.510
 because then an extreme change 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.110
 comes and the story then but one 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.560
 takes extremely different course than she does in the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.630
 first episode did it 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.280
 So I'm going to boil that now and that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.140
 Youtube starts an escape attempt 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.030
 can finally escape his too 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.780
 However, friends can not do it and 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.670
 one has the representation that Michael 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.549
 his best friend so good yet 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.810
 a vampire is killed though and 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.040
 I have to go right to the beginning of the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.630
 pick up the first episode 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.600
 the opening british guys and machers 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.519
 from this agb what you have with you 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.840
 The tour is thought to be later 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.180
 maybe somehow cooler to introduce 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.769
 could have been right in the opening too 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.569
 spoiler because you see it right away 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.079
 opening that his best friend Michael 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.700
 still alive and that looks like 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.139
 when they fight each other later 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.739
 and if I'm speculating now 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:24.359
 I would have to say Michael has become 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.359
 a vampire maybe because he is 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.310
 would be bitten for everyone 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.130
 make sense i do not believe that 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.630
 a human is because the opening games 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.709
 that so clearly again that they somehow 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.460
 meet each other and then 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.370
 against each other 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:40.950
 have to and I just do not understand 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.860
 how to do something so important for the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.910
 history simply in the opening 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.260
 consistently it does not show that way 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.970
 that looks very short and then 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.500
 if only if one looks exactly 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.470
 you can see that just has to open 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.850
 watch it and can even halfway in 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.680
 to be deep in sleep you will see me immediately 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.970
 experienced and they will probably be against each other 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.700
 fight because both have weapons in the 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.170
 hand converge on each other 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.850
 I did not really know 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.850
 but now the second episode or 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.040
 the following episodes in general 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.660
 the second consequence is our main stop 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.640
 just on the surface in the 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.910
 Human world meets other people 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.830
 learns a unit that is suitable for 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.960
 the fight against the vampires prescribed 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.610
 and he wants this unit 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.290
 of course , has already connect 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.570
 found an important commander 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.620
 who can take him 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.630
 But now I have to stop first show 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.670
 that he also has the normal school life 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.320
 mastered that I found then 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.340
 somewhere has a bit of this 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.780
 Tension taken out 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.120
 in the first episode especially me 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.650
 this discrimination between vampires 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.570
 and people really liked it 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.310
 that is almost completely one that is 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.210
 actually flown out then in 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.100
 the next ones to follow 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.180
 yet of course we know the trees themselves 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.620
 but each kill these 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.880
 Discrimination factor from because 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.590
 papers discriminate against the small ones 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.750
 I just found children very much 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.450
 great and I would like to actually still 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.430
 seen more 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.350
 nonetheless, the second episode 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.130
 was still through 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.220
 entertaining 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.230
 I had looked at like it's 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.800
 It just adds that to ours 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.780
 he wants to exercise revenge 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.940
 lost his friends or his 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.530
 goal siblings and, of course, too 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.660
 Michael, who is still alive 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.770
 At least that says that opening and then 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.690
 will probably be like that 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.450
 a thing that I still generally 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.020
 need because I do not hold against it simple 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.880
 understand 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.800
 Most people still visit 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.750
 normal school with her are natural 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.310
 all people are very young because the virus 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.720
 yes, all the older people killed 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.040
 definitely visit one now 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.520
 school a completely normal music 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.290
 learn english mats yes ok you need 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.700
 maybe somewhere but in his 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.050
 many situations almost complete 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.970
 Mankind is dead and you know that 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.210
 The people actually only use the papers 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.740
 want to kill why then learn something like that 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.960
 why does not he learn all human beings 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.200
 why do not you all learn to fight? 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.540
 I kill a vampire is such a person 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.560
 small weak point but yes it 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.720
 I would like to continue now 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.630
 Riding was in principle also necessary 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.790
 say the second episode was still 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.990
 neat and solid and I will 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.340
 look forward to each case for now 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.170
 but I have to say that too 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.270
 believe the level the first consequence 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.950
 would have 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.170
 I think that will be in the coming years 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.550
 Do not follow anymore and follow these 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.720
 Drama that follows in the first 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.640
 come up to me, I do not think so 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.600
 so much more so taken up 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.820
 I find it hard now, too 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.440
 tendency to say in principle I would have 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.360
 said so from the second episode it was 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.020
 only then but the first band already closed 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.090
 gl 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.130
 that's why I would basically say that 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.010
 Tendency goes up steeply I watch 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.950
 In any case, it tends to be more 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.690
 to go down slowly because of me 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.550
 from the coming ones follow from the 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.340
 Do not follow two and three now 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.290
 were thrilled 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:46.030
 if it falls but I would times 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.200
 hope we can do this 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.250
 level of first not why you times 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.230
 be reached again with such a 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:53.440
 I'm already in the interesting type 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:55.870
 opening is anticipated and 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.370
 otherwise you are welcome to join us again
