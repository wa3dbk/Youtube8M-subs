00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.379
 hello everyone today in the protects is vine 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.379
 let's see how to connect through 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.869
 wifi the laser printer that we saw the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.310
 last week this laser printer is the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.300
 brother hn 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.250
 21 35 w well the first thing we have to 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.469
 to do is to enter the installation CD 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 that comes with the printer as we saw the 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:35.450
 last week and after this well what 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.450
 we started 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.440
 we see that the program of 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.630
 installation and the first thing he asks us is 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.210
 tell you what kind of printer we have in 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:52.579
 this case as I said is the hl 21 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.409
 35 w we choose the Spanish language 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.920
 and here is no longer several options 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.269
 installation and I what I will choose 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.010
 now it is to simply install the 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.079
 controller you can also install 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.790
 other utilities that this program brings 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.399
 of installation I am going to 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.630
 install the printer via wifi 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.640
 ok click on install the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.649
 Printer driver asks us 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.750
 permission to start the cd we say 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.600
 yes 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.900
 and already the installation program begins 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.610
 tells us the terms of the terms 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.740
 legal licenses we tell you that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.240
 we accept and here he already asks us if 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.369
 we want to connect it by usb or by 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 wirelessly through wifi I'm going to 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.860
 say that I will connect it via wifi 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.890
 click on next 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.660
 and he asks us here what kind of connection 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.550
 we want that because it depends what 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.380
 you want the most normal thing is 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.630
 Printer peer network of 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.180
 brother is the simplest thing worth 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.940
 click on next 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.150
 and here it depends on the firewall 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.720
 have you click on next and 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.670
 we wait 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.610
 Here he asks us if the access point 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.640
 that we have is compatible with vw ps or 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.070
 I do that is the access point is 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.880
 refers to the router that we have at home or 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.770
 that we have in the office if it is 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.200
 compatible can say yes because 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.790
 It will be easier to install if you do not 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.290
 you know or it is not compatible because 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.830
 we say that not like I'm going to do in this 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.360
 case and next to continue 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.280
 we will have to know the name of the network 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.410
 and the password to connect the 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.360
 printer to the wifi we tell you that it is 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.670
 checked and confirmed and we give to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.830
 following 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.330
 here we already have two options 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.940
 installation 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.010
 we can connect it during this 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.950
 installation by a usb cable and when 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.230
 finish installing the remove the cable 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.480
 and it would start working by wifi or 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.460
 we can also configure this 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.500
 device so that it is not necessary 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.090
 install on the cable for installation 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.190
 but already warned that it is a little more 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.510
 complex if you want it to be a 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.130
 simple installation 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.460
 What I recommend is to connect it 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.050
 the usb install it and then you remove the 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.300
 cable and everything works wirelessly 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.230
 we say the advanced method and we give it 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.129
 to next 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.739
 here what it tells us is that if 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.159
 we keep pressing the power button 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:19.840
 of the printer for 10 seconds we 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.150
 will give a list of all the settings 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.879
 who have the printer 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.890
 among them the network configuration of 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.750
 network then here we have to check 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.569
 that the wireless configuration is 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.220
 activated it is worth checking what we say 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.700
 to the computer that we have checked and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.430
 we give the following voucher in this step 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.400
 what it tells us is that the printer creates 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.560
 With a Wi-Fi network what you have to do is 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.120
 connect the computer with that wifi network 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.030
 which creates the printer so that it 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.760
 communicate ok we go to the wifi of the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.090
 computer is worth it and we have to find 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.269
 a network name that is called z and we 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.010
 says he has no password and 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.230
 If you ask us the channel, it has to be 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.709
 channel 11 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.440
 ok we give you to connect we tell you 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.659
 checked and confirmed and clicked on 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.640
 next now it is already looking for the 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.140
 wireless devices in this case 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.389
 I would have to find the printer already 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.729
 that right now they are on the same network already 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.170
 you can not find here the printer that 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.240
 have us to install 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.460
 right now they are in the same network as 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.140
 we see on the computer that is connected 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.480
 to a network called setup that is the 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.400
 own that the printer has created 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.400
 we select and give it to next 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.400
 Now what it says is that 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.639
 let's find our wifi network for 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.699
 connect again to her 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.139
 I choose mine I give to next and I put 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.639
 the key 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.639
 we click the following 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 and already send the configuration to 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.780
 printer is worth 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.320
 the printer should print us a 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.940
 page where he tells us how he is 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.030
 all configurations and we should 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.040
 check then down here we already have 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.080
 that tell you computer if the printer 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.390
 tells us that the connection is ok or the 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.510
 connection is file tells you that you can 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.440
 take up to two minutes to print it 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.730
 ok call me the printed connection ok 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.160
 we selected there and told them in 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.170
 following 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.000
 and again next so you can 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.460
 continue installing select the 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.620
 printer and we have finished installing it 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.420
 and we could start printing to 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.670
 via wifi 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.670
 and this is all until next week
