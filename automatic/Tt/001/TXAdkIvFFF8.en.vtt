this<00:03:17.329> is<00:03:17.570> near<00:03:17.840> where<00:03:17.870> you<00:03:18.140> filmed<00:03:18.500> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
this is near where you filmed the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.550 
this is near where you filmed the
encounter<00:03:18.739> is<00:03:19.070> that<00:03:19.280> right<00:03:19.459> yes<00:03:20.350> seems<00:03:21.350> like<00:03:21.530> a

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
encounter is that right yes seems like a

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.550 
encounter is that right yes seems like a
vast<00:03:22.130> area<00:03:22.549> that's<00:03:23.000> huge<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.959> actually<00:03:24.410> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
vast area that's huge it's actually the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.940 
vast area that's huge it's actually the
largest<00:03:24.980> natural<00:03:25.880> park<00:03:26.239> in<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.540> world<00:03:26.950> and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
largest natural park in the world and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.870 
largest natural park in the world and
also<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.609> coastal<00:03:28.940> per<00:03:29.660> service<00:03:30.109> for<00:03:31.040> marine

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
also a coastal per service for marine

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.509 
also a coastal per service for marine
mammals<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:33.440> think<00:03:33.739> because<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.100> our

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
mammals and I think because of our

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.800 
mammals and I think because of our
footage<00:03:35.060> was<00:03:35.239> taking<00:03:35.690> near<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.140> area<00:03:36.500> then

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
footage was taking near that area then

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.780 
footage was taking near that area then
there<00:03:38.810> was<00:03:39.049> a<00:03:39.350> lot<00:03:39.799> of<00:03:39.859> concern<00:03:40.400> about<00:03:40.609> the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
there was a lot of concern about the

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.810 
there was a lot of concern about the
disturbances<00:03:41.780> to<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.530> habitat<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.579> and

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
disturbances to this habitat and and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.809 
disturbances to this habitat and and
what<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:44.989> may<00:03:45.170> affect<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:45.980> animals

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
what that may affect to the animals

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.120 
what that may affect to the animals
there
