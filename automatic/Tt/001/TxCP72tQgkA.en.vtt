00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and 33 is corrupted in a brick psp's now

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.310 
and 33 is corrupted in a brick psp's now
when<00:01:08.850> i<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.060> creating<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.810> magic<00:01:10.170> memory

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
when i was creating my magic memory

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.090 
when i was creating my magic memory
stick<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.990> didn't<00:01:13.290> work<00:01:13.439> for<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.680> reason

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
stick I it didn't work for some reason

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.630 
stick I it didn't work for some reason
so<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.640> figured<00:01:15.150> out<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:16.650> dot<00:01:16.920> bin<00:01:17.280> file

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
so I figured out that the dot bin file

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.749 
so I figured out that the dot bin file
is<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:19.530> fixed<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.070> image<00:01:20.310> has<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.670> be

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
is the fixed the image has to be

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.340 
is the fixed the image has to be
installed<00:01:20.880> onto<00:01:21.240> your<00:01:21.450> computer<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.170> need

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
installed onto your computer so you need

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.010 
installed onto your computer so you need
to<00:01:22.439> download<00:01:22.650> poweriso<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to download poweriso so you this the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.980 
to download poweriso so you this the
link<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.470> download<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> then<00:01:27.180> open<00:01:27.900> up

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
link just download it and then open up

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.719 
link just download it and then open up
your<00:01:28.259> Pandora's<00:01:28.770> memory<00:01:29.189> stick<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.549> just

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
your Pandora's memory stick and just

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.969 
your Pandora's memory stick and just
copy<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> files<00:01:30.240> onto<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.810> again<00:01:31.079> your<00:01:31.740> memory

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
copy the files onto it again your memory

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.609 
copy the files onto it again your memory
stick<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> image<00:01:33.000> will<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.210> installed<00:01:33.619> now

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
stick so the image will be installed now

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
stick so the image will be installed now
if<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.130> can't<00:01:35.310> even<00:01:35.400> access<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.909> files<00:01:36.270> it's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
if you can't even access the files it's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
if you can't even access the files it's
because<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.810> don't<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.020> winrar<00:01:37.619> extract

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
because you don't have winrar extract

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.569 
because you don't have winrar extract
did<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.000> let<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> link<00:01:39.930> right<00:01:40.049> here

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
did I let it here the link right here

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
did I let it here the link right here
okay<00:01:41.579> there's<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> difference<00:01:42.329> between<00:01:42.360> PSP

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
okay there's a difference between PSP

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.210 
okay there's a difference between PSP
classics<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:43.829> fat<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.610> PSP<00:01:45.030> slim<00:01:45.329> or<00:01:45.840> new<00:01:46.220> ok

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
classics or fat and PSP slim or new ok

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.090 
classics or fat and PSP slim or new ok
so<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.579> difference<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:49.530> PSP

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
so the difference is because the PSP

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.030 
so the difference is because the PSP
slim<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:51.450> takes<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.960> logical<00:01:52.500> memory<00:01:52.649> but

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
slim it takes more logical memory but

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.100 
slim it takes more logical memory but
the<00:01:53.159> PSP<00:01:53.520> classic<00:01:54.060> has<00:01:54.270> more<00:01:54.450> physical<00:01:54.930> memory

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
the PSP classic has more physical memory

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.810 
the PSP classic has more physical memory
now<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.860> deal<00:01:56.100> with<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.579> need<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
now to deal with this you need to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.139 
now to deal with this you need to
download<00:01:56.939> Corley's<00:01:57.540> tool<00:01:57.840> 149<00:01:58.759> what<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.939> is
