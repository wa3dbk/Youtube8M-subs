00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
I think he spotted some gotten over Kim

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.580 
I think he spotted some gotten over Kim
or<00:03:10.090> he<00:03:10.269> sort<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.569> in<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.019> process<00:03:11.379> of<00:03:11.470> getting

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
or he sort of in the process of getting

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.319 
or he sort of in the process of getting
over<00:03:11.799> Kim<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.340> would<00:03:12.459> be<00:03:12.579> nice<00:03:12.760> for<00:03:12.790> him<00:03:13.120> bad

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
over Kim so it would be nice for him bad

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.600 
over Kim so it would be nice for him bad
sort<00:03:13.629> of<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.750> new<00:03:13.920> love<00:03:14.920> in<00:03:14.950> his<00:03:15.250> life<00:03:15.280> a

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
sort of the new love in his life a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.140 
sort of the new love in his life a
little<00:03:15.790> distraction<00:03:16.269> of<00:03:16.720> obstacle<00:03:17.590> as

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
little distraction of obstacle as

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.330 
little distraction of obstacle as
content<00:03:19.150> that's<00:03:19.720> not<00:03:19.959> how<00:03:20.079> I'd<00:03:20.200> if<00:03:20.319> I<00:03:20.500> love<00:03:20.799> you

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
content that's not how I'd if I love you

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.140 
content that's not how I'd if I love you
know<00:03:21.629> but<00:03:22.629> that's<00:03:22.810> what<00:03:22.989> happens<00:03:23.379> in<00:03:23.560> Eureka's

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
know but that's what happens in Eureka's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.380 
know but that's what happens in Eureka's
I<00:03:26.190> think<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.519> definitely<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.000> possibility

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
I think that is definitely a possibility

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.740 
I think that is definitely a possibility
obviously<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.440> this<00:03:30.220> was<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> big<00:03:30.730> trauma<00:03:31.389> for

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
obviously we this was a big trauma for

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.360 
obviously we this was a big trauma for
Henry<00:03:32.019> last<00:03:32.230> season<00:03:32.680> was<00:03:32.859> sort<00:03:33.069> of<00:03:33.099> built

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
Henry last season was sort of built

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.640 
Henry last season was sort of built
around<00:03:33.700> with<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.120> he<00:03:34.480> was<00:03:34.690> mourning<00:03:35.620> the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
around with that he was mourning the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.680 
around with that he was mourning the
loss<00:03:35.799> of<00:03:36.129> Kim<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:36.760> it's<00:03:37.269> kind<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.480> hard<00:03:37.659> to

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
loss of Kim so it's kind of hard to

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.930 
loss of Kim so it's kind of hard to
throw<00:03:37.840> it<00:03:37.930> back<00:03:38.349> in<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.829> water<00:03:39.010> with<00:03:39.639> somebody

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
throw it back in the water with somebody

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.449 
throw it back in the water with somebody
new<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.650> think<00:03:41.859> we<00:03:41.950> have<00:03:41.980> now<00:03:44.459> absolute

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
new but I think we have now absolute

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:52.320 
new but I think we have now absolute
possibilities<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:47.639> so<00:03:48.639> saw<00:03:48.940> wedding<00:03:49.359> rough

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.750 

not<00:03:52.930> let's<00:03:53.230> give<00:03:53.440> away<00:03:53.620> or<00:03:53.740> anything<00:03:53.890> you've

been wearing for any number of reasons

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.760 
been wearing for any number of reasons
we<00:03:57.820> love<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.120> season<00:03:58.450> with<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.960> question<00:03:59.620> and

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
we love the season with a question and

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:10.460 
we love the season with a question and

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.900 
willing to take that chance on you know
something<00:05:24.540> new<00:05:25.430> even<00:05:26.430> though<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.550> actually

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
something new even though I actually

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.810 
something new even though I actually
think<00:05:27.240> that<00:05:27.360> you<00:05:27.600> would<00:05:28.050> be<00:05:28.200> a<00:05:28.230> more<00:05:28.410> solid<00:05:28.820> guy

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
yeah so I think that's where the dilemma

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.860 
yeah so I think that's where the dilemma
you<00:05:35.190> know<00:05:35.310> that<00:05:35.520> dilemma<00:05:35.790> lies<00:05:36.030> history<00:05:36.630> or

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870
