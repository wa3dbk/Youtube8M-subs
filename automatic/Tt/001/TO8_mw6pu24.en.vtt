00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
calculate priority and we can just click

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.499 
calculate priority and we can just click
on<00:01:27.149> start<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:28.229> will<00:01:28.380> automatically<00:01:29.509> create

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
here that it's doing something it's

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.389 
here that it's doing something it's
loading<00:01:36.060> time<00:01:36.990> left<00:01:37.350> looks<00:01:37.800> like<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.039> 20

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
loading time left looks like about 20

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.940 
loading time left looks like about 20
seconds<00:01:39.149> and<00:01:39.330> we'll<00:01:40.289> just<00:01:40.470> wait<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.679> this<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
seconds and we'll just wait for this to

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:51.580

have some steps so the second step is to

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.670 
have some steps so the second step is to
check<00:02:05.119> that<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.360> site<00:02:05.570> map<00:02:05.780> is<00:02:05.810> showing<00:02:06.229> for

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
check that the site map is showing for

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.509 
check that the site map is showing for
you<00:02:06.860> at<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.430> here's<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:09.280> directory<00:02:10.280> here's

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
you at and here's the directory here's

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.759 
you at and here's the directory here's
the<00:02:10.700> link<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.330> site<00:02:11.540> map<00:02:11.780> now<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.470> site

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
the link to the site map now the site

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.820 
the link to the site map now the site
map<00:02:12.950> won't<00:02:13.280> be<00:02:13.640> on<00:02:13.989> this<00:02:14.989> website<00:02:15.500> because<00:02:15.620> I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
map won't be on this website because I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.460 
map won't be on this website because I
haven't<00:02:16.010> uploaded<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.760> to<00:02:16.970> my<00:02:17.480> servers<00:02:17.930> so<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
haven't uploaded it to my servers so the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.290 
haven't uploaded it to my servers so the

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
first thing that we need to do is we

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.960 
first thing that we need to do is we
need<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> upload<00:02:21.080> this<00:02:21.800> file<00:02:22.250> here<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.730> site

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
need to upload this file here the site

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.720 
need to upload this file here the site
map<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:24.019> root<00:02:24.350> directory<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:25.130> our<00:02:25.280> website
