batteries<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.920> had<00:00:23.670> such<00:00:23.939> energy<00:00:24.180> saving

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
batteries I had such energy saving

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.359 
batteries I had such energy saving
energy<00:00:24.960> saving<00:00:25.560> well<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.769> has<00:00:25.920> built-in

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
energy saving well it has built-in

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.589 
energy saving well it has built-in
batteries<00:00:26.789> but<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.060> doesn't<00:00:27.359> run<00:00:27.480> off

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
batteries but it doesn't run off

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.230 
batteries but it doesn't run off
batteries<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:28.140> runs<00:00:28.349> offer<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:29.160> wind-up<00:00:29.970> arm

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
batteries it runs offer a wind-up arm

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.920 
batteries it runs offer a wind-up arm
care<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.520> for<00:00:32.520> every<00:00:32.790> minutes<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.300> want<00:00:33.540> you

care and for every minutes you want you

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.100 
care and for every minutes you want you
get<00:00:34.170> five<00:00:34.649> minutes<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.190> power<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.870> its<00:00:36.870> really

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
get five minutes of power and its really

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.549 
get five minutes of power and its really
simple<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.680> easy<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:40.050> turn<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
simple really easy and you turn it on

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.400 
simple really easy and you turn it on
you<00:00:41.399> can<00:00:41.610> adjust<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.090> brightness<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.870> very

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
you can adjust the brightness here very

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.940 
you can adjust the brightness here very
cleverly<00:00:43.770> over<00:00:44.489> there<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.850> has<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.329> mirrored

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
cleverly over there it has a mirrored

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.260 
cleverly over there it has a mirrored
surface<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.370> reflects<00:00:47.789> back<00:00:48.059> down

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
surface so that it reflects back down

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500 
surface so that it reflects back down
and<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.710> very<00:00:49.980> mother<00:00:50.370> murdered<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.210> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and this is very mother murdered I so it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.410 
and this is very mother murdered I so it
gives<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.899> much<00:00:52.559> better<00:00:52.770> quality<00:00:53.399> light<00:00:54.230> and

black cards yes initially we didn't have

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.850 
black cards yes initially we didn't have
something<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.900> in<00:01:10.049> South<00:01:10.320> Africa<00:01:10.710> not

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
something like this in South Africa not

inventor he came up with it free play
being<00:01:14.610> idea<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.840> could<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.200> wandered

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
being idea then you could just wandered

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.320 
being idea then you could just wandered
and<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> energy<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.580> he<00:01:17.700> was<00:01:17.820> originally

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and get the energy and he was originally

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.899 
and get the energy and he was originally
backed<00:01:18.570> by<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:19.560> South<00:01:19.860> African<00:01:20.250> investors<00:01:20.759> who
