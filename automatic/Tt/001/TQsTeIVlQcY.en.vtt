00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
as bad as the weather forecasters have

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.450 
as bad as the weather forecasters have
predicted<00:00:21.310> they<00:00:22.090> had<00:00:22.180> gone<00:00:22.329> 4a<00:00:22.570> minus<00:00:22.810> 1<00:00:23.460> but

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
predicted they had gone 4a minus 1 but

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.249 
predicted they had gone 4a minus 1 but
there's<00:00:25.119> not<00:00:25.270> even<00:00:25.329> a<00:00:25.599> frost<00:00:25.840> on<00:00:25.989> the<00:00:26.020> ground

there's not even a frost on the ground

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.729 
there's not even a frost on the ground
so<00:00:26.560> it's<00:00:26.770> a<00:00:27.239> it's<00:00:28.239> just<00:00:28.329> above<00:00:28.689> that<00:00:28.750> although

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
so it's a it's just above that although

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.069 
so it's a it's just above that although
with<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.980> windchill<00:00:30.279> factor<00:00:30.820> it's<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.599> it's

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
with the windchill factor it's a it's

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.470 
with the windchill factor it's a it's
certainly<00:00:32.410> minus<00:00:32.770> 1<00:00:32.980> I<00:00:33.010> can<00:00:33.370> I<00:00:33.820> can<00:00:34.300> say<00:00:34.450> that

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
certainly minus 1 I can I can say that

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.200 
certainly minus 1 I can I can say that
for<00:00:34.660> sure<00:00:34.840> but<00:00:35.770> as<00:00:35.980> they<00:00:36.340> say<00:00:36.370> you've<00:00:36.969> got<00:00:37.120> to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
for sure but as they say you've got to

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.389 
for sure but as they say you've got to
be<00:00:37.300> in<00:00:37.420> it<00:00:37.510> to<00:00:37.750> win<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.350> let's<00:00:39.129> see<00:00:39.309> how<00:00:39.340> it

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
be in it to win it so let's see how it

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.630 
be in it to win it so let's see how it
goes<00:00:43.050> session<00:00:44.050> 2<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.499> I'm<00:00:44.620> back<00:00:45.039> on<00:00:45.070> the<00:00:45.280> canal

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
goes session 2 and I'm back on the canal

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.750 
goes session 2 and I'm back on the canal
and<00:00:45.879> the<00:00:46.649> reason<00:00:47.649> that<00:00:47.679> I'm<00:00:47.890> back<00:00:48.070> 24<00:00:48.579> hours

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.899 
and the reason that I'm back 24 hours

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
later is that yesterday I lost a very

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.290 
later is that yesterday I lost a very
good<00:00:52.210> perch<00:00:52.480> on<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:52.899> live<00:00:53.710> bait<00:00:53.949> rod<00:00:54.159> it<00:00:55.149> was<00:00:55.239> a

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
good perch on the live bait rod it was a

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.779 
good perch on the live bait rod it was a
cold<00:00:55.539> day<00:00:55.839> and<00:00:56.079> today<00:00:56.920> isn't<00:00:57.309> much<00:00:57.609> better

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
cold day and today isn't much better

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.020 
cold day and today isn't much better
although<00:00:58.120> it's<00:00:58.359> marginally<00:00:59.050> improved<00:01:00.030> but

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
although it's marginally improved but

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.090 
although it's marginally improved but
that<00:01:01.780> fish<00:01:02.339> just<00:01:03.339> really<00:01:03.789> got<00:01:04.360> me<00:01:04.479> going<00:01:04.510> and
