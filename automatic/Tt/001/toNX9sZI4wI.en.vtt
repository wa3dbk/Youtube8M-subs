00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
with the iphone 4s because the camera is

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.430 
with the iphone 4s because the camera is
so<00:02:02.390> good<00:02:02.600> now<00:02:02.720> they<00:02:02.840> can<00:02:02.990> actually<00:02:03.260> do<00:02:03.410> that

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
so good now they can actually do that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.880 
so good now they can actually do that
which<00:02:04.310> is<00:02:04.340> pretty<00:02:04.880> dang<00:02:05.180> impressive<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.140> maybe

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
about well I'm going to probably do a

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.160 
about well I'm going to probably do a
video<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.880> the<00:02:17.000> verge<00:02:17.210> just<00:02:17.570> like<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.930> launch

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
video of the verge just like the launch

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.290 
video of the verge just like the launch
like<00:02:19.130> how<00:02:19.520> would<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.700> think<00:02:19.880> of<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.030> site<00:02:20.180> that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
like how would I think of the site that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.760 
like how would I think of the site that
I'm<00:02:20.390> also<00:02:20.510> going<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.810> like<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.960> timeline<00:02:21.590> of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
I'm also going to be like a timeline of

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.100 
I'm also going to be like a timeline of
you<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:22.850> people<00:02:23.120> leaving<00:02:23.270> in<00:02:23.450> gadget<00:02:23.930> and

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
you know people leaving in gadget and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.690 
you know people leaving in gadget and
then<00:02:24.230> people<00:02:24.530> going<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:24.860> is<00:02:24.980> my<00:02:25.100> next<00:02:25.370> and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
then people going to this is my next and

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.120 
then people going to this is my next and
then<00:02:25.760> more<00:02:25.940> people<00:02:26.090> joining<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.130> that's

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
then more people joining and that's

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.290 
then more people joining and that's
going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.430> more<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.670> long-term<00:02:28.880> project

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
going to be more of a long-term project

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.229 
going to be more of a long-term project
doing<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.810> whole<00:02:29.959> timeline<00:02:30.280> but<00:02:31.280> maybe<00:02:32.060> I'll

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
doing the whole timeline but maybe I'll

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.460 
doing the whole timeline but maybe I'll
