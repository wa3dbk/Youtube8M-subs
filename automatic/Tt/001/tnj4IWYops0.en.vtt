00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
of wire okay so this and at first I

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.140 
of wire okay so this and at first I
thought<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.740> looked<00:02:00.130> like<00:02:00.250> gum<00:02:00.670> but<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:00.970> not

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
gone let me just eat that it breaks down

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.880
