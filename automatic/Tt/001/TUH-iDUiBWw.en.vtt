00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.330
 as a person too 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.430
 it's like you imagined you saw there was 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.650
 a lot of people in the presentation 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.420
 it generates a lot of repercussion all that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.420
 it has to do with the club yes they have 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.330

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.080

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.590
 possibility of coming not but what you 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.450

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.090
 I looked at this showed that they are that are 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.030
 now and good if I imagined a little 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.050
 this not so much but if I imagined it 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.340
 remember particularly from a player 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.810
 of river that is what you have called the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 Attention when you were when I was a boy 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.600
 same saviola I loved how he played 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.740
 quick made goals 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.240
 to tell of you we know that those 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.910
 Uruguayans come and play in Turkey 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.410
 a bit of a summary of what's on your 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.799
 life for the fans to know you a 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.600
 little bit better in defender start 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.600
 of last 17 years 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.660
 I went to Italy I was in Milan 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.480
 year I went back to defender again I went to 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.340
 Mexico I was in the necaxa after 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.069
 I went back to national national cools 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.190
 turkey I had three years there and he turned me 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.599
 the first experience in Argentina 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.580
 Knowing a little good air your 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.620
 first experience I came to play 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.049
 some liberators that another but little 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.120
 and good of the soccer that I can say to you is 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:43.060
 a football totally different from the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.190
 others that a lot of force is very dynamic 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.110
 very current and good as I told you 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.060
 before you have to try to adapt to your 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.610
 I imagine that they are going to invite you to eat 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.700
 A little asshole has not yet appeared 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.959
 nobody that invited me but hopefully 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.849

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.099

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.150

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.950
 they made me feel one more at once in 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.420
 what you see outside there is 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.420

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.180
