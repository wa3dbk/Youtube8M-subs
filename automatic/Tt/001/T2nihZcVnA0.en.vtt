00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
same kind of version there as well so I

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.060 
same kind of version there as well so I
mean<00:03:26.000> even<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.750> sunís<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.440> little<00:03:27.650> bit<00:03:27.740> older

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
mean even the sunís a little bit older

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.890 
mean even the sunís a little bit older
devices<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.700> mean<00:03:28.850> there's<00:03:29.030> not<00:03:29.209> real<00:03:29.630> like<00:03:29.870> a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
devices I mean there's not real like a

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.440 
devices I mean there's not real like a
big<00:03:30.140> difference<00:03:30.530> so<00:03:31.430> if<00:03:31.550> I<00:03:31.670> see<00:03:31.880> five<00:03:32.180> that

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
big difference so if I see five that

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.150 
big difference so if I see five that
room<00:03:32.720> in<00:03:32.810> common<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.350> think<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:33.680> like<00:03:33.830> September

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
room in common I think in like September

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.199 
room in common I think in like September
or<00:03:35.060> October<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:36.739> hopefully<00:03:37.489> will<00:03:37.700> be<00:03:37.730> some

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
or October that hopefully will be some

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.800 
or October that hopefully will be some
interesting<00:03:38.930> updates<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:40.730> can<00:03:40.940> see<00:03:41.330> here<00:03:41.600> how

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
interesting updates you can see here how

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
interesting updates you can see here how
the<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:42.709> like<00:03:43.580> how<00:03:43.820> these<00:03:44.000> III<00:03:44.570> pass<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.140> thinner

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
the I like how these III pass is thinner

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.850 
the I like how these III pass is thinner
and<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.910> doesn't<00:03:47.209> have<00:03:47.330> that<00:03:47.360> weird<00:03:47.930> docking

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
and it doesn't have that weird docking

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.330 
and it doesn't have that weird docking
