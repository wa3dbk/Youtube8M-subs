00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
making this movie for nothing which we

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.590 
making this movie for nothing which we
did<00:04:08.709> all<00:04:09.190> these<00:04:09.400> people<00:04:09.459> on<00:04:09.880> this<00:04:10.030> stage<00:04:10.300> and<00:04:10.570> I

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
did all these people on this stage and I

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.940 
did all these people on this stage and I
think<00:04:10.810> it's<00:04:10.900> really<00:04:11.080> important<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.470> notice<00:04:11.800> is

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
think it's really important to notice is

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.220 
think it's really important to notice is
note<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.490> all<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.209> other<00:04:13.360> panels<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:14.140> are

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
note that all the other panels that are

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.320 
note that all the other panels that are
in<00:04:14.380> here<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.800> think<00:04:15.190> every<00:04:15.610> single<00:04:15.790> one<00:04:16.030> is<00:04:16.180> on
