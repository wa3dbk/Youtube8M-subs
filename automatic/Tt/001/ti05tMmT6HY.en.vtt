00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
down to this little band right here you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.960 
down to this little band right here you
want<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.349> make<00:02:31.530> sure<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.099> one<00:02:32.400> piece<00:02:32.700> is

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
want to make sure that this one piece is

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.039 
want to make sure that this one piece is
all<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.540> way<00:02:33.659> down<00:02:33.900> as<00:02:34.110> far<00:02:34.470> as<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.010> go

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
all the way down as far as it can go

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:39.770 
all the way down as far as it can go
good<00:02:37.049> all<00:02:37.860> right<00:02:37.920> now<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:39.090> take<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.540> piece

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
good all right now you take the piece

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.530 
good all right now you take the piece
that<00:02:40.079> does<00:02:40.470> not<00:02:40.829> have<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.489> controller<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
that does not have the controller on it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.360 
that does not have the controller on it
so<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.049> see<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.409> are<00:02:43.440> two<00:02:43.560> sides<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.250> this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
so you see there are two sides to this

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.119 
so you see there are two sides to this
one<00:02:44.760> has<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.269> little<00:02:45.420> Apple<00:02:45.840> controller<00:02:46.260> with

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
one has the little Apple controller with

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.160 
one has the little Apple controller with
your<00:02:47.280> volume<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.819> your<00:02:47.879> mic<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:49.019> other

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
your volume and your mic and the other

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.599 
your volume and your mic and the other
one<00:02:49.379> does<00:02:49.530> not<00:02:49.560> you're<00:02:49.980> going<00:02:50.069> to<00:02:50.129> take<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
one does not you're going to take the

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.210 
one does not you're going to take the
side<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.030> does<00:02:51.239> not<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:52.010> you're<00:02:53.010> going<00:02:53.160> to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
side that does not and you're going to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.990 
side that does not and you're going to
wrap<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.760> around<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:56.000> pull

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
wrap it around just like that and pull

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.839 
wrap it around just like that and pull
it<00:02:57.150> right<00:02:57.390> down<00:02:57.450> through<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> middle<00:02:58.849> just

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
it right down through the middle just

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.539 
it right down through the middle just
like<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.329> on<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:01.739> other<00:03:01.890> side<00:03:02.190> you're<00:03:02.430> going

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
like that on the other side you're going

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.890 
like that on the other side you're going
to<00:03:02.609> do<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.819> same<00:03:03.060> thing<00:03:03.409> pull<00:03:04.409> it<00:03:04.560> up<00:03:04.709> and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
to do the same thing pull it up and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.099 
to do the same thing pull it up and
around<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:08.069> time<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.879> take<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.900> little

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
around and this time you take the little

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.309 
around and this time you take the little
volume<00:03:10.470> piece<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.849> slot<00:03:12.299> that<00:03:12.659> right

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
volume piece and you slot that right

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.589 
volume piece and you slot that right
over<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.980> center<00:03:14.280> piece<00:03:14.549> above<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.239> cable

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
over the center piece above the cable

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.659 
over the center piece above the cable
that<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:16.079> had<00:03:16.349> now<00:03:17.069> if<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.400> look<00:03:17.639> here

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
that you just had now if you look here

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.800 
that you just had now if you look here
you<00:03:18.569> see<00:03:18.599> that<00:03:19.019> what<00:03:19.200> you<00:03:19.230> have<00:03:19.349> is<00:03:20.269> a<00:03:21.269> nice

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
you see that what you have is a nice

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.009 
you see that what you have is a nice
even<00:03:22.739> cable<00:03:23.040> all<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.660> way<00:03:24.660> down<00:03:26.030> okay<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.450> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
even cable all the way down okay if you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.869 
even cable all the way down okay if you
didn't<00:03:28.410> do<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.680> exactly<00:03:28.799> like<00:03:29.400> that

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
didn't do it exactly like that

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.580 
didn't do it exactly like that
when<00:03:30.329> it<00:03:30.419> comes<00:03:30.660> down<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.900> this<00:03:31.139> little<00:03:31.379> bump

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
when it comes down to this little bump

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.500 
when it comes down to this little bump
right<00:03:31.859> here<00:03:31.919> it's<00:03:32.340> not<00:03:32.549> going<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.849> be<00:03:32.940> even<00:03:33.150> and

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
right here it's not going to be even and

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.509 
right here it's not going to be even and
it's<00:03:33.629> going<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> be<00:03:33.959> almost<00:03:34.109> impossible<00:03:34.980> to

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
it's going to be almost impossible to

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.159 
it's going to be almost impossible to
wrap<00:03:35.730> up<00:03:35.940> in<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.239> thing<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.599> if<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.750> did<00:03:37.049> it

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
wrap up in this thing but if you did it

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.530 
wrap up in this thing but if you did it
exactly<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.919> way<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.069> just<00:03:38.190> showed<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.609> then

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
exactly the way I just showed you then

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.839 
exactly the way I just showed you then
you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.870> take<00:03:40.079> it<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.310> really<00:03:41.549> either

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
you can take it and and really either

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.280 
you can take it and and really either
way<00:03:42.120> you<00:03:42.329> can<00:03:42.480> go<00:03:42.599> right<00:03:42.810> or<00:03:42.840> left

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
way you can go right or left

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.809 
way you can go right or left
but<00:03:43.739> you're<00:03:43.889> just<00:03:44.040> going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.250> take<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:44.489> and

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
but you're just going to take it and

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:55.320 
but you're just going to take it and
very<00:03:45.449> easily<00:03:47.150> go<00:03:48.150> around<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> ear<00:03:48.840> potholder

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.320
