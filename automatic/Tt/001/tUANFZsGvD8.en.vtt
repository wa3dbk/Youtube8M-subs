00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
take out more defenses as well so once

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.770

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.399 
daughter daughter down he's gonna send
some<00:01:46.049> hogs<00:01:46.310> shoot<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:47.460> her<00:01:47.610> defense<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.409> he

some hogs shoot at her defense and he

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.200 
some hogs shoot at her defense and he
miscalculated<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.939> bit<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
miscalculated a bit on this one and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.429 
miscalculated a bit on this one and
probably<00:01:54.210> didn't<00:01:54.479> notice<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439

went<00:01:57.540> over<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.229> he<00:01:58.619> had<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> bit<00:01:59.040> of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
went over here so he had a bit of

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.850

horrible bad bad design I don't know why

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.490 
horrible bad bad design I don't know why
so<00:02:26.459> many<00:02:26.520> people<00:02:26.730> are<00:02:27.060> using<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:27.959> have

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
of course with a jump spell and the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.900 
of course with a jump spell and the
whole<00:02:39.690> idea<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.050> using<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.770> logo<00:02:41.280> wipe<00:02:41.520> although

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
whole idea of using a logo wipe although

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.720 
whole idea of using a logo wipe although
or<00:02:42.120> logo<00:02:42.810> will<00:02:42.989> wipe<00:02:43.230> attack<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.950> because<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
or logo will wipe attack is because the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.449 
or logo will wipe attack is because the
air<00:02:44.790> defenses<00:02:45.330> are<00:02:45.360> basically<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.220> core

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
air defenses are basically in the core

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.270 
air defenses are basically in the core
to<00:02:47.750> first<00:02:48.750> air<00:02:48.870> defenses<00:02:49.440> are<00:02:49.590> gonna<00:02:49.830> go<00:02:50.070> down

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
to first air defenses are gonna go down

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.560 
to first air defenses are gonna go down
very<00:02:50.760> easily<00:02:51.090> by<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.510> heavy<00:02:51.780> troops<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.440> once

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
very easily by the heavy troops and once

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.060 
very easily by the heavy troops and once
your<00:02:54.570> troops<00:02:54.870> are<00:02:55.080> in<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.290> Corps<00:02:55.530> they're

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
your troops are in the Corps they're

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.100 
your troops are in the Corps they're
gonna<00:02:56.220> take<00:02:56.459> out<00:02:56.670> those<00:02:57.269> our<00:02:57.450> defenses<00:02:57.959> as

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
gonna take out those our defenses as

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.009 
gonna take out those our defenses as
well<00:02:58.140> as<00:02:58.620> well<00:02:59.070> so<00:02:59.670> basically<00:03:00.030> they're<00:03:00.660> few

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
well as well so basically they're few

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.259 
well as well so basically they're few
ways<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.230> take<00:03:01.560> them<00:03:01.739> out<00:03:01.860> with<00:03:02.400> wizards<00:03:02.850> with

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
ways to take them out with wizards with

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.280 
ways to take them out with wizards with
the<00:03:03.390> queen<00:03:03.660> or<00:03:05.480> even<00:03:06.480> with<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.810> pack<00:03:06.989> guy<00:03:07.170> in

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
the queen or even with the pack guy in

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.840 
the queen or even with the pack guy in
the<00:03:07.380> golems<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:08.220> are<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.610> break

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
the golems that are going to break

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.479 
the golems that are going to break
through<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.989> walls<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.470> once<00:03:11.010> doors<00:03:11.280> are

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
through the walls and once doors are

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.180 
through the walls and once doors are
down<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:12.090> gotta<00:03:12.300> watch<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.720> timing<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.260> once

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
down you gotta watch the timing and once

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.530 
down you gotta watch the timing and once
any<00:03:14.580> section<00:03:15.300> out<00:03:15.630> of<00:03:16.370> those<00:03:17.370> trees<00:03:17.880> that<00:03:18.299> are

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
any section out of those trees that are

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.050 
any section out of those trees that are
left

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
left

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.680 
left
once<00:03:21.060> it's<00:03:21.440> undefended<00:03:22.440> by<00:03:23.130> any<00:03:23.430> defense<00:03:24.060> so

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
once it's undefended by any defense so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.990 
once it's undefended by any defense so
for<00:03:25.019> example<00:03:25.380> if<00:03:25.470> those<00:03:25.680> two<00:03:25.920> are<00:03:26.040> out<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.489> can

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
for example if those two are out you can

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.270 
for example if those two are out you can
start<00:03:27.420> sending<00:03:27.630> balloons<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:29.100> those

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
start sending balloons and those

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.390 
start sending balloons and those
defenses<00:03:29.820> so<00:03:30.150> not<00:03:31.079> much<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.470> say<00:03:31.650> over<00:03:32.190> here

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
defenses so not much you say over here

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:39.440 
defenses so not much you say over here
we<00:03:33.299> can<00:03:33.480> see<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.780> attack<00:03:33.989> now<00:03:38.090> so<00:03:39.090> as<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.299> can

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
we can see the attack now so as you can

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.800 
we can see the attack now so as you can
see<00:03:39.660> two<00:03:40.140> balloons<00:03:40.470> are<00:03:40.799> shielding<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:42.570> those

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
see two balloons are shielding for those

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.150 
see two balloons are shielding for those
other<00:03:43.049> balloons<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:46.170> able<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.650> take<00:03:46.950> out

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
other balloons and is able to take out

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.370 
other balloons and is able to take out
those<00:03:47.549> three<00:03:47.880> defenses<00:03:48.420> with<00:03:48.780> four<00:03:49.110> balloons

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
those three defenses with four balloons

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.789 
those three defenses with four balloons
only<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.010> now<00:03:50.220> he's<00:03:50.400> sending<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.940> hogs<00:03:51.150> a<00:03:51.799> bit

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
only so now he's sending the hogs a bit

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.729 
only so now he's sending the hogs a bit
of<00:03:53.070> miscalculation<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.530> that's<00:03:55.530> why<00:03:55.709> I

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
of miscalculation and that's why I

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.620 
of miscalculation and that's why I
didn't<00:03:56.100> lure<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.549> whole<00:03:56.730> clan<00:03:57.000> castle<00:03:57.450> but

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
didn't lure the whole clan castle but

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.949 
didn't lure the whole clan castle but
it's<00:03:58.230> better<00:03:58.680> than<00:03:58.980> nothing<00:03:59.370> if<00:03:59.489> you<00:03:59.700> if<00:04:00.690> you

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
it's better than nothing if you if you

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.850 
it's better than nothing if you if you
did<00:04:01.170> lure<00:04:01.410> let's<00:04:02.400> say<00:04:03.200> 10<00:04:04.200> of<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.470> archers

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
did lure let's say 10 of the archers

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.250 
did lure let's say 10 of the archers
from<00:04:05.250> 25<00:04:05.850> it's<00:04:06.120> good<00:04:06.390> enough<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.579> he<00:04:08.579> actually

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
from 25 it's good enough and he actually

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.289 
from 25 it's good enough and he actually
lured<00:04:10.260> even<00:04:10.530> more<00:04:10.769> than<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.100> one<00:04:11.730> Wizards<00:04:12.150> is

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
lured even more than that one Wizards is

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.470 
lured even more than that one Wizards is
out<00:04:12.480> whoa<00:04:12.870> but<00:04:13.290> that's<00:04:13.530> definitely<00:04:13.829> not<00:04:14.480> the

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
out whoa but that's definitely not the

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.590 
out whoa but that's definitely not the
whole<00:04:15.630> clan<00:04:15.959> castle<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.880> he's<00:04:18.180> gonna<00:04:18.359> gather

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
whole clan castle so he's gonna gather

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.810 
whole clan castle so he's gonna gather
them<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.049> take<00:04:19.169> them<00:04:19.350> out<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.829> then<00:04:20.549> he<00:04:20.640> can

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
them and take them out and then he can

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.770 
them and take them out and then he can
start<00:04:21.060> the

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
start the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.870 
start the
in<00:04:21.840> attack<00:04:22.170> so<00:04:22.560> he's<00:04:22.710> using<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.160> minion<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.700> the

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
in attack so he's using a minion in the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.550 
in attack so he's using a minion in the
bottom<00:04:24.150> because<00:04:24.420> the<00:04:24.840> arch<00:04:24.990> towers<00:04:25.350> are

bottom because the arch towers are

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.460 
bottom because the arch towers are
pretty<00:04:26.100> far<00:04:26.400> from<00:04:26.610> that<00:04:26.820> area<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:28.080> can<00:04:28.260> use<00:04:28.440> a

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
pretty far from that area you can use a

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.610 
pretty far from that area you can use a
minion<00:04:29.270> which<00:04:30.270> will<00:04:30.540> gather<00:04:30.810> those<00:04:31.260> corn

and it's going down very easy easily by

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.560 
and it's going down very easy easily by
that<00:05:52.380> backhand<00:05:52.860> golems<00:05:53.280> and<00:05:53.960> now<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.020> base<00:05:55.350> is
