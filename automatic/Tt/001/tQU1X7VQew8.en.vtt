00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
try to keep in mind that there's two

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.560 
try to keep in mind that there's two
crew<00:01:08.400> members<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.850> game<00:01:09.090> there's<00:01:09.450> two

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
crew members in this game there's two

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
crew members in this game there's two
armored<00:01:09.900> Karuma<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.500> there's<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> one

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
armored Karuma and then there's the one

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
armored Karuma and then there's the one
that<00:01:11.100> has<00:01:11.280> no<00:01:11.490> armor<00:01:11.880> when<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.840> down

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that has no armor when they get down

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.450 
that has no armor when they get down
armored<00:01:13.320> one<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.920> think<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.280> both

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
armored one because I think they both

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100 
armored one because I think they both
have<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.790> same<00:01:14.970> top<00:01:15.150> speed<00:01:15.180> anyways<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
have the same top speed anyways so the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620 
have the same top speed anyways so the
one<00:01:16.229> -<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.619> armor<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.979> gone<00:01:17.159> faster<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:18.299> if

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
one - my armor is gone faster also if

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.270 
one - my armor is gone faster also if
you<00:01:18.750> upgrade<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.170> armor<00:01:19.500> Karuma<00:01:19.920> it'll<00:01:20.159> go

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
you upgrade the armor Karuma it'll go

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.039 
you upgrade the armor Karuma it'll go
extremely<00:01:20.700> fascinating<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.360> trust<00:01:21.689> me<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
extremely fascinating I trust me it's a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.690
