we do know this the longest trail ever
measured<00:04:03.530> was<00:04:03.800> almost<00:04:04.390> 3,000<00:04:05.390> feet<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:06.290> rocks

move<00:04:07.190> at<00:04:07.340> about<00:04:07.430> 6<00:04:08.150> miles<00:04:08.450> an<00:04:08.780> hour<00:04:08.959> and

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
move at about 6 miles an hour and

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.710 
move at about 6 miles an hour and
there's<00:04:09.950> one<00:04:10.190> more<00:04:10.400> thing<00:04:10.700> we<00:04:10.910> know<00:04:11.090> it's<00:04:11.510> one

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.520 
of those unique places the rocks
definitely<00:04:14.090> make<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.690> was<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.840> really<00:04:14.989> simple

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530
