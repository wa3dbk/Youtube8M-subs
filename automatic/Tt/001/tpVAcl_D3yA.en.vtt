really<00:00:23.300> feel<00:00:23.630> comfortable<00:00:23.660> doing<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:24.849> so<00:00:25.849> I

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
really feel comfortable doing this so I

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.249 
really feel comfortable doing this so I
just<00:00:26.990> took<00:00:27.470> the<00:00:27.529> initiative<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:28.840> I<00:00:29.840> started

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
just took the initiative and I started

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.010 
just took the initiative and I started
out<00:00:30.410> with<00:00:30.650> it<00:00:31.189> completely<00:00:31.939> rusted<00:00:32.420> out<00:00:32.570> the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
out with it completely rusted out the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.490 
out with it completely rusted out the
floor<00:00:35.740> and<00:00:36.740> I<00:00:37.310> went<00:00:37.490> underneath<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.500> I

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
floor and I went underneath and I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.740 
floor and I went underneath and I
located<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.340> cross<00:00:40.610> braces<00:00:41.270> there's<00:00:41.510> one

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
located the cross braces there's one

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.250 
located the cross braces there's one
that<00:00:41.930> goes<00:00:41.990> under<00:00:42.530> here<00:00:42.970> and<00:00:43.970> then<00:00:44.260> there's

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
that goes under here and then there's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.040 
that goes under here and then there's
one<00:00:45.470> that<00:00:45.500> comes<00:00:45.920> back<00:00:46.250> under<00:00:46.700> here<00:00:47.050> the

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
one that comes back under here the

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.410 
one that comes back under here the
difference<00:00:48.440> between<00:00:48.890> these<00:00:49.040> two<00:00:49.370> this<00:00:49.780> one

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
it at the transmission tunnel and put

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.390 
it at the transmission tunnel and put
the<00:01:12.710> new<00:01:12.830> one<00:01:13.040> in

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
the new one in

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.570 
the new one in
but<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.420> reproduction<00:01:15.170> pans<00:01:15.590> do<00:01:16.100> not<00:01:16.280> have

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
but the reproduction pans do not have

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.410 
but the reproduction pans do not have
the<00:01:17.330> same<00:01:17.600> exact<00:01:18.110> lip<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:18.980> runs<00:01:19.250> down<00:01:19.520> the

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
the same exact lip that runs down the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.540 
the same exact lip that runs down the
side<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.720> this<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.830> you're<00:01:21.980> not<00:01:22.160> going<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.430> get

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
side of this so you're not going to get

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.960 
side of this so you're not going to get
that<00:01:22.790> factory<00:01:23.330> look<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:24.460> went<00:01:25.460> ahead<00:01:25.610> on

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
that factory look I went ahead on

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.170 
that factory look I went ahead on

entire pan on this side I set this pan
in<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.440> it<00:01:39.830> fits<00:01:40.040> very<00:01:40.370> well<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.900> way<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.050> fit

in and it fits very well the way I fit
it<00:01:42.590> was<00:01:42.800> I<00:01:43.570> realized<00:01:44.570> I<00:01:44.750> did<00:01:44.960> not<00:01:44.990> want<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.470> cut

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
it was I realized I did not want to cut

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.010 
it was I realized I did not want to cut
past<00:01:46.970> this<00:01:47.800> divot<00:01:48.800> right<00:01:48.979> here<00:01:49.190> this<00:01:49.370> dimple

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
past this divot right here this dimple

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.770 
past this divot right here this dimple
there's<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.140> brace<00:01:51.500> under<00:01:51.890> here<00:01:52.240> so<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.300> stopped

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
there's a brace under here so I stopped

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.710 
there's a brace under here so I stopped
here<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.409> then<00:01:54.800> I<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.070> went<00:01:55.250> around<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:56.000> cut

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
the majority of the pan out the old pan

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.960 
the majority of the pan out the old pan
comes<00:02:00.080> down<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.590> about<00:02:00.799> here<00:02:01.220> that's<00:02:01.580> how<00:02:01.850> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
comes down to about here that's how it

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.870 
comes down to about here that's how it
is<00:02:02.090> right<00:02:02.330> now<00:02:02.510> I<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:03.440> cut<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> bottoms<00:02:04.310> out

half<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:22.080> side<00:02:22.470> here<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.210> pan<00:02:24.390> drops<00:02:24.720> down

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
half the side here so the pan drops down

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.930 
half the side here so the pan drops down
this<00:02:25.710> side<00:02:26.010> because<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.460> goes<00:02:26.610> from<00:02:26.640> rocker

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
this side because it goes from rocker

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.890 
this side because it goes from rocker
rocker<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.660> did<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.890> mess<00:02:29.190> with<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.900> so

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
rocker I did not want to mess with it so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.720 
rocker I did not want to mess with it so
I<00:02:30.930> left<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:31.710> notched<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.310> pan<00:02:32.520> out

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
I left it and just notched the pan out

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.530 
I left it and just notched the pan out
around<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:34.640> what<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> did<00:02:35.910> was<00:02:36.060> when<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.240> laid<00:02:36.510> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
around it what I did was when I laid the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.500 
around it what I did was when I laid the
pan<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.380> lined<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:39.600> seam<00:02:40.350> up<00:02:40.560> here<00:02:41.510> would

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
pan and I lined this seam up here would

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.910 
pan and I lined this seam up here would
be<00:02:42.660> old<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.400> one's<00:02:44.790> perfect

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
be old so that one's perfect

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
be old so that one's perfect
that<00:02:46.920> gave<00:02:47.220> me<00:02:47.250> where<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.790> pan<00:02:48.030> needed<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> go

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
that gave me where the pan needed to go

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.400 
that gave me where the pan needed to go
this<00:02:48.840> way<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.490> pulled<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.240> pan<00:02:51.510> up<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
this way then I pulled the pan up to the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.980 
this way then I pulled the pan up to the
rocker<00:02:52.950> as<00:02:53.250> much<00:02:53.490> as<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.820> could<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.660> it's

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
rocker as much as I could so that it's

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.350 
rocker as much as I could so that it's
nice<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.470> tight<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.760> used<00:02:57.000> pliers

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
nice and tight and I used pliers

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.949 
nice and tight and I used pliers
underneath<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.200> hold<00:02:58.470> them<00:02:58.830> together<00:02:59.959> so

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
underneath to hold them together so

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.060 
underneath to hold them together so
that's<00:03:01.170> why<00:03:01.880> it's<00:03:03.260> butted<00:03:04.260> up<00:03:04.350> as<00:03:04.590> tight<00:03:04.800> as<00:03:04.950> it

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
that's why it's butted up as tight as it

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.010 
that's why it's butted up as tight as it
is<00:03:05.220> otherwise<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.209> pan<00:03:06.420> really<00:03:06.660> does<00:03:06.900> not

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
is otherwise this pan really does not

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.510 
is otherwise this pan really does not
want<00:03:07.230> to<00:03:07.350> fit<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:07.709> there<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.459> snugly<00:03:10.310> once<00:03:11.310> I

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
want to fit in there that snugly once I

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.340 
want to fit in there that snugly once I
had<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.790> set<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.480> knew<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.900> had<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
had that set and knew that I had it

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.650 
had that set and knew that I had it
where<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.650> needed<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.010> be<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.580> went<00:03:15.360> ahead<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
where it needed to be I went ahead and

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.610 
where it needed to be I went ahead and
started<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:17.160> this<00:03:18.000> end<00:03:18.269> because<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.080> have<00:03:19.380> vise

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
started at this end because I have vise

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.750 
started at this end because I have vise
grips<00:03:19.980> on<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.550> holding<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.000> together

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
grips on this and holding it together

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.960 
grips on this and holding it together
see<00:03:23.760> there<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.810> vise<00:03:25.050> grips<00:03:25.380> are<00:03:25.700> there's<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
see there the vise grips are there's the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.280 
see there the vise grips are there's the
crossmember<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.050> can<00:03:28.230> see<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:30.080> used<00:03:31.080> a

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
crossmember and you can see I used a

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.120 
crossmember and you can see I used a
black<00:03:31.680> marker<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:33.030> marked<00:03:33.830> where<00:03:34.830> these

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
black marker and I marked where these

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.540 
black marker and I marked where these
cross<00:03:35.400> members<00:03:35.430> go<00:03:36.620> then<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.769> drilled<00:03:38.190> holes

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
cross members go then I drilled holes

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.960 
cross members go then I drilled holes
this<00:03:38.970> going<00:03:39.480> up<00:03:39.600> from<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> bottom<00:03:40.970> because

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
this going up from the bottom because

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.580 
this going up from the bottom because
that<00:03:42.480> way<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.780> left<00:03:42.959> all<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.290> nasty<00:03:44.510> metal

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
that way it left all the nasty metal

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.140 
that way it left all the nasty metal
sticking<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.070> state<00:03:47.430> smooth<00:03:47.790> on<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
sticking up in a state smooth on the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.300 
sticking up in a state smooth on the
bottom<00:03:48.450> then<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.440> used<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.800> grinder<00:03:50.220> and

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
bottom then I just used a grinder and

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.979 
bottom then I just used a grinder and
got<00:03:50.489> rid<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.930> burst<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:53.360> set<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.510> pan<00:03:54.750> back

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
got rid of the burst I set the pan back

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.550 
got rid of the burst I set the pan back
inside<00:03:55.670> by<00:03:56.670> scripted<00:03:57.239> together<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:58.470> I

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
inside by scripted together and I

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.890 
inside by scripted together and I
started<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.070> this<00:03:59.280> side<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.760> I<00:04:00.300> went<00:04:00.690> straight

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
started on this side and I went straight

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.470 
started on this side and I went straight
into<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.530> crossmember<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.430> what<00:04:03.000> it<00:04:03.120> does<00:04:03.300> is

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
into the crossmember and what it does is

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.380 
into the crossmember and what it does is
it<00:04:03.630> pulls<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.200> pan<00:04:04.440> straight<00:04:04.890> down<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.730> made

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
it pulls the pan straight down it made

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.449 
it pulls the pan straight down it made
its<00:04:06.600> fit<00:04:06.930> snugly<00:04:07.800> up<00:04:07.950> against<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
its fit snugly up against the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.090 
its fit snugly up against the
crossmember<00:04:09.090> then<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.930> kept<00:04:10.470> screwing<00:04:10.830> it<00:04:10.980> all

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
crossmember then I kept screwing it all

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.690 
crossmember then I kept screwing it all
the<00:04:11.220> way<00:04:11.310> down<00:04:11.519> now<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:13.680> know<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.220> pan<00:04:14.519> is

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
the way down now I know this pan is

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.140 
the way down now I know this pan is
located<00:04:15.330> exactly<00:04:15.959> where<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.260> needs<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.709> be

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
located exactly where it needs to be

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.240 
located exactly where it needs to be
my<00:04:18.150> next<00:04:18.510> step<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.960> am<00:04:19.170> going<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.800> go<00:04:19.950> underneath

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
my next step I am going to go underneath

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.030 
my next step I am going to go underneath
the<00:04:20.610> car<00:04:20.960> and<00:04:23.240> where<00:04:24.240> I<00:04:24.270> cut<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.040> transmission

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
the car and where I cut the transmission

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.220 
the car and where I cut the transmission
tunnel<00:04:26.190> I'm<00:04:26.730> gonna<00:04:26.940> draw<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> line<00:04:27.720> underneath

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
tunnel I'm gonna draw a line underneath

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.750 
tunnel I'm gonna draw a line underneath
that<00:04:29.030> all<00:04:30.030> the<00:04:30.360> way<00:04:30.450> around<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.590> then<00:04:32.430> I'm

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
that all the way around and then I'm

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.880 
that all the way around and then I'm
gonna<00:04:33.270> pull<00:04:33.570> this<00:04:33.780> all<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.230> screws<00:04:34.470> up<00:04:34.650> hold

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
gonna pull this all the screws up hold

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.280 
gonna pull this all the screws up hold
this<00:04:35.040> pan<00:04:35.310> out<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:36.390> I'm<00:04:36.480> actually<00:04:36.690> gonna<00:04:36.930> trim

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
this pan out and I'm actually gonna trim

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.100 
this pan out and I'm actually gonna trim
this<00:04:37.530> new<00:04:37.770> pan<00:04:38.100> down<00:04:38.520> I'm<00:04:39.390> gonna<00:04:39.630> leave<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:40.020> a
