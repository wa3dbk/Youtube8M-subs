it<00:00:17.789> up<00:00:18.000> into<00:00:18.150> phases<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.529> completed

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
it up into phases we just completed

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.740 
it up into phases we just completed
phase<00:00:20.070> one<00:00:20.130> last<00:00:20.609> week<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.150> there's<00:00:21.630> probably

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
phase one last week and there's probably

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.720 
phase one last week and there's probably
be<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.380> know<00:00:22.470> maybe<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.740> week<00:00:23.220> or<00:00:23.340> two<00:00:23.490> gap

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
be you know maybe a week or two gap

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.759 
be you know maybe a week or two gap
maybe<00:00:24.180> three<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:24.840> depends<00:00:25.199> because

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
maybe three I don't know depends because

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.019 
maybe three I don't know depends because
we'll<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.730> our<00:00:26.820> schedules

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
we'll have if we can get our schedules

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.779 
we'll have if we can get our schedules
ranged<00:00:28.099> but<00:00:29.099> yeah<00:00:29.279> there'll<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.580> little<00:00:29.699> bit

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
ranged but yeah there'll be a little bit

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.279 
ranged but yeah there'll be a little bit
of<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> gap<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.359> then<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.510> do<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.750> second<00:00:31.080> phase

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
of a gap and then we do the second phase

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.470 
of a gap and then we do the second phase
which<00:00:32.130> we'll<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> lot<00:00:32.790> we'll<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> lot

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
which we'll get a lot we'll get a lot

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.900 
which we'll get a lot we'll get a lot
done<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.899> phase<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.820> know

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
done in that phase and then you know

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.340 
done in that phase and then you know
then<00:00:36.120> we'll<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> little<00:00:36.480> small<00:00:36.809> gap<00:00:37.079> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
then we'll have a little small gap and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.680 
then we'll have a little small gap and
then<00:00:37.440> we'll<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> third<00:00:37.980> phase<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.690> yet

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
then we'll have a third phase but yet

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.910 
then we'll have a third phase but yet
today<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.260> want<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> show<00:00:40.860> you

if<00:00:46.200> plans<00:00:46.890> don't<00:00:47.039> change<00:00:47.629> but<00:00:48.629> first<00:00:48.899> let's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
if plans don't change but first let's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.940 
if plans don't change but first let's
break<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> chains

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.650 

well<00:00:59.950> first<00:01:00.250> let's<00:01:00.460> start<00:01:00.550> with<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:01.059> front<00:01:01.570> of

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
well first let's start with the front of

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.860 
well first let's start with the front of
the<00:01:01.899> van<00:01:02.110> here<00:01:02.379> up<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:02.920> cab<00:01:03.190> area<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
the van here up in the cab area this

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.740 
the van here up in the cab area this
passenger<00:01:05.620> side<00:01:05.920> seat<00:01:06.310> we<00:01:07.180> are<00:01:07.300> going<00:01:07.540> to<00:01:07.600> add

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
passenger side seat we are going to add

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.560 
passenger side seat we are going to add
on<00:01:07.960> a<00:01:07.990> swivel<00:01:08.530> attachment<00:01:09.280> to<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.270> bottom<00:01:10.540> of

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
on a swivel attachment to the bottom of

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.300 
on a swivel attachment to the bottom of
the<00:01:10.659> seat<00:01:10.900> here<00:01:11.140> which<00:01:11.320> will<00:01:11.590> probably<00:01:11.979> raise

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
the seat here which will probably raise

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.310 
the seat here which will probably raise
it<00:01:12.490> up<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.670> little<00:01:12.790> bit<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:14.020> it's<00:01:14.110> going<00:01:14.229> to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
it up a little bit but it's going to

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.320 
it up a little bit but it's going to
allow<00:01:14.470> us<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.680> swivel<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.369> seat<00:01:15.670> all<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.090> way

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
allow us to swivel the seat all the way

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.150 
allow us to swivel the seat all the way
around<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:17.229> it'll<00:01:17.590> be<00:01:17.680> facing<00:01:18.070> this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
around so that it'll be facing this

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.430 
around so that it'll be facing this
direction<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.810> will<00:01:19.930> kind<00:01:20.110> of<00:01:20.140> open<00:01:20.229> up

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
direction and that will kind of open up

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.930 
direction and that will kind of open up
the<00:01:20.500> space<00:01:20.800> here<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.159> give<00:01:21.340> it<00:01:21.369> give<00:01:21.700> another

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
the space here and give it give another

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the space here and give it give another
seat<00:01:22.300> for<00:01:23.020> the<00:01:23.110> living<00:01:23.500> space<00:01:23.770> area<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.780> also

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
seat for the living space area we also

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.320 
seat for the living space area we also
are<00:01:26.440> looking<00:01:26.619> at<00:01:26.920> putting<00:01:27.220> an<00:01:27.400> ottoman<00:01:27.970> right

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
are looking at putting an ottoman right

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.350 
are looking at putting an ottoman right
here<00:01:28.570> to<00:01:28.690> go<00:01:28.840> along<00:01:29.080> with<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:30.550> small<00:01:31.330> little

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
here to go along with it a small little

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.690 
here to go along with it a small little
box<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:32.259> way<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.530> know<00:01:32.649> I<00:01:32.680> can<00:01:32.950> prop<00:01:33.399> my<00:01:33.520> feet

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
box the way you know I can prop my feet

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.550 
box the way you know I can prop my feet
up<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:36.280> thinking<00:01:36.700> about<00:01:36.970> maybe

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
up and we're thinking about maybe

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.300 
up and we're thinking about maybe
putting<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:40.080> porter<00:01:41.080> can<00:01:41.289> inside<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.160> little

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
putting a porter can inside that little

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.910 
putting a porter can inside that little
ottoman<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:43.330> that's<00:01:43.810> that's<00:01:44.200> you<00:01:44.830> know

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
ottoman so that's that's you know

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.580 
ottoman so that's that's you know
something<00:01:45.220> that's<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.030> works<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:47.410> that's

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
something that's in the works so that's

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.410 
something that's in the works so that's
the<00:01:47.770> plan<00:01:48.009> for<00:01:48.039> that<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.640> that's<00:01:49.270> really

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
the plan for that and that's really

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.270 
the plan for that and that's really
about<00:01:49.660> it<00:01:49.960> for<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.410> but<00:01:50.649> what<00:01:50.920> another<00:01:51.190> thing

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
about it for that but what another thing

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.310 
about it for that but what another thing
we'll<00:01:51.520> do<00:01:51.700> is<00:01:51.729> we're<00:01:52.660> going<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.810> put<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.050> curtain

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
we'll do is we're going to put a curtain

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.889 
we'll do is we're going to put a curtain
here<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:57.250> know<00:01:57.369> to<00:01:57.429> close<00:01:57.700> off<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.450> cab

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
here and you know to close off the cab

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.800 
here and you know to close off the cab
area<00:01:59.229> from<00:01:59.410> the<00:01:59.560> living<00:01:59.979> space<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.689> make<00:02:01.689> it

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
area from the living space and make it

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.100 
area from the living space and make it
more<00:02:01.930> stealth<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.939> that's<00:02:04.210> about<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.540> for<00:02:05.020> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
more stealth so that's about it for the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.690 
more stealth so that's about it for the
front<00:02:05.409> area<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:07.270> for<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.780> driver's<00:02:08.470> side

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
front area now for the driver's side

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.280 
front area now for the driver's side
behind<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.970> driver's<00:02:10.329> seat<00:02:10.509> all<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.780> way

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
behind the driver's seat all the way

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.780 
behind the driver's seat all the way
just<00:02:11.650> about<00:02:11.739> all<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:11.980> way<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> back

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
just about all the way to the back

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.819 
just about all the way to the back
we're<00:02:13.690> planning<00:02:13.989> on<00:02:14.049> putting<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.440> bed<00:02:14.620> here

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
we're planning on putting a bed here

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.560 
we're planning on putting a bed here
this<00:02:17.829> actually<00:02:18.040> I'll<00:02:18.940> be<00:02:19.090> talking<00:02:19.299> about<00:02:19.360> this

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
this actually I'll be talking about this

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.750 
this actually I'll be talking about this
one<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:19.959> another<00:02:20.049> video<00:02:20.500> but<00:02:20.620> this<00:02:20.769> is<00:02:20.829> two

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
one in another video but this is two

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.970 
one in another video but this is two
pieces<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.120> plywood<00:02:22.299> here<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.560> we've<00:02:23.680> cut

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
pieces of plywood here that we've cut

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.949 
pieces of plywood here that we've cut
and<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:24.549> actually<00:02:24.970> eight<00:02:25.180> foot<00:02:25.660> long<00:02:25.690> a

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
and it's actually eight foot long a

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.870 
and it's actually eight foot long a
piece<00:02:26.380> of<00:02:26.500> plywood<00:02:26.650> we<00:02:27.100> didn't<00:02:27.340> cut<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.579> will

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
piece of plywood we didn't cut it will

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.949 
piece of plywood we didn't cut it will
be<00:02:27.970> trimmed<00:02:28.180> off<00:02:28.329> a<00:02:28.360> little<00:02:28.540> bit<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.840> edge

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
be trimmed off a little bit on the edge

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.350 
be trimmed off a little bit on the edge
it's<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.010> little<00:02:30.190> sanding<00:02:30.549> on<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> edge

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it's a little sanding on the on the edge

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.690 
it's a little sanding on the on the edge
on<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> end<00:02:31.959> but<00:02:32.650> that's<00:02:32.799> an<00:02:32.890> 8-foot<00:02:33.340> bore<00:02:33.549> out

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
on the end but that's an 8-foot bore out

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.479 
on the end but that's an 8-foot bore out
there<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.829> there's<00:02:35.829> actually<00:02:36.280> eight

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
there so you see there's actually eight

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.449 
there so you see there's actually eight
feet<00:02:36.940> from<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:38.170> door<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.799> the<00:02:38.920> back<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
feet from the door to the back of the

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.460 
feet from the door to the back of the
seat<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.390> we're<00:02:40.510> going<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.720> put<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> six<00:02:41.230> foot

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
seat but we're going to put a six foot

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.970 
seat but we're going to put a six foot
long<00:02:41.739> bed<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:43.350> it's<00:02:44.350> going<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> couch

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
long bed here it's going to be a couch

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.460 
long bed here it's going to be a couch
bed<00:02:46.230> combo

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
bed combo

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.400 
bed combo
so<00:02:47.620> basically<00:02:48.010> there'll<00:02:48.489> be<00:02:48.519> some<00:02:49.320> will<00:02:50.320> be

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
so basically there'll be some will be

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.199 
so basically there'll be some will be
some<00:02:50.620> cushions<00:02:51.160> up<00:02:51.310> against<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.700> wall<00:02:51.910> here

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
some cushions up against the wall here

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.880 
some cushions up against the wall here
to<00:02:52.239> where<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.660> can<00:02:52.810> sit<00:02:53.140> here<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.650> lean<00:02:53.859> up

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
to where you can sit here and lean up

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.400 
to where you can sit here and lean up
against<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.370> wall<00:02:54.519> back<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.000> way<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:55.480> then

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
against the wall back that way and then

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.050 
against the wall back that way and then
the<00:02:56.590> course<00:02:56.799> would<00:02:56.890> be<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> bed<00:02:57.310> lined<00:02:57.640> up<00:02:57.790> along

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
the course would be a bed lined up along

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.569 
the course would be a bed lined up along
here<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.650> then<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.680> think<00:02:59.980> we're<00:03:00.400> going<00:03:00.519> to

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
here and then I think we're going to

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.280 
here and then I think we're going to
make<00:03:00.730> we're<00:03:01.209> not<00:03:01.329> positive<00:03:02.049> on<00:03:02.140> our

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
make we're not positive on our

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.360 
make we're not positive on our
dimensions<00:03:02.709> yet<00:03:02.799> but<00:03:02.950> we're<00:03:03.070> looking<00:03:03.280> at

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
dimensions yet but we're looking at

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.940 
dimensions yet but we're looking at
maybe<00:03:03.489> 24<00:03:04.090> inches<00:03:04.690> wide<00:03:04.750> but<00:03:05.680> then<00:03:05.830> we're

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
maybe 24 inches wide but then we're

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.589 
maybe 24 inches wide but then we're
going<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.129> have<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.640> where<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.090> pulls

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
going to have it to where it it pulls

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.450 
going to have it to where it it pulls
out<00:03:08.400> another

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
out another

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.090 
out another
of<00:03:10.490> inches<00:03:10.820> or<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.120> to<00:03:11.180> make<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.540> 36<00:03:12.140> inch<00:03:12.320> wide

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
of inches or so to make a 36 inch wide

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.190 
of inches or so to make a 36 inch wide
bed<00:03:13.370> maybe<00:03:14.150> more<00:03:14.450> than<00:03:14.570> that<00:03:14.690> we're<00:03:14.870> kind<00:03:15.140> of

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
bed maybe more than that we're kind of

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.040 
bed maybe more than that we're kind of
looking<00:03:15.380> into<00:03:16.090> sizes<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.270> beds<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:17.840> things

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
looking into sizes of beds and things

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.940 
looking into sizes of beds and things
like<00:03:18.140> that<00:03:18.200> right<00:03:18.320> now<00:03:18.500> to<00:03:18.560> figure<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:18.920> out

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
like that right now to figure it out

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.640 
like that right now to figure it out
completely<00:03:19.780> okay<00:03:20.780> this<00:03:21.020> little<00:03:21.200> area<00:03:21.470> here

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
completely okay this little area here

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.100 
completely okay this little area here

small<00:03:27.800> little<00:03:28.070> area<00:03:28.400> here<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:29.510> what<00:03:29.690> we're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
small little area here but what we're

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.500 
small little area here but what we're
going<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:29.960> do<00:03:30.080> with<00:03:30.200> it<00:03:30.410> in<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:31.330> corner<00:03:32.330> right

putting two batteries over there maybe
stacking<00:03:39.920> them<00:03:40.040> or<00:03:40.220> fit<00:03:40.730> them<00:03:40.850> in<00:03:40.940> there

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
stacking them or fit them in there

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.280 
stacking them or fit them in there
somehow<00:03:41.360> we're<00:03:41.570> working<00:03:42.110> on<00:03:42.200> the

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
somehow we're working on the

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.780 
somehow we're working on the
measurements<00:03:42.710> now<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.130> what<00:03:43.310> batteries<00:03:43.640> will

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
measurements now and what batteries will

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.310 
measurements now and what batteries will
fit<00:03:44.000> in<00:03:44.090> there<00:03:44.210> now<00:03:44.390> we're<00:03:44.990> going<00:03:45.080> to<00:03:45.140> make

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
fit in there now we're going to make

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.200 
fit in there now we're going to make
this<00:03:45.440> whole<00:03:45.680> area<00:03:46.250> right<00:03:46.310> here<00:03:47.050> basically<00:03:48.050> the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
this whole area right here basically the

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.990 
this whole area right here basically the
electrical<00:03:50.210> setup<00:03:50.720> you<00:03:51.530> know<00:03:51.650> with<00:03:52.000> the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
electrical setup you know with the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.530 
electrical setup you know with the
batteries<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.930> inverter<00:03:54.740> the<00:03:55.540> charge

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
batteries the inverter the charge

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.300 
batteries the inverter the charge
controller<00:03:56.870> everything<00:03:57.560> over<00:03:57.770> there<00:03:57.950> you

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
controller everything over there you

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.770 
controller everything over there you
know<00:03:58.400> cabling<00:03:58.850> will<00:03:59.030> be<00:03:59.120> run<00:03:59.360> straight<00:03:59.630> to

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
know cabling will be run straight to

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.980 
know cabling will be run straight to
there<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:01.340> then<00:04:01.790> over<00:04:02.000> in<00:04:02.090> this<00:04:02.240> area<00:04:02.600> we're

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
there and then over in this area we're

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.860 
there and then over in this area we're
going<00:04:03.080> to<00:04:03.140> have<00:04:03.380> some<00:04:04.100> shelving<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.670> storage

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
going to have some shelving and storage

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.260 
going to have some shelving and storage
all<00:04:05.870> up<00:04:06.290> all<00:04:06.560> up<00:04:06.800> along<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:07.610> wall<00:04:07.880> here<00:04:08.150> and

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
all up all up along this wall here and

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.360 
all up all up along this wall here and
down<00:04:08.450> to<00:04:08.570> the<00:04:08.660> will<00:04:08.840> well<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.290> then<00:04:10.130> we're

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
down to the will well and then we're

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.290 
down to the will well and then we're
looking<00:04:10.760> at<00:04:10.970> doing<00:04:11.450> some<00:04:11.870> sort<00:04:12.170> of<00:04:12.320> a<00:04:13.300> these

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
looking at doing some sort of a these

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.200 
looking at doing some sort of a these
are<00:04:14.450> fold<00:04:14.810> down<00:04:15.280> either<00:04:16.280> fold<00:04:16.549> down<00:04:16.790> from<00:04:17.090> the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.210 
are fold down either fold down from the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.010 
are fold down either fold down from the
ceiling<00:04:17.510> or<00:04:18.140> a<00:04:18.170> fold<00:04:19.330> fold<00:04:20.330> down<00:04:20.540> from<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
ceiling or a fold fold down from the

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.680 
ceiling or a fold fold down from the
shelving<00:04:21.410> system<00:04:21.860> bed<00:04:22.160> so<00:04:22.460> maybe<00:04:22.670> it'll<00:04:22.940> fold

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
shelving system bed so maybe it'll fold

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.920 
shelving system bed so maybe it'll fold
down<00:04:23.930> right<00:04:24.140> here<00:04:24.500> or<00:04:24.710> up<00:04:25.220> top<00:04:25.750> something<00:04:26.750> that

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
down right here or up top something that

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.620 
down right here or up top something that
is<00:04:27.140> up<00:04:27.440> here<00:04:27.500> in<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.890> in<00:04:28.070> it<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:29.060> folds<00:04:29.570> down

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
is up here in it in it and it folds down

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.010 
is up here in it in it and it folds down
or<00:04:30.110> comes<00:04:30.380> down<00:04:30.620> from<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.010> ceiling<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:32.300> you

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
or comes down from the ceiling so you

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.710 
or comes down from the ceiling so you
know<00:04:33.110> we'll<00:04:33.590> be<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> little<00:04:34.190> desk<00:04:34.460> or<00:04:34.820> you<00:04:35.630> know

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
know we'll be a little desk or you know

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.740 
know we'll be a little desk or you know
a<00:04:35.750> kind<00:04:36.410> of<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.530> dinette<00:04:37.100> set<00:04:37.580> up<00:04:37.730> so<00:04:38.450> I<00:04:38.480> have

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
a kind of a dinette set up so I have

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.600 
a kind of a dinette set up so I have
some<00:04:39.200> place<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.380> eat<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.920> some<00:04:40.310> place<00:04:40.460> you

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
some place to eat and some place you

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.910 
some place to eat and some place you
know<00:04:40.730> work<00:04:40.880> on<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.090> computer<00:04:41.510> or<00:04:41.720> whatever

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
know work on the computer or whatever

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.830 
know work on the computer or whatever
okay<00:04:43.460> now<00:04:43.640> I'm<00:04:43.730> looking<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.270> from<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.630> back

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
okay now I'm looking in from the back

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.100 
okay now I'm looking in from the back
doors<00:04:46.150> what<00:04:47.150> we're<00:04:47.270> planning<00:04:47.480> on<00:04:47.690> doing<00:04:47.750> back

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
doors what we're planning on doing back

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.790 
doors what we're planning on doing back
here<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.680> put<00:04:48.980> in<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.130> galley<00:04:49.400> back<00:04:49.760> here<00:04:50.800> sort

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
here is put in a galley back here sort

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.980 
here is put in a galley back here sort
of<00:04:51.860> like<00:04:51.920> how<00:04:52.190> Dan<00:04:52.580> trowels<00:04:52.940> has<00:04:53.210> his<00:04:53.480> but<00:04:53.750> he's

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
of like how Dan trowels has his but he's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.450 
of like how Dan trowels has his but he's
using<00:04:54.410> the<00:04:54.530> side<00:04:54.770> doors

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
using the side doors

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.000 
using the side doors
we're<00:04:56.390> going<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.630> try<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:56.960> put<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:57.380> back<00:04:57.560> here

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
we're going to try to put it back here

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.490 
we're going to try to put it back here
in<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.760> back<00:04:58.970> it's<00:04:59.660> probably<00:05:00.080> only<00:05:00.200> going<00:05:00.410> to

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
in the back it's probably only going to

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.080 
in the back it's probably only going to
be<00:05:00.770> about<00:05:01.280> as<00:05:01.430> high<00:05:01.580> as<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.820> windows

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
be about as high as the windows

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.730 
be about as high as the windows
basically<00:05:02.710> we'll<00:05:03.710> have<00:05:03.860> some<00:05:04.100> sort<00:05:04.310> of<00:05:04.370> a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
basically we'll have some sort of a

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.000 
basically we'll have some sort of a
storage<00:05:06.740> system<00:05:07.010> that<00:05:07.460> will<00:05:07.850> have<00:05:08.030> a<00:05:08.890> like<00:05:09.890> a

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
storage system that will have a like a

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.770 
storage system that will have a like a
maybe<00:05:10.190> a<00:05:10.280> Coleman<00:05:10.580> stove<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:11.060> pulls<00:05:11.600> out

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
maybe a Coleman stove that pulls out

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.510 
maybe a Coleman stove that pulls out
right<00:05:12.020> here

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
right here

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.220 
right here
then<00:05:13.940> we'll<00:05:14.030> have<00:05:14.120> some<00:05:14.300> stores<00:05:14.600> for<00:05:14.840> pots<00:05:15.050> and

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
then we'll have some stores for pots and

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.190 
then we'll have some stores for pots and
pans<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.830> have<00:05:16.010> a<00:05:16.040> little<00:05:16.490> pantry<00:05:16.910> area<00:05:17.200> but

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
pans and have a little pantry area but

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.510 
pans and have a little pantry area but
we're<00:05:18.320> going<00:05:18.440> to<00:05:18.500> try<00:05:18.680> and<00:05:18.860> encompass<00:05:19.280> it<00:05:19.370> all

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
we're going to try and encompass it all

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.210 
we're going to try and encompass it all
right<00:05:19.760> here<00:05:20.120> it'll<00:05:20.390> probably<00:05:20.660> go<00:05:20.960> about<00:05:21.260> from

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
right here it'll probably go about from

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.500 
right here it'll probably go about from
the<00:05:22.340> wheel<00:05:22.550> well

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
the wheel well

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.830 
the wheel well
all<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.560> way<00:05:24.620> to<00:05:24.650> the<00:05:24.800> back<00:05:24.920> of<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.130> van<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:25.840> I

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
all the way to the back of the van so I

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.390 
all the way to the back of the van so I
can't<00:05:27.590> quite<00:05:27.770> remember<00:05:27.890> that<00:05:28.130> measurement

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
can't quite remember that measurement

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.220 
can't quite remember that measurement
but<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:28.670> think<00:05:28.850> it's<00:05:28.970> about<00:05:29.090> you<00:05:29.540> know<00:05:29.660> you<00:05:30.140> know

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
but I think it's about you know you know

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.370 
but I think it's about you know you know
a<00:05:30.380> little<00:05:30.500> morning<00:05:30.680> foot<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:33.080> then<00:05:33.290> we're

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
a little morning foot and then we're
