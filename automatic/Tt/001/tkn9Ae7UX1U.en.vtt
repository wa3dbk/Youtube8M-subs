 specific weight 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.559
 it is this one of quito 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.610
 with the connector for the ipad remove in turns 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.389
 and with four and tanti 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.089
 a standard hdmi connector 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.089
 we simply introduce 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.419
 what is the cost of that month 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.789
 to that extreme 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.849
 and the other 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.199
 trusted for example frames continued 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.220
 this first test 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.330
 I commented that for example in this case we have improved with one 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.270
 Spain is a bit of a slide show 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.380
 percent and comment that this accessory works perfectly 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500
 when he has been 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.770
 or the ipod touch or iphone 4 activate the mayor 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.680
 this happens for example in a pass of two teams ahead of her 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.690
 oo percent of the part divided dente cuit year 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.130
 I'm not going to teach a young woman also from youtube videos 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.900
 it is not the case bush for example for flights 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.680
 per hundred for this you can want I think they insist ellis already made the break in 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.190
 your 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.140
 Thank you 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.659
 is that there is an application that activated after having lived a hundred percent is and 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:20.980
 official 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.980
 ep for example there must have been a the slides 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.790
 I'm going to show a video 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.980
 engraving at 700 20 pesos 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.110
 thousand 280 by 720 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.730
 and of course with the h 12 4 and it acts like a wildcard 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.740
 it is not simply 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.400
 when you hit the play 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.010
 c activated video output 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.010
 and what is there is perfectly lovers 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 the reproduction of both audio and live 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.130
 Or simply 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.130
 comment that the image of the video there is no peace will be frozen 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.990
 and we can only as we do not here for a hundred we have access what is 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.490
 to the timeline 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 I can handle it a lot to do 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.579
 i the other are the controls of paul shan 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.709
 next video and previous 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.189
 as you see, it works really well 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.359
 you see it is the output of 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:27.759
 divided into in there is peace 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.869
 We are not going to approve for example or a YouTube video 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.869
 let's go to this video 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.039
 Kim when the movie is loaded 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:44.259
 the g in him 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.259
 the ipad 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.299
 and how you have exposed the YouTube video 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.999
 things of lights perfectly 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.039
 and the same what 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:59.059
 that one lived in 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.329
 the store 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.369
 our image is frozen in the ae party in i love the time controls 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.519
 forward backwards I was going to pass 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.169
 have commented that I have had particularly looks pretty good 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.339
 because it is engraved if you want 720 p 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:19.059
 As you know when with 200 euros in 2009 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:20.869
 therefore everything 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:25.459
 he admits it and as you can see on Thursdays he really looks very good 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.790
 well this must be what they want 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.469
 as soon as 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:36.139
 as for the pair 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.839
 and now we're going to perform it from itself test but 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.440
 confused with four 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.440
 the same thing happen to them of slides 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.109
 and as dysfunctional 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.109
 exactly as well 

00:03:57.249 --> 00:04:01.329
 now we are going to make percent per cent reproduction 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.749
 d of the same unleashes the same video 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.839
 dv from there emerges as the frozen image points 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.509
 here we have some verses of access to 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.180
 some salt 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.180
 at the time of reproduction 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.429
 at the time of reproduction i the bishop where next video 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:30.960
 the used 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.960
 and back 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:40.559
 per hundred comment how good it is more if it fits in pretty pretty moutinho 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:42.010
 this accessory 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.539
 Adam for what it is 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:45.439
 the l with four for example 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:50.639
 it was because gm for a smaller screen and the pact have given portable and 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:51.840
 you go to a hotel 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.219
 efe a version of meneses m 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.229
 and as you can see why it works perfectly well 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.879
 create for example 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.740
 now let's do more tests per hundred of the video of what is of 

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:06.739
 Youtube 

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.400
 it is clear that they lived it 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.330
 we are in full 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.219
 and as you can see the frozen image 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.219
 and behind you trace to the video output you know perfectly 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.509
 maintaining the quality 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.339
 It's pretty good 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:27.189
 Of reproduction 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.069
 bulls of the bibio the truth that 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:33.069
 it also makes you angry 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.339
 and the same 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:41.339
 what does not control this month the cons of time 

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.550
 in which good 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.550
 every time if we want to see you a little 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.259
 it is very accurately simple had that party 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:58.669
 and as you can see it works very well 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.969
 by the way of subtlety reaprovechar 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.520
