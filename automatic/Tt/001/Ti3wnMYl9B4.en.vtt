00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:12.179
 well these are the back muscles right 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:16.139
 the back is a theme pull the trapeze the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:21.600
 deltoid than the musician picking up a piece 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:27.109
 of the back and arm of the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:36.090
 Spanish the two rounds larger round 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:40.890
 and smaller round that muscle here is a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.620
 the top of the back accompanied by a 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 powerful call by neurosis 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:53.010
 colomar is also important to know 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 we have here the gluteus medius and this one is 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.440
 the maximum goal goal from the other side 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.159
 note that they were cut 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 the trapeze on this side and the dairy 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.510
 back 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:15.500
 for what to appear to appear this 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:19.140
 muscle that is the semi spinal 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 this boy here wanted to be subdivided into 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:26.810
 two that are the full head and the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.810
 neck planes 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:39.710
 This little one is a scapula lifter. 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.710
 followed by the supra spinal 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.710
 this one I be later radio 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.729
 higher 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:02:01.020
 usually you radio higher 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:04.530
 later it is underneath the robot 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.649
 smaller than most robot in this case here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.520
 they are cut 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:14.069
 but in this figure 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.019
 note that john boy says no 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.129
 are cut with smaller boyd and rum boyd 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.249
 bigger 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.909
 then in this figure the robot is cut 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:32.489
 to appear the muscle underneath it 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:38.540
 it is the latter being higher radio 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:45.419
 this mosko here is the posterior radio being 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:49.530
 and we have here a large muscle 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:57.870
 called and director of the spine that is this 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:03:02.060
 here we have a figure that is if with all 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:09.629
 the surface musicians removed then 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:14.699
 we have this musician who is the voter of the 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:18.329
 spine this is the posterior closed 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:27.959
 superior and this is the closed and posterior 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:31.979
 bottom and here are the and radio oo 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:36.060
 voter gives superior spines and rats 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:41.060
 posterior and inferior posterior 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.060
 so these were the main muscles 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:48.090
 of suÃ¡ remembering from this also the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.829
 very deep muscle but it's important 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:57.299
 that you know that it is the lumbar 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:04:00.569
 which is very deep here, but for the 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.519
 practical classes will be important to 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.030
 Do you know the square 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.030
 low back
