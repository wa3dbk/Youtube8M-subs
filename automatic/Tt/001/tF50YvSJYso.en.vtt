00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
not really a sports car it's a nice car

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.130 
not really a sports car it's a nice car
to<00:02:24.709> move<00:02:24.860> around<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.670> based<00:02:26.390> on<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.750> think

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
to move around and based on that I think

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.460 
to move around and based on that I think
it<00:02:27.739> does<00:02:28.040> deliver<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:29.569> killing<00:02:30.049> was<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.260> little

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
it does deliver the killing was a little

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.940 
it does deliver the killing was a little
bit<00:02:30.560> too<00:02:30.739> thin<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.250> feels<00:02:31.489> like<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.790> on<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:32.000> stick

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.430 

getting<00:02:37.950> down<00:02:38.069> towards<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.580> last<00:02:38.819> bins<00:02:39.440> and

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
getting down towards the last bins and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.990 
getting down towards the last bins and
it'll<00:02:40.739> be<00:02:40.800> interesting<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.190> see<00:02:41.430> how<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.730> fails

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
it'll be interesting to see how it fails

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.320 
it'll be interesting to see how it fails
but<00:02:43.010> certainly<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.130> nice<00:02:44.430> little<00:02:44.700> car<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.180> run

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
but certainly a nice little car to run

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.270 
but certainly a nice little car to run
around<00:02:46.250> but<00:02:47.250> not<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.849> prettiest<00:02:48.330> out<00:02:48.480> there
