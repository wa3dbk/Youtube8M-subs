would<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.640> think<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.969> Reddit<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:43.410> app<00:00:43.530> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
would you think of Reddit that app is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.799 
would you think of Reddit that app is
called<00:00:43.860> amino<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:45.120> League<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.329> Legends<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
called amino for League of Legends and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.529 
called amino for League of Legends and
it's<00:00:46.530> kind<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.829> mix<00:00:47.070> between<00:00:47.420> reddit<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
it's kind of a mix between reddit and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.110 
it's kind of a mix between reddit and
Facebook<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.070> guess<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.340> makes<00:00:50.910> it

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
Facebook so I guess that makes it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.709 
Facebook so I guess that makes it
racebook<00:00:52.020> Oh<00:00:52.699> obviously<00:00:53.699> its<00:00:54.090> amino<00:00:54.420> for

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
racebook Oh obviously its amino for

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.970 
racebook Oh obviously its amino for
League<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.930> Legends<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.440> there's<00:00:55.590> only<00:00:55.739> League

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
