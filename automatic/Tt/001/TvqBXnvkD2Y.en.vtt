00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
radiator okay go back people show them

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:35.500 
radiator okay go back people show them
the<00:00:26.990> new<00:00:27.110> radiator<00:00:27.939> no<00:00:28.939> in<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:29.240> back<00:00:34.510> it's

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
the new radiator no in the back it's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.660 
the new radiator no in the back it's
like<00:00:35.719> five<00:00:36.020> inches<00:00:36.200> longer<00:00:36.559> than<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.520> other

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
like five inches longer than the other

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.270 
like five inches longer than the other
one<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:38.120> think<00:00:38.870> it's<00:00:39.050> only<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.260> single<00:00:39.590> core<00:00:40.010> and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
one I think it's only a single core and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.490 
one I think it's only a single core and
it's<00:00:40.550> plastic<00:00:41.420> I<00:00:41.540> think<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:41.899> is<00:00:42.079> probably

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
it's plastic I think this is probably

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.610 
it's plastic I think this is probably
the<00:00:42.739> most<00:00:43.040> crackerjack<00:00:44.140> radiator<00:00:45.140> I've<00:00:45.440> ever

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
the most crackerjack radiator I've ever

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.549 
the most crackerjack radiator I've ever
seen<00:00:45.920> in<00:00:46.070> my<00:00:46.100> life<00:00:46.899> but<00:00:47.899> now<00:00:48.199> I<00:00:48.230> have<00:00:48.410> no

headlight toes experimenting with this
field<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.379> anyway<00:00:53.769> we're<00:00:54.769> going<00:00:54.859> to<00:00:54.949> start<00:00:55.159> her

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:55.249 
field so anyway we're going to start her

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
we'll put the radio in it without seeing

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.849 
we'll put the radio in it without seeing
the<00:02:16.359> dilemma<00:02:16.659> is<00:02:16.780> I<00:02:16.930> want<00:02:17.109> to<00:02:17.140> put<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.319> radio<00:02:17.680> in

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:17.859 
the dilemma is I want to put a radio in

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:22.220 
the dilemma is I want to put a radio in

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
this is all just taken apart because I'm

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.140 
this is all just taken apart because I'm
reworking<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.629> stuff<00:02:28.900> but<00:02:29.969> because<00:02:30.969> I<00:02:31.060> have

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.069 
no headlights basically and I'm you know
that<00:02:36.819> that's<00:02:37.030> going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.209> be<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.390> original<00:02:37.480> AM

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
that that's going to be the original AM

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.509 
that that's going to be the original AM
radio<00:02:38.290> I'm<00:02:38.560> going<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.739> make<00:02:38.859> it<00:02:39.040> work

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
radio I'm going to make it work

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:40.860 
radio I'm going to make it work
I've<00:02:39.700> been<00:02:39.849> experimenting<00:02:40.390> with<00:02:40.750> these

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
I've been experimenting with these

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.530 
I've been experimenting with these
consoles<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:42.730> going<00:02:42.909> to<00:02:42.970> get<00:02:43.090> like<00:02:43.269> one

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
consoles I'm going to get like one

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.390 
consoles I'm going to get like one
that's<00:02:43.689> even<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:43.989> little<00:02:44.019> bigger<00:02:44.349> than<00:02:44.530> this<00:02:44.739> to

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
that's even a little bigger than this to

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.580 
that's even a little bigger than this to
where<00:02:45.579> I<00:02:45.609> can<00:02:45.879> like<00:02:46.060> cut<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:46.329> out<00:02:46.569> mount<00:02:47.409> the

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
where I can like cut it out mount the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.140 
where I can like cut it out mount the
head<00:02:47.709> unit<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.189> there<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.579> know<00:02:51.700> hook<00:02:52.030> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
head unit in there and you know hook the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.640 
head unit in there and you know hook the
radio<00:02:52.420> up<00:02:52.569> that<00:02:52.780> way<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:52.989> I<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.500> to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
radio up that way so I don't have to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.839 
radio up that way so I don't have to
like<00:02:54.060> screw<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.299> car<00:02:55.950> or<00:02:56.950> another

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
like screw with the car or another

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.460 
like screw with the car or another
option<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.299> was<00:02:58.450> thinking<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.810> was<00:02:58.930> put<00:02:59.139> an<00:02:59.230> amp

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
option I was thinking I was put an amp

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.849 
option I was thinking I was put an amp
in<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.769> trunk<00:03:00.599> with<00:03:01.599> no<00:03:01.870> head<00:03:02.139> unit<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.620> just

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
in the trunk with no head unit and just

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.069 
in the trunk with no head unit and just
the<00:03:02.980> input<00:03:03.189> wire<00:03:03.639> make<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:04.599> like<00:03:04.750> suck<00:03:05.049> it

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
the input wire make it like suck it

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:06.869 
the input wire make it like suck it
stick<00:03:05.379> an<00:03:05.500> mp3<00:03:05.769> player<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.519> it<00:03:06.609> or<00:03:06.730> whatever

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
stick an mp3 player in it or whatever

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.110 
stick an mp3 player in it or whatever
and<00:03:07.569> that<00:03:07.829> was<00:03:08.829> going<00:03:09.129> to<00:03:09.280> be<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:10.150> main

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
and that was going to be the main

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.570 
and that was going to be the main
two<00:03:11.690> options<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.379> don't<00:03:13.159> know<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.250> think<00:03:13.430> I'm

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
two options I don't know I think I'm

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.890 
two options I don't know I think I'm
going<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.730> go<00:03:13.819> with<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.060> head<00:03:14.239> unit<00:03:14.420> in<00:03:14.720> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
going to go with the head unit in the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.630 
going to go with the head unit in the
console<00:03:15.530> thing<00:03:15.799> because<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:18.590> flexibility<00:03:19.459> I

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
console thing because this flexibility I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.030 
console thing because this flexibility I
could<00:03:20.000> play<00:03:20.120> CDs<00:03:20.450> whatever

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.289 

and<00:03:26.040> that's<00:03:26.189> how<00:03:26.370> I'm<00:03:26.489> going<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.760> power<00:03:27.060> the

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
and that's how I'm going to power the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.740 
and that's how I'm going to power the
radio

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.810

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
get her pulled into the garage when we

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:45.110 
get her pulled into the garage when we
started<00:03:34.180> her<00:03:34.300> up

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.140
