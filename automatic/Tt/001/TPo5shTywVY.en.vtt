00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:18.810

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.340

 he is white all particles of bears will be 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.800
 stand out if you take white color further 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:40.070

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:45.450
 picture of a lion that you go here 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 next small plate with water I 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.789
 then I will explain for what and if you 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.489
 another manicure applied in normal hands 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.140
 then it should be washed off, respectively, and for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.340
 we need this liquid 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:05.880
 nail polish removers or from here sponges so 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 let's start the first thing we do is wash it off 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.770
 other 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.960
 manicure for this we just wet 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.960
 nail polish remover with donut and 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:26.479
 rub the nails we do with the nails it 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.479
 paint them white 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.799
 I think everyone knows how to paint nails 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:42.530
 so I donâ€™t explain how to do it 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.530
 I will and just calmly paint them 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:56.010
 so we made up our nails and now we 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:03.120
 we will translate the bears as I showed 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:08.520
 the bags here are not very visible but still 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:11.160
 and we will need scissors to 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.620
 cut off the right amount of niche we 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.330
 we cut off only the two upper ones 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.300
 bags 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:26.700
 because they are the only one 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:31.260
 according to the form that I have left so 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:34.910
 now we only have it 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:41.130
 such bags 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:47.100
 here and now we will get them 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:49.410
 dipping into the water here we cut so 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.180
 so that we have on each piece of paper paws 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:59.400
 one bags and both bags at once we can 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:05.630
 dunk the water here they have some 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.630
 properties are there and they will stick out from 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.680
 paper on which they are now 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:23.610
 are and so we glue these bears 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:28.790
 we will be big nails ki and we need 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:32.730
 wait literally 3 4 minutes so we wait 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.459
 so I checked 1 bear we already became 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.160
 lag behind the paper and now it is him 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:43.040
 we will put on our new for this 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:49.340
 we take here bumazhechku with our teddy bear 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:53.720
 here and neatly peel it off 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:58.079
 from paper here we have a bear 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.980
 somewhere in my hand and I glue it 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:04.489
 literally 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.489
 in the corner of our nails to 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:22.079
 so here is where our bear is now 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:23.820
 she practice me here and you 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:33.199
 check such a bear 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:33.199
 we also already began to believe them and methane 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.630
 sticking on nails 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.770
 That's how I got these two 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:47.060
 wonderful bags and now we need 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.940
 will naturally cover it 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.630
 by some slag namely not 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.900
 some 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.289
 And transparent and now we wait while she 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:02.280
 dries and we will cover transparent 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:05.250
 lacquer and so my bags and no longer 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.150
 lag behind the nails and i can calm them 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:12.720
 clear varnish 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:21.830
 what I'm going to do now is just take 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:21.830
 and on top of the outer we apply transparent 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.320
 do the same with the second hand 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.680

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:09.320
