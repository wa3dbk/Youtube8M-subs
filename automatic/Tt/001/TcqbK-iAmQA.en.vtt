00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.169
 mental note the following video only 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.950
 an idea as an experiment can 

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:10.250
 getting it right can go wrong out of my 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.250
 responsibility 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.420
 although you remember in the previous video 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.759
 we remove a ball from cladophora or from 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.669
 moss from the 60 liter aquarium that I have 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.919
 I opened my room and we said 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.849
 tie it to the aquarium trunk of 160 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.289
 liters 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.779
 well I remembered that I had a stone 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.360
 they gave me a big stone in shape 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.000
 of cave and I thought about the tara and the 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.620
 cladophora open 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.060
 as I would not have room to boil the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.610
 stone I've been cleaning and 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.440
 rinsing for several weeks and in 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.059
 this video we are going to make him a cleaned 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.880
 intensive with a toothbrush to 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.060
 that everyone see it, let's clear the aquarium 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.340
 and we are going to clean the stone 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.600
 Normally when we move some object 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.400
 from the aquarium that has been there for a long time 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.830
 stopped is usually generated a lot of dirt 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.780
 below and we should sound every time 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.160
 we move it I 'm so sorry you come 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.930
 but I forgot to do it 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.340
 because I had so many things in my head 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.920
 to record the video that escaped me 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.570
 but I strongly recommend that you 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.710
 you notice my mistake and you do what 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.270
 you do 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.159
 at the moment the aquarium has an aspect 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.950
 pretty clean but soon it has 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.900
 put this plant that I have 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.520
 hands right now we're going to 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.590
 remove from this aquarium and we will put it 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.150
 provisionally around here next to 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.520
 then take it to the 60-liter aquarium 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.070
 where there is an illumination and a water of 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.350
 higher quality we will prepare the area 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.670
 for the big rock I tried to remove the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.979
 tax very carefully so that it does not 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.830
 stir too much society very shit 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.390
 floating because this is the stone and the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.280
 truth is that it has a lot of green though 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.110
 in this part it does not look like it but that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.149
 we move it to the other parts already 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.619
 you will have to be very insistent with 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.840
 this type of materials before 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.880
 put them in the aquarium and I warn you that if 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.190
 it is possible before cleaning and 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.090
 get him to the aquarium's going green 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.860
 everywhere green filamentous algae me 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.860
 love being what you are thinking 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.460
 but although it may not work 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.380
 it would be the final solution because you can 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.630
 release the algae and other parts of the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.880
 aquarium and it would simply grow in another 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.010
 place the best way to get rid of 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.700
 the algae is maintaining a quality 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.200
 correct water and a correct subscriber that 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.200
 you want two or three letters of ration 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.930
 be good after that appointment 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.640
 prepared here we're going to put the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.920
 stone very carefully so that it does not 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 overflow the water this type of stones or 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.480
 Adornment materials usually weigh a lot 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.700
 at the time of catching the ones out of the water 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.280
 but when we put them inside the 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.470
 aquarium underwater lose most 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.150
 of their weight and it is very rare that they can 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.739
 damage the aquarium although I understand 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.620
 perfectly that you can be scared 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.150
 catch them in weight nothing happens right 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.159
 when I was about to put the lid on the 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.170
 aquarium I find that the pipes 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.359
 of fluorescents have a thick layer 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.239
 of lime tries to remove them from several 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.489
 ways but there was no way so I opted 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.560
 by nails or catch a cloth 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.209
 aluminum and I realized that with that it 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.950
 it removed perfectly as they are 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.629
 fluorescent I did not mind razing them 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.800
 the result has been nothing more and nothing 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.670
 less than perfect before 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.720
 after 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.720
 and more after 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.469
 rotating all afternoon 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.469
 yes 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.210
 and finally the moment has arrived 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:55.370
 They are boys and is this will be the new 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:57.400
 me to record ends and now we go with 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.629
 the moss that we are going to give to the stone 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.000
 half wey be careful with doing it you 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.370
 because a catastrophe could happen in 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.230
 your aquarium come that we already have the 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.360
 nuclear bomb for some in the hands 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.360
 and now we are going to place on the stone 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.519
 I leave it here and now I'm going to do it with 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.200
 nylon thread a few stitches around 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.700
 the stone so that it does not escape 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.700
 staying well tied there 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.800
 after several laps we make a 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.780
 knot and cut the thread 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.539
 finally I'm about to place the aquarium 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.919
 and this is already to the taste of each one of me 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.220
 moment I will place it as I think 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.710
 best 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.080
 and later we'll see if I change it or 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.820
 it was as is this already as 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.229
 I'm watching, I'm not going to 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.759
 use any kind of proportions 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.500
 this is the final result and it's time 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.800
 that he's teaching the aquarium from 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.800
 closer 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.030
 We're here cerquita can 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.390
 appreciate that of course now it is well tied 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.030
 to the rock and let's hope it expands by 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.300
 the sides and fill the whole stone 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.300
 green 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.120
 if it grows up vertically 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.250
 What I will do is try to prune the 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.949
 very much care that no cutting 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.720
 or no part moves through the aquarium 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.970
 and make a plague okay cherubs 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.190
 us others with this big aquarium and 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.229
 let's go to the other aquarium where we are going to 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.150
 plant a plant of which we said 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.500
 before as it seems that in this 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.240
 Large aquarium does not shoot correctly 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.100
 I hope you like how the 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.330
 landscape of this aquarium at the moment not 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.690
 I can do any kind of expense on it 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.700
 but it is what there is we are back in 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.860
 the 60-liter aquarium and we have 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.420
 to put the plant is tiny and the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.040
 they attack the snails so I think that 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.960
 here it will fit very well since there is no 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.110
 no snail since we do not have 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.210
 professional tweezers to plant with 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.220
 the tips of the fingers we grab what 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.560
 are the roots the principle of 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.690
 roots and we buried them on the gravel 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.330
 so that the roots are not visible 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.820
 damaged before releasing the plant 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.710
 we get while with the other fingers 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.020
 we ground over it so it does not 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.270
 come up this plant has a lot 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.030
 tendency to get rid of small 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.620
 twigs and float by the water then he 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.550
 has buried a lot so that it does not 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.140
 I raised 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.030
 finally we compress a little bit the 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.250
 land around the plant so that 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.530
 stay a little compact but not 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.419
 too much but as in any plant 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.790
 normal and current the roots do not 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.980
 would throw well because nothing like this has been 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.500
 I hope you like how it is being 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.910
 the aquarium that gives you some ideas and 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.690
 I'm leaving you with a bit of video 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.690
 of the previous aquarium 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:59.400
 fast on Friday
