splits and it splits two ways first it
splits<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.910> again<00:00:47.910> I'll<00:00:48.000> put<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.239> back<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
splits into a again I'll put it back in

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.340 
splits into a again I'll put it back in
the<00:00:48.660> conventional<00:00:49.230> position<00:00:49.680> first

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.950 

we<00:00:54.350> just<00:00:54.560> dropped<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.920> motor<00:00:55.070> down<00:00:55.900> okay<00:00:56.900> so

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
we just dropped the motor down okay so

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.350 
we just dropped the motor down okay so
it<00:00:57.170> starts<00:00:57.500> off<00:00:57.680> pretty<00:00:58.040> much<00:00:58.850> looking<00:00:59.180> like

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
it starts off pretty much looking like

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.830 
it starts off pretty much looking like
your<00:00:59.809> average<00:01:00.070> conventional<00:01:01.070> kayak<00:01:01.840> with

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
your average conventional kayak with

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.910 
your average conventional kayak with
everything<00:01:04.180> coming<00:01:05.180> all<00:01:05.360> together<00:01:05.920> final

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
everything coming all together final

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.380 
everything coming all together final
version<00:01:07.250> kinda<00:01:07.430> looks<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.880> tantum<00:01:08.240> good

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
version kinda looks like the tantum good

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.020 
version kinda looks like the tantum good
stand<00:01:08.630> boat<00:01:08.810> if<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.020> look<00:01:09.140> over<00:01:09.290> here<00:01:10.000> so<00:01:11.000> just

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
stand boat if you look over here so just

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.550 
stand boat if you look over here so just
like<00:01:11.360> pretty<00:01:11.509> much<00:01:11.690> any<00:01:11.869> other<00:01:11.960> kayak<00:01:12.440> you

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
like pretty much any other kayak you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.010 
like pretty much any other kayak you
seen<00:01:12.800> but<00:01:13.580> the<00:01:13.700> difference<00:01:13.850> is<00:01:14.300> when<00:01:14.780> you<00:01:14.869> want

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
seen but the difference is when you want

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.719 
seen but the difference is when you want
to<00:01:15.110> get<00:01:15.200> to<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.380> place<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.979> you<00:01:16.340> want<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.550> stand

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
to get to a place and you want to stand

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.910 
to get to a place and you want to stand
up<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.000> fish<00:01:17.300> what<00:01:18.200> you<00:01:18.320> do<00:01:18.440> is<00:01:18.560> you<00:01:18.650> engage

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
up and fish what you do is you engage

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.990 
up and fish what you do is you engage
these<00:01:19.160> simple<00:01:19.490> levers<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:22.400> when<00:01:22.729> you<00:01:22.820> move

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
these simple levers and when you move

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.749 
these simple levers and when you move
the<00:01:23.119> boat<00:01:23.300> into<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.570> Y<00:01:23.810> position<00:01:23.840> it<00:01:24.830> gives

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
the boat into the Y position it gives

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.630 
the boat into the Y position it gives
the<00:01:25.880> boat<00:01:26.030> maximum<00:01:26.570> stability<00:01:27.310> now<00:01:28.310> when<00:01:28.520> you

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
the boat maximum stability now when you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.580 
the boat maximum stability now when you
do<00:01:28.789> that<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.149> kayak<00:01:29.450> goes<00:01:29.600> from<00:01:29.780> having<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.289> 30

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
do that the kayak goes from having a 30

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.580 
do that the kayak goes from having a 30
inch<00:01:30.680> beam<00:01:31.039> to<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:32.149> equivalency<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.020> a<00:01:33.140> 6-foot

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
inch beam to the equivalency of a 6-foot

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.410 
inch beam to the equivalency of a 6-foot
beam<00:01:33.830> so<00:01:34.369> it's<00:01:34.490> like<00:01:34.670> standing<00:01:34.940> up<00:01:35.149> on<00:01:35.330> your

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
beam so it's like standing up on your

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.660 
beam so it's like standing up on your
average<00:01:35.690> jon<00:01:36.020> boat<00:01:36.490> basically<00:01:37.490> what<00:01:37.640> that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
average jon boat basically what that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.340 
average jon boat basically what that
means<00:01:37.820> is<00:01:38.180> this<00:01:38.330> boat<00:01:38.600> is<00:01:38.630> not<00:01:38.899> going<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.170> tip

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
means is this boat is not going to tip

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.310 
means is this boat is not going to tip
over<00:01:40.180> there's<00:01:41.180> a<00:01:41.270> second<00:01:41.720> position<00:01:41.810> that<00:01:42.229> you

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
over there's a second position that you

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.740 
over there's a second position that you
can<00:01:42.470> put<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.710> outrigger<00:01:43.070> into<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.750> that's

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
can put the outrigger into and that's

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.920 
can put the outrigger into and that's
this<00:01:44.960> position<00:01:45.470> here

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.770 

and<00:01:49.260> this<00:01:49.650> in<00:01:49.890> line<00:01:50.100> position<00:01:50.610> allows<00:01:51.480> you<00:01:51.660> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
and this in line position allows you to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
and this in line position allows you to
paddle<00:01:52.170> or<00:01:52.290> pull<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.650> boat<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.040> still<00:01:53.790> have

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
paddle or pull the boat and still have

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
paddle or pull the boat and still have

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
good stability but also have a little

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.640 
good stability but also have a little
bit<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> speed<00:01:56.970> as<00:01:57.150> well<00:01:57.300> if<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.470> were<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
bit of speed as well if you were to

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.380 
bit of speed as well if you were to
paddle<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.160> the<00:01:59.220> Y<00:01:59.370> position<00:01:59.400> you<00:02:00.060> could<00:02:00.180> do

paddle it in the Y position you could do

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
paddle it in the Y position you could do
that<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:01.050> it<00:02:01.170> would<00:02:01.290> push<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.710> bit<00:02:01.979> of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that but it would push a little bit of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.400 
that but it would push a little bit of
water<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.550> may<00:02:02.729> spook<00:02:03.030> fish<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.140> again
