this done a couple months ago after I
got<00:00:27.190> it<00:00:27.310> done<00:00:27.340> i<00:00:27.460> think<00:00:27.580> i<00:00:27.820> may<00:00:28.000> be<00:00:28.060> gamed<00:00:28.420> it

two<00:00:29.289> or<00:00:29.470> three<00:00:29.500> times<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.480> the<00:00:31.600> reason<00:00:31.810> for

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
that is because i got a bunch of the new

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.189

it the first time you know I'd stripped
it<00:03:58.290> all<00:03:58.410> down<00:03:58.620> took<00:03:58.890> everything<00:03:59.220> apart<00:03:59.490> you

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
it all down took everything apart you

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.310 
it all down took everything apart you
