pointless in a certain aspect but at the
same<00:03:08.730> time<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.540> really<00:03:09.989> good<00:03:10.080> episode

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
same time it is a really good episode

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.350

really watching chuni and a nice good
kyo-ahn<00:03:14.670> anime<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.380> anime<00:03:16.709> did<00:03:16.950> good

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
