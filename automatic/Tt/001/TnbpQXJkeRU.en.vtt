very very very cool but the really

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.350 
very very very cool but the really
interesting<00:02:04.890> thing<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.909> kill<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.339 
interesting thing is if you kill a
peacock<00:02:07.069> it<00:02:08.069> drops<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.759> peacock<00:02:09.629> feather<00:02:09.660> and
