00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.660
 How do you make a check and at 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.039
 and who knows the power of paa very rare burns 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.199
 good clippers 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.029
 You and you can even be cold. 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.920
 soothing to check this voice 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.859
 first you'll be here in cali in 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.830
 one of the starting cities and goes 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.789
 direction to the sling that is there 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.320
 our voice 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.820
 Let's go for the ride to run a 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.820
 A little faster, huh? 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.469
 Come on, I'll hardly find the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.489
 because this is a very 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.780
 rare 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.469
 it can appear from one to three sets 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:02.520
 Let's see where he is coming here. 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:06.949
 with the boatman rairo wheel and arriving 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.949
 here we go here left 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:17.820
 OK 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:21.350
 arriving here we find that the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:27.090
 iet it respawn it can be born here 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.009
 Sure, but how can people get there? 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.750
 he can walk and stay a little longer 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.680
 Far too when you get here. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.970
 to check to send money understood 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:47.600
 duty is there 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.600
 he walked nothing from 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:58.920
 Come on, let's go, there's nothing vietnam to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:04.049
 top sees nothing of ethics just by disengagement 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 of conscience nothing because it is I did not have 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.470
 lucky to find the yeti here right? 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.850
 but I hope you have the luck 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.970
 to find it and who knows 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.490
 snipers and worships for a good price 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.840
 I think she was reading some 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:28.150
 worlds up to more than 10 kaka 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.150
 Good luck. See you at the team.
