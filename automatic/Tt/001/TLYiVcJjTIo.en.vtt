00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.600
 Y 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.600
 all right 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.360
 we saw that the river sagua bread 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.670
 dragged many of those bottles by 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.520
 another side in Mexico there are 10 million 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.920
 families in housing arrears and there it is 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.930
 where the idea of ​​using the 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.840
 bottles to build houses of es 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.029
 thermal because in fact you do not feel the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.340
 it's cold cold does not feel that much 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.500
 Cold cold just the same heat is equal 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.500
 Fresquita does not feel hot 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.660
 the plastic bottles should go 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.640
 filled with earth and then 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.699
 they stick with each other with a mixture of 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.500
 clay and prickly pear also 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:04.879
 we use glass bottles that 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.740
 bottles also serve as as as 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.960
 to make the walls although its 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.390
 resistance is not as big as 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.970
 plastic bottles we discover in 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.690
 laboratories that filled bottles 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.250
 of land like the ones we do 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.640
 they resist four times more than 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.670
 Specifically five years ago this that 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.280
 We built this we are 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.539
 I am living here because we feel 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.050
 happy because in fact it is a house 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.340
 no one has it, nobody has it 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.170
 and he 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.170
 the first that we have 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:00.210
 most people see that it is 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.850
 necessary only to build with block 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.060
 with brick and cement and they are 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.150
 forget that for many centuries the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.280
 humanity did not have those materials and what 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.340
 did with clays he did with others 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.880
 materials then I think the challenge more 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.040
 important is to break the paradigms of 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.110
 the people and that people stop seeing 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.700
 to the bottles as garbage and that the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.970
 start to see as a material of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.970
 building
