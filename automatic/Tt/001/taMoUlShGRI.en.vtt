 Welcome to a new video of mine 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.910
 Today I show you how to make dark circles 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.650
 perfectly covering and how to look first and foremost 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.990
 that prevents me from doing this 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.000
 small wrinkles here settles what we 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.500
 I think everyone just gets upset and we all 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.119
 everyone tries the perfect tip for it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 I have to personally find myself 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.949
 found the best solution and wanted the 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.109
 Of course, share with you so completely 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.779
 quite a lot of fun with myvideo and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.769
 I use the same today 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.020
 menu bar nation of mckinsey 25 die 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.329
 By the way, lately I am on the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.860
 dearest with a brush hers 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 certainly already knows from several videos 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.219
 and shines series 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.000
 that's such a hack with several brushes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.930
 definitely worth it again 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.620
 discounted absolute favorite movie 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.620
 currently 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.610
 what you have to pay attention to now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.149
 is that your make up or 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.869
 foundation only holds up to the eyes 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.210
 against order because the more products there 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.530
 order the more can also be quasi 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.890
 It can be more wrong 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.159
 settle and therefore just really 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 the eye area for fun so come now 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.060
 we go to the main part and ours 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.520
 beautiful dark circles 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.399
 the first is once again important mega 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.840
 So what kind of stuff do you use? 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.490
 eye cream no matter what was a great one 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.410
 from page you have to fall in the technique 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.450
 have had the subject not true 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:37.080
 then the better can clear or the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.179
 better players in the world not what 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.950
 tell her what she really rolls since me 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.590
 i have used very dry skin 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.720
 currently of la roche coming into her 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.850
 of pharmacy leaders repeatedly scans in 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.720
 Krems a bit cool it on everyone 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.960
 very good 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.850
 who to extremely recent eyebrows 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.410
 tends in any case before 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.560
 products use what kind of a 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:07.110
 orange rotstich has as you know 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.369
 red is the complementary colors expensive 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.080
 eye rings and she wanted the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.030
 with which you can do that with something useful 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.410
 some survive, some survive 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.650
 Lipstick or no idea what I have there 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.120
 I have been able to creamy 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.250
 Press clear and for that I use 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.460
 really easy of essence here 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.730
 isle of stage airways that has so easy 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:33.550
 in front of antique engraving and I carry 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.440
 just before easy and easy 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.200
 that easily blinds you with the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.150
 finger like that when you first 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.100
 the color balance has come now 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.200
 to lighten that is what it really is 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.180
 The dark circles are very beautiful 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.760
 disappear one of my favorite 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.680
 concealer which is very good at everyone 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 Mexico is definitely the case 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.940
 pole series and that is what I have 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.120
 either 20 is bright and has 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.980
 again a pink is also available 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:12.060
 even more the clear shadow on so 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:15.700
 I put that on first finger 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.740
 that only spreads a little bit quietly 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.590
 a bit larger that here 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.600
 already part of your banking game with you 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.150
 brightened piece again a bit 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.100
 blind awake and work I do 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.690
 that with a wet beauty planner 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.580
 or with a damp 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.270
 youtube countries do not really know 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.209
 but he teaches dozens 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:44.770
 so and now comes the real trick 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.200
 How not from never and indeed 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.080
 you need loose powder 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.750
 This is courageous as far as dark circles are concerned 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.540
 or settling on concealer 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.300
 I have here once from g2 a whole 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.530
 simple transparent loose powder and 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.970
 once max the effortless powder that 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.070
 you can do as you want once 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.460
 the cheaper variant once the 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.890
 not so cheap evaluate 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:14.270
 30 euro three euros, it was of course great 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.950
 then you just take one right 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.950
 bright phase there if you look at each one 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.450
 well advise this case it almost does 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.210
 that's why I'm going to do it now 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.890
 Use here is minimal 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.540
 but it is transparent therefore from the 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.480
 such a cash effect but sets 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.550
 definitely not from time to time 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.100
 really really what she does now 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.360
 is you the youtube country of the also 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.820
 is still wet and goes in with it 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.160
 This loose powder in here then looks 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.170
 He previously again after if not 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.310
 has already settled with me it is 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.090
 namely for example now already the 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.440
 case therefore I go again slightly 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.660
 with the little finger over it and make 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.780
 it's gone because if you're here right now 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.640
 do it then it stays that way there is 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.000
 Now really just to eyelash 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.690
 border on that can be quiet right much 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.370
 his 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.890
 Do not worry about it that is 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:16.280
 somehow too blatant I hear 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:18.020
 that is, we are looking at it 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.110
 now just for a moment and leave it 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.080
 So the powder particles say 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.890
 that excess skin is fat or that 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.960
 on and off excess oil of the container 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.370
 Cooking is so far away hence the name 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.750
 cooking or beijing 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.300
 as it is from the American 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.370
 come here something like that next 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.160
 Do the following here take your sand 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.430
 behind i use for example al-ali trend 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.830
 to the highlights from else is the number 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:51.200
 105 and just wiped it completely 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:55.550
 easy away now runs the excess 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:59.330
 powder wiped off and since stopped 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.500
 It just never looks great 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.610
 over paragraphs 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.610
 on the 8th 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.880
 so that 's it again with the 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.290
 video fans you would like then 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.200
 Of course, as always, I have one 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.270
 look forward to a positive review or above 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.810
 Abo what you might leave me there 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.610
 would like to 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.290
 I wish you a very complete one 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.860
 really great day and until the next 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.860
 Video
