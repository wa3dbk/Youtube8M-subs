00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.519
 Hopsten as began few bars back in a pack game 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.109
 quite right we are in similar pilot hype and boring are these 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.470
 Tables not that namely the super powers and filed in the 

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:20.949
 Can buy a game and how it looks like it's full of experimentation 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.329
 guaranteed 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.650
 But what are the products at all? 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.130
 quite simply around line Alex Mercer the at the beginning of the game with amnesia in one 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.300
 Mortuary on 8 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.730
 confused, he flies and discovers his supernatural powers 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 and also the Manhattan of the city played in the group 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.519
 were infected by a cruel virus 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.990
 Of course, the military does not help too much 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.210
 Erlach stands moon between the fronts and will uncover his past 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.090
 but of course serve revenge amount 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.090
 August method is 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.680
 The storyline is presented in front of her neck and into the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.620
 Cutscenes and Flashbacks that reflect people's memories 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.520
 which has incorporated itself into the world 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.200
 no Trichet Alix can become 1 with any human and so on 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.880
 harmonious that too sounds the process is not just minute took friendly 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.979
 it is an NPC incorporated, he can transform from now on that ensures 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.100
 a few nice infiltration Samsung against the military 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.730
 this is Doris couple or parts of the cart are unfolded but never his 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.430
 all the potential for it lacks the characters too much depth 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.229
 Thus, being totally proud was thus exhorting not outstanding 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.740
 the real strength played but the already mentioned superpowers and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.910
 the way Alex moves through Manhattan 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.910
 who owns cars if you want Nokia can fly now 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.240
 Among the super powers is developer Radical Entertainment 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.390
 strongly printed 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.870
 They're doing really well and it's fun to chaos in the city 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.219
 on back 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.219
 Here we see for the women 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.629
 Brühl media 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.619
 or here 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.129
 to show all forces both in the frame 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.269
 but well a hole if witches is not quite alive, he likes to warm it up 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.329
 has a particularly strong power use here for example the explode success 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 want 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.200
 By default, the sample starts to hit Euro mode there you can 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.639
 similar to GTA's either the emissions or the story campaign 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.199
 dedicate 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.239
 but the story campaign is rarely jerat with their on 30 missions but 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.889
 on a Osnabrück newspaper » 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.149
 the sooner we, for example, get one from each mother and child 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.499
 in between there are various boss fights which often end very close 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:05.499
 can be quite difficult to take place 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.859
 Maybe it will always be when I switch to the following box 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.709
 Dresen raises to zero then it means pulling back and regenerating in 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.169
 that man implants you 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.559
 in Stellingen chaos the overview of that is not always easy 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.979
 especially if the military reinforces in the form of stretch and calls and we 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.439
 from both the AMI and the infected Georg Werne 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.439
 No 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.249
 With 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.129
 Keyword military Helge Karch infiltration of military bases 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.139
 Steal war machines without attracting attention 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.769
 the nerves 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 Of course, the classic version is also possible 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.799
 calling the minis the ONI mission is a terrified dream 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.510
 Downie little vans for more than five minutes that is rare if you have many now 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.099
 Doing infected or running away points is really exciting 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.669
 Not 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.059
 The funniest thing is the bullseye wind in the Aleks 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.469
 It has to land exactly what tape or controller control also problem-free 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.469
 is working 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.470
 If I'm boring, the 200 countries together could be the source 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.750
 Manhattan are scattered 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.720
 As a reward, there are the p of Solutions points for almost everything in the game 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.720
 with which you can upgrade your superpowers 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.500
 technical product unfolds low visibility weak textures and 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.039
 Continuous repetition was clouding the picture 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:38.409
 only last time Zion and the representation of his super powers can 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:39.240
 impress 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.150
 In addition, the chaos becomes convincing despite the weak technology 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.979
 rübergebracht 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.860
 I expected more from the producer, but I make the break and game play and 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.479
 that experiment with super powers a lot of fun 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.180
 but many of the mission are somehow going 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.460
 The casino could also have tolerated more fine tuning 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.720
 in one point, however, the nail hits the head every day the feeling of power 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.610
 has not so convincingly conveyed a game before 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.339
 in the chaotic fast the field despite the weaknesses is fun 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:11.339
 you can do that to do that 19 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.689
 No 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:16.539
