a double lift that I rarely see used
probably<00:00:09.549> because<00:00:09.879> it<00:00:10.000> is<00:00:10.120> kind<00:00:10.299> of<00:00:10.360> difficult

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
probably because it is kind of difficult

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.589 
probably because it is kind of difficult
to<00:00:10.809> do<00:00:11.670> but<00:00:12.670> once<00:00:12.880> you<00:00:13.000> master<00:00:13.179> it<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:16.360> can<00:00:16.509> do

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
mechanic's grip and just practice

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.180

pushing<00:01:54.250> over<00:01:54.580> two<00:01:54.730> cards<00:01:55.800> squared<00:01:56.800> up<00:01:56.950> and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
pushing over two cards squared up and

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.680 
pushing over two cards squared up and
just<00:01:57.460> keep<00:01:57.610> practicing<00:01:57.760> pushing<00:01:58.390> over<00:01:58.540> two

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
just keep practicing pushing over two

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.140 
just keep practicing pushing over two
cards<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.250> cards<00:02:03.550> spread<00:02:03.820> out<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.940> little

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
cards if the cards spread out a little

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.550 
cards if the cards spread out a little
bit<00:02:04.360> that's<00:02:04.600> okay<00:02:04.750> because<00:02:05.050> they'd<00:02:05.200> be<00:02:05.320> do<00:02:05.440> it

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
bit that's okay because they'd be do it

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.090 
bit that's okay because they'd be do it
fast<00:02:05.800> enough<00:02:05.950> nobody<00:02:06.820> will<00:02:06.970> see<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:11.860> keep

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
fast enough nobody will see so just keep

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.520 
fast enough nobody will see so just keep
practicing<00:02:12.580> till<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.850> can<00:02:13.060> get<00:02:13.300> two<00:02:14.260> cards

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
practicing till you can get two cards

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.730 
practicing till you can get two cards
like<00:02:15.280> I've<00:02:15.430> gotten<00:02:15.700> pretty<00:02:15.820> good<00:02:15.970> at<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.270> I

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
like I've gotten pretty good at it I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.540 
like I've gotten pretty good at it I
have<00:02:17.740> two<00:02:17.950> cards<00:02:18.190> right<00:02:18.370> here<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
porters are lined up really good so I

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.230 
porters are lined up really good so I
can<00:02:23.350> just<00:02:23.590> go<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.460> just<00:02:24.850> turn<00:02:25.060> over

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.980 
can see that if you're pushing over two
cars<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:13.640> pulling<00:03:13.880> back<00:03:16.540> then<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.630> just<00:03:17.660> got

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
cars and pulling back then you just got

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.950 
cars and pulling back then you just got
to<00:03:18.080> break<00:03:18.230> under<00:03:18.410> two<00:03:18.650> cards<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:20.660> with<00:03:20.720> this

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
to break under two cards but with this
