on the weapon I believe the recoil on
this<00:01:18.869> weapon<00:01:19.080> isn't<00:01:19.800> that<00:01:20.340> much<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.720> still

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this weapon isn't that much but it still

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
we don't care about any of that we just

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.730 
we don't care about any of that we just
want<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> run<00:02:18.180> gun<00:02:18.510> get<00:02:18.900> kills<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.410> be<00:02:19.560> done

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
with the objective so that is the class

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.210 
with the objective so that is the class
that<00:02:21.750> I<00:02:21.840> have<00:02:22.020> every<00:02:22.680> game<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.099> I've<00:02:23.190> played

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
that I have every game that I've played

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.339 
that I have every game that I've played
and<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> only<00:02:23.880> play<00:02:24.150> domination<00:02:24.840> or<00:02:25.050> demolition

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
I get thirty plus kills and thirty kills

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.240 
I get thirty plus kills and thirty kills
is<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> low<00:02:28.380> end<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.650> most<00:02:28.860> kills<00:02:29.099> I've

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
is on the low end the most kills I've

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.970 
is on the low end the most kills I've
gotten<00:02:29.550> so<00:02:29.730> far<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:30.360> sixty<00:02:30.870> eight<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.740> think

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
gotten so far is sixty eight and I think

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.830 
gotten so far is sixty eight and I think
that's<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.220> decent<00:02:32.400> class<00:02:32.819> setup<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.599> like

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that's a decent class setup that I like

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.630 
that's a decent class setup that I like
to<00:02:34.020> use<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.410> called<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.709> go<00:02:34.890> hamburger<00:02:35.430> just
