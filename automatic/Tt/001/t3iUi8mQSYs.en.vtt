00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:58.590
 the condition of the firewood burned out and now we lay down 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:04.540

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:13.260

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:19.660

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:22.780
 we twist we twist we fry so little bit 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.290
 literally there 5 minutes lay on 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.360
 on one side now we have this whole thing 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.610
 immediately turned up to nothing here 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.890

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.030

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.190

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.090
 We turn over with her. 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.410
 more often we will do it all 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:52.900

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:57.150

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.540
 seen now has grown the other side 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:05.650
 this is the whole thing here the fish is fried faster 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:11.760
 than meat so you need to be watchful 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.760
 as you can see if you look closely 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.799
 Macro will not choose here 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 if you look closely there is no big 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.900
 quantities of spices i'm not really 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:30.950
 I love a lot of different herbs there and 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:35.420
 like that but it interrupts 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:39.000
 the natural taste here is the fish it is delicious 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.230
 fried over 30 with its smell 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.930
 fire is all 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.900

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:24.090
