this is true this is a really

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.730 
this is true this is a really
interesting<00:00:06.410> hack<00:00:07.639> for<00:00:08.840> the<00:00:09.840> iphone<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
interesting hack for the iphone and

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.160 
interesting hack for the iphone and
ipads<00:00:11.460> which<00:00:12.420> worked<00:00:12.840> through<00:00:13.290> version<00:00:13.920> 8.1

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
ipads which worked through version 8.1

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
ipads which worked through version 8.1
but<00:00:16.170> inevitably<00:00:17.130> was<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.420> be

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
but inevitably was going to be

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.890 
but inevitably was going to be
foreclosed<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.980> soon<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.520> Apple<00:00:21.029> realized

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
foreclosed on as soon as Apple realized

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.040 
foreclosed on as soon as Apple realized
what<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.670> fact<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.180> this

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
what was going on but the fact is this

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.490 
what was going on but the fact is this
was<00:00:25.910> hardware<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.240> hardware<00:00:28.340> box<00:00:29.340> costs<00:00:30.330> about

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
was hardware a hardware box costs about

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
was hardware a hardware box costs about
120<00:00:31.500> pounds<00:00:31.969> which<00:00:32.969> which<00:00:33.630> until<00:00:34.559> just

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
120 pounds which which until just

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.610 
120 pounds which which until just
November<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> when<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.320> went<00:00:37.530> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
November which is when they went to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.880 
November which is when they went to
eight<00:00:38.010> point<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.760> point<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.950> was<00:00:40.950> able<00:00:41.820> to

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
eight point one point one was able to

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.139 
eight point one point one was able to
crack<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.670> digit<00:00:45.210> pins<00:00:45.600> uh<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.340> had<00:00:47.670> if

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
crack four digit pins uh if you had if

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
crack four digit pins uh if you had if
you<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.450> iPhone<00:00:48.870> protected<00:00:49.410> by<00:00:49.530> four

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
you had your iPhone protected by four

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
you had your iPhone protected by four
digit<00:00:50.219> PIN<00:00:50.460> code<00:00:50.820> now<00:00:51.539> we've<00:00:51.719> talked<00:00:52.020> about

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
digit PIN code now we've talked about

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.420 
digit PIN code now we've talked about
how<00:00:52.949> hard<00:00:53.460> Apple<00:00:54.120> worked<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.649> make<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
how hard Apple worked to to make that

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.049 
how hard Apple worked to to make that
impossible<00:00:57.289> specifically<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.609> famous

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
impossible specifically the the famous

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.889 
impossible specifically the the famous
erase<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.899> data<00:01:01.500> after<00:01:02.250> 10<00:01:02.609> attempts<00:01:03.359> lockout

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
erase all data after 10 attempts lockout

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.010 
erase all data after 10 attempts lockout
the<00:01:04.559> idea<00:01:04.920> being<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.939> just<00:01:06.180> can't<00:01:06.570> guess

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the idea being that you just can't guess

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.219 
the idea being that you just can't guess
four<00:01:07.470> digit<00:01:07.890> pins<00:01:08.220> day<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.360> nyah<00:01:09.570> because

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
four digit pins day and nyah because

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.460 
four digit pins day and nyah because
after<00:01:10.760> 10<00:01:11.760> mistakes<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.840> does<00:01:13.140> out<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
after 10 mistakes it does out it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
after 10 mistakes it does out it
basically<00:01:13.860> remember<00:01:14.610> throws<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.270> keys<00:01:15.479> away

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
basically remember throws the keys away

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
basically remember throws the keys away
it<00:01:15.960> doesn't<00:01:16.200> actually<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.860> wipe<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it doesn't actually have to wipe the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.300 
it doesn't actually have to wipe the
data<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.890> phone<00:01:20.130> is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
data because the the the phone is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.960 
data because the the the phone is
encrypted<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> needs<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.040> wipe

counting

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.910 

so<00:02:27.980> Apple<00:02:28.819> made<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> little<00:02:29.420> mistake<00:02:29.710> and<00:02:30.710> this

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
so Apple made a little mistake and this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.160 
so Apple made a little mistake and this
is<00:02:31.069> why<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.459> such<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.790> perfect<00:02:32.300> example<00:02:32.600> of

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
is why this is such a perfect example of

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.640 
is why this is such a perfect example of
you<00:02:33.920> know<00:02:34.040> like<00:02:34.069> real<00:02:34.760> world<00:02:35.120> security<00:02:35.750> apples

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
you know like real world security apples

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.690 
you know like real world security apples
programmers<00:02:37.340> said<00:02:37.910> okay<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:39.110> if<00:02:39.650> it's<00:02:40.130> if<00:02:40.340> they

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
programmers said okay so if it's if they

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.870 
programmers said okay so if it's if they
don't<00:02:40.910> enter<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.360> pin<00:02:41.660> code<00:02:41.690> correctly<00:02:42.200> and

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
don't enter the pin code correctly and

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.390 
don't enter the pin code correctly and
we<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.330> erased<00:02:44.750> data<00:02:44.990> after<00:02:45.290> 10<00:02:45.800> attempts<00:02:46.280> is

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
we and erased data after 10 attempts is

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.380 
we and erased data after 10 attempts is
enabled<00:02:47.120> then<00:02:47.840> we<00:02:48.050> increment<00:02:48.290> a<00:02:48.950> counter

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
enabled then we increment a counter

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
enabled then we increment a counter
which<00:02:50.390> we<00:02:50.630> store<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.340> non-volatile<00:02:52.340> memory<00:02:53.410> so

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
which we store a non-volatile memory so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.620 
which we store a non-volatile memory so
that<00:02:54.440> we're<00:02:55.340> continuing<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.030> increment<00:02:56.390> it

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
that we're continuing to increment it

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.420 
that we're continuing to increment it
until<00:02:57.020> they<00:02:57.200> enter<00:02:57.230> correctly<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.100> which<00:02:58.220> case

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
until they enter correctly in which case

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.820 
until they enter correctly in which case
we<00:02:58.610> zero<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.030> counter<00:02:59.390> what<00:03:00.050> these<00:03:00.230> guys<00:03:00.500> did

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
we zero the counter what these guys did

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.670 
we zero the counter what these guys did
was<00:03:01.070> realize<00:03:01.640> they<00:03:02.270> could<00:03:02.510> they<00:03:03.020> could<00:03:03.050> break

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
was realize they could they could break

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.080 
was realize they could they could break
power<00:03:04.780> disconnect<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.930> battery<00:03:06.700> so<00:03:07.700> fast

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
power disconnect the battery so fast

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
power disconnect the battery so fast
after<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.350> guest<00:03:09.739> failure<00:03:10.550> that<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.630> phone<00:03:11.870> was

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
after a guest failure that the phone was

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.860 
after a guest failure that the phone was
in<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.440> process<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:13.370> recording<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.390> guests

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
in the process of recording the guests

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.090 
in the process of recording the guests
but<00:03:15.110> wasn't<00:03:15.590> able<00:03:15.739> to<00:03:16.160> complete<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:17.420> update

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
but wasn't able to complete that update

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.759 
but wasn't able to complete that update
so<00:03:19.100> just<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.180> brilliant<00:03:20.480> hack<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.140> just<00:03:21.530> love

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
so just a brilliant hack I just love

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.860 
so just a brilliant hack I just love
this<00:03:21.890> because<00:03:22.100> this<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.430> this<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.300> kind<00:03:23.630> of

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
this because this is this is the kind of

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.120 
this because this is this is the kind of
way<00:03:24.489> security<00:03:25.750> breaches<00:03:26.750> occur<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.860> you

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
way security breaches occur that you

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.949 
way security breaches occur that you
know<00:03:28.250> where<00:03:28.670> something<00:03:28.970> looks<00:03:29.300> absolutely

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
know where something looks absolutely

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.550 
know where something looks absolutely
solid<00:03:30.500> until<00:03:31.400> somebody<00:03:31.850> really<00:03:32.560> motivated

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
solid until somebody really motivated

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.550 
solid until somebody really motivated
looks<00:03:34.160> at<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.489> same<00:03:34.940> code<00:03:35.329> everybody<00:03:36.320> else

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
looks at the same code everybody else

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.080 
looks at the same code everybody else
has<00:03:36.709> been<00:03:36.860> looking<00:03:37.190> at<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.549> says<00:03:37.790> wait<00:03:38.030> a

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
has been looking at and says wait a

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.870 
has been looking at and says wait a
minute<00:03:38.420> what<00:03:39.230> if<00:03:39.350> we<00:03:39.560> chopped<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.640> power

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
minute what if we chopped the power

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.990 
minute what if we chopped the power
right<00:03:41.390> here<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.959> then<00:03:42.650> reboot<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.430> phone<00:03:43.640> and

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
right here and then reboot the phone and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.500 
right here and then reboot the phone and
then<00:03:44.660> try<00:03:45.320> the<00:03:45.380> next<00:03:45.680> pin<00:03:46.100> and<00:03:46.370> if<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.120> fails

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
then try the next pin and if it fails

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.410 
then try the next pin and if it fails
chop<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.290> power<00:03:48.500> reboot<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.400> phone<00:03:49.579> go<00:03:50.060> again

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
chop the power reboot the phone go again

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.550 
chop the power reboot the phone go again
and<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:51.410> turns<00:03:51.650> out<00:03:51.860> that<00:03:52.100> works<00:03:52.549> so<00:03:53.239> all<00:03:53.810> Apple

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
and it turns out that works so all Apple

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.080 
and it turns out that works so all Apple
had<00:03:54.769> to<00:03:54.920> do<00:03:55.130> is<00:03:55.489> change<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.420> sequence<00:03:56.780> they

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
had to do is change the sequence they

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.930 
had to do is change the sequence they
pre-increment<00:03:59.440> before<00:04:00.440> they<00:04:00.739> do<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:01.130> test<00:04:01.400> so

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
pre-increment before they do the test so

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.030 
pre-increment before they do the test so
that<00:04:01.970> they've<00:04:02.239> recorded<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.440> pending

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
that they've recorded the pending

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.990 
that they've recorded the pending
failure<00:04:04.760> in<00:04:05.030> case<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.900> does<00:04:06.290> fail<00:04:06.670> rather<00:04:07.670> than

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
failure in case it does fail rather than

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.900 
failure in case it does fail rather than
post<00:04:08.750> incrementing<00:04:09.680> they<00:04:10.190> did<00:04:10.459> that<00:04:10.670> they

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
post incrementing they did that they

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.550 
post incrementing they did that they
changed<00:04:11.329> that<00:04:11.420> in<00:04:11.720> eight<00:04:11.989> point<00:04:12.260> one<00:04:12.380> point

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
changed that in eight point one point

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.160 
changed that in eight point one point
one<00:04:13.070> that's<00:04:13.430> all<00:04:13.820> they<00:04:14.030> had<00:04:14.209> to<00:04:14.239> do<00:04:14.510> to

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
one that's all they had to do to

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.240 
one that's all they had to do to
foreclose<00:04:16.130> on<00:04:16.459> this<00:04:17.329> really<00:04:18.200> cool<00:04:18.440> hack<00:04:18.799> but

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
foreclose on this really cool hack but

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.390 
foreclose on this really cool hack but
until<00:04:19.669> last<00:04:20.030> November<00:04:20.660> even<00:04:21.530> with<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:21.950> iphone

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
until last November even with the iphone

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.330 
until last November even with the iphone
6<00:04:22.789> and<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.510> version<00:04:24.020> 8<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.830> all<00:04:25.010> of<00:04:25.190> its

various incantations uh getting up to up

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.850 
various incantations uh getting up to up
to<00:04:28.850> eight<00:04:29.030> point<00:04:29.360> one<00:04:29.419> point<00:04:29.570> one<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.680> can

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
to eight point one point one you can

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.800 
to eight point one point one you can
crack<00:04:31.130> it<00:04:31.160> this<00:04:31.430> way<00:04:31.610> if<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.210> was<00:04:32.360> protected<00:04:32.780> by

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
crack it this way if it was protected by

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.110 
crack it this way if it was protected by
four<00:04:33.169> four<00:04:33.560> four<00:04:33.830> digit<00:04:34.190> pin<00:04:34.370> if<00:04:34.580> you<00:04:35.000> were

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
four four four digit pin if you were

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.790 
four four four digit pin if you were
using<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.630> more<00:04:35.840> complicated<00:04:36.169> passwords

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
using the more complicated passwords

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.290 
using the more complicated passwords
there<00:04:36.950> was<00:04:37.039> just<00:04:37.220> you<00:04:37.400> know<00:04:37.430> if<00:04:37.789> there's<00:04:38.090> no

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
there was just you know if there's no

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.260 
there was just you know if there's no
way<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.900> was<00:04:39.050> going<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.320> guess<00:04:39.500> as<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.830> was

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
way it was going to guess as it was

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.970 
way it was going to guess as it was
it<00:04:40.630> could<00:04:40.870> take<00:04:41.020> like<00:04:41.230> a<00:04:41.290> hundred<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:41.890> eleven

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
it could take like a hundred and eleven

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.010 
it could take like a hundred and eleven
hours<00:04:42.580> so<00:04:43.300> many<00:04:43.720> days<00:04:44.110> to<00:04:44.890> go<00:04:45.070> through<00:04:45.390> 00<00:04:46.390> 00

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
hours so many days to go through 00 00

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
hours so many days to go through 00 00
to<00:04:47.530> 99<00:04:47.800> 99<00:04:48.550> but<00:04:49.150> if<00:04:49.300> you're<00:04:49.540> you<00:04:49.900> know<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.620> law

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
to 99 99 but if you're you know the law

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.730 
to 99 99 but if you're you know the law
enforcement<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:51.910> you<00:04:52.870> needed<00:04:53.200> to<00:04:53.260> get<00:04:53.440> into

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
enforcement and you needed to get into
