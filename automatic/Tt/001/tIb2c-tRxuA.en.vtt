 interest of a glance there is this 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.240
 story that starts out really cool with 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.280
 This story came about and he almost 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.440
 was published in place of its rings 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.510
 so the areas only came about because this 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.400
 book is that it was not published and was only 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.290
 published many years later 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.570
 so I'm just interested in the girlfriend there. 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.020
 galley west of it tells the story of a 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.150
 peaceful farmer, it 's you. 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.040
 in england in very remote times 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.300
 when the tide is a book that actually 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.010
 he says he's going on the story 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:21.150
 of the mother of all beginnings the story is 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.560
 It happens later the times of the king cowell but 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.350
 before artur 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.870
 windows 7 king the anglo saxons has one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.040
 idea about three times that do 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.080
 this story of getting you to sleep in the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.350

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.380
 dog that is all expected 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.480
 barking for help, yes the dogs 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.890
 From this story, people are a 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.040
 story for children 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.960
 So the dog wakes him up and says he's 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.420
 a giant there on the property of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.010
 destroying everything by stepping on cows 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.979

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.420
 of a bug is not the way though the 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.080
 bother with the sting 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:35.390

 trade bravery bracketed network because 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.930
 we have in history that a region 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.440
 where it is fearful then it was kind of 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.680
 luck a fluke scare the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.360

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.070
 sword that was thrown in the castle 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.570
 no one cared about the sword 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.390
 sure the goalkeeper knows that this story 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.520

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.640

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:31.280
 magic sword suffers her name is 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:34.130
 mote because it was a sword that the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:39.140
 ancient warriors used to kill 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:41.830
 dragons helton and eo and ze were not afraid 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.830
 this ladder 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:48.430
 then the dragon appeared in the region 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.590
 threatening the day and the whole region there 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.930

 going to meet the citizen in history 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.330
 because the story is not talking anymore 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.320
 about this story that the story well 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.299
 short 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.960
 but it's very cool for those who like 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.110
 Imaginative stories that have kings who 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.300
 has it is that there are now several journey 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.300
 Next story best indyu com 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.970
 she 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.050
 santino a personal story is that 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.650
 despite being a story for children 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.229
 we will find is a lot of 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.580
 adult world than things so negative 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:47.270
 type cunning betrayal greed is 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.100
 among other things that I think 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.020
 I may be wrong but I think it rang 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.440
 in your story to show to the 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.840
 his children as the world itself then 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.490
 I think there's this thing I was in 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.930
 story 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:05.690
 I think cool good guys this is my 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:10.390
 two stories telling only the same as 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:13.430
 first story is the final version of 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.280
 that tone in which you worked 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.310
 perfected for publication even books 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.320
 and the second one in history is a 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.919
 Manuscript that the closest story 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.930
 She told how she told her children. 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.550
 is a much smaller zinha story is more 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.650
 I liked it more cool, because it is 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:35.870
 exactly the story as the control of the 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:38.900
 cane is in the beginning for you here it starts 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.690
 so is father began to tell a 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.970
 story and that's what he said so 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.850
 there is that thing more switched and 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.860
 your children even then I went to two 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.930
 but I think I think the second is a 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.910
 interesting to see then is this personal 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.280
 there's the hint of staying face to face with a book 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.490
 very cool came the reed very fun 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.830
 a very imaginative story I say 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.890
 again for those who want to go out on something 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.320
 different from these others free to catch 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.600
 a light and imaginative thing then 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:12.680
 to drop down to the next video then 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.710
 of books of stories that the total of 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.660
 your kids will likely tone photoshop 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:19.789
 Maybe I'll make a video until the 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.180
 next video was forced to watch is 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.180
 more
