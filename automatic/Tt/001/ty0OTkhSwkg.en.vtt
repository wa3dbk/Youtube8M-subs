00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
stuff up here you're bending the twelfth

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.200 
stuff up here you're bending the twelfth
fret<00:01:53.370> of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.850> g<00:01:54.210> string<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:56.030> then<00:01:57.030> you're

fret of the g string and then you're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.920 
fret of the g string and then you're
using<00:01:57.420> your<00:01:57.780> first<00:01:58.200> finger<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:59.030> bar<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.720> 10th

fret on the B and E strings and you're

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.660 
fret on the B and E strings and you're
doing<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.720> a<00:02:07.410> pattern<00:02:07.920> store<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.369> this

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.520 

you're<00:02:11.670> sliding<00:02:12.030> down<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.380> you're

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you're sliding down here so you're

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.600 
you're sliding down here so you're
borrowing<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.890> eighth<00:02:14.040> fret<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.490> you're

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
borrowing the eighth fret and you're

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.700 
borrowing the eighth fret and you're
bending<00:02:14.850> on<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.240> tenth<00:02:15.450> fret<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.530> g

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
bending on the tenth fret of the g

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:36.800 
bending on the tenth fret of the g
string<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:36.030> you're<00:02:36.330> basically<00:02:36.720> just

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
string so and you're basically just

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.809 
string so and you're basically just
doing<00:02:37.200> some<00:02:37.500> stuff<00:02:37.709> out<00:02:37.800> there

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.640 

you<00:02:42.819> can<00:02:43.000> do<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.510> pretty<00:02:43.780> much<00:02:43.930> in<00:02:44.079> any<00:02:44.170> rhythm

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
you can do it pretty much in any rhythm

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.330 
you can do it pretty much in any rhythm
you<00:02:44.739> want<00:02:44.980> at<00:02:45.159> all<00:02:45.219> it<00:02:46.000> all<00:02:46.180> sort<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:47.799> goes

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
you want at all it all sort of it goes

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.589 
you want at all it all sort of it goes
fine<00:02:48.579> with<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.819> recording<00:02:49.180> no<00:02:49.269> matter<00:02:49.450> what

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
fine with the recording no matter what

00:02:49.599 --> 00:03:09.030 
fine with the recording no matter what
way<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:49.930> it<00:03:07.319> but<00:03:08.319> if<00:03:08.439> you<00:03:08.530> really<00:03:08.560> want<00:03:08.950> to

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
way you do it but if you really want to

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.259 
way you do it but if you really want to
do<00:03:09.129> it<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.609> four<00:03:10.090> notes<00:03:10.420> here<00:03:10.719> and<00:03:12.239> then<00:03:13.239> a

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
do it it's four notes here and then a

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:32.789 
do it it's four notes here and then a
bent<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.900> doesn't<00:03:32.169> really<00:03:32.230> matter<00:03:32.439> how<00:03:32.739> you

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
bent so it doesn't really matter how you

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.759 
bent so it doesn't really matter how you
do<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:34.120> all<00:03:34.269> really<00:03:34.569> sounds<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.959> same<00:03:35.109> so

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
do it it all really sounds the same so

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:42.179 
do it it all really sounds the same so
then<00:03:36.639> you<00:03:36.700> go<00:03:36.790> back<00:03:36.939> into<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:40.799> then<00:03:41.799> until

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
then you go back into the and then until

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.159 
then you go back into the and then until
the<00:03:42.450> second<00:03:43.450> soul<00:03:43.599> will<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.840> just<00:03:44.019> keep

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
the second soul will you just keep

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.050 
the second soul will you just keep
repeating<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.980> for<00:03:45.549> the<00:03:45.609> second<00:03:45.940> soul

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
repeating that and for the second soul

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:56.280 
repeating that and for the second soul
it<00:03:46.359> starts<00:03:46.659> out<00:03:46.720> something<00:03:47.019> like<00:03:47.109> this<00:03:55.290> and

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
it starts out something like this and

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.390 
it starts out something like this and
you're<00:03:56.440> doing<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:56.799> on<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.720> tenth<00:03:58.720> fret<00:03:58.870> here

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
you're doing this on the tenth fret here

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.530 
you're doing this on the tenth fret here
of<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:01.180> D<00:04:01.299> string<00:04:03.629> so<00:04:04.629> ten<00:04:05.049> threaded<00:04:05.379> D<00:04:05.799> string

then finally a 12th on the a-string

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:58.590 
then finally a 12th on the a-string
so<00:04:54.480> and<00:04:55.480> you're<00:04:55.600> gonna<00:04:55.690> do<00:04:55.870> that<00:04:57.090> sort<00:04:58.090> of<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.510> a

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
pattern like this and then some bending

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.240 
pattern like this and then some bending
on<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.410> twelfth<00:05:14.710> fret<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.130> g<00:05:15.310> string<00:05:15.340> and

on the twelfth fret of the g string and

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.070 
on the twelfth fret of the g string and
then<00:05:18.250> you're<00:05:18.400> going<00:05:18.610> up<00:05:18.730> here<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.060> the<00:05:19.270> 17th

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.440 
then you're going up here to the 17th
fret<00:05:20.350> on<00:05:20.680> the<00:05:20.770> g<00:05:21.040> string<00:05:21.070> and<00:05:21.550> the<00:05:21.760> 15th<00:05:22.300> fret

on<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:22.990> B<00:05:23.350> string<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:24.930> you're<00:05:25.930> bending<00:05:26.110> that

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
on the B string and you're bending that

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.790 
on the B string and you're bending that
and<00:05:26.800> it'll<00:05:27.490> go<00:05:28.110> basically<00:05:29.110> to<00:05:29.410> a<00:05:29.440> rhythm<00:05:29.770> like

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
and it'll go basically to a rhythm like

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.550 
and it'll go basically to a rhythm like
this<00:05:31.710> then<00:05:32.710> you're<00:05:32.830> going<00:05:33.010> down<00:05:33.250> here<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.610> the

this then you're going down here to the

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:56.319 
this then you're going down here to the
12th<00:05:35.560> red<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:35.920> ten<00:05:36.100> threats

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:59.299 

and<00:05:57.329> then<00:05:58.019> you're<00:05:58.139> going<00:05:58.379> here<00:05:58.679> so<00:05:58.979> it's<00:05:59.159> the

00:05:59.299 --> 00:05:59.309 
and then you're going here so it's the

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.749 
and then you're going here so it's the
14th<00:05:59.729> fret<00:06:00.029> on<00:06:00.299> the<00:06:00.589> g-string<00:06:01.589> 15<00:06:02.459> thread<00:06:02.669> on
