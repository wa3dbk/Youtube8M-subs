00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.630 
don't want any dirt obviously fall in
the<00:01:36.329> air<00:01:36.420> budhism<00:01:36.960> least<00:01:37.710> amount<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.070> possible

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the air budhism least amount as possible

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.240 
the air budhism least amount as possible
and<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.320> only<00:01:40.439> reason<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.829> usually<00:01:41.070> happens

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and the only reason it usually happens

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
and the only reason it usually happens
is<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:42.090> there's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> lot<00:01:42.630> sitting<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.079> top

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
is because there's a lot sitting on top

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.289 
is because there's a lot sitting on top
of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.439> air<00:01:43.560> filter<00:01:43.740> itself<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.119> when

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
of the air filter itself and then when

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.450 
of the air filter itself and then when
you<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> pull<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.799> hit<00:01:47.009> parts<00:01:47.340> at

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
you go to pull it off you hit parts at

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.100 
you go to pull it off you hit parts at
the<00:01:47.549> top<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.909> air<00:01:48.030> box<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> knocks<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the top of the air box and it knocks it

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
the top of the air box and it knocks it
off<00:01:49.200> pulls<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> off<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:49.950> just<00:01:50.280> drops<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.939> right

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
off pulls it off and just drops it right

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.060 
off pulls it off and just drops it right
into<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.509> air<00:01:51.630> boot<00:01:51.869> so<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> lot<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> times<00:01:52.920> what

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
into the air boot so a lot of times what

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.789 
into the air boot so a lot of times what
I'll<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> try<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.299> put<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> paper<00:01:54.810> towel<00:01:55.140> up

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
I'll do is try and put a paper towel up

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.030 
I'll do is try and put a paper towel up
over<00:01:56.280> top<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.380> kind<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> trap

and just less prone to fall in the air
boot<00:02:05.630> itself<00:02:07.630> seems<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.750> work<00:02:08.899> out

ignition cover spray it down with maybe
some<00:05:18.170> WD<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:18.920> just<00:05:19.100> let<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:19.340> air<00:05:19.490> out

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
some WD and just let it air out

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.490 
some WD and just let it air out
sometimes<00:05:20.090> sometimes<00:05:20.570> water<00:05:20.810> will<00:05:21.050> seep<00:05:21.290> in

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
sometimes sometimes water will seep in

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.560

there<00:05:21.760> it's<00:05:22.760> a<00:05:22.820> good<00:05:22.940> idea<00:05:23.000> that's<00:05:23.330> getting

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
there it's a good idea that's getting

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.820 
there it's a good idea that's getting
the<00:05:23.630> habit<00:05:23.960> of<00:05:24.050> pulling<00:05:24.260> this<00:05:24.470> off<00:05:24.620> and

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
life a lot of times if they stay wet

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.840 
life a lot of times if they stay wet
saturated<00:06:38.930> they<00:06:39.290> get<00:06:39.500> soft<00:06:39.919> sooner<00:06:40.580> and<00:06:40.790> they

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
saturated they get soft sooner and they

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.920 
saturated they get soft sooner and they
don't<00:06:41.000> last<00:06:41.180> as<00:06:41.390> long

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930 
don't last as long

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.409 
don't last as long
so<00:06:42.110> this<00:06:42.710> is<00:06:42.860> a<00:06:42.889> rich<00:06:43.280> Lafferty<00:06:43.669> with<00:06:43.940> some

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
so this is a rich Lafferty with some

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.530 
so this is a rich Lafferty with some
