the<00:01:21.030> top<00:01:22.970> looks<00:01:23.970> like<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.990> top<00:01:25.170> which

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the top looks like one of the top which

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:39.330 
the top looks like one of the top which
is<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.860> online

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.190 

and<00:01:39.909> this<00:01:40.060> isn't<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.390> final<00:01:40.570> version<00:01:41.079> yet

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
and this isn't the final version yet

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.740 
and this isn't the final version yet
either<00:01:41.829> this<00:01:42.820> isn't<00:01:43.119> this<00:01:43.270> isn't<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.600> final

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
either this isn't this isn't the final

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.899 
either this isn't this isn't the final
versions<00:01:44.259> the<00:01:44.409> final<00:01:44.710> all<00:01:45.369> right<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.729> first

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
versions the final all right the first

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.819 
versions the final all right the first
100<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.630> these<00:01:46.750> are<00:01:46.810> going<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.170> be<00:01:47.229> hand<00:01:47.500> signed

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
100 of these are going to be hand signed

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.910 
100 of these are going to be hand signed
on<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.159> best<00:01:48.369> cap<00:01:48.579> so<00:01:49.390> that<00:01:49.869> includes<00:01:50.619> mine

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
on the best cap so that includes mine

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.999 
on the best cap so that includes mine
it's<00:01:51.700> definitely<00:01:52.149> an<00:01:52.240> SMB<00:01:52.570> woofer<00:01:53.079> I'm<00:01:53.829> not

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
it's definitely an SMB woofer I'm not

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.740 
it's definitely an SMB woofer I'm not
just<00:01:54.189> signing<00:01:54.399> something<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:54.909> idea<00:01:55.270> was<00:01:55.509> for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
just signing something that idea was for

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.300 
just signing something that idea was for
the<00:01:55.840> first<00:01:55.990> 100<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.860> have<00:01:57.009> an<00:01:57.189> authentic

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
the first 100 to have an authentic

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.550 
the first 100 to have an authentic
signature<00:01:58.119> that<00:01:58.600> came<00:01:58.810> right<00:01:58.990> off<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.110> my<00:01:59.259> hand

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
signature that came right off of my hand

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.510 
signature that came right off of my hand
so<00:01:59.740> I'm<00:02:00.460> gonna<00:02:00.580> go<00:02:00.729> ahead<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.149> this<00:02:01.299> one

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:16.460 

you<00:02:06.520> shut<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.729> off<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.000> that's<00:02:07.149> over<00:02:07.329> practice

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.860 

cool<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.090> seems<00:02:19.330> you're<00:02:19.480> thinking<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> be

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
cool so it seems you're thinking to be

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:27.410 
cool so it seems you're thinking to be
perfect<00:02:20.230> every<00:02:20.319> time

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.110 

yeah<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:29.799> signed<00:02:30.099> one<00:02:30.400> there<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.819> I<00:02:30.880> signed

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
yeah so I signed one there and I signed

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.420 
yeah so I signed one there and I signed
one<00:02:31.390> kind<00:02:31.630> of<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> middle<00:02:32.140> of<00:02:32.530> the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
one kind of in the middle of the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.960 
one kind of in the middle of the
ascendant<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.830> I<00:02:35.830> don't<00:02:36.310> know<00:02:36.519> which<00:02:36.790> one

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
ascendant and I don't know which one

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.370 
ascendant and I don't know which one
looks<00:02:37.180> better<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.660> I'll<00:02:38.349> figure<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.680> out<00:02:40.380> it's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
looks better but I'll figure it out it's

00:02:41.380 --> 00:03:14.280 
looks better but I'll figure it out it's
alright<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:44.310> this<00:02:45.310> will<00:02:45.519> be<00:02:47.579> SMD<00:02:48.579> number<00:02:49.239> one

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.160 

look<00:03:15.290> at<00:03:15.379> that<00:03:15.500> coil<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:15.980> there

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
look at that coil in there

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.039 
look at that coil in there
goddamn<00:03:18.170> look<00:03:19.329> where<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.390> starts<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:20.930> look

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
goddamn look where it starts and look

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:37.110 
goddamn look where it starts and look
where<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.349> is<00:03:29.140> again<00:03:35.230> see<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.379> right<00:03:36.530> there

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
where it is again see that right there

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.490 
where it is again see that right there
that's<00:03:38.120> SMD<00:03:38.870> number<00:03:39.530> one<00:03:41.049> gotta<00:03:42.049> love<00:03:42.260> that

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.129 

this<00:03:45.500> will<00:03:45.650> be<00:03:45.739> number<00:03:45.889> two<00:03:46.690> suit<00:03:47.690> yourself

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
this will be number two suit yourself

00:03:48.139 --> 00:04:05.190 
this will be number two suit yourself
it's<00:03:48.349> kinda<00:03:48.590> hard<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.799> sign<00:03:49.069> on<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.370> round<00:03:49.549> us

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.840 

kind<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:05.860> put<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.069> signature<00:04:06.550> in<00:04:06.670> two

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
kind of put the signature in two

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.130 
kind of put the signature in two
different<00:04:07.000> spots<00:04:07.420> because<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.780> wasn't<00:04:07.990> sure

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
different spots because I wasn't sure

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.600 
different spots because I wasn't sure
where<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:08.470> wanted<00:04:08.740> to<00:04:08.920> put<00:04:09.069> them<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.680> sort

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
where I wanted to put them so sort

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.220 
where I wanted to put them so sort
messed<00:04:12.880> up<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.209> that<00:04:13.330> way<00:04:13.540> but<00:04:13.780> that's<00:04:13.930> okay

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
messed up in that way but that's okay

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.650 
messed up in that way but that's okay
because<00:04:14.260> they're<00:04:14.709> authentic<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.700> these<00:04:16.540> are

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
because they're authentic and these are

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.140 
because they're authentic and these are
prototypes<00:04:17.670> the<00:04:18.670> real<00:04:18.910> ones<00:04:19.209> will<00:04:20.970> they'll<00:04:21.970> be

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
prototypes the real ones will they'll be

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.670 
prototypes the real ones will they'll be
a<00:04:22.180> slightly<00:04:22.660> different<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.470> couple

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
a slightly different just a couple

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.200 
a slightly different just a couple
little<00:04:23.890> design<00:04:24.220> changes<00:04:24.580> but<00:04:24.760> nothing<00:04:24.910> too

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
little design changes but nothing too

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.290 
little design changes but nothing too
big<00:04:25.390> this<00:04:25.540> is<00:04:25.600> what<00:04:25.840> they<00:04:25.990> really<00:04:26.230> look<00:04:26.410> like

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
big this is what they really look like

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.110 
big this is what they really look like
but<00:04:28.860> love<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:29.980> signature<00:04:30.400> thing<00:04:30.610> all<00:04:30.760> handled

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
but love the signature thing all handled

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.250 
but love the signature thing all handled
by<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.270> time<00:04:32.280> they<00:04:33.280> officially<00:04:33.640> go<00:04:33.790> out<00:04:34.260> so

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
by the time they officially go out so

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.520 
by the time they officially go out so
keep<00:04:35.440> your<00:04:35.590> eye<00:04:35.620> out<00:04:35.710> for<00:04:35.860> them<00:04:37.470> actually<00:04:38.470> I'm

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
keep your eye out for them actually I'm

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
keep your eye out for them actually I'm
not<00:04:38.650> ready<00:04:38.890> to<00:04:38.950> tell<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.280> keep<00:04:39.370> your<00:04:39.430> eye

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
not ready to tell you to keep your eye

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.100 
not ready to tell you to keep your eye
out<00:04:39.580> for<00:04:39.640> me<00:04:40.000> X<00:04:40.120> I<00:04:40.240> didn't<00:04:40.419> get<00:04:40.540> my<00:04:40.720> four<00:04:42.450> so<00:04:43.450> in

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110

a couple of days I'll have the other two

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:56.119 
a couple of days I'll have the other two
then<00:04:46.120> we'll<00:04:46.240> hook<00:04:46.330> them<00:04:46.480> up
