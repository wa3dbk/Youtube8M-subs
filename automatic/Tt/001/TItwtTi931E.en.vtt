00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
how gentle a chiropractic adjustment to

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.280 
how gentle a chiropractic adjustment to
infants<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.270> art<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:55.430> okay<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.810> let's<00:01:57.810> sound<00:01:58.079> we

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
infants in art is okay so let's sound we

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.219 
infants in art is okay so let's sound we
take<00:01:58.469> our<00:01:58.680> know<00:02:00.530> what<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.860> with<00:02:02.219> babies<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
take our know what we do with babies and

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.429 
take our know what we do with babies and
we<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:05.700> dump<00:02:05.939> them<00:02:06.090> upside<00:02:06.420> down<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:07.380> know

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
we we dump them upside down and I know

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.520 
we we dump them upside down and I know
that<00:02:07.740> seems<00:02:08.099> kind<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.520> odd<00:02:08.989> but<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> think

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that seems kind of odd but if you think

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.060 
that seems kind of odd but if you think
about<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:11.009> she<00:02:11.459> has<00:02:11.760> spent

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
about it she has spent

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.880 
about it she has spent
nine<00:02:14.070> months<00:02:14.430> upside<00:02:15.240> down<00:02:15.480> in<00:02:15.900> Kristen<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
nine months upside down in Kristen and

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.890 
nine months upside down in Kristen and
it's<00:02:17.520> actually<00:02:17.910> only<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.240> last<00:02:18.450> two<00:02:18.690> months

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
it's actually only the last two months

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.390 
it's actually only the last two months
that<00:02:19.110> she's<00:02:19.290> been<00:02:19.440> right<00:02:19.620> side<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.040> she's

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that she's been right side up so she's

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000 
that she's been right side up so she's
quite<00:02:20.760> comfortable<00:02:21.330> bi<00:02:21.870> upside<00:02:22.380> down<00:02:22.650> right

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
quite comfortable bi upside down right

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.100 
quite comfortable bi upside down right
and<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.600> we<00:02:24.870> go<00:02:26.600> so<00:02:27.600> we<00:02:27.780> dumped<00:02:27.990> her

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
and so here we go so we dumped her

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.230 
and so here we go so we dumped her
upside<00:02:28.470> down<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:29.100> what<00:02:29.280> I'm<00:02:29.400> looking<00:02:29.790> at<00:02:29.940> is

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
upside down and what I'm looking at is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.530 
upside down and what I'm looking at is
to<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:30.510> her<00:02:31.380> head<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.310> whether<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.790> turns<00:02:33.060> one

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to see her head and whether it turns one

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.480 
to see her head and whether it turns one
way<00:02:33.720> or<00:02:33.870> another<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.320> what<00:02:34.650> did<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.280> notice

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
way or another now what did you notice

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.880 
way or another now what did you notice
when<00:02:35.880> she<00:02:36.150> first<00:02:36.690> came<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.380> when<00:02:37.620> she<00:02:37.740> first

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
when she first came in when she first

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.410 
when she first came in when she first
came<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.430> had<00:02:38.580> was<00:02:38.700> constantly<00:02:39.270> going

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
came in and I had was constantly going

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.360 
came in and I had was constantly going
to<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.660> right<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.620> what<00:02:40.800> it<00:02:41.010> didn't

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
to the right I think it what it didn't

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.340 
to the right I think it what it didn't
move<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.670> off<00:02:41.820> no<00:02:42.030> okay<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:42.960> after<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
move it off no okay and then after the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.460 
move it off no okay and then after the
second<00:02:43.890> or<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.460> adjustment<00:02:45.150> she<00:02:46.050> was<00:02:46.170> showing

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
second or so adjustment she was showing

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.830 
second or so adjustment she was showing
the<00:02:46.740> other<00:02:46.890> way<00:02:47.220> normal<00:02:47.670> okay<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.450> you'll<00:02:48.630> take

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the other way normal okay so you'll take

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.640 
the other way normal okay so you'll take
her<00:02:49.050> now<00:02:49.790> great<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.780> that's<00:02:51.990> kind<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.320> like<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
her now great so that's kind of like the

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.710 
her now great so that's kind of like the
diagnostic<00:02:53.520> way<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.880> doing<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.300> and<00:02:54.420> then<00:02:54.480> now

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
diagnostic way of doing it and then now

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.880 
diagnostic way of doing it and then now
what<00:02:54.930> I'm<00:02:55.050> doing<00:02:55.080> is<00:02:55.440> I'm<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.620> adjusting

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890

their mid-back and just kind of going
down<00:02:59.160> her<00:02:59.700> spine<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.480> there's<00:03:01.320> no<00:03:01.560> force<00:03:02.130> or

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
down her spine and there's no force or

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.320 
down her spine and there's no force or

traumatic force at all and then we

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.590 
traumatic force at all and then we
always<00:03:40.620> adjust<00:03:41.100> that<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.460> tip-top<00:03:41.910> Parker
