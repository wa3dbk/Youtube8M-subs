let's first take a look at our foot

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310 
let's first take a look at our foot
placement<00:00:50.820> or<00:00:50.940> our<00:00:51.090> feet<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.660> want<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> make

sure as you're running that you're

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
sure as you're running that you're
running<00:00:54.480> parallel<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.949> not

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
running parallel and that you're not

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.880 
running parallel and that you're not
crossing<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.910> feet<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.260> another<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
crossing your feet over one another so

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.729 
crossing your feet over one another so
run<00:00:59.250> parallel<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.210> when<00:01:00.780> your<00:01:00.899> foot<00:01:01.230> strikes

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
run parallel and when your foot strikes

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.740 
run parallel and when your foot strikes
the<00:01:01.920> ground<00:01:02.059> ensure<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.270> you're<00:01:03.420> striking

the ground ensure that you're striking
right<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> middle<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.250> foot<00:01:05.640> now

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
right into the middle of your foot now

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
right into the middle of your foot now
it's<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:06.960> debatable<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.070> should<00:01:08.280> go

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it's very debatable if you should go

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's very debatable if you should go
heel<00:01:08.729> ball<00:01:09.000> toe<00:01:09.030> or<00:01:09.780> run<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> middle<00:01:10.350> of

heel ball toe or run to the middle of
your<00:01:10.740> foot<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.250> run<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> toes<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.540> that's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
your foot or run at the toes but that's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.289 
your foot or run at the toes but that's
a<00:01:12.900> beginner<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:14.040> may<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.250> going<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.090> bit

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
a beginner you may be going a little bit

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480 
a beginner you may be going a little bit
slower<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.290> more<00:01:16.530> natural<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.340> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
slower so it's more natural for you to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.789 
slower so it's more natural for you to
go<00:01:17.729> into<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.240> heel<00:01:18.540> ball<00:01:18.780> toe<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.259> eventually

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
go into a heel ball toe but eventually

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.260 
go into a heel ball toe but eventually
you'll<00:01:19.979> start<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.490> run<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> middle<00:01:21.180> of

you'll start to run to the middle of

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.149 
you'll start to run to the middle of
your<00:01:21.390> foot<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.259> start<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.680> pick<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.950> your
