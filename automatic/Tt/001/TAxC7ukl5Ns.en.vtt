00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
is one of those exotic swear it's a

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.780 
is one of those exotic swear it's a
little<00:00:33.210> lackluster<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:35.280> say<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.730> because

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
little lackluster and I say this because

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.350 
little lackluster and I say this because
it<00:00:36.630> has<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.290> high<00:00:37.410> fire<00:00:37.950> rate<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.430> really

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
it has a really high fire rate a really

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920 
it has a really high fire rate a really
high<00:00:39.540> stability<00:00:39.980> with<00:00:40.980> fitted<00:00:41.460> stock<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.120> you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
high stability with fitted stock and you

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.860 
high stability with fitted stock and you
can<00:00:43.140> go<00:00:43.320> ahead<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.879> get<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.690> actually

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
can go ahead and get it so it actually

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.500 
can go ahead and get it so it actually
has<00:00:46.230> pretty<00:00:46.530> decent<00:00:47.039> range<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.300> reason

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
has pretty decent range now the reason

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.470 
has pretty decent range now the reason
why<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.260> gun<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> doodoo<00:00:51.239> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
why this gun is kind of doodoo is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.740 
why this gun is kind of doodoo is
because<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:53.219> doesn't<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.789> any<00:00:53.940> damage<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
because it doesn't do any damage and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
because it doesn't do any damage and
it's<00:00:55.379> special<00:00:56.100> /<00:00:56.280> curse<00:00:56.640> bringer<00:00:57.120> which

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
it's special / curse bringer which

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
it's special / curse bringer which
allows<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.859> ahead<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.280> cause<00:00:59.489> enemies

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
allows you to go ahead and cause enemies

allows you to go ahead and cause enemies
to<00:01:00.680> explode<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> curse<00:01:02.640> throw<00:01:02.969> type

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
explosion for precision kills doesn't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.990 
explosion for precision kills doesn't
have<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> big<00:01:06.600> blast<00:01:07.439> radius<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.640> has

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
have a big blast radius it actually has

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.870 
have a big blast radius it actually has
a<00:01:09.030> really<00:01:09.930> small<00:01:10.409> blast<00:01:11.070> radius<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.760> it

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a really small blast radius and it

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
a really small blast radius and it
doesn't<00:01:12.090> do<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.479> damage<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:13.430> combustion

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
because like i said it's going to be

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.130 
because like i said it's going to be
like<00:02:34.939> a<00:02:35.000> no<00:02:35.239> land<00:02:35.569> beyond<00:02:35.810> and<00:02:36.019> they're

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
like a no land beyond and they're

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.020 
like a no land beyond and they're
probably<00:02:36.379> going<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:36.709> do<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:37.129> balancing<00:02:37.879> act

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
probably going to do a balancing act

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.610 
probably going to do a balancing act
like<00:02:38.329> they<00:02:38.450> did<00:02:38.659> with<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.930> vex<00:02:39.140> myth<00:02:39.349> class

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the point that a lot of people didn't

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.949 
the point that a lot of people didn't
want<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.609> use<00:02:49.790> it<00:02:49.819> too<00:02:50.209> much<00:02:50.239> they<00:02:50.599> returning

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
to other guns so they were like well

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.970 
to other guns so they were like well
this<00:02:53.000> was<00:02:53.209> supposed<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.659> be<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.810> shining<00:02:54.200> pillar

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
glass so let's make it a little bit

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.839 
glass so let's make it a little bit
better<00:02:59.870> we<00:03:00.169> took<00:03:00.409> it<00:03:00.530> down<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.859> little<00:03:01.250> too<00:03:01.609> much

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
better we took it down a little too much

better we took it down a little too much
but<00:03:02.319> let's<00:03:03.319> go<00:03:03.500> ahead<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.769> fix<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.220> by

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
but let's go ahead and fix that by

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
did a little bit of a balancing act with

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.800 
did a little bit of a balancing act with
nerfing<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.519> buffing<00:03:10.939> the<00:03:11.090> vex<00:03:11.299> math<00:03:11.540> class

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
nerfing and buffing the vex math class

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.300 
nerfing and buffing the vex math class
to<00:03:12.049> go<00:03:12.169> ahead<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.530> get<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:12.919> where<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.189> is

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
to go ahead and get it to where it is

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.159 
to go ahead and get it to where it is
now<00:03:13.639> where<00:03:14.150> it's<00:03:14.269> actually<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.780> pretty<00:03:15.079> decent

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.649 
the vex metaclass which is under the 331
I<00:03:42.859> believe<00:03:43.870> but<00:03:44.870> its<00:03:45.139> its<00:03:45.879> lackluster<00:03:46.879> simply

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
I believe but its its lackluster simply

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.649 
I believe but its its lackluster simply
because<00:03:47.930> there's<00:03:48.440> no<00:03:48.680> impact<00:03:49.099> so<00:03:49.819> you<00:03:50.329> can<00:03:50.510> go

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
because there's no impact so you can go

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.199 
because there's no impact so you can go
ahead<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.930> hit<00:03:51.229> people<00:03:51.470> with<00:03:51.680> shit<00:03:52.609> tons<00:03:52.940> of

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.270 
shoot it in the face I do 52 it's
literally<00:04:07.760> like<00:04:08.329> a<00:04:08.389> two<00:04:08.810> x<00:04:09.169> two<00:04:09.889> and<00:04:10.069> a<00:04:10.099> half

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:17.979 
unreal amounts of damage if you hit
criticals<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.849> problem<00:04:17.180> with<00:04:17.269> this<00:04:17.419> is<00:04:17.599> you

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
criticals the problem with this is you

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.990 
criticals the problem with this is you
have<00:04:18.199> to<00:04:18.380> consistently<00:04:18.859> hit<00:04:19.340> criticals<00:04:19.789> and

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
have to consistently hit criticals and

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.600 
have to consistently hit criticals and
it's<00:04:20.810> one<00:04:21.079> of<00:04:21.169> those<00:04:21.259> guns<00:04:21.560> where<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:22.010> recoil

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
it's one of those guns where the recoil

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.399 
it's one of those guns where the recoil
is<00:04:22.760> really<00:04:23.210> controllable<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:24.229> can

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
is really controllable you can

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.110 
is really controllable you can
definitely<00:04:24.680> hit<00:04:25.099> critical<00:04:25.340> as<00:04:25.639> but<00:04:25.880> when<00:04:26.029> you

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
definitely hit critical as but when you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.500 
definitely hit critical as but when you
getting<00:04:26.389> into<00:04:26.570> a<00:04:26.750> situation

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
getting into a situation

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.120 
getting into a situation
especially<00:04:27.870> against<00:04:28.080> fallen<00:04:28.560> or<00:04:28.680> anything

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
especially against fallen or anything

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.030 
especially against fallen or anything
that's<00:04:29.580> moving<00:04:29.910> it's<00:04:30.360> not<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.590> best<00:04:31.800> gun

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
that's moving it's not the best gun

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.800 
that's moving it's not the best gun
because<00:04:32.310> hidden<00:04:32.790> crits<00:04:33.060> on<00:04:33.240> something<00:04:33.630> that's

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
because hidden crits on something that's

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.190 
because hidden crits on something that's
moving<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.260> not<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.680> easiest<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:36.090> that's<00:04:37.020> my

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
moving is not the easiest so that's my

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.850 
moving is not the easiest so that's my
review<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.920> my<00:04:38.640> little<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.150> guess<00:04:39.210> rant<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:39.990> the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
review and my little I guess rant on the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.530 
review and my little I guess rant on the
necro<00:04:41.310> chasm<00:04:41.640> it's<00:04:41.760> definitely<00:04:42.150> something<00:04:42.360> i

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
necro chasm it's definitely something i

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.880 
necro chasm it's definitely something i
would<00:04:42.630> recommend<00:04:43.050> picking<00:04:43.200> up<00:04:43.500> if<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.770> have

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
would recommend picking up if you have

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.030 
would recommend picking up if you have
the<00:04:44.040> opportunity<00:04:44.070> i<00:04:44.910> like<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.930> gun<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.380> just

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
the opportunity i like the gun I just

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.620 
the opportunity i like the gun I just
can't<00:04:47.340> wait<00:04:47.430> for<00:04:47.610> bungee<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.210> go<00:04:48.330> ahead<00:04:48.480> and

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
can't wait for bungee to go ahead and

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.970 
can't wait for bungee to go ahead and
fix<00:04:48.810> it<00:04:48.900> because<00:04:49.020> more<00:04:49.380> than<00:04:49.410> likely<00:04:49.560> they'll

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
fix it because more than likely they'll

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.500 
fix it because more than likely they'll
add<00:04:50.100> something<00:04:50.490> they'll<00:04:50.850> boost<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.270> crit

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
add something they'll boost the crit

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.030 
add something they'll boost the crit

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
modifier if um they feel that's too low
