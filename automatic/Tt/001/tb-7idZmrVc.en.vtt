00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.920
 My name is James Dierke 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.420
 and I am the director of the 'Visitation Valley' high school 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.929
 when I arrived in this school thirteen years ago 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.950
 she had the highest absenteeism 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.529
 the highest percentage of suspensions 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.600
 the highest turnover of teachers the lowest academic performance 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.840
 we had the 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.100
 second highest crime rate in San Francisco 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.510
 and about eighty-five percent of the children were from poor families 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.220
 children could not play outside 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.610
 they didn't go anywhere on the weekend. they were prisoners 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.000
 of their environment 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.000
 I had heard about transcendental meditation at the start of my career 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.710
 as a special educator I had seen how it worked 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.280
 on a personal basis 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.500
 TM is a simple technique with proven effects on stress health and well-being 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.080
 when I first started telling the education department 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.200
 they looked a little weird and said "really?" 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.240
 I said we really had nothing to lose by trying this 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.670
 we tried everything we could and spent a lot of money 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.729
 to all those different programs 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.690
 that would have an effect on student performance 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.160
 I said that I would have the support of the parents and my teachers 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.440
 and 99% voted in favor of doing it 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.500
 let's see if it works 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 class are you ready? the silence time starts now 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.500
 Director Dierke and his staff learned meditation 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.500
 They implemented the "Quiet Time" program in the 1st and 2nd year of secondary education 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.869
 The students meditated 15 minutes twice a day 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.970
 the idea that kids 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.200
 Having a little time out of all impressions allows them to do everything 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.130
 from their frontal brains. the brain is much calmer 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.739
 this way you are able to absorb much more 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.900
 those fifteen to twenty minutes in the morning and in the evening 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.209
 is enough to make a difference 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.609
 when you actually have a class of forty minutes 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.209
 it is quieter and better concentration 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.690
 and enjoy learning 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.870
 if you live in difficult neighborhoods with gunshots and 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.100
 things happen everywhere around you and you feel like you have no control anywhere 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.920
 about it 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.400
 students are calmer and more attentive 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.590
 because we effectively tackle stress 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.329
 when you meditate 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.200
 keep calm and all your problems disappear 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.500
 I can keep my attention better 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.730
 it feels like the person inside 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.840
 actually comes out 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.200
 and shows itself 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 the result of their experiment was amazing 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.900
 The classes that participated had fewer suspensions, more attendance and better exam results 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.030
 a little less than a year later 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.730
 I went back to the school and walked around and you could see 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.760
 that the tone had changed, people no longer shouted at each other 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.760
 just have the feeling of silence in schools 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.900
 the i think most teachers and educators i talk to about it 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.900
 silence time program 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.000
 to be jealous. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.099
 I show them the results, and they sit there and say "wow" 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.409
 The problem is that we let our personal prejudices stand in the way of 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.189
 what really works 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:11.500
 I always say that I don't care what they think and that they don't have to 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.439
 decide what I think 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.100
 where it comes are the data 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.180
 Visitation Valley went from the school with the highest suspensions to the lowest 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.019
 that is not an opinion but a fact 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.700
 and when you start watching the program from that point of view 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.700
 then it attracts attention 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.820
 it was a pleasant surprise 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.950
 that it did not require a major effort, or a major change 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.610
 to enter it into the daily routine 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.630
 we didn't have to build bridges 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.080
 or doing the impossible 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.300
 After the success of Visitation valley, 3 other schools started the program 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.490
 well, let's start with the silence time 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.960
 silence time is what high school has transformed 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.960
 in my first three years 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.260
 in the school 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.030
 we had the second or third highest number of suspensions in San Francisco 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.610
 but a year and a half after we had entered the silence time 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.240
 was the number of suspensions 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:26.240
 to the point 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.000
 Teaching at this type of school is not just teaching, you are also a therapist, you are a friend 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.250
 you are a mentor, you are a counselor, you are all those things together 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.009
 that is why we ourselves have to deal with a lot of stress 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:42.080
 in the first two years I lost nineteen of the 36 teachers 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.800
 which was half the staff 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.160
 meditation has unbelievably helped me to cope with all those problems and stay focused 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.650
 and have enough energy to get through the day 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.349
 since we started quietly, il have only lost teachers who have retired 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.520
 or got a promotion 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.419
 you don't lose time, you use your time in a more productive way 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.700
 even if you have less time for the actual instructions 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.409
 get a better result 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:14.110
 because the students are better prepared and have a greater willingness to learn 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.650
 I would not want a teacher to say 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.620
 that he just has to take care of the silence time 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.020
 I think it is one of many tools 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.280
 that a director or teacher can use in the school 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.259
 you have to invest money, time and people 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:39.560
 to make this work, but the results are huge 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.770
 you feel more relaxed, more productive, you can concentrate better 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.620
 you feel that you could do anything
