00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
been really busy so okay let's start by

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.710 
been really busy so okay let's start by
taking<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:23.670> square<00:00:23.939> sheet<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.210> paper<00:00:24.420> as

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
taking the square sheet of paper as

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.290 
taking the square sheet of paper as
usual<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.500> we're<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.369> going<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.609> fold<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.119> in

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
usual and we're just going to fold it in

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.299 
usual and we're just going to fold it in
half<00:00:27.619> like<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:32.960> then<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.680> need<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.010> take

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
half like this and then you need to take

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.030 
half like this and then you need to take
the<00:00:35.520> sides<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.090> fold<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.860> to<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> top<00:00:41.780> and

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
the sides and fold them to the top and

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.000 
the sides and fold them to the top and
you<00:00:44.040> need<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.460> try<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:45.719> your<00:00:45.989> creases<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.829> be

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you need to try all your creases to be

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.369 
you need to try all your creases to be
very<00:00:47.489> even<00:00:49.550> then<00:00:50.550> turn<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.059> over<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.750> repeat

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
very even then turn it over and repeat

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:06.459 
very even then turn it over and repeat
on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> other<00:00:53.280> side

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.349 

so<00:01:07.469> you'll<00:01:08.039> end<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.549> something<00:01:09.210> like

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:09.359 
so you'll end up with something like

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:14.510 
so you'll end up with something like
that<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:10.310> then<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.609> just<00:01:11.969> need<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:13.350> take<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that and then you just need to take this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:26.209 
that and then you just need to take this
flap<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.149> fold<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:16.020> downwards<00:01:16.439> like<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:25.219> and

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
flap and fold it downwards like this and

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.719 
flap and fold it downwards like this and
then<00:01:26.520> take<00:01:26.789> the<00:01:27.329> side<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.899> the<00:01:28.049> model<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.729> fold

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
then take the side of the model and fold

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.389 
then take the side of the model and fold
it<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.179> way<00:01:30.329> down<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.859> need<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.189> use

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
it all the way down and you need to use

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.080 
it all the way down and you need to use
this<00:01:33.149> line<00:01:33.479> please<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.590> mate<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:35.100> your<00:01:35.670> fault

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this line please the mate as your fault

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.859 
this line please the mate as your fault
line<00:01:38.000> and<00:01:39.590> if<00:01:40.590> you've<00:01:40.799> done<00:01:41.069> it<00:01:41.220> correctly<00:01:41.869> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
line and if you've done it correctly the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.529 
line and if you've done it correctly the
angle<00:01:43.560> between<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.250> flaps<00:01:44.520> would<00:01:44.849> be<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> 90

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
angle between the flaps would be a 90

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.620 
angle between the flaps would be a 90
degrees<00:01:46.429> okay<00:01:47.429> so<00:01:47.489> now<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.060> need<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.450> unfold

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
degrees okay so now you need to unfold

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.979 
degrees okay so now you need to unfold
everything<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.599> look<00:01:51.599> at<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.929> model<00:01:53.539> so<00:01:54.539> you

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:54.989 
everything and look at your model so you

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.630 
everything and look at your model so you
can<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.739> that<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.849> the<00:01:56.939> folds<00:01:57.299> is

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
can see that one of the folds is

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.589 
can see that one of the folds is
downwards<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.500> another<00:02:01.500> fold<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.099> upwards<00:02:02.759> so

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:03.599 
downwards and another fold is upwards so

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:10.390 
downwards and another fold is upwards so
you<00:02:03.659> need<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:05.929> reverse<00:02:06.929> the<00:02:07.379> fold<00:02:07.709> so<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> just

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
you need to reverse the fold so you just

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.349 
you need to reverse the fold so you just
start<00:02:11.400> folding<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:13.250> in<00:02:14.250> Reverse<00:02:14.670> like<00:02:15.120> this

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:15.359 
start folding it in Reverse like this

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.759 
start folding it in Reverse like this
and<00:02:15.920> also<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.340> center<00:02:17.880> should<00:02:18.389> be<00:02:18.450> an<00:02:19.290> output

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
and also the center should be an output

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.759 
and also the center should be an output
volt<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.420> pinch<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.139> the<00:02:22.260> center

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
volt so you just pinch to the center

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.020 
volt so you just pinch to the center
like<00:02:23.549> this<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:25.010> at<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.160> same<00:02:26.340> time

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
like this and at the same time

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.530 
like this and at the same time
fold<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.769> for<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:29.010> way<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.950> should<00:02:32.250> end<00:02:32.579> up

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
fold it for this way so it should end up

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.599 
fold it for this way so it should end up
like<00:02:34.169> this<00:02:34.579> let<00:02:35.579> me<00:02:35.669> show<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.880> again

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
like this let me show you again

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:45.140 
like this let me show you again
basically<00:02:39.049> we<00:02:40.049> need<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:41.090> take<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.239> pot<00:02:42.540> and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
basically we need to take this pot and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.280 
basically we need to take this pot and
to<00:02:46.110> reverse<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.829> fold<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.629> it's<00:02:48.629> a<00:02:48.930> down

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
to reverse this fold that it's a down

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.089 
to reverse this fold that it's a down
fold<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.400> changes<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:51.060> an<00:02:51.299> out<00:02:51.569> fold<00:02:52.970> and

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
fold the changes to an out fold and

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.449 
fold the changes to an out fold and
these<00:02:56.099> folds<00:02:56.610> should<00:02:56.790> be<00:02:57.209> down<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:58.280> hope<00:02:59.280> this

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
these folds should be down I hope this

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.380 
these folds should be down I hope this
makes<00:02:59.640> sense<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:03.269> now<00:03:03.720> you're<00:03:04.109> almost<00:03:04.409> done

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
makes sense so now you're almost done

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.789 
makes sense so now you're almost done
and<00:03:07.220> you<00:03:08.220> need<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.790> fold<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.629> neck<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.319> your

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
and you need to fold the neck of your

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.289 
and you need to fold the neck of your
dog<00:03:12.140> basically<00:03:13.140> take<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:14.069> top<00:03:14.370> triangle

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
dog basically take the top triangle

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.009 
dog basically take the top triangle
lettuce<00:03:16.049> longer<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.790> fold<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.209> the

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
lettuce longer and fold it so that the

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.229 
lettuce longer and fold it so that the
edge<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.290> parallel<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.659> dog's<00:03:21.659> tail<00:03:22.260> and

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
edge is parallel to the dog's tail and

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.940 
edge is parallel to the dog's tail and
you<00:03:24.239> also<00:03:24.420> need<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.959> leave<00:03:25.139> a<00:03:25.260> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.590> of

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
you also need to leave a little bit of

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:38.149 
you also need to leave a little bit of
neck<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.750> unfold<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:37.560> fold<00:03:37.920> it

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
neck then unfold it and fold it

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:46.849 
neck then unfold it and fold it
backwards<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:42.680> then<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:44.189> need<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.790> open<00:03:45.859> the

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
backwards and then you need to open the

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.759 
backwards and then you need to open the
model<00:03:47.250> slightly<00:03:47.489> and<00:03:48.230> you<00:03:49.230> need<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.530> do<00:03:49.650> the

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
model slightly and you need to do the

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.839 
model slightly and you need to do the
same<00:03:49.980> thing<00:03:50.280> as<00:03:50.519> you<00:03:51.150> did<00:03:51.329> in<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.720> beginning

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
same thing as you did in the beginning

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.659 
same thing as you did in the beginning
basically<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:54.569> need<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:55.049> reverse<00:03:55.440> this<00:03:55.889> piece

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
basically you need to reverse this piece

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:01.539 
basically you need to reverse this piece
and<00:03:56.940> these<00:03:57.180> folds<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.370> also<00:03:59.370> pinch<00:04:00.500> this

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
and these folds and also pinch this

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.550 
and these folds and also pinch this
zigzag<00:04:02.549> line<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:05.040> you<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.639> start<00:04:05.940> by<00:04:06.150> pushing

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
zigzag line so you can start by pushing

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.290 
zigzag line so you can start by pushing
these<00:04:07.560> flaps

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:26.320 

and<00:04:14.300> then<00:04:14.600> pinch<00:04:15.080> these<00:04:17.470> lines<00:04:23.860> and<00:04:25.060> then<00:04:26.060> just

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
and then pinch these lines and then just

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.060 
and then pinch these lines and then just
pinch<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.990> center<00:04:27.200> and<00:04:27.790> then<00:04:29.200> just<00:04:30.200> fold<00:04:30.590> it

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
pinch the center and then just fold it

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.010 
pinch the center and then just fold it
like<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:34.280> then<00:04:34.850> we<00:04:35.210> are<00:04:35.570> going<00:04:36.020> to<00:04:36.500> fold

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
like this and then we are going to fold

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:46.180 
like this and then we are going to fold
this<00:04:39.160> end<00:04:41.620> to<00:04:42.620> that<00:04:42.650> point<00:04:44.470> and<00:04:45.470> then<00:04:45.800> fold<00:04:46.070> it

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
this end to that point and then fold it

00:04:46.190 --> 00:05:01.360 
this end to that point and then fold it
back<00:04:46.460> like<00:04:48.700> this<00:04:57.430> open<00:04:58.430> up<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:58.610> head<00:04:59.030> and<00:05:00.370> just

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
back like this open up the head and just

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:07.390 
back like this open up the head and just
fold<00:05:01.730> it<00:05:01.940> like<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:03.130> and<00:05:04.870> then<00:05:05.870> out<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:07.220> it

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
fold it like this and then out so it

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.600 
fold it like this and then out so it
should<00:05:07.580> look<00:05:07.760> like<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:08.360> from<00:05:08.600> both<00:05:08.870> sides

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.670 

basically<00:05:13.610> you're<00:05:14.030> first<00:05:14.420> folding<00:05:14.990> down<00:05:15.320> and

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
basically you're first folding down and

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.670 
basically you're first folding down and
then<00:05:16.040> up<00:05:16.280> and<00:05:17.020> then<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.290> should<00:05:18.500> look<00:05:18.620> like

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
then up and then it should look like

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.730 
then up and then it should look like
this<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:20.120> make<00:05:20.300> the<00:05:20.419> nose<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.810> the<00:05:20.900> dog<00:05:21.050> just

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
this to make the nose of the dog just

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.730 
this to make the nose of the dog just
fold<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.430> little<00:05:22.880> triangle<00:05:23.810> here

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.570 

then<00:05:27.740> open<00:05:27.980> the<00:05:28.610> head<00:05:28.790> again<00:05:29.120> and<00:05:29.890> just<00:05:30.890> fold

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
then open the head again and just fold

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.899 
then open the head again and just fold
it<00:05:31.760> upwards

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:42.409 

and<00:05:38.909> it<00:05:39.090> should<00:05:39.300> look<00:05:39.449> like<00:05:39.509> this<00:05:39.870> and<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:42.270> make

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
and it should look like this and to make

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:50.719 
and it should look like this and to make
a<00:05:42.479> tail<00:05:43.129> you<00:05:44.129> just<00:05:44.370> fold<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:49.129> like<00:05:50.129> this<00:05:50.190> and

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
a tail you just fold it like this and

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.920 
a tail you just fold it like this and
then<00:05:51.240> outwards<00:05:52.550> and<00:05:53.550> then<00:05:54.120> repeat<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.629> same

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
then outwards and then repeat the same

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.909 
then outwards and then repeat the same
step<00:05:55.259> you've<00:05:55.680> done<00:05:55.979> to<00:05:56.340> make<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.759> head<00:05:57.919> open

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
step you've done to make the head open

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.930 
step you've done to make the head open
it<00:05:59.009> up<00:05:59.330> hold<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.479> down<00:06:01.280> but<00:06:02.280> you<00:06:02.310> don't<00:06:02.460> need<00:06:02.879> to

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
it up hold it down but you don't need to

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.969 
it up hold it down but you don't need to
make<00:06:03.210> me<00:06:03.270> fault<00:06:03.720> you<00:06:03.960> just<00:06:04.199> folding<00:06:04.560> over<00:06:04.710> the

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
make me fault you just folding over the

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.629 
make me fault you just folding over the
old<00:06:05.159> pieces<00:06:06.349> pull<00:06:07.349> it<00:06:07.469> down<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.949> then<00:06:08.099> up<00:06:08.340> and

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
old pieces pull it down and then up and

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:12.649 
old pieces pull it down and then up and
then<00:06:09.449> you<00:06:09.539> have<00:06:09.690> something<00:06:09.990> like<00:06:10.020> this<00:06:11.659> and

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
then you have something like this and

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:16.279 
then you have something like this and
then<00:06:13.020> you<00:06:13.889> need<00:06:14.069> to<00:06:14.099> hold<00:06:14.520> your<00:06:14.759> dog<00:06:15.000> at<00:06:15.300> its

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
then you need to hold your dog at its

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.730 
then you need to hold your dog at its
legs<00:06:16.590> and<00:06:16.889> by<00:06:17.789> pulling<00:06:18.060> you<00:06:18.870> make<00:06:19.229> its<00:06:19.469> head

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:19.740 
legs and by pulling you make its head

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.749 
legs and by pulling you make its head
back<00:06:20.960> so<00:06:21.960> it<00:06:22.289> looks<00:06:22.590> something<00:06:22.800> like<00:06:22.979> this<00:06:25.759> so

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
back so it looks something like this so

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:30.529 
back so it looks something like this so
that's<00:06:27.030> it<00:06:27.360> I<00:06:27.569> hope<00:06:27.870> that<00:06:28.289> was<00:06:28.500> helpful<00:06:28.530> and<00:06:29.539> if

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
that's it I hope that was helpful and if

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:32.209 
that's it I hope that was helpful and if
you<00:06:30.659> have<00:06:30.870> any<00:06:31.020> questions<00:06:31.500> you<00:06:31.650> can<00:06:31.680> ask<00:06:31.919> me<00:06:32.190> in

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:32.219 
you have any questions you can ask me in

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:34.369 
you have any questions you can ask me in
the<00:06:32.370> comments<00:06:32.699> below<00:06:32.750> but<00:06:33.750> I<00:06:33.930> think<00:06:34.259> it's

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
the comments below but I think it's

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.629 
the comments below but I think it's
pretty<00:06:34.590> easy<00:06:34.919> model<00:06:35.629> and
