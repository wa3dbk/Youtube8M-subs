pretty frustrating i think in the long
run<00:01:21.440> especially<00:01:22.440> in<00:01:22.890> some<00:01:23.069> of<00:01:23.099> the<00:01:23.250> later

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
run especially in some of the later

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:55.300 
run especially in some of the later
levels

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.040 

it's<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.370> pretty<00:01:56.580> annoying<00:01:56.850> job<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.330> be<00:01:57.450> honest

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050

boss<00:02:49.069> I<00:02:49.310> think<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.670> got<00:02:49.910> very<00:02:50.390> lucky<00:02:50.660> at<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
boss I think I got very lucky at the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.520 
boss I think I got very lucky at the
first<00:02:51.830> attempt<00:02:53.620> and<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.830> is<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:54.980> Jerry

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
first attempt and this is just Jerry

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.380 

but<00:02:58.530> anyway<00:02:58.829> I<00:02:58.920> noticed<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.459> especially

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
but anyway I noticed that especially

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.209 
but anyway I noticed that especially
with<00:03:00.510> gaming<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.109> my<00:03:01.260> first<00:03:01.530> attempt<00:03:02.069> is

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
with gaming that my first attempt is

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.440 
with gaming that my first attempt is
always<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.730> best<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.269> then<00:03:03.439> there<00:03:04.439> come<00:03:04.709> a

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
always the best and then there come a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.619 
always the best and then there come a
very<00:03:06.450> poor<00:03:06.989> attempt<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:08.060> recreate<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.329> first

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
very poor attempt to recreate that first

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.280 
very poor attempt to recreate that first
attempt<00:03:10.430> until<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.459> actually<00:03:12.049> finish<00:03:13.049> whatever

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
attempt until I actually finish whatever

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.179 
attempt until I actually finish whatever
challenge<00:03:13.889> it<00:03:13.980> is<00:03:15.349> somehow<00:03:16.349> just<00:03:16.739> going<00:03:17.069> in

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
challenge it is somehow just going in

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.220

as<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.250> sounds<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.879> noticed<00:03:33.419> it's<00:03:33.989> a

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
as that sounds I noticed it's a

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.909 
as that sounds I noticed it's a
recurring<00:03:34.439> theme<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> let's<00:03:36.989> see<00:03:37.139> how<00:03:37.169> I<00:03:37.290> go<00:03:37.859> to

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
recurring theme so let's see how I go to

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:50.910 
recurring theme so let's see how I go to
four<00:03:38.370> against<00:03:38.879> this<00:03:38.970> boss<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:40.049> time<00:03:40.349> around

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.940 

he's<00:03:51.430> going

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.720 

no<00:03:58.950> ID<00:03:59.129> one<00:03:59.400> misstep

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.699 

I<00:04:03.790> got<00:04:04.510> three<00:04:04.750> balls<00:04:04.989> at<00:04:05.140> least<00:04:05.319> I<00:04:05.440> got<00:04:05.560> the

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
I got three balls at least I got the

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:32.850 
I got three balls at least I got the
last<00:04:05.920> bowls<00:04:06.250> on<00:04:06.489> this<00:04:06.670> one's<00:04:06.909> riding<00:04:07.330> out

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.250 

it's<00:04:33.860> awful

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
it's awful

00:04:36.260 --> 00:05:07.230 
it's awful
a<00:04:36.320> little<00:04:36.980> bit<00:04:37.130> discombobulated

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.900 

it's<00:05:07.810> very<00:05:07.990> hard<00:05:08.319> to<00:05:08.410> see<00:05:08.680> here<00:05:08.919> he<00:05:09.550> is<00:05:09.699> one

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
it's very hard to see here he is one

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:24.010 
it's very hard to see here he is one
ball<00:05:10.199> left<00:05:11.199> on<00:05:11.470> his<00:05:11.590> body

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.320 

and<00:05:25.020> there<00:05:25.349> we<00:05:25.439> have<00:05:25.470> it

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
and there we have it

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.170 
and there we have it
I<00:05:28.099> do<00:05:29.099> think<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.490> it's<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:29.879> end<00:05:30.030> of<00:05:30.120> the

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
I do think that it's the end of the

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:36.309 
I do think that it's the end of the
battle<00:05:30.419> but<00:05:30.629> I'm<00:05:30.780> not<00:05:30.960> sure<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.289> course

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.350 

definitely<00:05:37.319> Mario<00:05:37.740> Mario<00:05:38.280> laws<00:05:38.699> always<00:05:39.180> had

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
definitely Mario Mario laws always had

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.689 
definitely Mario Mario laws always had
some<00:05:39.599> but<00:05:40.050> something<00:05:40.680> three<00:05:40.949> times<00:05:40.979> or<00:05:41.490> six

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
some but something three times or six

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:50.450 
some but something three times or six
times<00:05:41.789> so<00:05:42.479> is<00:05:42.629> the<00:05:42.719> power<00:05:42.960> of<00:05:43.050> three<00:05:49.460> not

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
times so is the power of three not

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.100 
times so is the power of three not
playing<00:05:50.729> this<00:05:50.879> game<00:05:50.969> for<00:05:51.120> over<00:05:51.330> two<00:05:51.569> years<00:05:51.780> I
