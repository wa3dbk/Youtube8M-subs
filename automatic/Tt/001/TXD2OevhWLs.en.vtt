00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
but if you let's look at the eye sees so

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.970 
but if you let's look at the eye sees so
many<00:02:21.670> eye<00:02:21.790> sees<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.269> choose<00:02:22.450> from<00:02:22.920> open<00:02:23.920> the

not such a big deal on the handbrake
permit<00:03:42.500> yeah<00:03:42.620> but<00:03:43.310> if<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.550> model<00:03:44.180> would

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
permit yeah but if the model would

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.260 
permit yeah but if the model would
actually<00:03:44.630> you<00:03:44.960> know<00:03:44.990> make<00:03:46.060> this<00:03:47.060> thing<00:03:47.210> work

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
actually you know make this thing work

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.000 
actually you know make this thing work
with<00:03:47.540> drive<00:03:47.750> controls<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.500> changed<00:03:48.950> the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
with drive controls you just changed the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.160 
with drive controls you just changed the
macro<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.459> see<00:03:49.850> used<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.180> write<00:03:50.450> control<00:03:50.780> like<00:03:51.050> I

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
macro I see used to write control like I

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.640 
macro I see used to write control like I
go<00:03:51.350> did<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.490> will<00:03:52.580> be<00:03:52.700> a<00:03:52.730> perfect<00:03:53.030> mod

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
go did and it will be a perfect mod

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.130 
go did and it will be a perfect mod
perfect<00:03:55.300> okay<00:03:56.300> that's<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.690> key<00:03:56.780> nearly<00:03:56.959> cup

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
perfect okay that's the key nearly cup

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.810 
perfect okay that's the key nearly cup
suspension<00:03:57.650> look<00:03:57.830> I<00:03:58.660> know<00:03:59.660> we<00:03:59.780> go<00:03:59.900> over<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.080> bump

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
suspension look I know we go over a bump

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.000 
suspension look I know we go over a bump
like<00:04:01.820> that<00:04:02.410> yeah<00:04:03.410> if<00:04:03.620> you<00:04:03.709> had<00:04:03.860> to<00:04:05.800> if<00:04:06.800> it<00:04:06.980> was

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
like that yeah if you had to if it was

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.920 
like that yeah if you had to if it was
driving<00:04:07.730> follow<00:04:07.910> me<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> perfect<00:04:08.510> marker<00:04:08.810> then

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
driving follow me a perfect marker then

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.900 
driving follow me a perfect marker then
you<00:04:08.990> can<00:04:09.110> actually<00:04:09.310> no<00:04:10.310> use<00:04:10.459> all<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.670> forward

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
you can actually no use all the forward

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.710 
you can actually no use all the forward

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:48.460 

cool<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:39.080> beacons<00:04:39.470> to<00:04:40.540> hook<00:04:41.540> up<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.750> trailer<00:04:47.470> it

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
cool the beacons to hook up a trailer it

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.870 
cool the beacons to hook up a trailer it
does<00:04:48.650> seem<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.890> break<00:04:49.070> a<00:04:49.100> lot<00:04:49.280> faster<00:04:49.670> than<00:04:49.700> it

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
does seem to break a lot faster than it

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.130 
does seem to break a lot faster than it
should<00:04:50.030> as<00:04:50.150> well<00:04:50.270> it's<00:04:50.480> like<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:50.900> know<00:04:50.990> it's

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
should as well it's like you know it's

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.390 
should as well it's like you know it's
all<00:04:51.230> like<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.470> brakes<00:04:51.680> are<00:04:51.830> sticking<00:04:52.160> all<00:04:52.310> the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
all like the brakes are sticking all the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.600 
all like the brakes are sticking all the
time

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.830 

so<00:04:58.610> what<00:04:58.850> trailers<00:04:59.180> do<00:04:59.270> we<00:04:59.390> actually<00:04:59.540> have

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
so what trailers do we actually have

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.760 
so what trailers do we actually have
then<00:05:00.430> we've<00:05:01.430> got<00:05:01.580> this<00:05:01.730> one<00:05:01.970> which<00:05:02.240> silage<00:05:03.200> and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
then we've got this one which silage and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.120 
then we've got this one which silage and
that<00:05:03.890> one<00:05:04.100> which<00:05:04.250> looks<00:05:04.490> like<00:05:04.700> silage<00:05:05.210> as<00:05:05.330> well

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
that one which looks like silage as well

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.310 
that one which looks like silage as well
that's<00:05:07.130> like<00:05:07.400> slurry<00:05:07.790> tanker<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:09.110> green

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
that's like slurry tanker and a green

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.100 
that's like slurry tanker and a green
trailer<00:05:10.150> let's<00:05:11.150> just<00:05:11.360> make<00:05:11.540> it<00:05:11.660> look<00:05:11.810> that's

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
trailer let's just make it look that's

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.630 
trailer let's just make it look that's
just<00:05:12.170> time<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.590> look<00:05:12.770> just<00:05:13.040> to<00:05:13.190> be<00:05:13.220> sure<00:05:13.310> I<00:05:13.490> have

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
just time to look just to be sure I have

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.620 
just time to look just to be sure I have
a<00:05:13.670> lot<00:05:13.790> of<00:05:13.820> stuff<00:05:14.200> so<00:05:15.200> slurry<00:05:15.620> tank<00:05:16.660> so<00:05:17.660> silage

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
a lot of stuff so slurry tank so silage

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.400 
a lot of stuff so slurry tank so silage
and<00:05:20.630> wood<00:05:20.840> chip<00:05:21.520> that's<00:05:22.520> everything<00:05:23.360> on<00:05:24.350> that

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
and wood chip that's everything on that

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.630 
and wood chip that's everything on that
silage<00:05:25.330> slurry<00:05:26.330> yeah<00:05:30.250> that's<00:05:31.250> a<00:05:31.340> nice<00:05:31.430> big

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
silage slurry yeah that's a nice big

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.920 
silage slurry yeah that's a nice big
trail<00:05:31.850> away

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.159 

so<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:38.009> this<00:05:38.400> truck<00:05:38.790> is<00:05:39.030> a<00:05:39.720> 1<00:05:40.470> is<00:05:42.169> 370

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
so this this truck is a 1 is 370

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.680 
so this this truck is a 1 is 370
horsepower<00:05:43.290> is<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.830> bit<00:05:44.040> like<00:05:44.220> the<00:05:44.340> DAF<00:05:44.690> they

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
horsepower is a bit like the DAF they

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.950 
horsepower is a bit like the DAF they

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
set much like useful off-road if drive

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.520 
set much like useful off-road if drive
control<00:05:49.380> is<00:05:49.530> used<00:05:50.720> there<00:05:51.720> is<00:05:51.840> work<00:05:52.020> now<00:05:52.380> they

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
control is used there is work now they

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.029 
control is used there is work now they
do<00:05:52.590> not

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 
do not

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.499
