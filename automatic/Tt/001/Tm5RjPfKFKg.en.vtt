and maybe I'll get a more like fancier
fall<00:04:30.760> clothes<00:04:31.090> but<00:04:31.330> I<00:04:31.570> just<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.260> simple<00:04:32.470> and

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
fall clothes but I just like simple and

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.900 
fall clothes but I just like simple and
then<00:04:33.130> I<00:04:33.160> got<00:04:33.400> this<00:04:33.990> infinity<00:04:34.990> scarf<00:04:35.460> it's<00:04:36.460> I

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
then I got this infinity scarf it's I

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.970 
then I got this infinity scarf it's I
think<00:04:37.270> this<00:04:37.360> is<00:04:37.480> a<00:04:37.510> dog<00:04:37.870> on<00:04:38.200> it<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.560> can't<00:04:38.800> tell

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
think this is a dog on it I can't tell

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.590 
think this is a dog on it I can't tell
but<00:04:39.040> if<00:04:39.430> you<00:04:39.550> wear<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:39.850> you<00:04:40.060> can't<00:04:40.240> even<00:04:40.390> tell

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
but if you wear it you can't even tell

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.520 
but if you wear it you can't even tell
and<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.840> just<00:04:41.020> like<00:04:41.170> the<00:04:41.380> navy<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.250> white<00:04:42.280> so

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
and I just like the navy and white so

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.660 
and I just like the navy and white so
yeah<00:04:44.530> it<00:04:44.800> is<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.130> think<00:04:45.190> those<00:04:45.430> are<00:04:45.550> what<00:04:45.640> are

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
yeah it is I think those are what are

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:52.050 
yeah it is I think those are what are
called<00:04:46.000> ah<00:04:50.580> here<00:04:51.580> it<00:04:51.700> is

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
called ah here it is

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.420 
called ah here it is
so<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.570> think<00:04:52.660> infinity<00:04:53.350> scarves<00:04:53.650> and<00:04:54.010> scarves

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
so I think infinity scarves and scarves

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.970 
so I think infinity scarves and scarves
in<00:04:54.640> general<00:04:55.000> are<00:04:55.240> very<00:04:55.270> fall-like<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.290> I<00:04:56.530> had

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
in general are very fall-like so I had

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.340 
in general are very fall-like so I had
to<00:04:57.070> get<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.220> scarf<00:04:57.550> so<00:04:57.910> yeah<00:04:58.900> that's<00:04:59.200> everything

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
to get a scarf so yeah that's everything

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.710 
to get a scarf so yeah that's everything
I<00:04:59.800> got<00:05:00.010> like<00:05:00.220> I<00:05:00.340> said<00:05:00.550> I<00:05:00.580> am<00:05:00.730> so<00:05:01.120> simple<00:05:01.570> when<00:05:01.690> it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
I got like I said I am so simple when it

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.420 
I got like I said I am so simple when it
comes<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.110> my<00:05:02.200> clothes<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:02.680> maybe<00:05:03.070> I'll<00:05:03.280> go

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
comes to my clothes and maybe I'll go
