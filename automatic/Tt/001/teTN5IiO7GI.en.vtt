00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
guys the first ones pretty obvious you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.290 
guys the first ones pretty obvious you
go<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.949> here<00:00:29.220> next<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.640> blue<00:00:29.820> buff<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
go up here next to the blue buff and you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.500 
go up here next to the blue buff and you
can<00:00:31.050> clearly<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.949> sparrow<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:33.270> think

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
can clearly see a sparrow now think

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.799 
can clearly see a sparrow now think
about<00:00:33.630> this<00:00:33.930> Sparrow<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.520> Jack<00:00:36.300> Sparrow

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
about this Sparrow as in Jack Sparrow

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.860 
about this Sparrow as in Jack Sparrow
and<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.250> Jack<00:00:38.489> Sparrow<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:39.090> pirate<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
and what was Jack Sparrow a pirate I

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
and what was Jack Sparrow a pirate I
think<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> pretty<00:00:40.890> obvious<00:00:41.370> teaser

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
think this is a pretty obvious teaser

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.280 
think this is a pretty obvious teaser
for<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.030> new<00:00:42.239> gangplank<00:00:42.750> very<00:00:42.960> work<00:00:43.079> that's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
for the new gangplank very work that's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.459 
for the new gangplank very work that's
coming<00:00:43.559> out<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.539> yeah<00:00:45.539> pretty<00:00:45.719> obvious<00:00:46.200> so

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
coming out and yeah pretty obvious so

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.959 
coming out and yeah pretty obvious so
that's<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.039> quick<00:00:47.160> one<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.579> there

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
that's a really quick one right there

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.610 
that's a really quick one right there
but<00:00:48.120> now<00:00:48.210> go<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> little<00:00:48.600> bit<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.930> okay<00:00:49.260> check

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
but now go a little bit up okay check

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
but now go a little bit up okay check
this<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.950> out<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.430> stone<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> shape<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
this one out this stone as a shape on it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.139 
this one out this stone as a shape on it
that<00:00:52.289> clearly<00:00:52.649> resembles<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.520> fishing<00:00:53.910> hook

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that clearly resembles a fishing hook

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
that clearly resembles a fishing hook
now<00:00:54.870> what<00:00:55.050> champion<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.770> know<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:55.949> has

close<00:00:56.489> ties<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> fish<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:58.079> know<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> fish

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
close ties to fish you know a fish

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
close ties to fish you know a fish
champion<00:01:00.050> obviously<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> teaser<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
champion obviously it's a teaser for the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.260 
champion obviously it's a teaser for the
new<00:01:01.920> gangplank<00:01:02.399> rework<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.879> I've<00:01:02.969> heard<00:01:03.120> so

new gangplank rework that I've heard so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
new gangplank rework that I've heard so
much<00:01:03.390> about<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.229> he's<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
much about because you know he's a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.370 
much about because you know he's a
pirate<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:05.729> pirates<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:06.960> fish

pirate and then pirates have to go fish

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.780 
pirate and then pirates have to go fish
a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:07.890> they're<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> seas<00:01:08.490> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
a lot because they're on the seas and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.330 
a lot because they're on the seas and
they<00:01:09.299> eat<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> lot<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.600> fish<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.290> yeah<00:01:10.500> once

they eat a lot of fish so yeah once
again<00:01:11.460> pretty<00:01:11.970> obvious<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:13.140> one's

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
again pretty obvious now this one's

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.630 
again pretty obvious now this one's
pretty<00:01:13.500> cool<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> little<00:01:14.159> bit<00:01:14.280> harder<00:01:14.460> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
pretty cool and a little bit harder to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.700 
pretty cool and a little bit harder to
spot<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> other<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
spot in the other two if you go to the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.740 
spot in the other two if you go to the
Raptors<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> blue<00:01:17.549> side<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.119> will<00:01:18.240> see<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
Raptors on the blue side you will see a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.890 
Raptors on the blue side you will see a
little<00:01:19.380> nest<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.070> inside<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> helmet

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
little nest and inside there is a helmet

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.640 
little nest and inside there is a helmet
aware<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:23.040> which<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:23.790> deceased<00:01:24.650> now

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
aware of which is probably deceased now

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.620 
aware of which is probably deceased now
this<00:01:25.830> helmet<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.310> guarded<00:01:26.640> by<00:01:26.670> oh<00:01:27.090> look<00:01:27.509> at

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
this helmet is guarded by oh look at

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.740 
this helmet is guarded by oh look at
that<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.229> crimson<00:01:28.710> Raptors<00:01:29.159> now<00:01:30.090> crimson<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
that the crimson Raptors now crimson is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.300 
that the crimson Raptors now crimson is
a<00:01:30.780> type<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> red<00:01:31.409> now<00:01:31.799> who<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.280> that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
a type of red now who do we know that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
a type of red now who do we know that
wears<00:01:32.610> red<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.420> helmet<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.020> one<00:01:34.380> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
wears red and a helmet like this one I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
wears red and a helmet like this one I
think<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.729> pretty<00:01:35.880> obvious<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.600> this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
think it's pretty obvious that this

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.840

anyone<00:05:59.279> buy<00:05:59.550> this<00:05:59.789> before<00:06:00.240> I<00:06:00.270> don't<00:06:00.689> I've

anyone buy this before I don't I've
never<00:06:01.110> bought<00:06:01.319> it<00:06:01.500> so<00:06:01.740> I<00:06:01.770> think<00:06:01.979> they<00:06:02.370> probably

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
never bought it so I think they probably

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.480 
never bought it so I think they probably
just<00:06:02.789> added<00:06:03.419> it<00:06:03.539> recently<00:06:03.949> but<00:06:04.949> regardless<00:06:05.310> I

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
just added it recently but regardless I

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.550 
just added it recently but regardless I
think<00:06:05.520> it's<00:06:05.759> a<00:06:05.819> pretty<00:06:06.000> obvious<00:06:06.449> teaser<00:06:06.870> for

think it's a pretty obvious teaser for
the<00:06:07.620> upcoming<00:06:08.189> gangplank<00:06:08.639> rework<00:06:08.909> that<00:06:09.089> I've
