00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.220
 Greetings to all I know that none of you knows me so I 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.050
 I will present 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.949
 My name is the Skull Knight and I am here to replace Astor 10 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.100
 x which is still in examination periods because they played a 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.910
 bad luck hahaha xd 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.180
 but do not worry that he will return for the next video 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.580
 well, today's video will focus on football bars 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.870
 which I think are becoming the cancer of it 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.330
 due to the amount of problems and fights that most of the time 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.100
 they cause 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.850
 well let's get started 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.990
 football is surely the sport that most fans have in the world 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.190
 which all kinds of people attend 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.100
 be poor 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.960
 well-off or rich, hence they say that it has no social distinction 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.300
 in the last decades it has been degenerating in the sense that the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.660
 violence has taken the stadiums 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.940
 but we must bear in mind that the violence was accompanied by a 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.450
 phenomenon that football was taken around the world 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.870
 this is the one of the brave bars 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.050
 the term barrabrava is used to designate those organized groups 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.220
 inside a fan that are characterized by producing various 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.710
 violent incidents 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.780
 inside and outside the stadium pyrotechnic display and chants employees 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.130
 during the development of matches 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.220
 generally the brave bars 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.320
 also called the bulk of the fans 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.790
 they use flags called rags and different musical instruments 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.060
 The white bars are also characterized by being located in the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.320
 popular tribunes 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.220
 those that frequently lack seats and where spectators must 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.690
 watch the match standing 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.470
 among the first records of brave bars can be named the tan 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.250
 recognized her we got name that comes from the family name 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.820
 english 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.710
 place where this splendid sport was born 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.729
 but that against him is against his true fans 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.270
 the latter are recognized for the atrocities they have committed when 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.100
 play your England selection 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.069
 different from the behavior they experience when a match is played 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.249
 of the English league 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.909
 in which all live in peace and even the stadiums have minimal 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.179
 security between court and grandstands 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:19.129
 perhaps the most remembered tragedy caused by the so-called fled 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.629
 be that of May 29, 1985 at the stadium of heysel of brussels 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.120
 in Belgium 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.519
 in which 39 fans died 34 Italian fans of the juventus fc 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.599
 two belgians 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.739
 two French and one British because of an avalanche of fans in the 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.549
 prolegomena of the final of the European Cup of football between Liverpool and 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:40.839
 the juventus 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.139
 the events caused 39 dead and 600 wounded 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.229
 but this movement is not exclusive to england or in europe this has happened 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.339
 the phenomenon of the bars also extended to many countries 

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:53.779
 Latin Americans 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.819
 among those who stand out 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:56.629
 for example 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.779
 In Argentina this phenomenon has claimed 227 fatal victims and a large 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.069
 number of injured 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.370
 although in argentina 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.519
 the phenomenon of the brave bars is considered dangerous as a whole 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.480
 according to the security organizations the most dangerous bars in the country are the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.349
 from river plate 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.269
 mouth juniors 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.139
 Central rosary and newell's old boys 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.019
 In uruguay 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.959
 deaths related to violence in football 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.569
 sum to 8 from 1957 to date 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.879
 in Uruguay and this phenomenon that almost simultaneously happens in Argentina 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.400
 the first brave bar called the cava 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.659
 it arose in peÃ±arol 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:37.329
 in the early 1960s and has been characterized by starring 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.429
 numerous acts of violence 

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:41.150
 in response to this group 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.150
 in the mid-1970s the park band was born 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.129
 the national bar of Montevideo which does not register the same level of 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:50.709
 unrest 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.209
 in chile for example 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.340
 These groups make their public appearance at the end of 1988 on the occasion of 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.180
 a match between colo colo and the university of chile 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.890
 which ended with serious incidents featuring the white claw 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.120
 whereas in 1989 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.829
 A group of fans from the University of Chile create the bar those below 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.719
 and in 1992 a group of fans of the catholic university founded the bar 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.239
 Crusaders 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.989
 in Colombia the phenomenon began by imitating the Argentine model 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.460
 the early 1990s from the rivalry between club supporters 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.490
 from Medellin 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.780
 cali and bogota extending then to other places of the country 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:31.770
 in Brazil 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.490
 by the influence of River Plate soccer they began to organize 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.630
 Argentine-style brave bars from 2001 onwards 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.240
 dissociating from the traditional crooked organized 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.770
 the first Brazilian rods emerged in 2001 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.490
 being the first to geraldo ate of the guild and the popular guard of the inter 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.970
 but the phenomenon did not stop there but spread to countries of America 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.849
 central and north 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.509
 as in Costa Rica they were born by the influence exerted by some 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.429
 barristas of the sides barrabrava of the catholic university of chile 

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:06.749
 formed the saprissa fans during the final of the cup final 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.819
 inter-American 1994 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:13.830
 while in Mexico the phenomenon dates from 1994 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.020
 when the pachuca created the ultra tuza 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.590
 the first bar with a South American format that was known in Mexico 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.400
 and that subsequently allowed the appearance of more bars such as 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.550
 rebel of the cougars in 1998 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.669
 the monumental 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:33.159
 of the club america in 1999 legion 1908 and irreverence 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.150
 of Guadalajara 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.289
 the 51 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.330
 from the club arms 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.599
 and the free and locos 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.819
 and the addiction of tigers and monterrey respectively 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.479
 because in my opinion I think that the violent actions of the brave bars are 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.740
 product of a blind and compulsive love 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.340
 towards a football team that in some cases replaces the love that 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.340
 missing in the follower's house or in his intimate and social life 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.069
 the followers of the "barras bravas" have a peculiar way of expressing 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.560
 your feelings for your team of preference 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.849
 and the most concrete is that of fanaticism 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:07.979
 this fanaticism is a usual expression of adolescence from 15 to 21 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:08.439
 years 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.150
 who are the main members of the bars 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.749
 those who lack everything and in the parties think they have everything 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:18.229
 Finally, I emphasize that we must try to reduce the 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.110
 emergence of these groups 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.020
 that most of the time they give football a bad reputation and try to 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.209
 look for another way to express our preference for our team
