there<00:01:41.810> extra<00:01:42.229> braking<00:01:42.679> power<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.159> we've<00:01:43.310> got

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
there extra braking power that we've got

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.760 
there extra braking power that we've got
firmly<00:01:44.090> printed<00:01:44.659> into<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.020> road<00:01:45.170> surface<00:01:45.649> so

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
firmly printed into the road surface so

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.529 
firmly printed into the road surface so
when<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.130> actually<00:01:46.310> apply<00:01:46.549> the<00:01:46.850> front<00:01:47.240> brake

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
when you actually apply the front brake

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.840 
when you actually apply the front brake
you've<00:01:48.110> got<00:01:48.320> that<00:01:48.470> additional<00:01:49.100> extra<00:01:49.490> rubber

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
you've got that additional extra rubber

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.550 
you've got that additional extra rubber
there<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.270> really<00:01:50.720> does<00:01:50.929> stop<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.350> bike

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
there that really does stop the bike

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.620 
there that really does stop the bike
quickly<00:01:51.860> because<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:52.909> literally<00:01:53.299> just

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
quickly because it literally just

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.779 
quickly because it literally just
handles<00:01:54.080> like<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.289> normal<00:01:54.830> scooter<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.580> don't

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
handles like a normal scooter you don't

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.370 
handles like a normal scooter you don't
even<00:01:55.940> know<00:01:56.209> it's<00:01:56.360> got<00:01:56.539> the<00:01:56.630> two<00:01:56.810> wheels<00:01:57.080> there

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
responds in the same way no difference

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.960 
responds in the same way no difference
at<00:02:05.690> all
