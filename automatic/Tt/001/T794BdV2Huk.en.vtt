director photography I grew up in Poland

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.259 
director photography I grew up in Poland
in<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.740> artistic<00:00:23.220> family<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:23.820> mother<00:00:24.060> as<00:00:24.240> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
think most people as children are very

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.050 
think most people as children are very
creative<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.980> then<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.189> they<00:00:29.369> grow<00:00:29.760> older

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
creative and then as they grow older

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.790 
creative and then as they grow older
they<00:00:30.269> either<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.840> encouraged<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.439> continue

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
they either not encouraged to continue

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.680 
they either not encouraged to continue
or<00:00:32.040> they're<00:00:32.189> actively<00:00:32.610> discouraged<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.660> I

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
or they're actively discouraged and so I

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.660 
or they're actively discouraged and so I
think<00:00:33.960> that<00:00:34.110> no<00:00:34.290> matter<00:00:34.440> what<00:00:34.770> modality<00:00:35.370> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
think that no matter what modality you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.370 
think that no matter what modality you
choose<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.270> sort<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> important<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.079> let

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
choose it's sort of important to let

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.619 
choose it's sort of important to let
this<00:00:37.590> stay<00:00:37.980> alive<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.510> lot

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
this stay alive in you there are a lot

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.360 
this stay alive in you there are a lot
of<00:00:39.660> elements<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> lot<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.559> moving<00:00:40.710> parts<00:00:41.010> in

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
of elements and a lot of moving parts in

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.490 
of elements and a lot of moving parts in
making<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> film<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> most<00:00:43.020> important

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
making a film I think the most important

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.709 
making a film I think the most important
thing<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.070> understand<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> vision<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
thing is to understand the vision of the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.569 
thing is to understand the vision of the
director<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.860> enough<00:00:47.070> meetings<00:00:47.430> have

director have enough meetings have
enough<00:00:47.789> conversations<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.590> exactly

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
enough conversations to know exactly

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.400 
enough conversations to know exactly
what<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.489> needed<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.539> specific<00:00:51.960> piece<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
what is needed for that specific piece I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.350 
what is needed for that specific piece I
think<00:00:52.980> what<00:00:53.280> makes<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.579> great<00:00:53.699> director<00:00:54.059> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
think what makes a great director is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.939 
think what makes a great director is

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
how valuable that was until I actually

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.840 
how valuable that was until I actually
got<00:01:39.080> my<00:01:39.110> hands<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.560> it<00:01:39.620> literally<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.370> I'm

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850
