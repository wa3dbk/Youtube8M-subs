00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 All big hello today by chance 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:12.349
 in my hands were such here 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:18.720
 wonderful watch is early 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:21.890
 casio pro trek series prt 70 now I will give you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.890
 I will demonstrate it 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:37.489
 so so so so so mean prt 70 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:41.270
 Japan's pro trek is a very interesting watch 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.020
 really they hit me in pretty 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.180
 we need this state of the bath 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 clean them thoroughly, etc. etc. 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.340
 Here and I had an idea to make 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.230
 so let's say the restoration because 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.219
 and watches are very very rare buy now 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 somewhere pro trek 70 models practically 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.580
 unreal, that is, you need to be lucky 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.439
 and of course I will do this video 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.409
 very short simple very short 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.900
 compare it with my say so small about 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.729
 track for some reason I thought that this 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.890
 big pro trek should be more than 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:30.180
 here it turned out just the opposite 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.869
 I'll tell you right away who wants to know what 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.659
 functional 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.900
 here you can calmly 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.360
 watch video of these hours in 4 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 weave the functions here are all the same here 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.649
 dual sensor altimeter barometer 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.540
 the thermometer here means design in principle 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.899
 also like the fact that only now here we 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 the bezel rotates freely and then 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.610
 such small things like arrows 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.860
 are translated with the key but it doesn't matter in 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.619
 Iâ€™m going to take another video 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 because I still want to get rid 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:10.520
 only great hours from such some 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.950
 worthless strap bracelet that I want 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.190
 sew your some such custom 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.459
 leather bracelet strap under it 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.890
 that's the first thing, of course I am 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.580
 I want to clean it where necessary 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.239
 polish put in order to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.340
 such a good exhibit worthy 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.940
 really took my place in my 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.720
 collections 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.930
 small well and basically not even 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 I know what else to say about this watch. 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.370
 good machine is quite stylish 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.590
 in spite of his attention to him 18 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.590
 years then maybe this watch is older 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.379
 some of my viewers here it is 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.239
 completely new and of course we'll talk in 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.290
 next video if i have this whole thing 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.260
 I'll talk about the trend as a company 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.680
 casio is positioning this watch this one 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.800
 hours and days as functions in general functionality 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.280
 as migrated from here these here on here 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.080
 these here 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.670
 I remind you that 400k almost almost new 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.860
 clock + 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.790
 the model is actually sold here this 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.540
 model prt 70 you will not find 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.580
 nowhere 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.970
 so that's what I have today 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.709
 impressions of this watch 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.920

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.110
