practice<00:03:23.040> for<00:03:23.910> every<00:03:24.299> single<00:03:24.570> team<00:03:24.810> like

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
practice for every single team like

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.170 
practice for every single team like
everything<00:03:25.890> was<00:03:25.950> impossible<00:03:26.459> because<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
everything was impossible because the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.550 
everything was impossible because the
way<00:03:27.269> we<00:03:27.299> practice<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.870> we<00:03:28.110> play<00:03:28.410> with

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
way we practice is that we play with

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.600 
way we practice is that we play with
strong<00:03:28.860> we<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:31.440> we<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:31.830> focus<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.400> ourselves

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
strong we and we just focus on ourselves

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.810 
strong we and we just focus on ourselves
that's<00:03:33.600> our<00:03:33.720> goal<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.310> against<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> og<00:03:35.610> we

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
that's our goal and against the og we

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.490 
that's our goal and against the og we
just<00:03:35.940> figure<00:03:36.150> out<00:03:36.269> what<00:03:36.390> they<00:03:36.540> what<00:03:36.840> pics<00:03:37.350> that

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
just figure out what they what pics that

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.020 
just figure out what they what pics that
they<00:03:37.620> liked<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.580> didn't<00:03:38.760> really<00:03:38.910> care

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
they liked and we didn't really care

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.850 
they liked and we didn't really care
