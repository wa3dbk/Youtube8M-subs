00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.640
 dessert cited or rich thing that no 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.380
 it is necessarily healthy so for 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.170

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.230

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.469
 super rich has pineapple has candy has 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390
 chamoy among other things so I 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.640
 I hope you like it a lot and if you want 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.680
 consent this weekend or consent 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.840
 to someone else that you see in this video 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.840
 we will occupy a pineapple 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.790
 the amount you want from chamoy 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.950
 Many of you have asked me in 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.750
 my video of cucumber glasses that are 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.120
 I will leave in the information box 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.550
 If you still do not see what the chamoy is 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.640
 Chamoy made a sauce based on chile and 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.369
 some fruits probably have another 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.180
 name in your country but here you are known 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.180
 like chamoy 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:15.549
 we will also take chili candies or 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.009
 tamarind of your choice I chose these 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.719
 tamarind candy called out chunks 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.829
 that come from a sweet also that is 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.829
 known as chaka chaka 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.620
 I also took pancho gummies that are 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.620
 some orange gummies 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.120
 Japanese peanuts chile lemon 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.160
 use this one that is called tajÃ­n but 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.400
 you can use any chile in 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.250
 powder 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.320
 The first thing we will do is a cut in 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.320
 the pineapple on the top 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.729
 since we achieved what we will do 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.440
 get all the pineapple out of the center and we 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.760
 we can help perfectly with a 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.760
 knife and a spoon 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.730
 our pineapple is put in a 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.340
 container and after we achieve 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.990
 remove all the pineapple center which 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.990
 we will make it cut into squares 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.689
 after this we will begin to fill 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.209
 our pineapple you can use the 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.219
 procedure that you want I decided 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.010
 put a base of chamoy and chile in 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:55.170
 powder to then add the pineapple 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.750
 stir a little mixing the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.430
 ingredients and in this step forget 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.220
 also mention that it is important 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.829
 add the juice of a lemon after 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.069
 this we added the sweets and finished with 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:10.280
 more chamoy and chili powder I hope that 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.280
 enjoy it 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.920

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.750
