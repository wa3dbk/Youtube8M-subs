00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.620
 Touhou Project Kirisame Marisa Making Course 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:19.370
 Second part 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.950
 This course will be explained by substitutes with the permission of general goods 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.670
 step 4 eh 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.670
 Skin whether Date 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.880
 turn on ea 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:35.480
 Sometimes I put a house on all parts in gray, but this time costume 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.890
 God eye skin 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.750
 Use a different color to light up the house 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.630
 I will apply the skin 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.250
 I often use salmon pink for good skin 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:55.770
 Set layer mode to No mode when you add ea 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:02.460
 The skin is adjusted while thinking how far to express the three-dimensional effect 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:08.210
 If it is close to a real car, more detailed expressions such as eyes, nose and mouth are necessary 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.049
 This time I apply in a relatively simple form for casuals 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.049
 Please put the ea taking care such as in the direction of the hairstyle and light 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.300
 I will add more layers such as the neck and other parts that get dark with other income 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.440
 Paint the hair 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:54.180
 Mai's so blonde base is now in the bright yellow 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:59.780
 Since the blonde and pink is common this time will use as the gradient 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.780
 em It becomes cute when you put the house in the pink system as well 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:14.739
 Set the direction while paying attention to the hair style being a long wave 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.739
 Proceed to ge 8 in order to one side 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.490
 step 5 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.480
 ea 2 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.480
 Costume and broom 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:52.020
 The costumes are generally monotone, so the atmosphere is low and bright on the side to match Marl 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.200
 I will try to put the house in purple 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.819
 Gray is often used in white houses 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:05.299
 I think it is good to put some color in this way 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:09.189
 Purple chose as earlier because the suit in any color to be too high Zayed and brightness in the black ea 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.189
 I would like to shoot here too 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.940
 4 characters are on board 1 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:23.960
 Taking care, such as the flow of the broom and give it a ea 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.960
 I want to go in a casual feeling, so some emotions are in the shadow 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.320
 Repro 9 ea 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.320
 What 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.099
 Then each style is a person, but usually Mr. Satoshi and screen 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.099
 I will paint using features such as overlay 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.170
 Upper part is dark in no mode 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.080
 The stock is lightly painted in a lighter mode with a lighter color 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.470
 Tei was the most mind when There is the work of think because the character that it where the most prominent 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.470
 I will 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.190
 Change the color of Beppu 7 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.930
 Put the color before 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:23.870
 The skin has a reddish color with low saturation such as brow or pale pink 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:25.290
 In the case of white, there are any colors, but it is important to create while considering the color and atmosphere of the marly 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.500
 is 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.500
 This time it was the purple color used in ea 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.460
 This is the end of character making 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:44.480
 step 8 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.480
 Background and effects 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:55.600
 I would like to add backgrounds and effects easily in the end 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:59.040
 Painted want the color of the sky to the campus because it is going to use the waist sky as the first to say as background 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.040
 Add a star 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.370
 Effect 1 First revised in white 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:27.129
 A glow effect in additional to use fading of and brush a layer under the wrote Layer 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.969
 Express 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:34.409
 This way, you can have effects that glow even without photoshop or other editing tools. 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.409
 Can be expressed 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.879
 This is the end 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.879
