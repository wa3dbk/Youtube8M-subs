microphone we have the MXL logo and then

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.600 
microphone we have the MXL logo and then
the<00:02:59.720> actual<00:03:00.080> microphone<00:03:00.470> pickup<00:03:00.920> itself<00:03:01.340> with

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
the actual microphone pickup itself with

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.089 
the actual microphone pickup itself with
this<00:03:01.760> nice<00:03:02.000> metal<00:03:02.360> grille<00:03:02.810> okay<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:03.799> basically

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
this nice metal grille okay so basically

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.650 
this nice metal grille okay so basically
what<00:03:04.459> would<00:03:04.580> happen<00:03:04.910> this<00:03:05.090> would<00:03:05.299> plug<00:03:05.540> the

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
what would happen this would plug the

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.960 
what would happen this would plug the
USB<00:03:05.780> cable<00:03:06.049> in<00:03:06.560> and<00:03:06.769> effectively<00:03:07.730> you<00:03:07.849> would

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
USB cable in and effectively you would

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.180 
USB cable in and effectively you would
put<00:03:08.569> this<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:08.840> your<00:03:08.930> desk<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.560> then<00:03:10.069> the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
put this on your desk and then the

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.160 
put this on your desk and then the
radius<00:03:10.640> would<00:03:10.849> radius<00:03:11.420> would<00:03:11.540> work<00:03:11.780> so<00:03:12.019> any

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
radius would radius would work so any

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.809 
radius would radius would work so any
sound<00:03:12.500> being<00:03:12.829> picked<00:03:13.099> up<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.400> front<00:03:13.610> of<00:03:13.700> this

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
sound being picked up in front of this

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.729 
sound being picked up in front of this
microphone<00:03:14.150> would<00:03:14.959> obviously<00:03:15.319> come<00:03:15.530> into

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
microphone would obviously come into

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.050 
microphone would obviously come into
here<00:03:15.920> so<00:03:16.040> it's<00:03:16.160> good<00:03:16.340> for<00:03:16.370> a<00:03:16.549> group<00:03:16.790> discussion

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
here so it's good for a group discussion
