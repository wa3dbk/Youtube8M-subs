I<00:02:20.870> recommend<00:02:21.709> sewing<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.190> ribbon<00:02:22.430> twice<00:02:22.730> once

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
the bottom of the ribbon this will give

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.280 
the bottom of the ribbon this will give
the<00:02:28.640> straps<00:02:28.910> extra<00:02:29.300> reinforcement<00:02:29.480> so<00:02:30.170> they
