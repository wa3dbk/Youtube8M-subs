00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.390

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.680

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.829

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.829
 spoons 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.330

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.130
 in such small pieces now i'm 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.550
 I'll blend it all together with a blender 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.010
 so they 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.010
 you will turn into such a single mixture 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.390
 and the ready dough we got here 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.820
 such is the consistency of thick cream 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.880
 I add June but this of course by 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.170
 Wish in this recipe was her I think 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.429
 that you can add any dried fruit 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:57.920
 all this stir and rerun all this 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:57.920
 pre-lubricated form 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.270
 so I put the dough in shape and now 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.869
 it all sent warmed up to 180 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.440
 degrees oven before the appearance of ruddy 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.140
 crust and so it took 40 minutes and i 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.510
 pulled casserole from the oven like this 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.730
 Here she looks amazing worth 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.580
 banana flavor and now I will 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.990
 spread it on a dish 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.780
 put the casserole on the dish like this 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.380
 It looks and incidentally according to the recipe she 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.440
 was called cancan shaft banana cheesecake 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.420
 Well, of course this is not a cheesecake to me 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.739
 just balunova cottage cheese casserole 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.459
 and of course I will show you her image of cutting and 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.170
 I will tell about my goats new impressions 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.870
 so here is the casserole 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.780
 in the section as you can see she is such a whole 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.970
 homogeneous just let's go and where sticks out 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.730
 I tried it for me crazy 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.000
 I liked it is sick and such a curd 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.269
 This banana souffle is very tasteful. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.720
 unusual I can say that it is perfect 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.540
 breakfast option moreover all this 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.190
 very easy to quickly preparing the more 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.709
 considering that you used skim 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.269
 cottage cheese is also not calorie so I 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.549
 I think I found the perfect 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:19.400
 cottage cheese casserole necessarily 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.079
