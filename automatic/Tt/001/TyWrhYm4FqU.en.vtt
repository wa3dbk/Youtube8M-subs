00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.160
 two 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.200
 we are today in the technical series 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.780
 of asprocan with santiago pereyra 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.210
 gonzalez agrarian extension agent 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.980
 insular town council of tenerife he is going to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.520
 talk about some pests and diseases 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.189
 that are not major but that do not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.410
 we are going to stop mentioning the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.399
 first we will talk about the evil of 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.040
 Panama 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.980
 santiago as we see the evil of panama in 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.200
 a plant because the evil of panama is a 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.270
 disease in a fungus that lives in the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.519
 soil whose scientific name of fusari 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.890
 not if it's for special report cubensis and 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.989
 which, as we said, lives on the ground and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.519
 It is introduced into the plant through 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.530
 the roots and in directly or through 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.879
 of some wound the symptoms 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.769
 main ones can be divided into three 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.600
 external symptoms as we can see here 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.519
 on this floor the first thing that can be 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.620
 observe is a yellow this yellow 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.780
 as you can see it starts from those of the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.519
 lower leaves to upper ones and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.370
 there is a greater eo than a yellow one 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.110
 in saw shape as we can appreciate 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.870
 another external symptom also in the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.720
 wrecks are produced a striations of color 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.370
 purple longitudinal after the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.630
 make the cut we can observe how 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.450
 those steps 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.090
 drivers of sap and nutrients and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.340
 of water are constructed as a symptom 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.020
 internal we can also observe when 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.600
 that later we will also cut down on 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.220
 the head and we can observe the vessels 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 clogged with colored dots 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.869
 reddish orange we can do if 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.939
 in our farm we found a plant 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.079
 with these symptoms first say that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.280
 this disease there are no products 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.960
 chemicals or phytosanitary products that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.909
 can be applied and be effective 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.189
 in front of this disease that first thing 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.020
 that we have to be clear and not spend 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.420
 neither money nor time to apply products 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.549
 second phytosanitary if we see a 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.220
 plant with these symptoms the first thing is 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.500
 do not touch it or avoid being destined 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.080
 and disinfecting the tools 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.899
 work tools so that you do not 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.830
 the disease is dispersed and then another 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.810
 What we can do is 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.100
 if in any case she has died 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.930
 remove it from the plantation of the plot and 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.930
 destroy it and in this area well apply 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.730
 calcium hydroxide to disinfect and 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 another thing we can do in the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.810
 neighboring plants leave a dumbbell for 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.360
 that little by little he is taking his place and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.400
 avoid planting another plant in the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.470
 same place also other things that 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.570
 recommended to avoid this disease 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.610
 is precisely to avoid 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.010
 waterlogging does not flood because it is 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.530
 a way for the disease to enter 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.930
 back through the root and obstruct the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.920
 vessels the water conductors and 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.990
 nutrients and the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.340
 withering that we see here another of 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.020
 preventive measures for control 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.270
 of this disease is applications of 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.040
 zinc sulfate or that the zinc cough already 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.140
 that these applications have been proven 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.000
 that increase the natural defenses of 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.340
 the plant before the entrance of this 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.160
 second disease is anti 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.900
 let's talk about the nematode that are the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.170
 nematodes and what damage they cause 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.750
 banana nematodes are using the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.880
 microscopic living on the ground that 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.210
 can be fed well from bacteria 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.220
 fungi or other nematodes 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.620
 to all who feed on the roots 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.050
 of the plants in the case of two genera 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.210
 of meloidogyne nematodes and practice 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.340
 their that feed on the roots of the 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.220
 black silver the damages they cause are 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.630
 damage to the roots that hinder the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.520
 absorption of water and nutrients what 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.650
 produce in the plant a yellow 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.750
 general and a decrease in vigor 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.360
 santi what we can do if we detect 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.800
 problems of nematodes to our farm 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.590
 Well, first you have to know if 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.600
 really that level of nematodes is 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.770
 producing damage to crops for 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.540
 it is necessary to take samples of 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.980
 roots and send to analyze to know the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.590
 number of nematodes per 100 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.810
 grams of roots based on that to that 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.940
 result of the analyzes based on the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.460
 level of organic matter in the soil and 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.950
 based on the mission level mission 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.710
 of roots of the crop because we will take the 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.750
 decision whether to apply measures 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.340
 control or not normally in the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.690
 conditions of our banana plantations is not 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.310
 necessary to give treatments 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.590
 phytosanitary products and treatments 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.820
 chemical nematicides in banana plantations 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.680
 from the Canary Islands 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.390
 normally maintaining a level of 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.540
 organic matter than 3 but 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.690
 3% and maintaining a 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.940
 a good level of nutrition and a 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.440
 Balanced fertilization is enough 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.280
 so that nematodes are not problems 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.900
 in our crops we have to say that 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.000
 must be avoided in any case and only 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.710
 only when it is necessary to give 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.810
 chemical nematicide treatments since 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.550
 can affect the microbial life of the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.949
 soil and can be harmful to the 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.720
 environment good before and finally 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.150
 you could do a little review 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.220
 about the red spider this problem we 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.900
 cause that we can do to control it 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.580
 You can have the first thing we can 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.990
 to say about the red spider is that it 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.759
 finds mainly in the instead of 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.680
 the leaves and when the conditions are 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.789
 very favorable for this plague and 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.449
 unfavorable for enemies 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.680
 natural or when there is an excess of 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.199
 Nitrogen fertilization this 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.240
 imbalance causes this pest to pass 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.039
 from the back of the leaves to racism and it's 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.729
 there where you have to establish the measures 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.830
 control in terms of driving management 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.210
 of the control of this plague we can say 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.949
 that we have to have especially 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.480
 monitored the areas that are 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.430
 close to 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.260
 road areas where dust accumulates 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.600
 in these areas where mainly 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.180
 this plague will appear and you have to be 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.860
 especially watching over that whole area 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.360
 as regards the control measures 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.860
 we have to be careful also with 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.960
 certain weeds that can 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.060
 be hosts of this plague like 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.920
 can be the tomatillo the solar a 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.780
 black or the ashy of the amaranth 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.360
 these pests are especially 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.340
 Hosts of this mite of this spider 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.200
 red and you have to have them especially 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.310
 monitored and controlled conditions 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.740
 favorable for this plague are 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.720
 temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees and 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.160
 low relative humidity this is 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.900
 normally produces at the end of 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.750
 spring summer and in this and it is in this 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.460
 time where you have to be especially 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.160
 vigilantes for the increases of 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.140
 populations is in charge of this 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.670
 red spider regarding the measures of 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.770
 control must be taken into account also 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.450
 the correct irrigation management since if 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.610
 there is a water deficit is there 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.820
 where they will also be favorable so that 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.980
 this one for this plague increase and you can 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.270
 produce cluster damage as soon as 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.040
 to the biological control of this plague 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.650
 exists spontaneously in the 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.930
 banana crops in the Canary Islands one 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.389
 red spider called fito series per 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.850
 similes that prey on the red spider 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:27.780
 plague of our crops and that 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.660
 finds can be arranged 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.460
 commercially of this insect in 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.680
 companies dedicated to multiplication 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.590
 of these natural enemies good many 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:40.080
 thanks santiago after this quick 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.960
 review with panama evil the 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.340
 nematodes and red spider anyway 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.500
 They know that if they have any doubt 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.580
 you can consult your technician is who 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.580
 better can advise you
