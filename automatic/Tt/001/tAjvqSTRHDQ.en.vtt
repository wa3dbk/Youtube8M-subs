too much of a risk being Dolph Prince
you<00:02:42.459> know<00:02:42.489> rich<00:02:42.940> versus<00:02:43.300> reward<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.870> risks

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
you know rich versus reward the risks

you know rich versus reward the risks

just being I was just playing it safe
there<00:02:48.910> with<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.480> slow-mo<00:02:49.989> slow-mo<00:02:50.709> shinning

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
there with the slow-mo slow-mo shinning

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.630 
there with the slow-mo slow-mo shinning
the<00:02:51.280> time<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.600> can<00:02:52.810> make<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.340> fall<00:02:54.340> without

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
the time you can make that fall without

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.270 
the time you can make that fall without
the<00:02:54.910> slow-mo<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:56.019> is<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> lot<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.800> is<00:02:57.069> rough

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
the slow-mo but it is a lot it is rough

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.590 
the slow-mo but it is a lot it is rough
tricky<00:02:57.610> in<00:02:57.730> fact<00:02:57.910> this<00:02:58.030> whole<00:02:58.209> section<00:02:58.540> here

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
tricky in fact this whole section here

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.570 
tricky in fact this whole section here
without<00:02:58.870> slow-mo<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.739> really<00:03:00.370> difficult

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
without slow-mo is really difficult

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.940 
without slow-mo is really difficult
because<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:01.000> how<00:03:01.209> quick<00:03:01.480> everything<00:03:01.750> moves<00:03:02.530> it

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
because of how quick everything moves it

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.009 
because of how quick everything moves it
is<00:03:03.160> all<00:03:03.310> possible<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.090> is<00:03:04.239> quicker<00:03:04.630> if<00:03:04.840> you

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
is all possible and it is quicker if you

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.229 
is all possible and it is quicker if you
don't<00:03:05.260> use<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.680> slow-mo<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.519> basically

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
don't use the slow-mo and just basically

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.180 
don't use the slow-mo and just basically
rely<00:03:07.540> on<00:03:07.569> good<00:03:07.959> old<00:03:08.110> skill<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:08.620> order<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.920> do<00:03:09.040> it

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
rely on good old skill in order to do it

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.030 
rely on good old skill in order to do it
but<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.239> just<00:03:10.690> prefer<00:03:10.840> being<00:03:11.350> safe<00:03:11.440> than<00:03:12.010> sorry

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
but I just prefer being safe than sorry

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.520 
but I just prefer being safe than sorry
so<00:03:12.579> that's<00:03:13.030> just<00:03:13.150> me<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:13.690> did<00:03:13.989> lose<00:03:14.170> saves

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
so that's just me so I did lose saves

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.750 
so that's just me so I did lose saves
time<00:03:15.160> there<00:03:15.519> by<00:03:15.790> freaking<00:03:16.780> time<00:03:17.440> is<00:03:18.370> something

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
time there by freaking time is something

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.759 
time there by freaking time is something
you<00:03:18.850> have<00:03:19.000> too<00:03:19.209> little<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.930> very<00:03:22.959> true<00:03:23.620> if

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
you have too little of and very true if

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.160 
you have too little of and very true if
you<00:03:23.950> have<00:03:24.130> very<00:03:24.670> little<00:03:24.940> time<00:03:25.239> only<00:03:25.780> I<00:03:25.900> had

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
you have very little time only I had

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.920 
you have very little time only I had
some<00:03:26.380> sort<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.880> sands<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:28.000> China<00:03:28.750> yeah<00:03:29.590> no<00:03:30.040> okay

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
some sort of sands of China yeah no okay

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.180 
some sort of sands of China yeah no okay
right<00:03:31.930> here<00:03:32.110> this<00:03:32.320> little<00:03:32.739> section<00:03:33.100> is

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
right here this little section is

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.069 
right here this little section is
annoying<00:03:33.489> because<00:03:33.730> if<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.239> miss<00:03:34.480> time<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.900> you

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
annoying because if you miss time it you

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.500 
annoying because if you miss time it you
will<00:03:35.290> get<00:03:35.470> hit<00:03:35.709> with<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.130> arrows<00:03:36.640> like<00:03:37.180> that

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
will get hit with the arrows like that

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.060 
will get hit with the arrows like that
so<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.290> do<00:03:38.590> want<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:39.810> slow<00:03:40.810> down<00:03:40.840> time<00:03:41.590> and

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
so you do want to slow down time and

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.640 
so you do want to slow down time and
then<00:03:42.880> run<00:03:43.450> across<00:03:43.810> because<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.290> prince<00:03:44.530> will

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
then run across because the prince will

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.470 
then run across because the prince will

is all section right here can be kind of
tricky<00:04:14.200> pressure<00:04:14.830> why<00:04:15.099> or<00:04:15.519> trying

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
tricky pressure why or trying

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
to pull this section out and then you've

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.580 
to pull this section out and then you've
got<00:04:18.820> to<00:04:18.910> jump<00:04:19.120> out<00:04:19.239> an<00:04:19.390> angle<00:04:19.900> right<00:04:19.930> here<00:04:20.200> and

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
got to jump out an angle right here and

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.770 
got to jump out an angle right here and
this<00:04:21.310> bit<00:04:21.610> is<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.790> very<00:04:22.090> tricky<00:04:22.390> bit<00:04:22.630> because

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
this bit is a very tricky bit because

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.240 
this bit is a very tricky bit because
look<00:04:23.050> at<00:04:23.110> your<00:04:23.260> health<00:04:23.380> it's<00:04:23.650> really<00:04:24.100> low

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
look at your health it's really low

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.950 
look at your health it's really low
because<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.670> you<00:04:25.360> don't<00:04:25.600> have<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:25.810> much

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
because you you don't have that much

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.780 
because you you don't have that much
sans<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.860> need<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.100> make<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.430> section

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
sans and you need to make this section

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.190 
sans and you need to make this section
right<00:04:27.970> here<00:04:28.000> so<00:04:28.270> if<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.450> have<00:04:28.600> like<00:04:28.720> no<00:04:28.930> sense

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
right here so if you have like no sense

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.020 
right here so if you have like no sense
that<00:04:29.470> really<00:04:30.340> checking<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.730> made<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:30.970> look

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
that really checking I made it look

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.190 
that really checking I made it look
simple<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.390> whatever<00:04:31.950> troubleshoot<00:04:34.020> what<00:04:35.020> is

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
simple but whatever troubleshoot what is
