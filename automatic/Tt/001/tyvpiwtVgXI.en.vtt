1.6 so a huge fall off there now what I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.080 
1.6 so a huge fall off there now what I
mean<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.140> real<00:01:58.320> difference<00:01:58.560> between

mean what is the real difference between

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.780 
mean what is the real difference between
2007<00:02:00.090> 2004<00:02:00.719> why<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.140> people<00:02:01.439> not<00:02:01.790> watching

in the Arena Football League it would be

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.180 
in the Arena Football League it would be
a<00:05:01.850> lot<00:05:02.150> bigger<00:05:02.360> than<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.690> is<00:05:02.750> right<00:05:02.840> now<00:05:03.190> and
