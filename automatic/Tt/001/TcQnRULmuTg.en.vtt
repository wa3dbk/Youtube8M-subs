00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
that to what I have here is the new

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
that to what I have here is the new
version<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:09.030> WWB<00:01:09.840> prototype<00:01:10.680> actually

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
version of the WWB prototype actually

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.289 
version of the WWB prototype actually
i'm<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.640> i'm<00:01:11.729> going<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> say<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
i'm not i'm going to say this is a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.670 
i'm not i'm going to say this is a
prototype<00:01:12.540> anymore<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.229> i<00:01:13.350> actually

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
prototype anymore because i actually

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.590 
prototype anymore because i actually
like<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> knife<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.700> i'm<00:01:15.240> probably<00:01:15.420> is

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
like this knife and i'm probably is

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.840 
like this knife and i'm probably is
going<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> keep<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.640> pretty<00:01:17.640> much<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
going to keep it as is pretty much the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.050 
going to keep it as is pretty much the
differences<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.650> blade<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.700> actually

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
differences is I just blade is actually

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.929 
differences is I just blade is actually
half<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.420> thickness<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.700> promo<00:01:23.700> talk

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
half the thickness of that promo talk

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.730 
half the thickness of that promo talk
net<00:01:24.180> effect<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> same<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> thickness

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
net effect is the same when a thickness

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
net effect is the same when a thickness
as<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:27.560> Condor<00:01:28.560> bush<00:01:28.770> war<00:01:29.270> same<00:01:30.270> handle<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
uh I don't know kind of an imperfect guy

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.510 
uh I don't know kind of an imperfect guy
not<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.539> like<00:01:57.630> imperfect<00:01:58.200> things<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.340> I'm

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
not kind of like imperfect things so I'm

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.149 
not kind of like imperfect things so I'm
really<00:01:59.819> thinking<00:02:00.090> about<00:02:00.450> keeping<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.380> put

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
really thinking about keeping that I put

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.069 
really thinking about keeping that I put
these<00:02:02.369> actual<00:02:02.939> lips<00:02:03.359> right<00:02:03.569> here<00:02:03.780> because<00:02:04.049> I

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
these actual lips right here because I

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.080 
these actual lips right here because I
haven't<00:02:04.560> tested<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.039> the<00:02:05.579> Ferro<00:02:05.819> rod<00:02:05.879> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
haven't tested it on the Ferro rod I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.949 
haven't tested it on the Ferro rod I
made<00:02:06.329> for<00:02:06.569> this<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.250> catches<00:02:08.519> a

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
made for this but it really catches a

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.210 
made for this but it really catches a
it's<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.259> sharp<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.769> it<00:02:10.829> really<00:02:10.979> catches

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
it's really sharp and it really catches

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490 
it's really sharp and it really catches
a<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:12.150> Ferro<00:02:12.390> rod<00:02:12.450> creates<00:02:13.019> a<00:02:13.110> nice<00:02:13.260> good

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
a the Ferro rod creates a nice good

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.930 
a the Ferro rod creates a nice good
spark<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.959> handle<00:02:16.319> wise<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.799> just<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.549> on<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
spark to handle wise is just like on the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.259 
spark to handle wise is just like on the
bigger<00:02:18.840> version<00:02:19.319> i<00:02:19.470> made<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.610> fit<00:02:21.120> my

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
bigger version i made this to fit my

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.910 
bigger version i made this to fit my
hand<00:02:21.510> it<00:02:22.019> is<00:02:22.230> very<00:02:22.560> very<00:02:22.920> comfortable<00:02:23.099> again

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
hand it is very very comfortable again

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.089 
hand it is very very comfortable again
to<00:02:25.920> match<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:26.519> i<00:02:26.849> made<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.840> fair<00:02:28.560> rod<00:02:28.859> out<00:02:28.890> of

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
we'll see how it holds up oh by the way

we'll see how it holds up oh by the way
it<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.650> made<00:05:01.890> out<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.100> that<00:05:02.360> 1095<00:05:03.360> carbon<00:05:03.870> steel

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
it is made out of that 1095 carbon steel

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.760 
it is made out of that 1095 carbon steel
it's<00:05:05.150> not<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.480> cheap<00:05:06.930> welding<00:05:07.290> still<00:05:07.500> i<00:05:07.530> was

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
it's not the cheap welding still i was

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.660 
it's not the cheap welding still i was
using<00:05:07.950> on<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.370> prototype<00:05:10.130> this<00:05:11.130> right<00:05:11.400> here

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:11.670 
using on the prototype this right here

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.630 
using on the prototype this right here
well<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:12.930> i'm<00:05:13.740> assuming<00:05:14.160> it's<00:05:14.400> going<00:05:14.580> to

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
well it is i'm assuming it's going to

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.000 
well it is i'm assuming it's going to
hold<00:05:14.760> an<00:05:14.940> edge<00:05:15.090> really<00:05:15.120> really<00:05:15.780> well<00:05:15.960> as<00:05:16.170> the

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
hold an edge really really well as the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.620 
hold an edge really really well as the
first<00:05:17.190> time<00:05:17.340> it's<00:05:17.490> been<00:05:17.550> sharpened<00:05:18.150> and<00:05:18.330> later

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
first time it's been sharpened and later

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.260 
first time it's been sharpened and later
i<00:05:18.780> was<00:05:19.050> shaving<00:05:19.290> arm<00:05:19.770> hair<00:05:20.010> with<00:05:20.250> it<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:23.270> and

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
i was shaving arm hair with it and and

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.740 
i was shaving arm hair with it and and
it<00:05:24.590> works<00:05:25.590> i<00:05:25.800> work<00:05:26.130> really<00:05:26.370> well<00:05:26.660> so<00:05:27.660> i'm

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
it works i work really well so i'm

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.240 
it works i work really well so i'm
hoping<00:05:27.960> it's<00:05:28.260> going<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:28.440> keep<00:05:28.620> an<00:05:28.740> edge<00:05:28.920> i<00:05:29.100> mean

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
hoping it's going to keep an edge i mean

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.830 
hoping it's going to keep an edge i mean
1095<00:05:29.760> carpets<00:05:30.330> do<00:05:30.450> it<00:05:30.990> better

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
1095 carpets do it better

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.990 
1095 carpets do it better
I<00:05:32.169> thought<00:05:32.800> about<00:05:33.040> go<00:05:33.250> ahead<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.550> polishing

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
I thought about go ahead and polishing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.590 
I thought about go ahead and polishing
up<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.919> you<00:05:35.919> see<00:05:36.130> all<00:05:36.250> the<00:05:36.400> milling<00:05:37.060> large<00:05:37.300> of

up the you see all the milling large of

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.469 
up the you see all the milling large of
paper<00:05:38.230> and<00:05:38.980> everything<00:05:39.100> I<00:05:39.669> thought<00:05:40.240> about

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
paper and everything I thought about

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.350
