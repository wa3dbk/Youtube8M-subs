 and a tablespoon of agave syrup 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.729
 to be able to put a little further if 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.869
 you do not have agave syrup you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.150
 can put sugar products 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:19.979
 previously cooled a little name that 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.609
 it's at full power for 2 to 3 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.939
 minutes 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:25.939
 Let's go 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.480
 two creams texture for now 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
 it's like a chocolate cream 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.230
 then I'm going to shoot a little 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.850
 moment to the electric mixer what will 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.830
 to ventilate the foam and that will 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.170
 to do that we will get the texture of 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.720
 foam so I pour it into another 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.970
 container 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.460
 now I'm going to beat my cream 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:59.880
 few seconds to the drummer to ventilate 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.990

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.610

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.000
 in a container and then I 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.140
 would place happy in the fridge 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.140
 until the next day 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.630
 we already see that the texture is a small 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.490

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.260

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.010

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.510
 my first try but you 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.370
 can see so we can get a 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.010
 beautiful foam texture without necessarily 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.019
 use of animal products so this 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.230

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.659

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.890
 delicious even at the level of taste I 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:08.510
 can you make sure that in the end it's a 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.970

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.890
