00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
but I could see that the sophistication

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.969 
but I could see that the sophistication
that<00:04:53.780> needs<00:04:54.020> to<00:04:54.229> come<00:04:54.410> of<00:04:54.650> them<00:04:54.830> actually

becoming dancers together rather than

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.980 
becoming dancers together rather than
brilliant<00:04:57.710> skaters<00:04:58.430> together<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.540> that<00:04:59.810> will

brilliant skaters together and that will

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.530 
brilliant skaters together and that will
come<00:05:00.169> with<00:05:00.440> maturity<00:05:00.860> but<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:01.910> base<00:05:02.150> of<00:05:02.389> what

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
come with maturity but the base of what

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.180
