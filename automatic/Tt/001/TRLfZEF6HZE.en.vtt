hey guys afterglow here bringing you a

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.490 
hey guys afterglow here bringing you a
tutorial<00:00:02.280> about<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.480> timecode<00:00:03.959> effect<00:00:04.259> in

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
tutorial about the timecode effect in

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.730 
tutorial about the timecode effect in
Sony<00:00:04.920> Vegas<00:00:05.130> Pro<00:00:05.310> 12<00:00:05.839> so<00:00:06.839> in<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.140> project<00:00:07.379> I

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
Sony Vegas Pro 12 so in this project I

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.299 
Sony Vegas Pro 12 so in this project I
have<00:00:07.950> my<00:00:08.130> footage<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:08.970> just<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.300> speedrun<00:00:09.840> and

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
have my footage it's just a speedrun and

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.650 
have my footage it's just a speedrun and
now<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.370> first<00:00:11.849> thing<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.090> like<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
now the first thing I like to do is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.990 
now the first thing I like to do is
indicate<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.410> start<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.490> end<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
indicate the start and end of the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.330 
indicate the start and end of the
speedrun<00:00:15.420> so<00:00:15.809> let's<00:00:16.379> say<00:00:16.560> for<00:00:16.770> instance<00:00:16.890> I

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
speedrun so let's say for instance I

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.580 
speedrun so let's say for instance I
want<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.699> start<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.090> right<00:00:19.080> here

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
want to start it right here

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.070 
want to start it right here
the<00:00:20.550> timer<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.060> I'm<00:00:21.420> just<00:00:21.689> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.840> hit

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
the timer that is I'm just going to hit

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.560 
the timer that is I'm just going to hit
M<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.619> create<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> marker<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.430> then<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.359> same

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
M to create a marker and then the same

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.000 
M to create a marker and then the same
thing<00:00:24.750> for<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> end<00:00:24.990> I'm<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> hit

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
thing for the end I'm just going to hit

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.779 
thing for the end I'm just going to hit
em<00:00:26.160> again

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
em again

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.070 
em again
to<00:00:27.420> indicate<00:00:27.810> where<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.560> run<00:00:28.740> ends<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:31.050> I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to indicate where the run ends so now I

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.990 
to indicate where the run ends so now I
have<00:00:31.230> two<00:00:31.410> markers<00:00:31.859> indicating<00:00:32.489> where<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
have two markers indicating where the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.729 
have two markers indicating where the
start<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.420> my<00:00:33.540> timecode<00:00:34.079> effect<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
start of my timecode effect is going to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.459 
start of my timecode effect is going to
be<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.640> end<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.020> I'm<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.320> do

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
be and the end so what I'm going to do

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
be and the end so what I'm going to do
now<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.920> create<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.340> blank<00:00:38.760> video<00:00:39.059> track<00:00:39.390> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
now is create a blank video track and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.380 
now is create a blank video track and
put<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.230> right<00:00:40.260> above<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.800> footage<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.579> then

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
put it right above my footage and then

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.590 
put it right above my footage and then
I'm<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.750> go<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> media<00:00:43.710> generators<00:00:44.100> and

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
I'm going to go to media generators and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.170 
I'm going to go to media generators and
create<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> black<00:00:46.050> solid<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.850> then<00:00:47.850> I'm<00:00:48.030> going

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
create a black solid and then I'm going

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.479 
create a black solid and then I'm going
to<00:00:48.210> apply<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.739> timecode<00:00:49.739> effect<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to apply the timecode effect to this

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.869 
to apply the timecode effect to this
black<00:00:50.760> solid<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.039> the<00:00:53.039> timer<00:00:53.280> starts<00:00:53.699> with<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
black solid and the timer starts with a

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.420 
black solid and the timer starts with a
solid<00:00:54.120> starts<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> just<00:00:55.320> put<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
solid starts so I just put that at the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
solid starts so I just put that at the
marker<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:58.410> next<00:00:58.590> step<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.280> extend<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
marker so the next step is to extend the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.729 
marker so the next step is to extend the
black<00:01:00.030> solid<00:01:00.300> all<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> way<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.260> end<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
black solid all the way to the end and

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860 
black solid all the way to the end and
you'll<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> timer<00:01:03.300> just<00:01:03.600> keeps

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you'll see that the timer just keeps

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.609 
you'll see that the timer just keeps
going<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.500> long<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.220> black<00:01:05.430> solid<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:06.619> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
going as long as the black solid is so

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.649 
going as long as the black solid is so
now<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> timer<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.030> next<00:01:09.299> step<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
now that I have a timer the next step is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
now that I have a timer the next step is
to<00:01:09.810> change<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.380> video<00:01:10.619> track<00:01:10.920> settings<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
to change the video track settings to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640 
to change the video track settings to
get<00:01:11.670> rid<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> black<00:01:12.210> background<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
get rid of the black background of the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.469 
get rid of the black background of the
black<00:01:13.830> solid<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.850> I'm<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> change<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
black solid so I'm going to change the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.330 
black solid so I'm going to change the
video<00:01:15.600> track<00:01:15.960> settings<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.560> be<00:01:16.590> set<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.130> add

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
video track settings to be set to add

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.160 
video track settings to be set to add
and<00:01:17.729> that's<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.450> remove<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and that's going to remove all of the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
and that's going to remove all of the
black<00:01:19.439> including<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.520> black<00:01:20.700> box<00:01:21.000> around<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
black including the black box around the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.050 
black including the black box around the
timecode<00:01:22.080> effect<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.939> alternatively<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
timecode effect and alternatively I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.149 
timecode effect and alternatively I
could<00:01:24.270> change<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.840> subtract<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.860> black

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
could change it to subtract to get black

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.640 
could change it to subtract to get black
text<00:01:26.640> instead<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> white<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.960> prefer<00:01:28.380> white

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
text instead of white but I prefer white

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.030 
text instead of white but I prefer white
so<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> make<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> add<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:31.560> that's<00:01:31.799> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
so I'm going to make it add so that's it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.730 
so I'm going to make it add so that's it
in<00:01:32.189> terms<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> actual<00:01:33.240> timer<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:34.439> next

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
in terms of the actual timer the next

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.679 
in terms of the actual timer the next
step<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.369> stop<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> timer<00:01:36.119> when<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> speed

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
step is to stop the timer when the speed

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.530 
step is to stop the timer when the speed
own<00:01:36.810> ends<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.579> unfortunately<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.060> timecode

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
own ends and unfortunately the timecode

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.109 
own ends and unfortunately the timecode
effect<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.990> Sony<00:01:40.229> Vegas<00:01:40.610> doesn't<00:01:41.610> enable<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
effect in Sony Vegas doesn't enable you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.219 
effect in Sony Vegas doesn't enable you
to<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
to do that

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840 
to do that
there's<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.740> no<00:01:43.950> setting<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> stop<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
there's just no setting to stop the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.460 
there's just no setting to stop the
timer<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> continue

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
timer so it's just going to continue

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.330 
timer so it's just going to continue
executing<00:01:47.250> after<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.880> end<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> stop<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
executing after my end so to stop the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
executing after my end so to stop the
timecode<00:01:50.820> effect<00:01:51.180> I'm<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.960> take<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
timecode effect I'm going to take a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.960 
timecode effect I'm going to take a
screenshot<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.979> where<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> want<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> timer<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
screenshot of where I want the timer to

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
screenshot of where I want the timer to
end<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.390> first<00:01:55.259> I'm<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.619> change<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
end and first I'm going to change the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.859 
end and first I'm going to change the
video<00:01:56.130> quality<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.880> best<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.450> then<00:01:57.570> click

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
video quality do best and then click

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.050

this<00:01:58.020> button<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.619> which<00:01:58.880> creates<00:01:59.880> a

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
this button here which creates a

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.420 
this button here which creates a
screenshot<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.990> then<00:02:01.049> I'm<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.399> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
screenshot and then I'm just going to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.810 
screenshot and then I'm just going to
drag<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.729> into<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.750> video<00:02:04.140> track<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.820> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
drag that into my video track and it

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.280 
drag that into my video track and it
looks<00:02:05.969> like<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.270> need<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.479> put<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.110> new

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
looks like I need to put this in a new

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.260 
looks like I need to put this in a new
track<00:02:07.649> since<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.280> current<00:02:08.459> track<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.970> set<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
track since the current track is set to

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.389 
track since the current track is set to
add

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
add

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.580

and<00:02:10.489> now<00:02:10.909> I<00:02:10.940> have<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.269> screenshot<00:02:11.599> of<00:02:11.840> where<00:02:12.319> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and now I have a screenshot of where the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.580 
and now I have a screenshot of where the
time<00:02:12.769> here<00:02:12.920> will<00:02:13.069> end<00:02:13.659> so<00:02:14.659> for<00:02:14.959> this<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.230> work<00:02:15.349> I

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
time here will end so for this to work I

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.020 
time here will end so for this to work I
need<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.830> get<00:02:15.950> rid<00:02:16.129> of<00:02:16.159> everything<00:02:16.670> but<00:02:16.849> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
need to get rid of everything but the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.690 
need to get rid of everything but the
white<00:02:17.209> text<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.049> screenshot<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:19.519> can

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
white text in the screenshot and I can

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.660 
white text in the screenshot and I can
do<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:19.970> by<00:02:20.150> applying<00:02:20.569> an<00:02:21.019> effect<00:02:21.470> now<00:02:22.400> I'm

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
do this by applying an effect now I'm

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.399 
do this by applying an effect now I'm
going<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.120> change<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.629> video<00:02:23.870> quality<00:02:24.140> to

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
going to change the video quality to

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.500 
going to change the video quality to
best<00:02:24.920> so<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.340> guys<00:02:25.580> can<00:02:25.819> see<00:02:25.940> what's<00:02:26.120> going<00:02:26.360> on

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
best so you guys can see what's going on

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.140 
best so you guys can see what's going on
and<00:02:26.840> then<00:02:27.440> solo<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:27.980> track<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.940> then<00:02:29.030> I'm

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
and then solo this track and then I'm

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.819 
and then solo this track and then I'm
going<00:02:29.299> to<00:02:29.329> add<00:02:29.510> an<00:02:29.870> effect<00:02:29.959> called<00:02:30.440> black

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
going to add an effect called black

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:34.089 
going to add an effect called black
restore<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:32.170> what<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.319> enables<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.829> to<00:02:33.890> do

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
restore and what this enables you to do

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.699 
restore and what this enables you to do
is<00:02:34.129> mask<00:02:34.640> out<00:02:34.909> darker<00:02:35.629> portions<00:02:36.079> of<00:02:36.349> your

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
is mask out darker portions of your

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.009 
is mask out darker portions of your
footage<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.640> you<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.599> do<00:02:38.690> that<00:02:38.810> by<00:02:38.989> just

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
footage and you can do that by just

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.990 
footage and you can do that by just
cranking<00:02:39.530> up<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.739> threshold<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.459> you'll<00:02:40.819> see

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
cranking up a threshold and you'll see

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.610 
cranking up a threshold and you'll see
that<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.360> leaves<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.780> white<00:02:41.959> text<00:02:42.170> intact

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
that it leaves the white text intact

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.130 
that it leaves the white text intact
because<00:02:42.920> that's<00:02:43.129> really<00:02:43.609> bright<00:02:43.910> although<00:02:44.780> if

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
because that's really bright although if

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.470 
because that's really bright although if
I<00:02:45.319> crank<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.650> up<00:02:45.739> too<00:02:45.859> high<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.340> does<00:02:46.549> mess<00:02:47.209> that

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
I crank it up too high it does mess that

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.960 
I crank it up too high it does mess that
out<00:02:47.629> as<00:02:47.780> well<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.709> trick<00:02:48.920> is<00:02:48.950> just<00:02:49.459> pick<00:02:49.940> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
out as well and the trick is just pick a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.089 
out as well and the trick is just pick a
threshold<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.780> leaves<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:51.890> white

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
threshold that leaves just the white

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.270 
threshold that leaves just the white
text<00:02:52.340> now<00:02:53.329> if<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.599> put<00:02:53.840> this<00:02:53.989> back<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:55.040> the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
text now if I put this back on to the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.059 
text now if I put this back on to the
track<00:02:55.609> set<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.030> add<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:57.079> will<00:02:57.440> remove<00:02:57.890> the

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
track set to add it will remove the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.330 
track set to add it will remove the
black<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.670> then<00:02:59.440> now<00:03:00.440> you'll<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.859> that<00:03:01.069> the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
black and then now you'll see that the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.039 
black and then now you'll see that the
timer<00:03:01.579> just<00:03:02.060> stops<00:03:02.359> when<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:02.989> reach<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.440> end<00:03:05.049> so

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
timer just stops when I reach the end so

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.410 
timer just stops when I reach the end so
that's<00:03:06.500> about<00:03:06.799> it<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.519> timer<00:03:07.790> stops<00:03:08.150> where<00:03:08.390> I

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
that's about it the timer stops where I

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.190 
that's about it the timer stops where I
wanted<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.989> and<00:03:09.730> now<00:03:10.730> let's<00:03:11.000> say<00:03:11.209> I<00:03:11.629> want<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
wanted to and now let's say I want the

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.099 
wanted to and now let's say I want the
timer<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.099> fade<00:03:13.760> out<00:03:13.790> at<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.599> beginning<00:03:14.840> and

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
timer to fade out at the beginning and

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.150 
timer to fade out at the beginning and
then<00:03:15.200> fade<00:03:15.380> back<00:03:15.410> in<00:03:15.739> at<00:03:15.859> the<00:03:15.889> very<00:03:16.040> end

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
then fade back in at the very end

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.099 
then fade back in at the very end
instead<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.790> being<00:03:17.090> throughout<00:03:17.690> the<00:03:17.840> entire

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
instead of being throughout the entire

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.050 
instead of being throughout the entire
footage<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.370> what<00:03:19.519> I'm<00:03:19.609> going<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:19.790> do<00:03:19.910> is

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
footage so what I'm going to do is

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.629 
footage so what I'm going to do is
duplicate<00:03:20.660> my<00:03:20.930> run<00:03:21.290> and<00:03:21.590> then<00:03:21.919> just<00:03:22.220> drag<00:03:22.459> that

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639 
duplicate my run and then just drag that

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.559 
duplicate my run and then just drag that
on<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:24.079> very<00:03:24.290> top<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.769> then<00:03:25.609> I'm<00:03:26.030> just<00:03:26.090> going

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
on the very top and then I'm just going

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.009 
on the very top and then I'm just going
to<00:03:27.069> fade<00:03:28.069> that<00:03:28.280> in<00:03:28.489> sometime<00:03:29.150> after<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.599> timer

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
to fade that in sometime after the timer

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.280 
to fade that in sometime after the timer
starts<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.790> then<00:03:31.790> feed<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.239> out<00:03:32.389> sometime

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
starts and then feed it out sometime

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.069 
starts and then feed it out sometime
before<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.709> timer<00:03:33.919> ends<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:35.480> you'll<00:03:35.599> see<00:03:35.840> now

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
before the timer ends and you'll see now

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.220 
before the timer ends and you'll see now
that<00:03:36.440> the<00:03:37.370> timer<00:03:37.639> just<00:03:37.790> fades<00:03:38.239> out<00:03:38.480> after

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
that the timer just fades out after

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.439 
that the timer just fades out after
about<00:03:39.260> five<00:03:39.620> seconds<00:03:40.129> and<00:03:40.730> then<00:03:40.790> fades<00:03:41.180> back

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
about five seconds and then fades back

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.220 
about five seconds and then fades back
in<00:03:41.510> at<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.049> end<00:03:42.199> which<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.530> what<00:03:42.769> I<00:03:42.799> want<00:03:43.040> and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
in at the end which is what I want and

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.080 
in at the end which is what I want and
one<00:03:45.230> last<00:03:45.379> thing<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.919> if<00:03:45.949> you<00:03:46.280> don't<00:03:46.489> have<00:03:46.699> the

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
one last thing is if you don't have the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.000 
one last thing is if you don't have the
black<00:03:47.329> restore<00:03:47.810> effect<00:03:48.169> since<00:03:48.500> all<00:03:48.799> the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
black restore effect since all the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.580 
black restore effect since all the
versions<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.609> Vegas<00:03:49.970> don't<00:03:50.150> you<00:03:51.019> can<00:03:51.260> use

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
versions of Vegas don't you can use

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.710 
versions of Vegas don't you can use
threshold<00:03:52.400> which<00:03:52.819> does<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.299> same<00:03:53.329> thing

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
threshold which does the same thing

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.949 
threshold which does the same thing
basically<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:55.180> yeah<00:03:56.180> that's<00:03:56.540> about<00:03:56.660> it
