00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
taller other rooks are actually probably

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.569 
taller other rooks are actually probably
the<00:00:45.180> worst<00:00:45.360> piece<00:00:45.600> NC<00:00:46.020> no<00:00:46.649> actually<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the worst piece NC no actually which is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.299 
the worst piece NC no actually which is
exactly<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.600> ends<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> position<00:00:49.559> actually

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
exactly it ends on a position actually

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.670 
exactly it ends on a position actually
the<00:00:50.520> question<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.969> hear<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> most<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.989> night<00:00:52.590> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
the question I hear the most is night is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.080 
the question I hear the most is night is
really<00:00:52.920> good<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> move<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:54.000> bit

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
really good if you can move a little bit

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.340 
really good if you can move a little bit
faster<00:00:54.510> partner<00:00:54.809> yeah<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.800> good<00:00:55.949> yeah

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
faster partner yeah that's a good yeah

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
faster partner yeah that's a good yeah
it's<00:00:58.350> such<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> tricky<00:00:59.129> question<00:00:59.340> answer

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it's such a tricky question answer

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
it's such a tricky question answer
because<00:01:00.359> different<00:01:00.960> positions<00:01:01.590> are<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
because different positions are going to

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.109 
because different positions are going to
be<00:01:02.070> different<00:01:02.280> pieces<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.170> really<00:01:05.119> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
be different pieces and it's really the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
be different pieces and it's really the
best<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.720> put<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:08.010> different

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
best way I can put it is at different

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
best way I can put it is at different
times<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.659> piece<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.560> more

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
times a piece is going to be more

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.120 
times a piece is going to be more
valuable<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:12.680> different<00:01:13.680> parts<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> game

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
valuable in different parts of the game

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.330 
valuable in different parts of the game
so<00:01:14.820> for<00:01:15.030> example<00:01:15.060> upon<00:01:15.990> pawns<00:01:16.770> are<00:01:17.009> actually

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so for example upon pawns are actually

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.320 
so for example upon pawns are actually
really<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.909> good<00:01:18.770> up<00:01:19.770> till<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.189> move<00:01:20.850> 10

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
really really good up till about move 10

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.010 
really really good up till about move 10
after<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.439> ah<00:01:24.350> ponds<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.820> valley<00:01:27.180> dropped<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
after that ah ponds the valley dropped a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.450 
after that ah ponds the valley dropped a
little<00:01:28.290> bit<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.650> could<00:01:28.829> have<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:28.979> kind<00:01:29.430> of

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
little bit if I could have some kind of

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.870 
little bit if I could have some kind of
peace<00:01:29.670> or<00:01:29.880> that's<00:01:30.299> coming<00:01:30.590> anything<00:01:31.880> you

alright<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.750> anyways<00:02:13.750> material<00:02:14.260> material

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
alright so anyways material material

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.130 
alright so anyways material material
again<00:02:15.610> can<00:02:15.850> vary<00:02:16.060> quite<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.390> bit<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:19.780> far<00:02:20.050> as

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
again can vary quite a bit as far as

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.590 
again can vary quite a bit as far as
everything<00:02:20.320> else<00:02:20.560> is<00:02:20.830> concerned<00:02:21.510> pieces<00:02:22.510> are

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
everything else is concerned pieces are

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.250 
everything else is concerned pieces are
roughly<00:02:22.990> about<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.260> same<00:02:24.060> strength<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.480> know<00:02:26.230> I

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
roughly about the same strength I know I

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.050 
roughly about the same strength I know I
think<00:02:26.620> another<00:02:26.830> big<00:02:27.100> Methvin<00:02:27.490> bughouse<00:02:27.670> is

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
think another big Methvin bughouse is

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.410 
think another big Methvin bughouse is
that<00:02:28.270> nice<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.690> find<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.050> Bishop<00:02:29.820> Bishop<00:02:30.820> e7
