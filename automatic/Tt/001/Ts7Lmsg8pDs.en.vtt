00:00:01.128 --> 00:00:05.842
This Spoon EG6 is the typical representative
of lightweight FF sports cars.

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:15.016
There's less grip with street tires compared to S tires,
so this time we concentrated on suspension stroke

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:23.207
tuning, to gain more grip without having to rely on high grip tires.
That's the overall settings of this car.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.403
This is good.

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:32.803
It makes you feel going very fast.

00:00:34.462 --> 00:00:36.639
Of course, this is VTEC engine.

00:00:36.707 --> 00:00:38.748
Even its sound is impressive.

00:00:43.786 --> 00:00:48.030
The steering time in this
measured section is a bit longer though.

00:00:52.627 --> 00:00:55.620
Its overall time is slower
than Spirits MR-S.

00:00:58.126 --> 00:01:01.119
And this car isn't even
wearing the S tires.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.894
The overall suspension
balance is very impressive.

00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:10.773
It makes you feel like there's no
need for FR if the FF goes like this.

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:17.272
It's good.

00:01:19.084 --> 00:01:21.813
It's very easy to control.

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:28.086
In the history of Civic model, this one is
the most liked model by Ichishima Spoon CEO,

00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:33.174
from the point of view of overall packaging.
It doesn't remind you of 10+ year old car.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:34.964
Let's not overdo this.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.917
Isn't the suspension a bit too stiff?

00:01:45.332 --> 00:01:49.092
Taniguchi's impression is different
than Orido's and DoriDori's impression.

00:01:49.118 --> 00:01:51.887
He's definitely concerned about
the suspension stiffness.

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:57.798
The second car from FF
squad is Phase Integra R.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:06.888
We've upgraded bushings and changed the damper
characteristics, to let the suspension move

00:02:06.914 --> 00:02:14.087
more precisely, so I'm pretty confident it
will drive just fine even on this harsh course.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.411
The suspension moves nicely.

00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:23.465
Feels like a racing car!

00:02:25.031 --> 00:02:26.184
The rebound is ok.

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.901
This machine has received many
praises on the circuit and keeps

00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:33.463
impressing even here without any
major changes to the suspension.

00:02:33.463 --> 00:02:37.261
The suspension is bit
stiffer and the car bounces

00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:41.083
here and there though.
It's slightly more jumpy.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.172
The engine is good.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:54.585
Brakes feel good too.

00:02:57.368 --> 00:03:02.411
It seems to be going fast on the outside
but still falling behind the Spirits MR-S.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.965
The suspension is a bit too stiff.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.931
Engine feels good though.

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:24.397
The turn-in feels good.

00:03:29.852 --> 00:03:31.958
It's good, the acceleration
builds up nicely.

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.112
Spoon Civic vs. Spirits MR-S.

00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:41.493
DoriDori is starting in the lead,
has he got some racing strategy?

00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:42.803
It's a sudden start!

00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:44.257
Civic vs. MR-S.

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:47.656
He's fast.

00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:00.598
The cornering of MR-S feels just right.

00:04:01.538 --> 00:04:04.663
The MR-S is sticking to
his tail from the start.

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:06.893
He's surprisingly behind me.

00:04:07.204 --> 00:04:10.129
MR-S keeps tailing the
Civic with a full throttle

00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:13.197
while the FF Civic can't floor
the throttle completely.

00:04:16.835 --> 00:04:19.012
The cornering of MR-S is faster.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.516
MR-S is still locked on the Civic
tail even though DoriDori used 1st

00:04:23.542 --> 00:04:27.135
gear and half clutch technique
going through the hairpin corner.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.145
The balance of MR-S is good.

00:04:41.653 --> 00:04:43.762
MR-S manages to win the battle.

00:04:43.963 --> 00:04:46.424
The MR-S's balance is good.

00:04:46.964 --> 00:04:54.009
Let's keep the cars without the roof
off the Touge, it's very dangerous.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.263
Let's put a roof on my car. Right.
