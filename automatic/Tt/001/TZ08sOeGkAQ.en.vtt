 Japanese mid confirmed that Tokyo 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.750
 intends to keep working on 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.519
 know the year to prepare for it 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.410
 visits and the president of russia for 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.100
 possible conclusion of a peace treaty 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.740
 between countries Russia Japan already 70 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.449
 years can not sign a peace treaty 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.920
 one of the cornerstones with the contract 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.750
 is territorial affiliation 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 South Kuril Islands 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.449
 Iturup and Kunashir Shikotan and the archipelagoes 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.860
 Obama they can offer you what 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.240
 interested let's say massive 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 investments 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.880
 technology export for far development 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.940
 east and realizations here are territories 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.730
 special development is our strategic 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.610
 now target in the far east 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.740
 but it is difficult to determine the price of these islands 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.710
 Zhirinovsky made courage on himself and and 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.320
 determined 1 trillion by 250 billion 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.860
 for every island but it's so a joke for a 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.720
 Generally on the territory without trading that on 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.480
 actually impede the conclusion 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.280
 peace treaty after so many years 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.350
 Japan is now the key 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.910
 ally and conductor american 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.400
 politics in the pacific 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.160
 here on okinawa is the largest 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.920
 American military base is possible and 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.080
 rapprochement between russia and japan means collapse 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.960
 US strategy in the Pacific Ocean 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.590
 so that japan would remain in the american 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.450
 leash 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.760
 white house skillfully used 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.070
 Japanâ€™s territorial disputes with its neighbors 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.410
 countries to create an image of the enemy in 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.360
 japanese consciousness need 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.070
 pro-american course of japan 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.410
 due to support from 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.390
 Washington in question Russian smoked 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.490
 Senkaku Chinese Archipelago 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.630
 and the korean island then it turns out 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.610
 that settling a relationship 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.500
 not so much Japanese 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.300
 Revanchism I come across she is quite 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.160
 grounded Russian patriotism 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.950
 how many geopolitical intrigues 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.130
 washington and what happens if these 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.069
 territorial issues will be resolved 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.369
 will tokyo remain in assalam us 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.770
 to conclude a treaty with japan 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:14.010
 general political who would define 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.700
 when the guidelines of our cooperation 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.459
 in the 21st century, well, it is another thing to conclude 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.409
 peace treaty all the more summing up we 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.480
 results of the second world war 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.430
 but it is complete nonsense large 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.700
 Japanese business when he is interested and 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.190
 the introduction of some cases he does not 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.180
 understands these questions them this is not 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.000
 interested in 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.019
 and look read this blogosphere in 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.209
 which service 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.790
 that you are fooling us and so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.519
 rest 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.500
 Russia can effectively use 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.790
 Kuril goats 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.709
 for example offer japan peaceful 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.989
 contracts in exchange for the transfer of Russia 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.930
 American military base and entry into 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.970
 Eurasian Union here and see what
