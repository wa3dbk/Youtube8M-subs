00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
has to do with the ways that these clays

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.490 
has to do with the ways that these clays
are<00:00:10.910> falling<00:00:11.910> into<00:00:13.160> flowing<00:00:14.160> into<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:15.500> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
are falling into flowing into the the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.939 
are falling into flowing into the the
opening<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.330> I'll<00:00:18.750> show<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.170> how<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.529> works

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
here is on/off I'll switch it on we're

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.470 
here is on/off I'll switch it on we're
hooked<00:00:28.199> up<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> battery<00:00:29.039> you'll<00:00:29.970> see<00:00:30.240> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
hooked up on the battery you'll see that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.060 
hooked up on the battery you'll see that
both<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> wobbler<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:32.520> thrower<00:00:33.329> are<00:00:34.070> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
both the wobbler and the thrower are the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.240 
both the wobbler and the thrower are the
big<00:00:35.250> ones<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.730> then<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.270> key<00:00:36.870> fob<00:00:37.079> which<00:00:37.920> I'm

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
big ones and then the key fob which I'm

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
big ones and then the key fob which I'm
hanging<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:40.250> attempt<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> try<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.930> keep

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
hanging here as a attempt to try to keep

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.459 
hanging here as a attempt to try to keep
that<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.800> being<00:00:43.980> lost<00:00:44.390> so<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.809> I'm<00:00:46.320> going

that for being lost so it's on I'm going

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.670 
that for being lost so it's on I'm going
to<00:00:46.530> be<00:00:46.590> super<00:00:46.920> careful<00:00:48.350> because<00:00:49.350> it'll<00:00:49.559> hurt

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
to be super careful because it'll hurt

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.310

you so I'll show you how it works and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.740 
you so I'll show you how it works and
then<00:00:53.309> hopefully<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.789> will<00:00:53.850> jam<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> see

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
then hopefully it will jam so you see

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.610 
then hopefully it will jam so you see
how<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.309> may<00:00:56.309> mess<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.410> when<00:00:58.410> everything

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
how it may mess up so when everything

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.250 
how it may mess up so when everything
works<00:00:58.980> okay<00:00:59.570> you<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.780> how<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
works okay you see how it's in the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.859 
works okay you see how it's in the
silver<00:01:01.739> tray<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.850> watch<00:01:04.339> okay<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.630> over

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
silver tray now watch okay and it's over

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:07.899 
silver tray now watch okay and it's over
the<00:01:06.900> tree<00:01:07.200> right<00:01:07.409> now

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
the tree right now

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.030 
the tree right now
okay<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> jammed<00:01:09.740> all<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:10.979> I'm

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
okay good it jammed all right so I'm

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.410 
okay good it jammed all right so I'm
going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> turn<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.520> off<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.180> cut

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
going to turn it off so I don't cut

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.469 
going to turn it off so I don't cut
myself<00:01:13.670> off

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
myself off

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
myself off
now<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.500> look<00:01:17.299> see<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.890> clay<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.490> not

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
now if you look see how the clay is not

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.690 
now if you look see how the clay is not
flat<00:01:22.009> let's<00:01:23.009> see<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.280> can<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.549> better

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
flat let's see if we can get a better

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
flat let's see if we can get a better
angle<00:01:24.770> okay<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.030> were<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> push<00:01:27.479> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
angle okay so if you were to push that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.120 
angle okay so if you were to push that
I'll<00:01:27.930> go<00:01:28.110> ahead<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.350> show<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.770> happens

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I'll go ahead and show you what happens

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.620 
I'll go ahead and show you what happens
as<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> result

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
as a result

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.749 
as a result
I'm<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> turn<00:01:31.049> back<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.549> it's<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I'm going to turn back on it's going to

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:42.920 
I'm going to turn back on it's going to
shatter<00:01:35.090> watch<00:01:40.040> okay<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.970> piece<00:01:42.240> flew<00:01:42.659> over

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
shatter watch okay and a piece flew over

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.410 
shatter watch okay and a piece flew over
there<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.549> part<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> danger<00:01:45.270> and

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
there so that's part of the danger and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.670 
there so that's part of the danger and
you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.630> see<00:01:45.780> what<00:01:45.899> happens<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.500> when

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
you can see what happens to them when

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.850 
you can see what happens to them when
they<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> stuck

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they do and see if it this one is stuck

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.209 
they do and see if it this one is stuck
as<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.509> we've<00:01:54.659> been<00:01:54.689> doing<00:01:55.159> is<00:01:56.159> just

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
as well so what we've been doing is just

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.800 
as well so what we've been doing is just
kind<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> jamming<00:01:56.969> our<00:01:57.060> finger<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.630> there

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
kind of jamming our finger up in there

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.330 
kind of jamming our finger up in there
and<00:01:58.170> dropping<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.460> now<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.630> fine<00:02:01.219> and<00:02:02.219> we'll

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and dropping it now it's fine and we'll

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.020 
and dropping it now it's fine and we'll
watch<00:02:02.549> watch<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:07.409> there<00:02:07.590> goes<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> that's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
watch watch so there goes so that's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.240 
watch watch so there goes so that's
probably<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> problem

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
probably the problem

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.770 
probably the problem
and<00:02:11.250> we'll<00:02:11.400> see<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.790> can<00:02:11.940> get<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.120> fixed<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and we'll see if we can get it fixed and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.740 
and we'll see if we can get it fixed and
then<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:14.099> want<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.030> show<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.239> everything<00:02:15.420> else

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
