stronger<00:01:06.210> get<00:01:06.510> bigger<00:01:06.750> at<00:01:06.930> natural<00:01:07.320> means

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
stronger get bigger at natural means

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.090 
stronger get bigger at natural means
it's<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> natural<00:01:08.490> steroid<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's like a natural steroid and

it's like a natural steroid and
different<00:01:11.100> companies<00:01:11.430> try<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> figure<00:01:12.000> out

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
different companies try to figure out

different companies try to figure out
how<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> make<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> creatine<00:01:12.960> work<00:01:13.229> better<00:01:13.530> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
how to make the creatine work better so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
how to make the creatine work better so
what<00:01:14.610> they<00:01:14.760> did<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:15.180> they<00:01:15.689> added<00:01:16.020> simple

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
what they did was they added simple

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.660 
what they did was they added simple
sugars<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.159> made<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
sugars to it and now made it the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.170 
sugars to it and now made it the
creatine<00:01:18.270> HP<00:01:19.040> high-performance<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.880> idea

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
creatine HP high-performance the idea

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
creatine HP high-performance the idea
was<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> could<00:01:21.930> increase<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.770> insulin

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
was if you could increase your insulin

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.679 
was if you could increase your insulin
after<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.430> workout<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.150> could<00:01:24.270> shuttle<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
after your workout you could shuttle the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.210 
after your workout you could shuttle the
creatine<00:01:25.110> into<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> muscle<00:01:25.680> faster<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
creatine into the muscle faster and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
creatine into the muscle faster and
store<00:01:26.430> more<00:01:26.640> creatine<00:01:27.119> make<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> more

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
store more creatine make it more

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.469 
store more creatine make it more
anabolic<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.130> become<00:01:29.490> bigger<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.240> stronger

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
anabolic and become bigger and stronger

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.219 
anabolic and become bigger and stronger
faster<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> great<00:01:32.610> theory<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.689> even

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
faster this was a great theory and even

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
faster this was a great theory and even
some<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> scientific<00:01:35.009> evidence<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.729> know

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
some of the scientific evidence you know

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.330 
some of the scientific evidence you know
did<00:01:36.180> show<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> increase<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.740> insulin<00:01:38.159> all

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
did show the increase in insulin all

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.740 
did show the increase in insulin all
this<00:01:38.460> different<00:01:38.640> stuff<00:01:38.939> but<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.329> turned<00:01:39.659> out

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
this different stuff but it turned out

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
this different stuff but it turned out
to<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:40.020> bro<00:01:40.290> science<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.310> didn't<00:01:41.610> work<00:01:41.820> people

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
to be bro science it didn't work people

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
to be bro science it didn't work people
got<00:01:42.420> fatter<00:01:43.040> anybody<00:01:44.040> who's<00:01:44.189> taken<00:01:44.549> that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
got fatter anybody who's taken that

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.899 
got fatter anybody who's taken that
celtech<00:01:45.360> product<00:01:45.869> knows<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:47.399> yes<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.729> get

celtech product knows that yes you get
bigger<00:01:48.119> but<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.450> got<00:01:48.780> back<00:01:49.320> not<00:01:50.009> better<00:01:50.220> that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
bigger but you got back not better that

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.590 
bigger but you got back not better that
period<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.670> fast<00:01:53.670> forward<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.149> people<00:01:54.540> are

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
period so fast forward now people are

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.690 
period so fast forward now people are
doing<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.899> pop-tart<00:01:55.170> loading<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.549> they're

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
doing this pop-tart loading and they're

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.920 
doing this pop-tart loading and they're
eating<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> pop-tarts<00:01:57.420> after<00:01:57.780> their

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
tastes better than a bowl of rice or

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.180 
tastes better than a bowl of rice or
they<00:03:47.609> taste<00:03:47.849> better<00:03:48.120> than<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.389> sweet<00:03:48.959> potato

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
they taste better than a sweet potato

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.289 
they taste better than a sweet potato
and<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:50.370> trick<00:03:50.579> themselves<00:03:51.000> into<00:03:51.180> thinking

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
and they trick themselves into thinking

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.180 
and they trick themselves into thinking
that<00:03:51.569> it's<00:03:51.690> okay<00:03:51.780> because<00:03:52.229> some<00:03:52.530> coach<00:03:52.829> told

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190

that it's okay because some coach told
them<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.459> it's<00:03:53.549> okay

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
them that it's okay

hormone that is highest stuff to your
workout<00:04:42.360> why<00:04:42.720> would<00:04:42.930> you<00:04:43.020> want<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.260> blunt<00:04:43.440> that

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
workout why would you want to blunt that

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.350 
workout why would you want to blunt that
that's<00:04:43.920> gonna<00:04:44.160> build<00:04:44.370> mass<00:04:44.580> muscle<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.210> burn

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
that's gonna build mass muscle and burn

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.960 
that's gonna build mass muscle and burn
fat<00:04:45.680> pop-tarts<00:04:46.680> technically<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:47.460> it<00:04:47.640> did<00:04:47.820> work

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
fat pop-tarts technically if it did work

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.490 
fat pop-tarts technically if it did work
we're<00:04:48.210> only<00:04:48.300> gonna<00:04:48.510> build<00:04:48.750> muscle<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.230> add

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
we're only gonna build muscle and add

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.750 
we're only gonna build muscle and add
fat<00:04:49.830> because<00:04:50.160> insulin<00:04:50.460> is

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
fat because insulin is

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.940 
fat because insulin is
non-discriminatory<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:52.170> doesn't<00:04:52.440> go<00:04:52.590> just<00:04:52.860> to

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
non-discriminatory it doesn't go just to

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.590 
non-discriminatory it doesn't go just to
muscle<00:04:53.220> cells<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:53.520> goes<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:53.760> fat<00:04:54.000> cells<00:04:54.300> also

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
muscle cells it goes to fat cells also

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.480 
muscle cells it goes to fat cells also
so<00:04:55.290> if<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.440> increase<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:55.860> there's<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.340> much

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
so if you increase that there's a much

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.390 
so if you increase that there's a much
better<00:04:56.640> chance<00:04:56.880> you're<00:04:57.090> going<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.450> get<00:04:57.630> fat<00:04:58.020> so

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
better chance you're going to get fat so

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.680 
better chance you're going to get fat so
now<00:04:59.400> we<00:04:59.460> have<00:04:59.820> the<00:05:00.150> train<00:05:00.330> of<00:05:00.450> thought<00:05:00.570> of

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
now we have the train of thought of

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.360 
now we have the train of thought of
being<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.930> opposite<00:05:01.380> don't<00:05:01.770> eat<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.100> carbs

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
being the opposite don't eat the carbs

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.760 
being the opposite don't eat the carbs
after<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.730> workout<00:05:03.200> use<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.320> branched<00:05:04.620> chain

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
after the workout use the branched chain

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.020 
after the workout use the branched chain
amino<00:05:04.800> acid<00:05:05.400> to<00:05:05.460> let<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.730> growth<00:05:05.880> hormone

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
amino acid to let the growth hormone

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.270 
amino acid to let the growth hormone
would<00:05:06.300> be<00:05:06.450> high<00:05:06.690> intake<00:05:07.560> tin<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:07.950> the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
would be high intake tin so the

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.580 
would be high intake tin so the
carbohydrates<00:05:09.090> about<00:05:09.540> 25<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.200> 30<00:05:10.410> minutes

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
carbohydrates about 25 to 30 minutes

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.620 
carbohydrates about 25 to 30 minutes
after<00:05:10.830> you<00:05:11.670> leave<00:05:11.850> your<00:05:12.000> growth<00:05:12.150> hormone<00:05:12.180> high

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
after you leave your growth hormone high

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.890 
after you leave your growth hormone high
like<00:05:12.810> that<00:05:13.190> now<00:05:14.190> I've<00:05:14.790> been<00:05:15.030> trying<00:05:15.240> this<00:05:15.630> and

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
like that now I've been trying this and

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.570 
like that now I've been trying this and
experimenting<00:05:16.740> with<00:05:16.860> this<00:05:16.980> and<00:05:17.040> it<00:05:17.250> does<00:05:17.430> make

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
experimenting with this and it does make

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.300 
experimenting with this and it does make
a<00:05:17.640> big<00:05:17.910> difference<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.510> do<00:05:19.080> retain<00:05:19.800> less<00:05:20.040> fat

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
a big difference you do retain less fat

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.430 
a big difference you do retain less fat
in<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:20.490> offseason<00:05:20.850> by<00:05:21.510> not<00:05:21.750> having<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.080> carbs

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
in the offseason by not having the carbs

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.910 
in the offseason by not having the carbs
after<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.770> workout<00:05:23.070> like<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.990> also<00:05:24.990> what

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
after the workout like that also what

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.830 
after the workout like that also what
they're<00:05:26.100> leaving<00:05:26.370> out<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.700> some<00:05:27.600> of<00:05:27.720> these

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
they're leaving out is some of these
