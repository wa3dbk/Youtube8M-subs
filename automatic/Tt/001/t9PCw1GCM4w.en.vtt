00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hi All, Swami John Hess Canal 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.130
 palms and today I will tell you about but to 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.020
 Sorry I will not show how stupid board and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.830
 but instead of that I did not show I 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 I will try to tell you very detailed 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 let's show you some skateboards 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.939
 I have what I did myself 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 here are two skateboards 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:42.540
 how to make one phone number here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 this phone's start over Neva 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:59.430
 of the year I took such a very flat 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:01:02.280
 cardboard and so embellished and and then I 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.580
 stuck such a sticker can and 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.189
 paint with pencils and felt-tip pens 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.490
 shining there all chemistry hands and so 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.760
 Further, here's the case I just went on the glue 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.009
 dozens 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:25.670
 that's what the wheels are 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:28.530
 These wheels are like people on handles 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 there are such things at the ends that 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:43.140
 unscrew and here I took a bite from 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:48.390
 I don't know how colored pens 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.030
 tell how to explain supra it here 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.050
 in short something like this so on the end of some 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.630
 pens and there are such and I will say it again 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.479

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.910
 well ka in is called and roundels 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:11.670

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.770
 a few years twenty to twenty 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:23.590

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:31.180
 that 's it. surprisingly can whole on 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:34.800

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.800

 five seconds and stuck like that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.180

 In general , they did not dry out. 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.209

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.840
 because we have such little pens 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.480
