00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 chucha and folklore to do what 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.649
 same this kind of revenue from things that 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.740
 they are not programmed well they are not well 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.019
 sealed look like the charge already and the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.750
 the woman this was compensating 100 kilos 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.990
 of weight or anything like that but 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.960
 can cause accidents by 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.850
 lack of preparation and destination at the time 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.000
 to do that nobody can control it 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.220
 the accidents happen there are the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 accidents happen and they may have 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.530
 terrible consequences 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 this time the girl chuchi del folklore 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.230
 this sonic came in the ambulance 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.130
 this channel 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.460
 and this happily without major damage just 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.079
 fastened the neck for a le 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.320
 They put what's called a collar 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.530
 no and they took her to a hospital but she 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.530
 could have destroyed the skull look 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.040
 so it came out we could have broken the 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.110
 column on anything that had 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.060
 fatal consequences then here not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.300
 we are saying that the show does not 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.090
 I do not think that sometimes you do not have to 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.770
 improvise so quickly and easily and that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.800
 not only goes for this program the 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.020
 tomorrow it goes to anybody else or whatever 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.060
 it happens that sometimes they get excited about 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.030
 hour that people are on the air and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.310
 well they can therefore cause damage to a 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.350
 person without the slightest intention 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.899
 when we saw there an evil what it was carrying 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.729
 the tarazona and recontra returned to 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.340
 load and reload it and return it 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.220
 to lift and that being one of those 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.520
 it escapes it is released and never gives 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.130
 someone then you have to sometimes take yourself 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.210
 things with a little more preparation 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.540
 because in addition here 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.780
 to a fall can bring consequences 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.600
 fatal that we do not want to see anymore in 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.180
 television so I ask a little bit of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.580
 sanity nothing more a little and stop 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.500
 do so that accidents do not happen like 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.500
 these because they are accidents
