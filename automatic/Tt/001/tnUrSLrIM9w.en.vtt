release<00:00:47.120> when<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.149> first<00:00:48.450> got<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> script<00:00:48.840> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
release when I first got the script is

release when I first got the script is
called<00:00:49.200> Sentinel<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.570> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
called Sentinel actually but I think it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.920 
called Sentinel actually but I think it
was<00:00:52.110> changed<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> earth<00:00:53.129> shot<00:00:53.489> because<00:00:53.930> there

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
was changed to earth shot because there

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.430 
was changed to earth shot because there
was<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.110> shock<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> play<00:00:58.379> it

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
was that shock in it and now I play it

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.119 
was that shock in it and now I play it
with<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> cyber<00:00:59.129> rised<00:00:59.430> audio<00:01:03.799> when<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> first

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
with the cyber rised audio when I first

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.380 
with the cyber rised audio when I first
got<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> script<00:01:05.519> used<00:01:05.760> all<00:01:05.909> Sentinel

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
got the script used all Sentinel

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.620 
got the script used all Sentinel
actually<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.729> changed<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
actually but I think it's changed to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.289 
actually but I think it's changed to
earth<00:01:09.810> shock<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.610> there<00:01:11.610> was<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.760> shock

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
earth shock because there was that shock

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.460
