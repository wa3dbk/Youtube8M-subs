that's<00:00:49.770> absolutely<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> correct<00:00:50.670> search<00:00:51.059> if

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that's absolutely the correct search if

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.430 
that's absolutely the correct search if

the positions and converted them in the

the positions and converted them in the

center backs and then he took out the

and by the time they get to their full
potential<00:01:55.790> potential<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.939> see<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
potential potential you see the the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
potential potential you see the the
drastic<00:01:58.500> difference<00:01:58.890> between<00:01:59.250> those<00:01:59.369> two

drastic difference between those two

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.310 
drastic difference between those two
players<00:01:59.850> development<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:01.200> have

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
players development and they have

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.620 
players development and they have
completely<00:02:02.070> difference<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.390> not

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
completely difference that it's not

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
completely difference that it's not
remotely<00:02:04.229> identical<00:02:04.890> maybe<00:02:05.159> some<00:02:05.399> stats<00:02:05.640> look

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
remotely identical maybe some stats look

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.459 
remotely identical maybe some stats look
similar<00:02:06.270> here<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.719> but<00:02:06.960> it<00:02:07.290> just

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
similar here and there but it just

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.960 
similar here and there but it just
doesn't<00:02:07.740> make<00:02:07.829> any<00:02:07.890> sense<00:02:08.099> those<00:02:08.759> were<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
doesn't make any sense those were to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.969 
doesn't make any sense those were to
play<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.450> review<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> play<00:02:10.110> stats<00:02:10.440> before

play the review of the play stats before
May<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.819> is

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
May and this is

May and this is
the<00:02:12.470> may<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.920> this<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.520> on<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.670> 1st<00:02:14.000> of<00:02:14.150> may<00:02:14.390> as

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
the may and this is on the 1st of may as

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.360 
the may and this is on the 1st of may as
they're<00:02:14.750> about<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.470> receive<00:02:15.740> a<00:02:15.800> boost<00:02:16.160> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
they're about to receive a boost and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.370 
they're about to receive a boost and
overall<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.300> potential<00:02:17.840> stays<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.350> same

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
overall and the potential stays the same

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.990 
overall and the potential stays the same
until<00:02:18.950> they<00:02:19.070> get<00:02:19.190> promoted<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.760> the<00:02:19.850> first

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
until they get promoted to the first

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.120 
until they get promoted to the first
team<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:20.600> then<00:02:20.900> their<00:02:21.080> potentials<00:02:21.620> changes

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
team and then their potentials changes

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.910 
team and then their potentials changes
and<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:23.210> potentials<00:02:23.780> potentials<00:02:24.530> change<00:02:24.770> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
and the potentials potentials change you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.270 
and the potentials potentials change you
can<00:02:25.040> see<00:02:25.070> Schwab<00:02:25.550> is<00:02:25.990> 67<00:02:26.990> to<00:02:27.170> 71<00:02:27.680> overall

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
can see Schwab is 67 to 71 overall

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.540 
can see Schwab is 67 to 71 overall
potential<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.240> still<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.380> same<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.040> look

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
potential is still the same and you look

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.130 
potential is still the same and you look
at<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.730> future<00:02:31.910> projection<00:02:32.570> on<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.840> stack

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
at the future projection on that stack

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.470 
at the future projection on that stack
and<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.920> right<00:02:34.280> there<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.550> what<00:02:35.090> he<00:02:35.120> will

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
and that right there is what he will

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.120 
and that right there is what he will
look<00:02:35.690> like<00:02:35.900> by<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.260> time<00:02:36.530> he<00:02:36.650> gets<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.950> his

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
look like by the time he gets to his

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.460 
look like by the time he gets to his
full<00:02:37.370> potential<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:38.240> first<00:02:38.510> part<00:02:38.840> is<00:02:39.050> when

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
full potential the first part is when

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.170 
full potential the first part is when
his<00:02:39.620> current<00:02:39.890> overall<00:02:40.220> might<00:02:40.520> look<00:02:40.700> like<00:02:40.760> and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
his current overall might look like and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.270 
his current overall might look like and
in<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.570> first<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.110> second<00:02:42.470> part<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:42.830> what<00:02:43.040> his

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
in the first the second part is what his

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.920 
in the first the second part is what his
full<00:02:43.520> potential<00:02:43.880> might<00:02:44.210> look<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:44.480> once<00:02:44.840> he

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
full potential might look like once he

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.990 
full potential might look like once he
gets<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.530> then<00:02:45.710> you<00:02:46.100> saw<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.490> on<00:02:46.640> those<00:02:46.790> two

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
gets to it then you saw it on those two

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.640 
gets to it then you saw it on those two
players<00:02:47.270> right<00:02:47.510> there<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:47.960> will<00:02:48.350> review

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
players right there and will review

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.650 
players right there and will review
their<00:02:48.860> stats<00:02:49.160> after<00:02:49.400> May<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.000> this<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.480> May

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
their stats after May so this is in May

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.960 
their stats after May so this is in May
when<00:02:50.870> they<00:02:50.990> received<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.470> boost<00:02:51.710> and<00:02:52.010> the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
when they received the boost and the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.970 
when they received the boost and the
highest<00:02:53.630> rated<00:02:53.930> player<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.320> a<00:02:54.350> physically

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
highest rated player is a physically

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.740 
highest rated player is a physically
physically<00:02:55.400> strong<00:02:55.730> player<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.090> you<00:02:56.450> can<00:02:56.600> see

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
physically strong player and you can see

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.590 
physically strong player and you can see
he<00:02:56.870> starts<00:02:57.200> at<00:02:57.320> 71<00:02:57.980> 81<00:02:58.400> strength<00:02:58.880> so<00:02:59.270> in<00:02:59.480> the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
he starts at 71 81 strength so in the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.030 
he starts at 71 81 strength so in the
Academy<00:03:00.020> he<00:03:00.140> started<00:03:00.500> at<00:03:00.620> a<00:03:00.680> pretty<00:03:00.950> low

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
Academy he started at a pretty low

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.370 
Academy he started at a pretty low
overall<00:03:01.460> and<00:03:01.700> based<00:03:02.270> on<00:03:02.450> his<00:03:02.600> potential<00:03:03.080> he

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
overall and based on his potential he

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.620 
overall and based on his potential he
received<00:03:03.770> a<00:03:03.890> lot<00:03:04.070> of<00:03:04.190> physical<00:03:04.550> boost<00:03:04.850> so<00:03:05.390> his

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
received a lot of physical boost so his

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.390 
received a lot of physical boost so his
overall<00:03:06.020> was<00:03:06.140> pretty<00:03:06.170> loaned<00:03:06.710> Academy<00:03:07.280> that

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
overall was pretty loaned Academy that

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.910 
overall was pretty loaned Academy that
explains<00:03:07.820> why<00:03:08.000> his<00:03:08.390> physicals<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.440> begin<00:03:09.740> with

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
explains why his physicals to begin with

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.560 
explains why his physicals to begin with
it's<00:03:10.160> pretty<00:03:10.460> good<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.150> could<00:03:11.300> pretty

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
it's pretty good and you could pretty

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.240 
it's pretty good and you could pretty
much<00:03:11.810> have<00:03:12.020> him<00:03:12.140> on<00:03:12.260> your<00:03:12.290> first<00:03:12.650> team<00:03:12.980> because

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
much have him on your first team because

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.670 
much have him on your first team because
if<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.520> compare<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:14.060> guy<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.300> most

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
if you compare this guy to most

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.910 
if you compare this guy to most
real-life<00:03:15.680> young<00:03:16.010> players<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.550> FIFA<00:03:17.210> they

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
real-life young players in FIFA they

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.070 
real-life young players in FIFA they
they<00:03:18.920> are<00:03:19.220> at<00:03:19.550> pretty<00:03:19.940> similar<00:03:20.360> levels<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.960> he

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
they are at pretty similar levels and he

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.650 
they are at pretty similar levels and he
has<00:03:21.170> potential<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.800> be<00:03:22.010> special<00:03:22.490> Danny<00:03:23.090> vas<00:03:23.390> is

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
has potential to be special Danny vas is

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.990 
has potential to be special Danny vas is
only<00:03:23.840> at<00:03:23.990> 61<00:03:24.560> overall<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.250> look<00:03:25.370> at<00:03:25.520> his<00:03:25.670> stats

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
only at 61 overall and look at his stats

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.700 
only at 61 overall and look at his stats
right<00:03:26.240> here<00:03:26.480> compared<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.990> Schwab<00:03:27.440> it's

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
right here compared to Schwab it's

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.350 
right here compared to Schwab it's
completely<00:03:28.340> different<00:03:28.580> and<00:03:29.000> look<00:03:29.150> at<00:03:29.240> that

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
completely different and look at that

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.180 
completely different and look at that
interception<00:03:29.900> look<00:03:30.500> at<00:03:30.680> that<00:03:30.860> attack

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
interception look at that attack

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.770 
interception look at that attack
positioning<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:31.880> look<00:03:32.030> at<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.210> vision<00:03:32.630> so

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
positioning and look at that vision so

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.540 
positioning and look at that vision so
those<00:03:33.080> will<00:03:33.320> be<00:03:33.440> in<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.620> 90s<00:03:33.770> by<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.220> time<00:03:34.460> he

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
those will be in the 90s by the time he

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.400 
those will be in the 90s by the time he
gets<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.910> 80<00:03:35.120> rated<00:03:35.510> play<00:03:35.720> which<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.140> just

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
gets the 80 rated play which is just

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.250 
gets the 80 rated play which is just
stupid<00:03:37.100> his<00:03:37.550> defensive<00:03:38.120> stats<00:03:38.360> did<00:03:38.840> receive<00:03:39.230> a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
stupid his defensive stats did receive a

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.860 
stupid his defensive stats did receive a
lot<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.890> boost<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.580> but<00:03:40.910> it's<00:03:41.300> still<00:03:41.630> there's

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
lot of boost and but it's still there's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.750 
lot of boost and but it's still there's
still<00:03:42.020> a<00:03:42.140> gap<00:03:42.680> between<00:03:42.890> his<00:03:43.250> attack<00:03:43.370> instead

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
still a gap between his attack instead

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.820 
still a gap between his attack instead
his<00:03:44.270> passing<00:03:44.720> stat<00:03:44.959> compared<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.709> his

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
his passing stat compared to his

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.680 
his passing stat compared to his
defensive<00:03:46.310> stat<00:03:46.580> as<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.820> centre-back<00:03:47.300> he's<00:03:47.570> an

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
defensive stat as a centre-back he's an

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.530 
defensive stat as a centre-back he's an
exciting<00:03:48.170> prospect<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.970> I'll<00:03:49.970> show<00:03:50.300> you<00:03:50.360> the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
exciting prospect and I'll show you the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.910 
exciting prospect and I'll show you the
first<00:03:50.720> squad<00:03:51.110> report<00:03:51.530> when<00:03:51.740> they<00:03:51.860> were

promoted before me and then the second

promoted before me and then the second
squad<00:03:54.590> report<00:03:54.980> when<00:03:55.100> they<00:03:55.220> were<00:03:55.340> promoted

squad report when they were promoted

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.940 
squad report when they were promoted
after<00:03:55.970> May<00:03:56.300> so<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.600> see<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.900> two<00:03:57.110> contrasting

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
after May so you see the two contrasting

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.280 
after May so you see the two contrasting
differences<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.300> can<00:03:59.420> see<00:03:59.570> Schwabe<00:04:00.080> was

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
differences you can see Schwabe was

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.040 
differences you can see Schwabe was
promoted<00:04:00.830> and<00:04:01.070> he<00:04:01.310> was<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.490> 49<00:04:02.000> overall<00:04:02.540> on<00:04:02.750> the

first Scout squad report and his

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.940 
first Scout squad report and his
physicals<00:04:05.600> are<00:04:05.720> starting<00:04:06.020> to<00:04:06.080> go<00:04:06.200> up<00:04:06.380> which<00:04:06.800> is

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
physicals are starting to go up which is

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.620 
physicals are starting to go up which is
a<00:04:06.980> future<00:04:07.459> projection<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.120> how<00:04:08.270> he's<00:04:08.480> gonna

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
a future projection of how he's gonna

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.390 
a future projection of how he's gonna
grow<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.410> doesn't<00:04:09.770> really<00:04:09.860> say<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.250> full

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
grow and it doesn't really say the full

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.890 
grow and it doesn't really say the full
thing<00:04:10.670> cuz<00:04:10.880> they<00:04:11.030> might<00:04:11.209> stop<00:04:11.480> growing<00:04:11.720> in

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
thing cuz they might stop growing in

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.420 
thing cuz they might stop growing in
their<00:04:12.020> physicals<00:04:12.440> once<00:04:12.950> they<00:04:13.130> get<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.400> a

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
their physicals once they get to a

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.580 
their physicals once they get to a
certain<00:04:13.459> level<00:04:13.730> 43<00:04:14.240> overall<00:04:14.720> Danny<00:04:14.959> Vaz<00:04:15.230> and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
certain level 43 overall Danny Vaz and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.710 
certain level 43 overall Danny Vaz and
that's<00:04:16.010> at<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.640> reasonable<00:04:17.180> level<00:04:17.209> is

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
that's at a reasonable level is

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.539 
that's at a reasonable level is
physicals<00:04:18.230> and<00:04:18.410> other<00:04:18.560> stats<00:04:18.890> are<00:04:19.070> going<00:04:19.370> up

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
physicals and other stats are going up

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.300 
physicals and other stats are going up
and<00:04:19.760> if<00:04:20.030> you<00:04:20.150> see<00:04:20.410> look<00:04:21.410> at<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.650> squad<00:04:21.950> report

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
and if you see look at this squad report

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.580 
and if you see look at this squad report
right<00:04:22.460> here<00:04:22.640> after<00:04:22.790> May<00:04:23.150> his<00:04:23.540> physicals<00:04:24.110> did

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
right here after May his physicals did

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.800 
right here after May his physicals did
not<00:04:24.770> go<00:04:24.979> up<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.280> single

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
not go up a single

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.810 
not go up a single
because<00:04:26.470> he's<00:04:26.740> already<00:04:26.950> at<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.460> default

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
because he's already at the default

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.730 
because he's already at the default
level<00:04:28.030> or<00:04:28.540> even<00:04:28.570> above<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:29.350> where<00:04:29.560> he's

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
level or even above it where he's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.650 
level or even above it where he's
supposed<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:30.130> be<00:04:30.190> at<00:04:30.430> based<00:04:30.700> on<00:04:30.850> his<00:04:31.030> potential

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
supposed to be at based on his potential

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.440 
supposed to be at based on his potential
so<00:04:31.930> his<00:04:32.320> physicals<00:04:32.800> won't<00:04:33.070> ever<00:04:33.340> go<00:04:33.580> up<00:04:33.610> maybe

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
so his physicals won't ever go up maybe

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.960 
so his physicals won't ever go up maybe
one<00:04:34.960> or<00:04:35.080> two<00:04:35.260> points<00:04:35.500> once<00:04:35.860> he<00:04:35.950> gets<00:04:36.130> to<00:04:36.280> 20<00:04:36.639> 21

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
one or two points once he gets to 20 21

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.280 
one or two points once he gets to 20 21
years<00:04:37.270> of<00:04:37.419> age<00:04:37.540> because<00:04:37.660> that's<00:04:37.930> when<00:04:38.139> they

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
years of age because that's when they

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.320 
years of age because that's when they
peak<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.800> you<00:04:38.950> can<00:04:39.100> see<00:04:39.280> Danny<00:04:39.820> vans<00:04:40.060> ain't

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
peak and you can see Danny vans ain't

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.270 
peak and you can see Danny vans ain't
gonna<00:04:40.419> go<00:04:40.600> up<00:04:40.720> either<00:04:40.900> cuz<00:04:41.230> he's<00:04:41.440> on<00:04:41.620> 62

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
gonna go up either cuz he's on 62

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.430 
gonna go up either cuz he's on 62
overall<00:04:42.730> and<00:04:43.000> when<00:04:43.600> they<00:04:43.720> started<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.290> high

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
meso promoting before me is the the best

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.200 
meso promoting before me is the the best
way<00:04:56.350> look<00:04:56.620> at<00:04:56.710> Schwab<00:04:57.040> at<00:04:57.220> 90<00:04:57.550> overall<00:04:57.880> take<00:04:58.180> a

good and some of his attacking stats

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.580 
good and some of his attacking stats
stop<00:05:09.880> growing<00:05:10.180> a<00:05:10.360> long<00:05:10.510> time<00:05:10.840> ago<00:05:11.080> as<00:05:11.230> I<00:05:11.350> said

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
stop growing a long time ago as I said

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.710 
stop growing a long time ago as I said
last<00:05:11.800> episode<00:05:12.370> players<00:05:12.640> have<00:05:12.880> a<00:05:12.910> certain<00:05:13.630> age

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
last episode players have a certain age

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.780 
last episode players have a certain age

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:15.790 
limit where when they hit that other

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.060 
limit where when they hit that other
stats<00:05:16.210> other<00:05:16.690> stats<00:05:17.140> and<00:05:17.320> other<00:05:17.470> categories

stats other stats and other categories

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.890 
stats other stats and other categories
will<00:05:18.280> stop<00:05:18.610> growing<00:05:18.940> so<00:05:19.120> if<00:05:19.390> you<00:05:19.479> take<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:19.720> look

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
will stop growing so if you take a look

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.780 
will stop growing so if you take a look
at<00:05:20.050> his<00:05:20.169> interceptions<00:05:20.830> most<00:05:21.310> of<00:05:21.460> his<00:05:21.580> stats

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
at his interceptions most of his stats

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.460 
at his interceptions most of his stats
hasn't<00:05:22.330> really<00:05:22.540> gone<00:05:22.690> up<00:05:22.960> but<00:05:23.080> this<00:05:23.229> was<00:05:23.440> just

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
hasn't really gone up but this was just

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.280 
hasn't really gone up but this was just
a<00:05:24.100> many<00:05:24.639> demonstration<00:05:25.389> of<00:05:25.540> what<00:05:25.840> their<00:05:26.020> stats

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
a many demonstration of what their stats

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.469 
a many demonstration of what their stats
will<00:05:26.470> look<00:05:26.650> like<00:05:26.860> based<00:05:27.370> on<00:05:27.490> for<00:05:27.700> once<00:05:28.330> they

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
will look like based on for once they

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.330 
will look like based on for once they
get<00:05:28.570> to<00:05:28.630> full<00:05:28.870> potential<00:05:29.350> look<00:05:29.500> at<00:05:29.620> Danny<00:05:29.800> vas

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
get to full potential look at Danny vas

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.010 
get to full potential look at Danny vas
if<00:05:30.490> you<00:05:30.700> compare<00:05:31.060> his<00:05:31.210> stats<00:05:31.450> to<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.720> Schwab

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
if you compare his stats to a Schwab

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.510 
if you compare his stats to a Schwab
it's<00:05:32.350> completely<00:05:32.860> different<00:05:33.070> look<00:05:33.370> at<00:05:33.460> the

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
it's completely different look at the

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.060 
it's completely different look at the
interception<00:05:33.970> vision<00:05:34.600> everything<00:05:35.200> says<00:05:35.740> he's

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
interception vision everything says he's

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.610 
interception vision everything says he's
supposed<00:05:36.430> to<00:05:36.490> be<00:05:36.640> a<00:05:36.669> cm<00:05:37.140> dribbling<00:05:38.140> is<00:05:38.320> in<00:05:38.500> the

90s as a centre-back finishing his 72
heading<00:05:41.950> everything<00:05:42.550> is<00:05:42.700> pretty<00:05:43.060> high<00:05:43.840> in<00:05:44.080> the

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
heading everything is pretty high in the

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.690 
heading everything is pretty high in the
greens<00:05:44.440> his<00:05:44.620> defensive<00:05:45.190> stats<00:05:45.430> have

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
greens his defensive stats have

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.400 
greens his defensive stats have
retracted<00:05:46.180> themselves<00:05:46.810> after<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.140> long

retracted themselves after a long
stretch<00:05:47.860> but<00:05:48.190> you<00:05:48.400> see<00:05:49.180> he's<00:05:49.330> only<00:05:49.630> growing<00:05:49.840> on

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140

his<00:05:50.440> the<00:05:50.979> stats<00:05:51.280> that<00:05:51.400> count<00:05:51.760> more<00:05:52.060> towards

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
his the stats that count more towards

his the stats that count more towards
his<00:05:52.570> overall<00:05:52.960> so<00:05:53.200> those<00:05:53.470> two<00:05:53.770> players<00:05:54.100> right

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
his overall so those two players right

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.070 
his overall so those two players right
there<00:05:54.640> or<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.970> only<00:05:55.120> possible<00:05:55.660> way<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:55.990> she

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
there or the only possible way that she

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.510 
there or the only possible way that she
can<00:05:56.169> search<00:05:56.350> for<00:05:56.560> center<00:05:56.860> backs<00:05:57.039> and<00:05:57.220> this<00:05:57.370> has

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
can search for center backs and this has

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.840 
can search for center backs and this has
