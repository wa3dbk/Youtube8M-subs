am<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> tell<00:00:50.010> him<00:00:50.160> what<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
am I to tell him what is it

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.990 
am I to tell him what is it
and<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:52.140> think<00:00:52.199> DJ<00:00:52.649> does<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.730> cup

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and I think DJ does it but this is a cup

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
and I think DJ does it but this is a cup
of<00:00:54.120> hat<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:54.899> maybe<00:00:55.140> maybe<00:00:55.739> someone<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:56.309> like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
of hat so maybe maybe someone would like

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:06.380 
of hat so maybe maybe someone would like
to<00:00:56.520> give<00:00:56.670> him<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.910> real<00:00:57.090> one<00:01:04.970> people<00:01:05.970> told<00:01:06.299> me

to give him a real one people told me
that<00:01:06.570> last<00:01:06.750> year<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.619> can't<00:01:08.310> ever<00:01:08.580> remember
