interpretation of proof frankly until
credentialed<00:03:40.030> archaeologist<00:03:40.689> has<00:03:40.780> come<00:03:41.019> in

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
credentialed archaeologist has come in

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.949 
credentialed archaeologist has come in
documented<00:03:42.280> dug<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.879> recorded<00:03:43.540> it<00:03:43.659> written

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
documented dug it recorded it written

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.960 
documented dug it recorded it written
about<00:03:44.230> do<00:03:44.620> we<00:03:44.680> know<00:03:44.859> for<00:03:45.099> sure<00:03:45.129> I<00:03:45.489> don't<00:03:45.760> think

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
about do we know for sure I don't think

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.349 
about do we know for sure I don't think
so

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
so

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.599 
so
is<00:03:46.420> it<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.200> best<00:03:47.379> place<00:03:47.530> right<00:03:47.739> now<00:03:48.069> without<00:03:48.430> a

is it the best place right now without a

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.610 
is it the best place right now without a
doubt<00:03:49.239> that's<00:03:49.810> where<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.049> have<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.290> believe<00:03:50.590> a

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
doubt that's where you have to believe a

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.099 
doubt that's where you have to believe a
little<00:03:50.859> bit<00:03:51.129> but<00:03:52.000> because<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.659> can<00:03:52.810> prove

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
little bit but because you can prove

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.410 
little bit but because you can prove
that<00:03:53.139> something<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:53.980> true<00:03:54.250> in<00:03:54.430> there<00:03:54.639> lends

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
that something is true in there lends

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.899 
that something is true in there lends
credibility<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.319> document<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.639> think

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:57.909 
credibility to the document and I think

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.240 
credibility to the document and I think
that<00:03:58.060> in<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.269> situation<00:03:58.650> we<00:03:59.650> have<00:03:59.920> a

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
that in this situation we have a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.399 
that in this situation we have a
monument<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.209> many<00:04:01.659> miracles<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.290> occurred

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
monument to many miracles that occurred

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
probably in the Old Testament more

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.720 
probably in the Old Testament more
miracles<00:04:05.170> were<00:04:05.439> performed<00:04:05.739> at<00:04:06.340> not<00:04:06.459> Sinai
