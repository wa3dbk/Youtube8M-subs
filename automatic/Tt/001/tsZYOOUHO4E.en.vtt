00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.449 
is much more about the function because
a<00:02:50.879> game<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.239> not<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> movie<00:02:51.959> means<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.739> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
a game is not a movie means that the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.270 
a game is not a movie means that the
game<00:02:53.700> is<00:02:53.940> something<00:02:54.629> that<00:02:54.870> players<00:02:55.560> have<00:02:55.590> to

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280
