00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
hundred watt that we we built we've had

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.529 
hundred watt that we we built we've had
some<00:00:28.740> requests<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:29.550> uh<00:00:29.609> basically

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
some requests for it it's uh basically

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.560 
some requests for it it's uh basically

about late 66 67 and now uses KT 66 is
has<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.680> 540<00:00:43.680> plate<00:00:44.190> volts<00:00:44.520> something<00:00:44.879> like

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
has a 540 plate volts something like

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
has a 540 plate volts something like
that<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.480> pretty<00:00:45.719> high<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> front<00:00:47.100> end

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that it's pretty high but the front end

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.130 
that it's pretty high but the front end
is<00:00:47.430> basically<00:00:47.879> just<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.300> fine-tuned<00:00:49.640> jtm<00:00:50.640> 45

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
is basically just a fine-tuned jtm 45

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
is basically just a fine-tuned jtm 45
and<00:00:54.530> I've<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:55.980> on<00:00:56.070> demo<00:00:56.370> right<00:00:56.670> now

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and I've got it on demo right now

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.029 
and I've got it on demo right now
because<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.180> basically<00:00:57.570> belongs<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> Eric

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
because it's basically belongs to a Eric

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.209 
because it's basically belongs to a Eric
Johnson<00:00:59.449> he's<00:01:00.449> uh<00:01:00.480> been<00:01:01.260> tracking<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.070> it's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
Johnson he's uh been tracking with it's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.240 
Johnson he's uh been tracking with it's
in<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> studio<00:01:02.910> using<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.739> I've<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:05.100> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
in the studio using it so I've got it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340 
in the studio using it so I've got it
back<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.670> demo<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.720> some<00:01:06.840> other<00:01:06.930> people

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
back to demo it for some other people

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
back to demo it for some other people
who<00:01:07.470> were<00:01:07.619> interested<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.790> build

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
who were interested in it so you build

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.899 
who were interested in it so you build
the<00:01:09.150> amps<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> building<00:01:09.930> apps<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.320> like

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
the amps you building apps to like

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.800 
the amps you building apps to like
specifications<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.970> people<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.360> well<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:12.780> you

specifications of people as well or you
just<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.470> build<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:14.420> yeah<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.840> if

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
just do you build them yeah we can if

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
just do you build them yeah we can if
people<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.470> requests<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.280> for

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
people have requests you know for

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.370 
people have requests you know for
example<00:01:19.369> well<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> don't<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.119> but

example well I don't have it here but

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.560 
example well I don't have it here but
it's<00:01:22.380> uh<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> bench<00:01:23.369> back<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:23.820> we

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it's uh it's on the bench back there we

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.359 
it's uh it's on the bench back there we
have<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> our<00:01:25.229> very<00:01:25.409> are<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:26.280> our

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
have one of our very are actually our

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.149 
have one of our very are actually our
very<00:01:26.580> first<00:01:26.850> 30<00:01:27.090> watt<00:01:27.270> model<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.110> use<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
very first 30 watt model that we use to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.149 
very first 30 watt model that we use to
as<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.759> build<00:01:30.000> amps<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.780> take<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> new<00:01:31.920> amp

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
as we build amps we take the new amp

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
as we build amps we take the new amp
that<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.430> finish<00:01:32.790> set<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.869> next<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> old

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that we finish set it up next to the old

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.249 
that we finish set it up next to the old
amp<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.040> compare<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> two<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.780> until

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
amp and compare the two you know until

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.899 
amp and compare the two you know until
we<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.560> them<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.100> they're<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.369> very

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
we get them like to they're just very

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.020 
we get them like to they're just very
minuscule<00:01:39.950> amounts<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> differences<00:01:41.610> between

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
minuscule amounts of differences between

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810 
minuscule amounts of differences between
the<00:01:42.390> tones<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> comes<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the tones and it comes down to it just a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.889 
the tones and it comes down to it just a
tolerance<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> tubes<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:47.630> some<00:01:48.630> people

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
tolerance of the tubes and some people

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.719 
tolerance of the tubes and some people
like<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.320> want<00:01:49.560> something<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.040> crunchy<00:01:50.549> so

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
like they want something more crunchy so

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
like they want something more crunchy so
we<00:01:50.909> add<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.210> part<00:01:51.689> some<00:01:52.500> people<00:01:52.799> want

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
we add a little part some people want

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.580 
we add a little part some people want
something<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.490> less<00:01:53.960> bright<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.470> we'll

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
something a little less bright so we'll

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
something a little less bright so we'll
take<00:01:55.799> something<00:01:56.040> out<00:01:56.280> where<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> add<00:01:57.060> for

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
take something out where you add for

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.940 
take something out where you add for
crunchiness<00:01:59.780> well<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.590> start<00:02:01.860> with

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
crunchiness well you can start with

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.500 
crunchiness well you can start with
granola

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
granola

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.830 
granola
that<00:02:04.470> now<00:02:04.650> anyway<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:06.000> change<00:02:06.510> just

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
that now anyway see you can change just

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.140 
that now anyway see you can change just
some<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> biasing<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.700> tubes<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.150 
some of the biasing of the tubes a

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.590 
some of the biasing of the tubes a
little<00:02:09.330> bit<00:02:09.510> you<00:02:09.720> can<00:02:09.840> also<00:02:11.510> there's<00:02:12.510> a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
little bit you can also there's a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.960 
little bit you can also there's a
sections<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> circuit<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.160> say<00:02:14.490> what

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
sections of the circuit that is say what

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.500 
sections of the circuit that is say what
you<00:02:15.090> would<00:02:15.210> call<00:02:15.360> passive<00:02:17.120> equalization<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
you would call passive equalization you

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.750 
you would call passive equalization you
can<00:02:18.690> change<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.170> nature<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.580> can

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
can change the nature of that you can

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
can change the nature of that you can
also<00:02:20.910> change<00:02:23.990> what<00:02:24.990> we<00:02:25.170> call<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> ground

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
also change what we call a ground

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.530 
also change what we call a ground
reference<00:02:25.920> resistor<00:02:26.550> something<00:02:27.180> like<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.510> a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
reference resistor something like that a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.930 
reference resistor something like that a
race<00:02:27.900> race<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.610> yeah<00:02:30.980> read<00:02:31.980> reference<00:02:32.460> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
race race the yeah read reference to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.490 
race race the yeah read reference to
ground<00:02:33.090> higher<00:02:33.510> so<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.110> there's<00:02:34.440> more

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
ground higher so that there's more

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.990 
ground higher so that there's more
signal<00:02:35.010> level<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.340> goes<00:02:35.460> into<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.720> circuit

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
signal level that goes into the circuit

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.520 
signal level that goes into the circuit
there's<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.330> know<00:02:39.420> things<00:02:39.690> like<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.900> some

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
there's you know things like that some

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.730 
there's you know things like that some
people<00:02:40.800> ask<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.100> a<00:02:41.250> half<00:02:41.790> power<00:02:42.090> switch<00:02:42.420> which

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
people ask for a half power switch which

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.040 
people ask for a half power switch which
we<00:02:43.740> provide<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.430> know<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.480> as<00:02:45.930> you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
we provide you know in that as you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.220 
we provide you know in that as you
change<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.470> switch<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.920> changes<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:48.230> output

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
change the switch it changes the output

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.010 
change the switch it changes the output
transformer<00:02:49.950> impedance<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:51.390> that<00:02:51.600> matches

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
transformer impedance so that matches

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.550 
transformer impedance so that matches
the<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.800> losing<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:54.240> know<00:02:54.360> some<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the the losing you know some of the the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410 
the the losing you know some of the the
you<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:55.980> two<00:02:56.160> plates<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.670> out<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.209> tubes

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
you know two plates of out of the tubes

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.850 
you know two plates of out of the tubes
you're<00:02:57.690> losing<00:02:58.020> two<00:02:58.170> of<00:02:58.200> those<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
you're losing two of those so the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.010 
you're losing two of those so the
impedance<00:02:59.520> changes<00:03:00.090> on<00:03:00.240> the<00:03:00.330> transformer<00:03:00.930> and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
impedance changes on the transformer and

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.140 
impedance changes on the transformer and
the<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> speaker<00:03:01.800> load<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.160> we<00:03:02.310> put<00:03:03.120> that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the and the speaker load so we put that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.790 
the and the speaker load so we put that
in<00:03:03.300> there<00:03:03.540> for<00:03:03.720> some<00:03:03.870> people<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.170> request<00:03:04.620> it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
in there for some people that request it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.340 
in there for some people that request it
from<00:03:05.010> playing<00:03:05.820> smaller<00:03:06.180> places<00:03:06.510> or<00:03:07.050> nerve

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
from playing smaller places or nerve

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.130 
from playing smaller places or nerve
studio<00:03:08.310> or<00:03:08.820> yeah<00:03:09.360> exactly<00:03:10.290> that's<00:03:12.050> that's<00:03:13.050> the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
studio or yeah exactly that's that's the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.010 
studio or yeah exactly that's that's the
idea<00:03:13.640> they<00:03:14.640> can<00:03:14.880> now<00:03:15.030> pull<00:03:15.300> two<00:03:15.480> tubes<00:03:15.750> out<00:03:15.959> of

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
idea they can now pull two tubes out of

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.820 
idea they can now pull two tubes out of
say<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> 30<00:03:16.680> watt<00:03:16.739> model<00:03:17.280> and<00:03:18.200> also<00:03:19.200> our<00:03:19.470> deluxe

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
say a 30 watt model and also our deluxe

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.910 
say a 30 watt model and also our deluxe
36<00:03:20.459> which<00:03:21.269> takes<00:03:21.570> two<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:22.140> six<00:03:22.650> v6<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.190> out<00:03:23.660> and

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
36 which takes two to six v6 is out and

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.699 
36 which takes two to six v6 is out and
that's<00:03:25.920> what<00:03:26.100> that's<00:03:26.610> what<00:03:27.230> some<00:03:28.230> people<00:03:28.500> like

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
that's what that's what some people like

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.460 
that's what that's what some people like
to<00:03:28.739> do<00:03:28.980> because<00:03:29.250> some<00:03:29.600> our<00:03:30.600> transformers<00:03:31.260> seem

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
to do because some our transformers seem

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.150 
to do because some our transformers seem
to<00:03:31.620> tend<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.920> be<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.570> little<00:03:33.570> bit<00:03:33.750> better

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
to tend to be a little bit better

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.800 
to tend to be a little bit better
efficient<00:03:35.160> than<00:03:35.310> regular<00:03:35.880> transformers<00:03:36.720> I

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
efficient than regular transformers I

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.150 
efficient than regular transformers I
guess<00:03:36.959> with<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.140> same<00:03:37.380> guy<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:37.830> they're<00:03:37.980> a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
guess with the same guy so they're a

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.259 
guess with the same guy so they're a
little<00:03:38.730> bit<00:03:38.850> beefier<00:03:39.300> tone<00:03:40.610> okay<00:03:41.610> yeah<00:03:41.940> that's

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
little bit beefier tone okay yeah that's

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.480 
little bit beefier tone okay yeah that's
good
