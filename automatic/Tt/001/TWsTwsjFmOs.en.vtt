a<00:03:09.090> potential<00:03:09.810> here<00:03:10.110> for<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.720> distracting<00:03:12.720> event

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
a potential here for a distracting event

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.540

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
with sports now whether that will happen

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
I don't know but the potential and the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.490 
I don't know but the potential and the
numbers<00:03:19.980> show<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.610> it's<00:03:21.300> more<00:03:21.570> likely<00:03:21.840> in

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
numbers show that it's more likely in

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.180 
numbers show that it's more likely in
this<00:03:23.310> kind<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.959> numbers<00:03:24.959> recipe<00:03:25.440> then<00:03:25.739> if

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
this kind of numbers recipe then if

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.990 
this kind of numbers recipe then if
Canada<00:03:26.760> was<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.060> a<00:03:27.150> different<00:03:27.410> cycle<00:03:28.410> so<00:03:29.310> keep

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
Canada was in a different cycle so keep

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.580 
Canada was in a different cycle so keep
