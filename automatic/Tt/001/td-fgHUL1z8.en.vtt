00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.460
 Hello everyone, Time is in Brazil. 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.650
 starting a cold front will advance 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.269
 from the southeast this weekend 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.670
 in fact it is already advancing in this 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.170
 between the south and southeast of the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.019
 mainly spreads instability 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.220
 between santa catarina paraná and the afternoon 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.349
 between the afternoon and the night the instability 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.330
 grow over the state of são paulo 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.320
 bringing once again rain of strong 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.699
 intensity 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.189
 already for the weekend the cold front 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.020
 advances some of the sea but generates 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.760
 instabilities still on the region 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.010
 and this causes the temperature to rise 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.860
 the main band 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.840
 east state of são paulo as well 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.220
 part of the paraná and santa catarina the people 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.660
 see here in the capital of São Paulo 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.970
 different from what you did during the week 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.590
 the maximum goes up a little less staying in the 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.960

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.880

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.630
 Saturday afternoon with time still good 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.490
 stuffy 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.590
 the rain for Saturday associated with the 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.420
 cold front will catch part of the southeast 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
 center but the largest accumulated 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.830
 still in the northern states 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.710
 due to tropical instabilities 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.140
 even in the region of that region 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.030

 although we have some instabilities 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.030
 but in a slightly more isolated form 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.619
 for Sunday we see that the front 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.479
 in some instabilities but still in 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.340
