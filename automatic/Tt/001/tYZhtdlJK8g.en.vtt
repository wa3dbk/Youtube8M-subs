 hello i 'm going christmas stars 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.070
 frosted to pink and blue I start with the 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.530
 outline I still hold the pocket to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:21.359
 socket 1 to 2 cm below the biscuit 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:23.880
 to steer the flow of frosting 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:31.769
 always applying uniform pressure 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:34.730
 on the socket pocket and I'm going 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.730
 fill the biscuit 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.500
 do not worry if there are holes 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.500
 we will fill them afterwards 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.870
 like this 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.550
 you then wait twelve hours for 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.530
 apply the second glaze after 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.520
 twelve o'clock 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.520
 I learned the white icing 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.590
 for a frosted effect or added sugar 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.590
 crystal right after putting the icing 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.069
 let him take two to three 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:26.239
 hours and after two hours 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.239
 you come to remove the excess 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.750
 and here is a Christmas star giedré à 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.750
