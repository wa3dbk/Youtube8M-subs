 channel I bring you a video that I know that you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.340
 will be very useful in this era 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.590
 since there are many people from 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.049
 accumulating the parties weddings 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.150
 graduations the sixth recording and everything 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.820
 that and all these events are but 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 almost same photos so 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.930
 always in these events we take 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.820
 many pictures and we always wanted 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.830
 see us better clear that you do not want to see 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
 good to a photo 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.180
 of such an important event so they 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.009
 I'm going to give several tips so it 's a 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.840
 never perfect makeup and they are small 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 details that really mark the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.800
 difference at the time of taking a photo 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.170
 It is very important that you use a 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 try both on your face sets or on 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.040
 the face there are several types of 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.949
 Evidence in tests is notifying 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.160
 refine the texture of the face the pores 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.720
 You can have dry skin but heat 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.699
 of solution can make you 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.379
 makeup melts so it's very 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.600
 important that they use that in addition 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.030
 if you aspirin the texture of the skin 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.220
 skin is going to look smoother and smoother 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.170
 above all prettier in terms of 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.570
 prevention of the eyes this is going to 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.320
 allow your shadow to last intact 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.150
 in the shadows are more intense to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.220
 long night or day is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.860
 important if you're going to make an appointment to 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.900
 do some pictures or under a then what 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 you are going to take many photos do not use 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.939
 no product that has a factor of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.939
 protection since this sunscreen 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.880
 contains titanium dioxide that what 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.960
 does is reflect light and therefore we 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.909
 candle the face 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
 white than the neck even though in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.760
 real life is new the same color 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 with the flash with the light this this 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.800
 material or this protective mineral what 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 will do is reflect what it is that 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.060
 you can practically say that it does 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.360
 with the sun the sun hits us in the face 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.580
 and this product is responsible for reflecting 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.320
 so that we do not usually stay 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.360
 pharmacy bases that I think are the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.540
 that almost all of us use or even bases 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.000
 high-end have sunscreen 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.700
 if you can find us one that does not have 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.610
 this protection factor what you can 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.269
 opting is to get one more tone 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.100
 dark that your feet is not that I look 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.580
 I am white and will put how to eliminate 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.190
 not like that but if it's one or two tones 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.050
 maximum to your skin tone and you have to 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.720
 blur it pretty well with the neck 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.060
 and the neckline what you're going to do is that if 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.120
 you are going to take the picture you are going to 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.040
 see much more couple face and not 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.549
 you're going to see that mask 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.019
 and they know it 's just for photography either 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.349
 is that you're going out on the street very 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.019
 usually with the darkest face 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.459
 but it is an easy solution for this 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.920
 problem as much as 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.299
 possible to use products that are 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.310
 you kill because I have mates because with the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.170
 simple fact of the flash you are going to sweat 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.530
 quite if there are enough photos that 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.299
 you plan to take and if you use very 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.430
 bright you can face very 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.950
 saturated and you can see your face 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.689
 greasy although you do not have anything greasy 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.209
 You can see it as too much 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.519
 brightness is very important that contours 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.879
 your face this might seem very basic 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.909
 but your face with the makeup is going to 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.829
 see plane and more with the lights is going to 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.620
 see still very flat then you need 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.049
 create those shadows that light is being 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.090
 removing you need to create dimensions 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.859
 so that your face is much more beautiful 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.019
 much more harmonious is important 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.209
 exaggerating a little bit with the tones and 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.609
 colors in your makeup when you go to 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.360
 do with a photograph I come back with the 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.670
 problem 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.860
 the color as much makeup and 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.020
 you can have a very nice makeup in 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.020
 person but when you take the pictures 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.630
 with those flashes with those lights you can 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.060
 Make your face look super washed 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.550
 as super subtle and if you do not want that 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.620
 you want it to really be enhanced get yourself 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.630
 just a little bit more than usual but 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.730
 nothing a little more is important that if 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.830
 do you have any type of steel wrinkles 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.410
 of the eyes or you are already an older person 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.120
 you have normal wrinkles that all 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.940
 will leave us at some point of our 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.459
 life avoids 100 percent of the 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.250
 Shiny and pearly products because 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.930
 what they are going to do is enhance those 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.989
 wrinkles that you have because you're going to 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.280
 put in the blonde and you will mark 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.650
 very much if you want your eyes to 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.600
 see bigger and more striking is 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.760
 important that no lines on the line 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.230
 of water with dark colors 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.630
 preferably use white or beige 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.030
 as you want but this what you are going to do 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.800
 is that you are a little bit bigger and 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.230
 more awake than I think that all the 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.420
 world likes to have open eyes 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.730
 awake 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.980
 who does not like the serious avoid the 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.900
 very white correctors in the area of ​​what 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.900
 that if you have a very pronounced way 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.990
 uses colors that neutralize those 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.970
 circles but not with the ones that do not solve the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.200
 problem placing white products 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.330
 because what we're going to do is that 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.080
 it will be safe as in distance and when 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.220
 then the pictures will be seen 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.410
 marcadito is as much where you have 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.510
 correctors and it would be horrible is going to see 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.430
 extremely illuminated and believe me not 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.140
 it's nice do not use either by the 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.180
 translucent in your makeup or so 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.220
 less to seal your makeup because 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:16.460
 when photography can be seen very well 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.310
 but when you photograph what he does is 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.470
 that gives a half-white look I look at 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.020
 the skin then especially on the part 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.600
 of the jaw and in the hairs it is noticeable 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.430
 something white that you really do not see anything 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.440
 well in photography sometimes the lights 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.810
 can irritate our eyes a little 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.730
 and they can make them look red and 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.380
 although we have the most beautiful skin 

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.250
 of the world and photography is the most 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.170
 beautiful 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.680
 Eyes never look good always 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.720
 they are tired like this 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.850
 It is important that in Tucuman have a 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.710
 little eye drops and you put it in the 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.840
 eyes carefully without staining your 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.100
 makeup so that the pretty ones if you 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.960
 we had whites and so your makeup 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.120
 let's highlight a lot more in that 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.440
