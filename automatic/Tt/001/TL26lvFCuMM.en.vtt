00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
about this random most was these little

about this random most was these little
break<00:04:10.000> things<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:12.489> that's<00:04:13.489> pretty<00:04:13.639> much<00:04:13.759> it

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
break things and that's pretty much it

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.759 
break things and that's pretty much it
I've<00:04:14.569> always<00:04:15.019> thought<00:04:15.199> about<00:04:15.259> cutting<00:04:15.560> them

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
I've always thought about cutting them

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.680 
I've always thought about cutting them
all<00:04:15.889> off<00:04:16.039> but<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.609> feel<00:04:17.150> like<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.389> would<00:04:17.539> probably

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
all off but I feel like I would probably

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.289 
all off but I feel like I would probably
like<00:04:18.049> mess<00:04:18.739> with<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:18.979> frame<00:04:19.250> and<00:04:19.489> like<00:04:20.090> its

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
like mess with the frame and like its

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.240 
like mess with the frame and like its
durability<00:04:20.779> or<00:04:21.019> something<00:04:21.500> by<00:04:21.709> doing<00:04:22.010> that

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
durability or something by doing that

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.370 
durability or something by doing that
so<00:04:22.340> I<00:04:22.370> never<00:04:22.550> touched<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.900> weld<00:04:24.080> aren't

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380
