00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.570

thus<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:31.110> surface<00:01:31.470> flattens<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.220> stretched

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
thus the surface flattens when stretched

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.930 
thus the surface flattens when stretched
and<00:01:32.850> appears<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.660> bunch<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.200> when<00:01:34.440> compressed

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
and appears to bunch up when compressed

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.790 
and appears to bunch up when compressed
this<00:01:35.940> yields<00:01:36.420> similar<00:01:36.810> directional<00:01:37.380> texture

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800
