00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.410

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.179
 hour what he had for hours then 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.099
 I just wanted marica 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.619
 The super nintendo started back then 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.369
 78 years maybe around 79 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.109
 to be exact 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.150
 yes and mario kart wii I even have 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.949
 played against japan that's bin 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.720
 actually a profi marc rath so 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.099
 not so long was the cable so yes 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 long was the cable we mario mario kart 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.800
 Eight hammer here and there today 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.390
 Best of all right on the wii u with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.469
 motion control that means he wants to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.059
 that about the weird little things 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.200
 you can steer children here once 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.760
 but motion control can vote 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.420
 change that you play the cursor and 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.460
 as you want 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.660
 you can see the drivers here right now 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.040
 have not changed big who me 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 Luigi like on pc 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.760
 we have super trouper death donkey kong 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.920
 browser 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.079
 daisy is new at basic still needs a lot 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 has to do is still there and I was 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.289
 just ask me who dropped out for it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.079
 is was luigi was not even before 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.010
 as far as I remember is but 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.410
 Of course, already a hit on youtube 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.899
 For whom are you going next to a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.090
 radio mario mario would mario standard 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.560
 or will the others have come 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 We again take vario on the stock exchanges 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.680
 you can do it and mister 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.010
 Fed the sympathetic but the suspicion 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.210
 Not 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.369
 you also have different 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.990
 You have to be very clear about skills 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.970
 marius very balanced from the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.950
 speed but he has one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.970
 mediocre speed has conceivable 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.439
 nothing better speed up though 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.390
 pretty high final speed and 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.920
 Of course, his legs can just do it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.970
 away but no matter that we are with the 3d 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.470
 then stretch partially 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.869
 neckdown over it went back then 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.759
 unfortunately did not see it but completely 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.189
 clearly the grafiker 200 is now fuller 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.869
 DE on the review and there are even 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 stretch which are super interesting 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.880
 they are just good too 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530
 start lapsed eleventh place age 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 eighth place sixth place alternative 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.409
 is from now on in fifth place 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.729
 this is unbelievably my vario after 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.079
 built back there was huge with the 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.659
 Comedian except first time 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.979
 extremely clunky is constantly controlling 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.899
 because emma cousin wheels in any case 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.579
 but he can do it now 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.170
 Owner mode go over the bridge here 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.619
 As a result, 3d quickly had to look quickly 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.659
 here 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.219
 how cool the tournament goes up is one 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.540
 little different from the old or yes 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.979
 is clearly different so I have to 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.270
 again, especially their age like 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.900
 cool that from or around with the kingdom 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.750
 and so 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.980
 after greens new new this plant the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.890
 Of course, we all know each other from the old ones 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.990
 mario theissen third i believe that 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.580
 but by 50 cubic me I believe 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.960
 not yet possible celebration of this level 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.920
 design but if I then drive myself 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.650
 I would have to think so because I would 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.750
 just cut short so hit 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.310
 somehow so pig priests dog he 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.620
 built in susanne streets there must be one 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.820
 Road Traffic Office say something like that 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.640
 is so in germany that comes 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.460
 Game also initiated out of 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.800
 Road Traffic Department indicated because of us 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.450
 over it and are equal place age 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.540
 first you horny sow I came age of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.070
 but is really hit in the green 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.630
 Greens are as I said for today 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.250
 mario kart may not know it that way 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.850
 no handlebar is in contrast to the 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.430
 redden 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.350
 the greens are just normal 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.490
 Panzer with that was the people shoot down 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.400
 but it must be there too 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.470
 with aim that the turtles elsner exactly 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.390
 just have to be at the first place 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.010
 So racing games are so almost here with it 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.750
 even vienna met with my banana 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.129
 Cordially, the mario was happy to be with you 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.189
 a banana hit that tells me 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:18.599
 every day there always so schlabbert with 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.040
 a banana knows the whole thing 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.840
 thiago is just jealous that again 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.400
 Not many in my game and me 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.720
 it works on an exceptional basis or you 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.250
 're like I said, I support you 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.930
 I too make poverty and I praise 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.819
 But you only make me up 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.319
 you little bastard but done because you 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.450
 you are totally you are I am I have that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.099
 ball work should come fuck fuck 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.180
 fuck navi keep coming we come 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.870
 as it sounds very well still in the 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.180
 first undefeated and benya finish 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.180
 by the way, I find the new calgon I know 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.409
 mario kart 8 is also allowed to open 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.459
 each case a super horny one plays 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.269
 has a bit of drunk or is 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.920
 So the landscape looks a bit 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.030
 open to but extremely cool there is 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.930
 of course different cards 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.430
 we can play currency 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.280
 currently back to normal course there you have 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.889
 I think a lot max cup yes that's it 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.670
 first card still quite light though 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.200
 Suddenly we also remember 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.400
 have already seen so 3d courses 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.260
 was suddenly on the ceiling long 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 first complete 3d level thing 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.400
 little interesting case new card 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.940
 Neumann and stretch so only a stretch 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.310
 kommune or yes we are aware 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.989
 yes you have got the biggest video at home 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.519
 but I never have the ioc house and 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.500
 I have my first time back then 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.190
 came super nintendo then gambled to 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.570
 break up 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.710
 We are not up to it 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.180
 home can also visit him 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.250
 So I like it very much 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.990
 completely even last time I have a lot 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.810
 early with the game against japan but how 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.520
 said you are the first and now 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.130
 the fourth age of mecablitz died 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.360
 then mario again i hate mario white 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.970
 why i had mario in the game now 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.210
 By the way, just not with the combo 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.380
 belongs to me but we wanted 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.849
 I would have saved myself should that 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.810
 get a bit goofy at below 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:48.180
 long, so even a little bit 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.440
 my route here is not on the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.120
 route stay that way come now 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.419
 we drive on the right we have just 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.539
 look what's there criticism mushroom that 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.310
 our speed up things applies to an old 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.630
 beating have so that's very 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.130
 interesting at mario with the whole 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.530
 eat mushrooms and then you become stronger 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.760
 and so i find the world here i am 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.409
 find the world so extremely sweet with the 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.729
 average girls and little ones everywhere yes 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.979
 and the graphic is still a whole 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.810
 corner better than on the wii u and market 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:16.020
 is really one of the two 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.370
 Title easy for the one you have to 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.139
 but say and i am happy now i 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.700
 Now this one can keep this banana 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.919
 that is what we are called in red battle tank myself 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.529
 he only hits one from behind 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.190
 Do not banana me that today 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:28.560
 wrong 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.909
 yes it keeps on sounding but it is true 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.469
 and now i can loos the banana before 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.430
 with the cover tape the green armor 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.320
 behind 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.880
 green band did not say anything to the left and 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.860
 as you said you can do this with the 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.640
 stick the game or stop play 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.850
 such as with the steering wheel 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.950
 the normal about this new one 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.110
 controller the wii remote then how 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.840
 as a steering wheel, so to speak , also use 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.220
 an interesting little bit of the 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.840
 gas would have to go, yes 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.190
 it went well so we are good the 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.480
 do not stretch there you have to benefit 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.360
 do not stop there comes the next one 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.990
 title over and I have 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.940
 arrived 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.750
 Whenever he is happy I am ok 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.860
 I met one now I watch 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.610
 but not there because I have to 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.970
 focus 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.760
 that's reasonable I drive very well 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.930
 am very proud deal confidently to you 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.820
 that is of course as I said 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.590
 the easiest course but if he used to 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.000
 Once we visited that one 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.670
 they have to be careful 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.720
 not that one has the same armor 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.670
 can pretty much be the first one again 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:29.880
 place ruin quasi if we are now 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.880
 get caught by comma 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:42.970
 that was marica 8 in any case is 130
