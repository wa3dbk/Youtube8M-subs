00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
make the recognition a part of the

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.770 
make the recognition a part of the
building<00:01:02.139> and<00:01:02.559> we<00:01:02.889> felt<00:01:03.190> that<00:01:03.249> water<00:01:03.639> as<00:01:03.999> an

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
building and we felt that water as an

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.410 
building and we felt that water as an
overall<00:01:05.350> element<00:01:06.070> would<00:01:06.430> be<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.820> perfect<00:01:07.240> way

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
overall element would be the perfect way

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.470 
overall element would be the perfect way
to<00:01:07.450> represent<00:01:07.960> movement<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.250> ER<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:10.330> we

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
to represent movement in the ER so we

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.990 
to represent movement in the ER so we
asked<00:01:10.660> Karen<00:01:11.110> singer<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.680> her<00:01:11.800> staff<00:01:12.160> to<00:01:12.490> give

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
asked Karen singer and her staff to give

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.640 
asked Karen singer and her staff to give
us<00:01:13.120> some<00:01:13.270> ideas<00:01:13.720> about<00:01:13.960> how<00:01:14.140> they<00:01:14.500> could

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
us some ideas about how they could

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.030 
us some ideas about how they could
represent<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.370> as<00:01:15.700> a<00:01:15.760> form<00:01:16.300> of<00:01:16.540> art<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.350> a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
represent that as a form of art and a

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.150 
represent that as a form of art and a
form<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.670> recognition<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.770> want<00:01:21.010> to

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
form of recognition I really want to

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.990 
form of recognition I really want to
understand<00:01:21.880> what<00:01:22.740> their<00:01:23.740> goals<00:01:24.130> are<00:01:24.460> for<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
understand what their goals are for the

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.740 
understand what their goals are for the
space<00:01:25.300> and<00:01:25.630> for<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.440> facility<00:01:27.360> what<00:01:28.360> came

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
space and for the facility what came

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.340 
space and for the facility what came
across<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.440> me<00:01:29.620> is<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.510> concept<00:01:32.050> they

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
across to me is that the concept they

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.560 
across to me is that the concept they
were<00:01:32.410> thinking<00:01:32.950> about<00:01:33.130> as<00:01:33.460> they<00:01:33.700> designed<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
were thinking about as they designed the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.000 
were thinking about as they designed the
building<00:01:34.990> with<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.410> architects<00:01:36.070> was<00:01:36.670> slow

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.270 

I<00:01:43.070> did<00:01:44.000> several<00:01:44.480> versions<00:01:44.900> that<00:01:45.440> all<00:01:45.650> had<00:01:46.010> this

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
I did several versions that all had this

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.910 
I did several versions that all had this
stream<00:01:46.760> that<00:01:46.790> started<00:01:47.510> in<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> left<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.290> kind

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
stream that started in the left and kind

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.430 
stream that started in the left and kind
of<00:01:49.040> went<00:01:49.370> down<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:50.060> stages<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.780> somewhere<00:01:51.140> we

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
of went down in stages and somewhere we

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.160 
of went down in stages and somewhere we
got<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.220> idea<00:01:52.370> of<00:01:52.820> putting<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.420> rocks<00:01:53.810> in

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
got the idea of putting the rocks in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.710 
got the idea of putting the rocks in
with<00:01:55.040> names<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.760> rocks<00:01:55.970> and<00:01:56.270> when<00:01:56.600> the

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
with names in the rocks and when the

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.080 
with names in the rocks and when the
idea<00:01:56.870> of<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.380> rocks<00:01:57.620> was<00:01:57.950> presented<00:01:58.550> we<00:01:58.730> just

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
idea of the rocks was presented we just

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.760 
idea of the rocks was presented we just
thought<00:01:59.750> that<00:01:59.960> was<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.230> best<00:02:00.440> thing<00:02:00.590> we'd

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
thought that was the best thing we'd

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.680 
thought that was the best thing we'd
ever<00:02:00.890> heard<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.850> idea<00:02:02.030> that<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.330> bed<00:02:05.330> of

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
ever heard the idea that the the bed of

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.920 
ever heard the idea that the the bed of
this<00:02:05.900> river<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.530> represented<00:02:07.460> by<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
this river is represented by the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.690 
this river is represented by the
foundation<00:02:08.930> of<00:02:09.140> donors<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.010> we<00:02:10.220> have<00:02:10.550> in

this community

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.600 
this community
that's<00:02:12.280> resonated<00:02:13.280> with<00:02:13.430> me<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:13.610> strongly<00:02:14.180> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
that's resonated with me so strongly and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.550 
that's resonated with me so strongly and
once<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.850> concept<00:02:17.450> was<00:02:17.690> communicated<00:02:18.410> to

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
once that concept was communicated to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.950 
once that concept was communicated to
our<00:02:18.590> donors<00:02:19.070> the<00:02:19.580> number<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.120> rocks<00:02:20.390> increased
