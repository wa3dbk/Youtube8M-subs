00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.420
 I did. 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.369
 There is a saying that summer pork should be eaten well. 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:22.470
 If you do not eat it carefully , it means that it is easy to get eight. 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:26.910
 The sns do not have to keep pork down. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.480
 It's unnecessary. As this story spreads, I wonder if it really matters. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.590
 I'm going to take this issue out of 100 checks today. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.100
 For the meantime, the reporter gimpilgyu something good to eat pork, baked dwaetjiman lot of press 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.059
 do 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.040
 One thing that they're supposed to talk about the parasite's right Hey example 1, especially 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.010
 An overview of the problem 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.860
 Now you'll see the hooked tapeworms and their larvae, 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.940
 I meet 6 I am in South America . 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:58.829
 Yes, close the big thing now, just like the way you saw it now . 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:05.039
 It's about 3 meters long. Yes. Is it in the person's body? 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:10.289
 When the egg comes out and the pig now eats it, 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:14.550
 Not gotta grow up in the body to enter the muscle through a second sleeping for example, so that 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:17.970
 After the pig has become the axis now, the pork is reopened and the pork is eaten. 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:22.729
 Once the Chapter in the parasite-hee growth in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:28.619
 For this there is still write a lot in just a chapter to the heart or brain moves 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:33.209
 Director lose sight, or may be brought only death causes seizures 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.020
 For this parasite Well now have the heating fire more than 717 even death 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:37.679
 So you have to eat pork so you can eat it. 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.979
 It is. 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:44.520
 I've only heard so far today, but I've already decided 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.420
 Yes , I 'm going to eat it. 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.960
 So why are you talking about that word is not accustomed to eat out why such a story 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.610
 For the first dwaetneunji out the story of John parasite experts 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.480
 I'll listen. 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:04.090
 Oh, this is gonna have too little layers Korea Insurance toilet 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:08.050
 Ya-no story is a story about the carp , 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.640
 I do not see it at all . I have to have it. 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.420
 Yes 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.980
 So, let me give you a little more explanation. 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.060
 In the 1960s and 1970s, it is almost always the case that pork is used as a feed 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.300
 Mostly. 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.430
 But now, in the '80s, the breeding system has changed. 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.880
 Once the pigs are eating all of the sewer water that is the source of the parasite infection, 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.350
 I'm done. 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.800
 Example According to the Centers for Disease Control has done a national survey results now increase workers 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:40.270
 I do not have a cover to eat, I'm eating 100% feed. 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.660
 He said that surely do eojjeom've so far Yes, and in fact even eojjae 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.580
 Also it serves to secure the part which may be more expensive haneunge management 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.890
 Gonna use it may make repairs 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.670
 The National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service required since 1989, and has six flights infected during 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.470
 I have not found one case discovered pigs so for example, E. 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:05.400
 Also in the paper on the parasite school in Korea until 1971, Korean gums 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:09.250
 In the first year of my life, 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.959
 Oh, I feel the noise disappeared Content 2004's not only 10 years 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.380
 It's also a job. 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:18.640
 If you do not know, I do not know if you keep talking on the first floor. 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.950
 So now that you do not have a parasitic risk, you can eat less . 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.110
 Is there actually such an example Yes 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:30.340
 In fact, in American or European restaurants, pork steak is medium rare 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:35.440
 So do naenotneun restaurants in the state of much of some bloody beach 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.209
 For many the menu are in fact eat Well okay these interests in a foreign country 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.480
 The problem has become a topic. 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:45.250
 Yes . Frank Bruni, food columnist in The New York Times. 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:49.720
 People like Medium Rare Pork because they like it very much. 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.530
 I wrote a column that recommends that you eat it tomorrow morning. 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.640
 It's possible 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.590
 Can you say one day, not one day ? 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.080
 We talked about it symbolically. 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.970
 For its British Guardian food critic John maps are slightly pink pork geunikkan 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.450
 I prefer less ripe pork. 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.959
 So many of the restaurants reported that they were offering this meat. 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.830
 There is 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:17.799
 Yes, this discussion will continue. In 2011, the US Department of Agriculture 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:23.080
 New Pork glass based entirely buttoned up to 70 degrees Celsius For true density of 3 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:26.440
 I lowered the original standard to 62 degrees, 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.760
 This way you can enjoy juicy, soft pork 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.710
 In addition, 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:36.760
 So, you can go to the pork house today and eat it. 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.220
 It 's all right now. 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.680
 There's actually some cautious facts to conclude. 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:47.750
 1 Let me hear something first. Yes. 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:52.190
 Basically, whatever carrots are, they have all these common bacteria. 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:56.810
 If there is a problem, there is a staphylococcus like criterion. 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.560
 It's very dangerous to eat, so it's important to eat it perfectly. 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:04.100
 Oh, but I eventually slip doendan eat cooked Yes. So just parasites 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:08.270
 Besides, there are many other factors to consider. 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:13.280
 It's good to say that you can eat less cooked meats in the US or UK 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:17.300
 Is that what you're doing on the premise that you've used well-fed pork in a controlled environment ? 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:22.340
 An example would mean cutting boards and knives sanitary conditions in the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.200
 Also consider that there is another risk of food poisoning depending on the state of the fire. 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.310
 Yes . 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:32.930
 So it is good to eat well as it is like buried meat. 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:35.630
 You intentionally burned it up too much or you've had a burberry king trademark 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.200
 You do not have to worry too much about it. 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.370
 Yes 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:46.440
 On the Internet , the nickname was written by reporter Kim Pil Kyu. 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.710
 No matter how articulate I really believe in the written press haneungeo For even talk today 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.910
 Go do what you're responsible for what ever ya sick, where is the talk 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.740
 What do you do when you hear it ? Yeah . 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.889
 Yes . 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.889
 Yes 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.820
 Is it yours? Yes. At lunch today, our fact check team is in the pig house. 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.490
 go 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:12.970
 In fact, I cooked meat every part of it. 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:17.350
 It's a king . 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:21.430
 So I eat eunikka would not come to the screen And now, if you get an answer 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:26.200
 Now that my teams have eaten , including me, 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:31.000
 I think the people who are here today are reporters for interns. 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:34.870
 Not sure I am not getting the consent of consciousness as secure line hangeo 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.560
 Well, once I had good taste, there was this evaluation. 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:42.280
 Further information covering milk is something academically Oh this one based on the instruction 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.360
 It's hard to say I'm responsible for it , but yes. 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:49.690
 Has it not even for a weekend, what the future Oh, there are some physical changes in me. 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.370
 I 'll let you know . I'll let you know. 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.740
 I do not think I'll eat it. 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.740
 Yes, he was a reporter, Kim Pil Kyu.
