00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
right out of the can and then somehow

for<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.310> O's<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.789> decided<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> use<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.779> stuff

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
for the O's I decided to use this stuff

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.630 
for the O's I decided to use this stuff
you<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.590> cuz<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.099> shaped<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.609> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
you know cuz it's like shaped like a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.420 
you know cuz it's like shaped like a
tube<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.300> look<00:00:30.720> at<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.769> probably

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
tube and look at that that is probably

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.950 
tube and look at that that is probably
the<00:00:32.610> best<00:00:32.940> thing<00:00:33.180> I've<00:00:33.329> ever<00:00:33.420> seen

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the best thing I've ever seen

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.930 
the best thing I've ever seen
so<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.380> boiled<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.070> seven<00:00:35.460> minutes<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so we boiled these for seven minutes to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.819 
so we boiled these for seven minutes to
make<00:00:36.090> them<00:00:36.239> easier<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.630> cut<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> then<00:00:37.380> we

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
make them easier to cut and then we

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.979 
make them easier to cut and then we
boiled<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.700> three<00:00:39.270> more<00:00:39.450> minutes<00:00:39.629> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
boiled them for three more minutes to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
boiled them for three more minutes to
get<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.290> nice<00:00:40.730> non-italian<00:00:41.760> softness<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.600> as

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
get that nice non-italian softness we as

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.990 
get that nice non-italian softness we as
odd<00:00:43.079> Americans<00:00:43.739> are<00:00:43.890> accustomed<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
odd Americans are accustomed to but the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.600 
odd Americans are accustomed to but the
tomato<00:00:45.300> sauce<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.840> use<00:00:45.870> tomato<00:00:46.800> soup<00:00:47.129> because

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
tomato sauce we use tomato soup because

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
tomato sauce we use tomato soup because
let's<00:00:48.149> be<00:00:48.360> honest<00:00:48.690> SpaghettiOs<00:00:49.200> that's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
let's be honest SpaghettiOs that's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.610 
let's be honest SpaghettiOs that's
tomato<00:00:50.070> soup<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:51.390> we<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.690> two<00:00:51.960> cans<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.379> tomato

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
tomato soup so we use two cans of tomato

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.010 
tomato soup so we use two cans of tomato
soup<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.100> only<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> water<00:00:54.030> cheddar

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
soup and only one can of water cheddar

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.369 
soup and only one can of water cheddar
cheese<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.710> ketchup<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.780> then<00:00:57.780> there's<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
cheese and ketchup and then there's the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
cheese and ketchup and then there's the
meatballs<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.579> are<00:00:59.850> those<00:01:00.239> probably

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
meatballs what are those probably

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
meatballs what are those probably
roadkill<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> breadcrumbs<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.969> don't<00:01:03.300> even

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
roadkill and breadcrumbs I don't even

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
roadkill and breadcrumbs I don't even
think<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.840> meat<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.500> should<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.860> call<00:01:05.070> it

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
think it's meat we should just call it

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820 
think it's meat we should just call it
SpaghettiOs<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:05.820> balls<00:01:06.450> anyway<00:01:07.439> for<00:01:07.710> our

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
