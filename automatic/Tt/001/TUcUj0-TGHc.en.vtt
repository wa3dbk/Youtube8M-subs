00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.480
 oh summer 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.539
 someone has already gone to rest in warm 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.820
 country someone still sitting at home and apple 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.439
 meanwhile makes loud announcements 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:35.030
 for example on June 2 wwdc showed us 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.210
 ios 8 showed yesterday and today ios 8 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.489
 beta 1 in our tenacious paws let's 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.250
 let's see what this OS 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:49.159
 different from its predecessor hey 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.710
 why are you showing us ios 7 say 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.159
 you and we had the same reaction to 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.189
 first glance looks like ios 8 beta 1 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.000
 exactly like the IS-7 but it only 

00:00:58.189 --> 00:01:00.489
 first glance 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.689
 let's call the panel 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.119
 multitasking and see what 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.979
 changed now besides open 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.560
 applications on this screen will be 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.970
 be your contacts those to whom you 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.460
 recently called and 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.340
 favorites rather convenient opportunity 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.410
 for those who are constantly lost in the lists 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.260
 swipe down on us rides 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.870
 updated spotlight on the presentation he 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.170
 looked good but to be and no longer so 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.120
 beautifully major innovation 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.120
 embedded search engine steel advanced 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.190
 search capabilities such as drive in 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.200
 search query and spotlight immediately 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.050
 will offer you some articles from 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.860
 Wikipedia and also look for 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.170
 matches in the appstore and aytyuns another 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.510
 question often do you use spotlight 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.140
 and how these functions seem 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.140
 helpful 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.070
 The most convenient features of ios 8 seemed to us 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.650
 interactive notification system 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.840
 now when watching movies or playing 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.420
 games do not necessarily collapse 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.790
 and go to the message window if 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.500
 someone suddenly decided to distract you 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.560
 just swipe down the notification 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.970
 then in the window that appears reply 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.690
 annoying mate 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.760
 very convenient and interesting opportunity 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.310
 by the way lovers will also chat 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.890
 pleased with the updated application and bowls 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.190
 Now you can send photos to video 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.650
 and even voice recordings alas appreciate your 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.890
 only iphone owners can send a message 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.050
 in case the companion has no iphone 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.790
 use mail app mail 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.770
 refreshed and now sort 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.130
 the message has become more convenient 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.190
 sorting is performed by swipe and 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.700
 a message in the mail svayp sent to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.160
 archive 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.970
 the truth is now an opportunity for 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.340
 your pats 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.890
 and randomly send a message to the trash 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.459
 that during the test we did 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.410
 good in the letter was nothing important 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.010
 like to take pictures and make selfies 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.810
 apple and a present for you in store 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.540
 updated camera application and new 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.790
 functions when processing camera photos 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.000
 now able to do frame-by-frame shooting 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.489
 with a rather unusual one frame in 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.650
 a few minutes this way you can 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.690
 photograph the sunset for example 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.300
 so you can stick together to get pretty 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.900
 entertaining video photo editor 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.360
 noticeably overgrown with functions here and balance 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.000
 white you can change and various filters 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.040
 impose so what instagram in terms of 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.090
 photo processing went to second 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.760
 plan 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:42.000
 Well, this is probably not all 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.370
 innovations ios 8 and many apple on 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.989
 presentations were silent for example 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.269
 ability to monitor battery consumption 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.730
 as it was on android 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.519
 well, the most important and interesting we 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.410
 told and if you missed something 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.330
 can always remind us in 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.330
