00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
which in effect runs from somewhere

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.740 
which in effect runs from somewhere
around<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> way<00:00:51.300> around<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> back

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
hoping you'll find on your car yeah it

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
hoping you'll find on your car yeah it
should<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.020> it's<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.770> effect<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.340> means

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
should be there it's in effect it means

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
should be there it's in effect it means
that<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:20.970> loose<00:01:21.180> there<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> gets

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that it's loose there and then it gets

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:30.109 
that it's loose there and then it gets
goes<00:01:22.710> over<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> tension<00:01:23.659> and<00:01:28.759> then<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.909> put

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
goes over the tension and then you put

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.450 
goes over the tension and then you put
the<00:01:30.540> next<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.900> goes<00:01:31.229> from<00:01:31.530> there<00:01:34.310> but<00:01:35.310> this

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the next one goes from there but this

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
the next one goes from there but this
isn't<00:01:35.700> bad<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> know<00:01:36.390> that'll<00:01:36.750> clean<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
isn't bad you know that'll clean up a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.899 
isn't bad you know that'll clean up a
thing<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> middle<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> would

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
thing in the middle but I think it would

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.929 
thing in the middle but I think it would
clean<00:01:39.150> up<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.570> yeah<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.619> usable

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.419 

this<00:01:47.810> is<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.140> straw<00:01:48.409> that<00:01:48.439> game<00:01:48.829> at<00:01:49.009> it<00:01:49.219> Midway

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
because it was three across something

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.580 
because it was three across something
like<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:52.039> yeah<00:01:52.640> in<00:01:53.539> fact<00:01:53.780> they're<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.229> three

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
upon a stick right there's no way they'd

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.150 
upon a stick right there's no way they'd
go<00:02:22.129> back<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.540> of<00:02:23.690> any<00:02:23.840> use<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.319> us<00:02:24.470> so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
go back now and be of any use to us so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.910 
go back now and be of any use to us so
I'm<00:02:25.489> getting<00:02:25.700> really<00:02:26.000> bought<00:02:26.329> them<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.079> I

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
I'm getting really bought them and I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.650 
I'm getting really bought them and I
think<00:02:27.980> was<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.489> be<00:02:28.579> getting<00:02:28.879> rid<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.120> off<00:02:29.329> these

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
think was to be getting rid of off these

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.819 
think was to be getting rid of off these
as<00:02:29.900> well<00:02:30.400> my<00:02:31.400> idea<00:02:31.849> is<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.200> plant<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> bit

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
as well my idea is to plant this a bit

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.910 
as well my idea is to plant this a bit
with<00:02:33.980> some<00:02:34.010> fold<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:35.599> best<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.349> up<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.680> about

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
with some fold as best I can up to about

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.420 
with some fold as best I can up to about
here<00:02:37.220> then<00:02:38.150> all<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.170> gluing<00:02:39.590> then<00:02:39.829> gloomy

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
here then all the gluing then gloomy

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.580 
here then all the gluing then gloomy
capital<00:02:41.060> at<00:02:41.209> top<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:41.690> take<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.079> underneath

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
capital at top of it take it underneath

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.069 
capital at top of it take it underneath
and<00:02:43.099> then<00:02:43.670> we'll<00:02:43.879> finish<00:02:44.209> some<00:02:44.569> of<00:02:44.690> them<00:02:44.870> there

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
and then we'll finish some of them there

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.050 
and then we'll finish some of them there
either<00:02:45.260> black<00:02:45.620> probably<00:02:46.400> black<00:02:46.760> leather

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
either black probably black leather

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.110 
either black probably black leather
cloth<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.470> I'm<00:02:48.560> dispensing<00:02:48.980> with<00:02:49.400> that<00:02:49.609> yeah

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
cloth so I'm dispensing with that yeah

cloth so I'm dispensing with that yeah
we're<00:02:50.750> going<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:50.959> leak<00:02:51.139> over<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.739> either<00:02:52.099> in

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
we're going to leak over that either in

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.170 
we're going to leak over that either in
blood<00:02:52.670> loss<00:02:53.060> but<00:02:53.239> probably<00:02:53.840> gap<00:02:54.349> it<00:02:54.650> yeah

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
blood loss but probably gap it yeah
