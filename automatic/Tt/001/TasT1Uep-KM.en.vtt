00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
because I'm thinking this might be a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.810 
because I'm thinking this might be a
nice<00:04:10.440> little<00:04:10.799> ornament<00:04:11.250> or<00:04:11.400> something<00:04:11.730> like

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
nice little ornament or something like

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.390 
nice little ornament or something like
that<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.420> there<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.650> making<00:04:14.070> bezel

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
that so there you have it making bezel

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.040 
that so there you have it making bezel
cups<00:04:14.610> in<00:04:14.910> your<00:04:15.269> own<00:04:15.450> unique<00:04:16.169> shapes<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.830> sizes
