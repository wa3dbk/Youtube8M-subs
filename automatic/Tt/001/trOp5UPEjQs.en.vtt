joints and pry things reasonably front

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.220 
joints and pry things reasonably front
for<00:01:02.030> knife<00:01:02.239> use<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:03.760> they<00:01:04.760> don't<00:01:05.090> choke<00:01:05.870> up<00:01:06.080> on

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
for knife use it they don't choke up on

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.740 
for knife use it they don't choke up on
it<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:06.500> there's<00:01:06.680> no<00:01:06.860> choice<00:01:07.300> but<00:01:08.300> they<00:01:08.450> wanted

it so there's no choice but they wanted
a<00:01:08.840> deeper<00:01:09.200> self<00:01:09.500> guard<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.180> actually<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.540> use

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
a deeper self guard and actually to use

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
supposed to go in front of the ramp that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.410 
supposed to go in front of the ramp that
way<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:19.370> can<00:01:19.640> bear<00:01:20.090> down<00:01:20.590> for<00:01:21.590> notching<00:01:22.420> this

section<00:01:28.550> of<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:28.700> blade<00:01:28.940> for<00:01:29.660> notching<00:01:30.170> so

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
section of the blade for notching so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.340 
section of the blade for notching so
what<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.310> turned<00:01:31.550> out<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.790> be<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.300> a<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.990> big

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
what it turned out to be is a is a big

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.820 
what it turned out to be is a is a big
bushcraft<00:01:34.040> course<00:01:34.370> or<00:01:34.780> utility<00:01:35.780> knife<00:01:35.960> that

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
bushcraft course or utility knife that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.420 
bushcraft course or utility knife that
was<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.190> purpose<00:01:37.460> of<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:37.790> Bravo<00:01:37.970> one<00:01:39.250> we<00:01:40.250> have

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
was the purpose of the Bravo one we have

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.330 
was the purpose of the Bravo one we have
a<00:01:40.720> another<00:01:41.720> variation<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.770> which<00:01:43.160> is<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
a another variation of it which is the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.330 
a another variation of it which is the
same<00:01:43.760> exact<00:01:44.510> knife<00:01:44.750> which<00:01:45.560> we<00:01:45.740> call<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.040> field

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
same exact knife which we call the field

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.910 
same exact knife which we call the field
version<00:01:46.940> where<00:01:47.720> we<00:01:47.900> have<00:01:48.080> eliminated<00:01:48.530> the

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
version where we have eliminated the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.910 
version where we have eliminated the
ramp<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.630> taken<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.780> jumping<00:01:51.290> from<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:51.650> ramp

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
ramp and taken the jumping from the ramp

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.010 
ramp and taken the jumping from the ramp
and<00:01:52.160> moved<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.790> down<00:01:52.970> on<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.240> blade<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.960> you

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
and moved it down on the blade so you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.620 
and moved it down on the blade so you
have<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.410> Bravo<00:01:54.650> one<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.970> Bravo<00:01:56.210> one

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
have the Bravo one and the Bravo one

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.900 
have the Bravo one and the Bravo one
field<00:01:56.990> they're<00:01:57.380> identical<00:01:57.860> except<00:01:58.640> for<00:01:58.670> the

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
field they're identical except for the

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.350 
field they're identical except for the
ramp<00:01:59.180> and<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.660> jumping<00:02:00.340> these<00:02:01.340> of<00:02:01.730> course<00:02:02.090> are

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
ramp and the jumping these of course are

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.920 
ramp and the jumping these of course are
in<00:02:02.420> black<00:02:02.840> canvas<00:02:03.140> because<00:02:04.070> they're<00:02:04.430> mine<00:02:04.930> but

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
in black canvas because they're mine but

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.870 
in black canvas because they're mine but
we<00:02:06.050> do<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.410> this<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.710> about<00:02:06.830> 85<00:02:07.430> handle

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
we do make this in about 85 handle

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.450 
we do make this in about 85 handle
variations
