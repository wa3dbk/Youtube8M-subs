this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.450> in<00:00:00.630> slow<00:00:01.079> motion<00:00:01.319> from<00:00:01.829> high<00:00:02.040> above

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
this is in slow motion from high above

this is in slow motion from high above
now<00:00:02.700> all<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:03.000> drivers<00:00:03.270> are<00:00:03.510> very<00:00:03.780> crowded

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
now all the drivers are very crowded

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.110

Scott and then man and this is what we
talked<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:11.639> before<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.059> these<00:00:12.480> speeds<00:00:12.900> at

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
talked about before that these speeds at

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.770 
talked about before that these speeds at
220<00:00:13.860> miles<00:00:14.040> an<00:00:14.340> hour<00:00:14.490> Eddie<00:00:14.790> you're<00:00:15.420> going<00:00:15.690> the

220 miles an hour Eddie you're going the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.810 
220 miles an hour Eddie you're going the

a second and you don't plan your next
move<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> speed<00:00:20.789> as<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.210> can<00:00:21.330> now<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
move at the speed as you can now see the

car starting to go one over each other
and<00:00:23.580> they'll<00:00:23.670> start<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.000> get<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.269> towards<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and they'll start to get up towards the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.080 
and they'll start to get up towards the
catch<00:00:24.960> fence<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.949> those<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.580> ones<00:00:26.820> the

catch fences that do the damage the
safer<00:00:29.730> walls<00:00:29.970> we've<00:00:30.269> improved<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:31.500> helps

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
safer walls we've improved really helps

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
safer walls we've improved really helps
dissipate<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.790> energy<00:00:32.820> when<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> cars<00:00:33.750> hit

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
dissipate the energy when the cars hit

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.709 
dissipate the energy when the cars hit
but<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.920> say<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.820> catch<00:00:36.149> fencing<00:00:36.570> that's

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
but to say the the catch fencing that's

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.479 
but to say the the catch fencing that's
above<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> safer<00:00:37.530> barriers<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> these<00:00:38.190> cars

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
above the safer barriers that these cars

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.910 
above the safer barriers that these cars
got<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.910> into<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.200> what<00:00:40.379> has<00:00:40.680> done

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
got up into and that is what has done

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.940 
got up into and that is what has done
the<00:00:41.040> damage<00:00:41.930> another<00:00:42.930> angle<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> as<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the damage another angle and as you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.590 
the damage another angle and as you
mentioned<00:00:44.100> Eddie<00:00:44.460> cards<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.059> going<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
mentioned Eddie cards is going for the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900 
mentioned Eddie cards is going for the
same<00:00:45.840> spot<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.280> speed<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.730> just

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
same spot and at this speed it just

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
same spot and at this speed it just
starts<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.390> go<00:00:48.510> sideways<00:00:48.750> cars<00:00:49.379> start<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
starts to go sideways cars start to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.760 
starts to go sideways cars start to
climb<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.700> over<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:52.079> further<00:00:52.379> cars

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
climb up and over and as further cars

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
climb up and over and as further cars
continue<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.579> come<00:00:53.760> into<00:00:53.910> frame<00:00:54.300> you'll<00:00:54.570> see

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
continue to come into frame you'll see

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.290 
continue to come into frame you'll see
cars<00:00:55.170> starting<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> slide<00:00:55.980> through<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.640> jump

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
cars starting to slide through and jump

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.240 
cars starting to slide through and jump
into<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> air<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:58.230> watch<00:00:58.500> 23<00:00:59.129> girls

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
into the air and now watch 23 girls

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.790 
into the air and now watch 23 girls
fence<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.300> car<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.780> goes<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.289> it's

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
fence in the car now goes up it's

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.030 
fence in the car now goes up it's
airborne<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.059> ball<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.930> halted<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.920> it

that you just cannot be prepared for
there's<00:01:12.810> nothing<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> I
