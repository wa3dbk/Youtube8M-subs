00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
done and really the hydrogenation

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.860 
done and really the hydrogenation
process<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.579> where<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> perkily<00:00:51.360> hiding<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
process is where you perkily hiding it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.580 
process is where you perkily hiding it
up<00:00:52.079> through<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.920> oil<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.840> stuff's<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
up through a oil and that stuff's it

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.549 
up through a oil and that stuff's it
full<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.120> kind<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.109> fake

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
full so it's kind of like a fake

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.799 
full so it's kind of like a fake
saturate<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.579> they're<00:00:59.699> able<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> save<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
saturate but they're able to save on the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.270 
saturate but they're able to save on the
statue<00:01:01.020> if<00:01:01.350> you're<00:01:01.469> able<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:02.039> it's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
statue if you're able to see it's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 
statue if you're able to see it's
cholesterol<00:01:02.789> free<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.809> fact<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.769> more

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
cholesterol free when in fact it is more

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.960 
cholesterol free when in fact it is more
toxic<00:01:05.850> than<00:01:06.260> regular<00:01:07.260> veggie<00:01:08.189> oil<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
toxic than regular veggie oil that's the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.140 
toxic than regular veggie oil that's the
scary<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.900> know<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.799> trans<00:01:11.490> fats<00:01:11.820> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
scary thing now know that trans fats it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
scary thing now know that trans fats it
can<00:01:12.270> even<00:01:12.360> say<00:01:12.630> trans<00:01:12.960> fat<00:01:13.170> free<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.890> label

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
can even say trans fat free on the label

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.950 
can even say trans fat free on the label
to<00:01:14.549> yet<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.600> tremendous<00:01:16.140> amount<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
to yet have a tremendous amount of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.539 
to yet have a tremendous amount of
hydrogenation<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.380> danger<00:01:20.039> which<00:01:20.399> is

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
hydrogenation and danger which is

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.609 
hydrogenation and danger which is
causing<00:01:20.759> inflammation<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.899> your<00:01:21.960> body<00:01:22.109> of<00:01:22.469> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
causing inflammation in your body of the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
causing inflammation in your body of the
year<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.429> I<00:01:23.460> think<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> other<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.179> I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
year so I think the other one that I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.569 
year so I think the other one that I
found<00:01:24.539> fascinating<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.679> sodium<00:01:26.189> honest<00:01:26.429> oh

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
found fascinating the sodium honest oh

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.669 
found fascinating the sodium honest oh
baby<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.659> saw<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.869> vinegar<00:01:28.289> was<00:01:28.469> bad

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
baby we just saw the vinegar was bad

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.380 
baby we just saw the vinegar was bad
yeah<00:01:29.069> we<00:01:29.219> thought<00:01:29.340> folded<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.210> bad

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
yeah we thought folded it would be bad

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.380 
yeah we thought folded it would be bad
if<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.719> see<00:01:31.289> 10<00:01:31.500> million<00:01:31.890> rupees<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.030> then

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
if you see 10 million rupees and then

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.959 
if you see 10 million rupees and then
with<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> work<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.049> did<00:01:34.560> me<00:01:34.770> any<00:01:34.969> barbecue

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
with the work you did me any barbecue

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.990 
with the work you did me any barbecue
ship<00:01:36.270> has<00:01:37.079> 600<00:01:37.859> milligrams<00:01:38.099> of<00:01:38.399> sodium<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.880> you

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
ship has 600 milligrams of sodium if you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.199 
ship has 600 milligrams of sodium if you
ate<00:01:39.209> with<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.569> that<00:01:40.409> would<00:01:40.500> be<00:01:40.530> about<00:01:41.209> 3,000

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
ate with that that would be about 3,000

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.089 
ate with that that would be about 3,000
milligrams<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.810> sodium<00:01:42.929> that's<00:01:43.530> twice<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
milligrams of sodium that's twice the

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.240 
milligrams of sodium that's twice the
sodium<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.609> can<00:01:44.789> have<00:01:44.969> in<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> day<00:01:45.630> without

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
sodium you can have in a day without

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.949 
sodium you can have in a day without
dramatically<00:01:47.250> elevated<00:01:47.939> blood<00:01:48.090> pressure<00:01:48.450> so

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:48.959 
dramatically elevated blood pressure so

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.309 
dramatically elevated blood pressure so
that's<00:01:49.170> not<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.439> real<00:01:49.770> crazy<00:01:50.099> fact<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.319> that's

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
that's not a real crazy fact and that's

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.080 
that's not a real crazy fact and that's
what<00:01:52.439> scaring<00:01:52.829> me<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.099> think<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.369> crazy<00:01:53.729> slow

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
what scaring me I think this crazy slow

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.440 
what scaring me I think this crazy slow

flavor flavor and all just and this is
particularly<00:02:03.060> scary<00:02:03.569> between<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.229> corn

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
particularly scary between the corn

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.029 
particularly scary between the corn
which<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.459> genetically<00:02:06.390> modified<00:02:06.959> for<00:02:07.409> weeds

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
which is genetically modified for weeds

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.039 
which is genetically modified for weeds
which<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.549> inflammatory<00:02:08.910> potentially<00:02:09.869> of
