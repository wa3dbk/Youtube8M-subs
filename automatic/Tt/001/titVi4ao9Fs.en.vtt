they do but whatever but it's a way to
kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> make<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.100> point<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.430> stay<00:01:14.670> out<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
kind of make your point and stay out of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.539

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
jail and start a movement or whatever so

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
jail and start a movement or whatever so
they've<00:01:18.000> banned<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.659> type<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> thing<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.560> I

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they've banned that type of thing and I

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.499 
they've banned that type of thing and I
guess<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> comedian's<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.820> China<00:01:21.180> are

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
guess the comedian's in China are

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.370 
guess the comedian's in China are
pushing<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.770> boundaries<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:24.110> what<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
pushing the boundaries of what is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
pushing the boundaries of what is
allowed<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.799> stage<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.729> what<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.180> amazing<00:01:27.450> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
allowed on stage and what is amazing to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
allowed on stage and what is amazing to
me<00:01:27.900> over<00:01:28.290> there<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.189> China<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
me over there is that in China the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.039 
me over there is that in China the
stand-ups<00:01:30.270> over<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.680> art<00:01:32.009> form<00:01:33.049> which

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
stand-ups over there that art form which

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.899 
stand-ups over there that art form which
I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.439> eventually<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.579> global

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
I think eventually it will go global

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.819 
I think eventually it will go global
it's<00:01:36.299> really<00:01:36.600> weird<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.140> art<00:01:37.500> form<00:01:37.770> has

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it's really weird that that art form has

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.660 
it's really weird that that art form has
not<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.060> fact<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.420> music<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.829> know<00:01:40.979> acting

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
not the fact that music you know acting

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.980 
not the fact that music you know acting
and<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.479> these<00:01:43.100> film<00:01:44.100> all<00:01:44.399> pictures<00:01:45.060> painting

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and all these film all pictures painting

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.889 
and all these film all pictures painting
all<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.500> other<00:01:46.740> arts<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.520> worldwide<00:01:48.450> but

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
all the other arts are worldwide but

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.850 
all the other arts are worldwide but
stand-up<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> great<00:01:51.090> arts<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.860> feel

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
stand-up one of the great arts I feel

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.889 
stand-up one of the great arts I feel
that<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.670> not<00:01:53.909> worldwide<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.810> it's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that there is is not worldwide and it's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.620 
that there is is not worldwide and it's
like<00:01:55.079> brand<00:01:55.470> new<00:01:55.590> essentially<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.490> China<00:01:57.299> and
