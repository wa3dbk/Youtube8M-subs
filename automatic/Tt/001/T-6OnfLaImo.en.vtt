00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.400
 hi friends my name is tauro garcÃ­a 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.379
 because I had to be the civic super 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.360
 I want to invite you here to 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.590
 know my skatepark and it's free 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.949
 I invite you to come, I hope you 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.949
 have fun 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.200
 the skate for me is my way of working 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.510
 I know 32 world cups and thanks to 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.050
 the skateboard and maybe I never thought 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.610
 that being able to skate could get 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.399
 well, make some of the best 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:57.399
 mexico and represent it like this place 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.210
 it was dangerous there was no light passing 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.610
 here the people and they stole them I made a 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.960
 model when I made my model I 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.420
 I had to go to the delegation and they hit me 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.330
 this awful and not after 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.460
 three years of being insistent touches me 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.100
 know a delegate alejandro pineapple a 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.200
 little more kid and like he trusts 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.600
 the project gave me the green light I said 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.030
 but it's not going to help me, it's going to be like 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.430
 the same thing as the model there 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.860
 and it turns out that at 34 months they talk to me 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.930
 they ask me to take all the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.460
 project because I had drawn it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.080
 said a model but they did not have the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.580
 exact measurements 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.580
 then I something good father 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.659
 has supported the project a lot because 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.060
 they want to do parking then 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.220
 I feel like I wanted to make money with 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.810
 a place and I did not see it this way 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.000
 so when I won the project and 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.790
 they see that it works because people get angry 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.260
 and they have always sending patrols 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.240
 they are complaining but it's something good 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.560
 funny because he even invited people 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.850
 what peace and see the kids are 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.190
 doing a sport that are being 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.200
 having fun that they are not smoking that is not 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.060
 are taking and on the contrary 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.060
 we as kids take care of this place 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.500
 At the beginning the delegation helped me with the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.990
 project but never 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.630
 then they helped me they did it and right now 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.310
 I am in charge of everything I do myself 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.860
 responsible for everything I know that if a chavito 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.230
 fall if something happens here because I am the 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.060
 responsible and in what way do I do it 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.980
 looking for my sponsors to be 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.420
 Keep here right now as well 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.390
 let the rains pass because we have to 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.160
 give him the most father is also that between 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.620
 we as friends help each other 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.110
 we have the paint and to give hard to 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.170
 Resanr and leave things as 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.170
 beginning 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:56.110
 about this trick that teaching is a 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.520
 good example for me to make you want not 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.290
 there's a lot here because it's a good 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.790
 example for anyone 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.790
 really teaching everything that is 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.280
 of course 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.110
 thank you guys but have fun 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.580
 greetings to the super civics that I think 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.860
 that gave us all that support so that 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.860
 let's continue promoting these spaces the 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.220

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.220
 doha
