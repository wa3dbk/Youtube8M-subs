too<00:00:55.199> closely<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.789> shouldn't<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.390> done

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
too closely they shouldn't have done

at<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> bridging<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.570> heard<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:04.739> were<00:01:04.799> doing

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
at a bridging I heard they were doing

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.460 
at a bridging I heard they were doing
the<00:01:05.309> cancer<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.970> makes<00:01:06.720> sense<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.350> think

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the cancer it makes sense if you think

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.179 
the cancer it makes sense if you think
about<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.720> yeah<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:10.320> probably<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.070> good

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
about it yeah that's probably a good

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.460 
about it yeah that's probably a good
idea<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:12.299> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
what was that I figured out that can

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.170 
what was that I figured out that can
control<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> script<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.129> series<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.700> wrote

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
control the script of the series I wrote

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.729 
control the script of the series I wrote
the<00:02:24.450> screen<00:02:24.689> we<00:02:24.840> change<00:02:25.079> into<00:02:25.290> black<00:02:25.530> and

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the screen we change into black and

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.399 
the screen we change into black and
white<00:02:25.859> and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.370> change<00:02:26.609> back<00:02:27.019> wait<00:02:28.019> how<00:02:28.349> does

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
white and then change back wait how does

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.330 
white and then change back wait how does
that<00:02:28.650> work<00:02:30.379> well<00:02:31.379> it<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.680> called<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.069> death
