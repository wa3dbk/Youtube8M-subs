 same 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.470

 the belly area is one of the 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:28.720
 first you notice it that's why the age 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.789
 greatly influences the distribution of 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.869
 abdominal fat predisposition 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.550
 genetics 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.320
 because there are people who do not gain weight 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.570
 the fat is deposited on the hip 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.850
 others in the buttocks and if you have 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.430
 predisposition to that you accumulate in the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.590
 belly then you will have more complicated 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.100
 remove it from this area that the other two 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.140
 groups erroneous exercises the body is 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.090
 It is customary if it has been a long time 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.130
 you come doing the same abs 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.170
 it will be time for you to change or that 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.060
 try another routine there are others 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.810
 exercises that can help you lose 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.670
 abdominal fat such as yoga 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.159
 testosterone is one of the reasons for 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.260
 have high testosterone levels 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.700
 It is due to ovarian syndrome 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.860
 polycystic 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.960
 it produces a swelling in the region 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.009
 central of the abdomen and because of this 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.539
 makes it impossible to reduce its dimensions 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.250
