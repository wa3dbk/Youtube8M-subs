00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.730
 good morning guys when we put the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.400
 driving a car is a lot 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 important driving position 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.990
 this because it allows us to have a 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.500
 less muscle fatigue and one 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.570
 better visibility what I do I go 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.939
 immediately to see the distance from the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.310
 pedal board with the lever that I have under the 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.510
 seat I can take it forward or 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.480
 bring it back 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.370
 at this point I press all the way down with 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.980
 the left foot the pedal of the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.860
 clutch and I have to have an angle to the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.320
 knee bent now I find the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.239
 distance from the steering wheel thanks to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.469
 numerous adjustments we have in 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.070
 equipment in the cars 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.289
 I can even recline the backrest 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.140
 with this lever I can carry it in 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.750
 vertical position while this lever 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.989
 allows me to lower or raise the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.629
 seat once again brought the backrest 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.030
 in a vertical position and remembering to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.490
 keep the shoulder blades resting on it 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.049
 I carry the seat at the top 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.450
 of the steering wheel rim 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.640
 I must have a relaxed arm 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.860
 quite soft at this point 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.710
 I insert the thumbs inside the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.189
 same and let them fall down 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.290
 on the breeds housing the thumbs 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.829
 within the races this is 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.170
 lets show how much your hands 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.409
 diametrically opposed they can turn 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.840
 the steering wheel in a more precise manner and ed 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 the angle on the arm la is also balanced 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 its importance just because me 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.729
 allows it to be fluid in any 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.729
 maneuver 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.260
 at this point let's move on to connect the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.790
 seatbelt as I do 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.220
 I take the hook and go to bring 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.560
 the lower part adhering to the bones 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.110
 of the pelvis while the upper part 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.470
 it must be close to the chest and I have to 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.780
 pull lengthwise from the bottom 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.459
 towards the other I can also try ad 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.830
 go ahead with the taste for 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.319
 check that in this with this 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.280
 movement does not go nor too close to 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.989
 neck to slip under the shoulder not 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.019
 let's forget the regulation of the 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.360
 headrest that must be lifted and carried 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.480
 in line with the top of the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.480
 head 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 child seats go 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.130
 secured to the rear seats by following 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.760
 scrupulously the instructions for the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.130
 mounting 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.160
 even better if they are equipped with the 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.730
 safe and practical isofix attachments from 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.730
 mount
