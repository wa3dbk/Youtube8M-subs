that would be retained in the body so it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.220 
that would be retained in the body so it

it<00:02:27.770> leaves<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.220> system<00:02:28.430> very<00:02:28.910> effectively

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
it leaves the system very effectively

and things like that if something needs
to<00:02:35.180> be<00:02:35.270> sweetened<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:36.080> we<00:02:36.260> need<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.620> check

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
to be sweetened then we need to check

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.640 
to be sweetened then we need to check
whether<00:02:37.130> we<00:02:37.430> need<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:37.670> consume<00:02:38.240> it<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.660> course
