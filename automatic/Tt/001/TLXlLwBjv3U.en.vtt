00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
use the heavy-duty type stuff and they

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.949 
use the heavy-duty type stuff and they
get<00:03:16.019> just<00:03:16.230> as<00:03:16.349> big<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:16.799> very<00:03:17.700> low<00:03:17.970> volumes<00:03:18.450> but

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
get just as big on very low volumes but

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.569 
get just as big on very low volumes but
the<00:03:19.139> reason<00:03:19.440> they<00:03:19.560> go<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.769> these<00:03:19.980> finishing

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
the reason they go to these finishing

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.819 
the reason they go to these finishing
moves<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.180> cut<00:03:21.450> all<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.840> secondary<00:03:22.350> movers

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
moves is to cut all the secondary movers

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.590 
moves is to cut all the secondary movers
out<00:03:23.010> because<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.760> you're<00:03:23.910> working<00:03:24.150> your<00:03:24.420> back

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
out because if you're working your back

out because if you're working your back
and<00:03:24.900> you've<00:03:25.079> already<00:03:25.350> done<00:03:25.739> barbell<00:03:26.250> rows

really fluffy isolation movement so that

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.680 
really fluffy isolation movement so that

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
they can cut out everything else and

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.000 
they can cut out everything else and

however<00:03:50.459> for<00:03:50.730> most<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:51.090> you<00:03:51.269> if<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.600> did

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
however for most of you if you did

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.559 
however for most of you if you did
deadlifts<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:52.380> barbell<00:03:52.769> rows<00:03:53.010> already<00:03:53.569> odds

are<00:03:55.220> especially<00:03:56.220> if<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.519> did<00:03:56.639> multiple<00:03:57.150> sets

odds<00:03:57.900> are<00:03:58.260> you're<00:03:58.530> not<00:03:58.560> going<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:58.980> stimulate

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
odds are you're not going to stimulate

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.009 
odds are you're not going to stimulate
any<00:03:59.730> more<00:03:59.940> girth<00:04:00.180> throughout<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.630> back<00:04:00.810> if

any more girth throughout the back if

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.490 
any more girth throughout the back if
you<00:04:01.170> trained<00:04:01.470> relatively<00:04:02.190> hard<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.609> heavy

you trained relatively hard and heavy

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.870 
you trained relatively hard and heavy
you're<00:04:04.500> probably<00:04:04.889> not<00:04:05.340> going<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:05.639> get

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
you're probably not going to get

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.490 
you're probably not going to get
anything<00:04:06.150> out<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.690> doing<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.959> lot<00:04:07.079> pull<00:04:07.349> downs

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
anything out of doing a lot pull downs

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.069 
anything out of doing a lot pull downs
after<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:08.010> maybe<00:04:08.459> 1%<00:04:08.819> more<00:04:09.389> growth<00:04:09.660> but

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
after that maybe 1% more growth but

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.309 
after that maybe 1% more growth but
maybe<00:04:10.340> 0%<00:04:11.340> more<00:04:11.519> growth<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.209> all<00:04:13.139> you're

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
maybe 0% more growth and all you're

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.110 
maybe 0% more growth and all you're
doing<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.829> burning<00:04:14.010> calories<00:04:14.400> at<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:14.880> point

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
doing is burning calories at that point

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.629 
doing is burning calories at that point
before<00:04:15.329> these<00:04:15.630> IFBB<00:04:16.139> guys<00:04:16.370> because<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.519> all

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
before these IFBB guys because of all

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.310 
before these IFBB guys because of all
the<00:04:17.789> drugs<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.389> additional<00:04:18.840> metabolic

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
the drugs the additional metabolic

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.960 
the drugs the additional metabolic
fatigue<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:19.919> direct<00:04:20.220> work<00:04:20.400> may

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
fatigue and that direct work may

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.580 
fatigue and that direct work may
possibly<00:04:21.599> give<00:04:21.750> them<00:04:21.780> some<00:04:22.079> more<00:04:22.229> growth<00:04:22.440> and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
possibly give them some more growth and

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.750 
possibly give them some more growth and
that's<00:04:22.770> why<00:04:22.890> they<00:04:23.010> do<00:04:23.070> these<00:04:23.280> finishing

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
that's why they do these finishing

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.370 
that's why they do these finishing
events

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
events

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.440 
events
so<00:04:25.070> hopefully<00:04:25.280> that<00:04:25.670> clarified<00:04:26.210> that<00:04:26.420> a

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
so hopefully that clarified that a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.850 
so hopefully that clarified that a
little<00:04:26.750> more<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.170> guys<00:04:27.260> understand<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
little more and you guys understand the

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.620 
little more and you guys understand the
relationship<00:04:28.520> between<00:04:28.550> high<00:04:29.210> amounts<00:04:29.600> of

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
relationship between high amounts of

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.280 
relationship between high amounts of
volume<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.850> metabolic<00:04:32.300> fatigue<00:04:32.780> it

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
volume and the metabolic fatigue it

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.690 
volume and the metabolic fatigue it
induces<00:04:33.710> versus<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.100> amount<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.400> drugs

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
induces versus the amount of drugs

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.360 
induces versus the amount of drugs
you're<00:04:34.910> on<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.120> does<00:04:35.300> make<00:04:35.540> a<00:04:35.570> difference<00:04:36.370> all

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
you're on it does make a difference all

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.770 
you're on it does make a difference all
right<00:04:37.460> guys<00:04:37.640> that's<00:04:37.880> really<00:04:38.270> all<00:04:38.390> I<00:04:38.420> have<00:04:38.690> to

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
right guys that's really all I have to

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.090 
right guys that's really all I have to
say<00:04:38.810> on<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.230> today<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.470> hope<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:39.980> has<00:04:40.070> been

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
say on that today I hope it has been

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.220 
say on that today I hope it has been
informative<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:41.240> I<00:04:41.570> will<00:04:41.750> talk<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.080> you<00:04:42.200> guys

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
informative and I will talk to you guys

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.950 
informative and I will talk to you guys
next<00:04:42.800> time
