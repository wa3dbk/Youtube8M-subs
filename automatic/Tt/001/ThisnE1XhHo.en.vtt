00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.330 

sixty<00:00:00.450> percent<00:00:00.680> so<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:01.890> do<00:00:01.949> you<00:00:02.129> calculate

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
sixty percent so how do you calculate

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.539 
sixty percent so how do you calculate
the<00:00:02.639> remaining<00:00:03.000> 40<00:00:03.449> percent<00:00:03.840> that<00:00:04.740> then<00:00:05.339> when

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
the remaining 40 percent that then when

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.440 
the remaining 40 percent that then when
you<00:00:05.670> join<00:00:06.270> them<00:00:06.509> together<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.500> 40%<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.309> 60%

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
you join them together that 40% and 60%

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.009 
you join them together that 40% and 60%
then<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.599> got<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.429> blood<00:00:11.429> volume<00:00:11.840> so<00:00:12.840> this

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
then you got the blood volume so this

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
then you got the blood volume so this
formula<00:00:13.469> simply<00:00:14.630> helps<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:15.780> reach<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
formula simply helps you reach that

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.250 
formula simply helps you reach that
volume<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:18.090> could<00:00:18.240> do<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.779> example<00:00:19.020> if

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
volume you could do this for example if

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.599 
volume you could do this for example if
I<00:00:19.380> told<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.520> just<00:00:20.750> an<00:00:21.750> example

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
I told you and this is just an example

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.170 
I told you and this is just an example
let<00:00:23.609> us<00:00:23.640> say<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> person<00:00:24.210> has<00:00:24.359> six<00:00:24.630> litter<00:00:26.180> six

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
let us say a person has six litter six

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.999 
let us say a person has six litter six
litter<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.630> plasma<00:00:28.609> that<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.670> 60%<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.619> gave

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
litter of plasma that is 60% so I gave

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.740 
litter of plasma that is 60% so I gave
you<00:00:32.130> an<00:00:32.189> easy<00:00:32.309> example<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.090> six<00:00:33.329> little<00:00:33.600> plasma

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
you an easy example so six little plasma

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.010 
you an easy example so six little plasma
means<00:00:34.110> 60%<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.670> remaining<00:00:36.210> 40%<00:00:36.600> should

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
means 60% and the remaining 40% should

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.049 
means 60% and the remaining 40% should
mean<00:00:37.200> for<00:00:37.440> litter<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.829> he<00:00:37.980> has<00:00:38.160> 10<00:00:38.430> litter

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
mean for litter so he has 10 litter

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.150 
mean for litter so he has 10 litter
blood<00:00:39.629> volume<00:00:39.809> normally<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
blood volume normally that is not the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.569 
blood volume normally that is not the
case<00:00:41.340> so<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.850> he<00:00:42.180> has<00:00:42.360> three<00:00:42.629> litters<00:00:43.579> then

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
case so if he has three litters then

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.920 
case so if he has three litters then
instead<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> remaining<00:00:45.450> four<00:00:45.629> he<00:00:45.809> would

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
instead of the remaining four he would

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.569 
instead of the remaining four he would
have<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.920> five<00:00:47.129> little<00:00:47.399> blood

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
have two so that is five little blood

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.610 
have two so that is five little blood
volume<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.059> anyways<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.930> best<00:00:49.110> way<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> work

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
volume but anyways the best way to work

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.740 
volume but anyways the best way to work
with<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.430> do<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.390> put<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
with this is to do this so put the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.380 
with this is to do this so put the
plasma<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.680> let<00:00:52.829> us<00:00:52.860> say<00:00:52.980> three<00:00:53.190> litter

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
plasma so let us say three litter

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.090 
plasma so let us say three litter
divided<00:00:54.390> by<00:00:54.510> one<00:00:54.870> minus<00:00:57.410> 0.4<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
divided by one minus 0.4 that is a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130 
divided by one minus 0.4 that is a
hematocrit<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.539> would<00:01:00.719> come<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.020> be

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
hematocrit so that would come to be

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
hematocrit so that would come to be
about<00:01:01.350> five<00:01:01.590> liters<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.290> forget<00:01:04.799> this

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
about five liters so do not forget this

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.960 
about five liters so do not forget this
formula<00:01:06.659> write<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.530> down<00:01:07.650> somewhere<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.700> use

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
formula write it down somewhere you use

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.870 
formula write it down somewhere you use
it<00:01:09.210> make<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.260> various<00:01:10.619> values<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.220> say<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.670> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it make up various values so say if a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.570 
it make up various values so say if a
person<00:01:12.180> has<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.390> plasma<00:01:13.020> value<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.590> volume<00:01:14.460> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
person has a plasma value of volume of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.230 
person has a plasma value of volume of
four<00:01:14.850> later

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
four later

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.320 
four later
how<00:01:16.020> much<00:01:16.290> blood<00:01:17.280> volume<00:01:17.640> will<00:01:17.970> he<00:01:18.150> have

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
how much blood volume will he have

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.910 
how much blood volume will he have
because<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.960> have<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.170> many<00:01:19.229> questions<00:01:19.770> we

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
because you have so many questions we

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.859 
because you have so many questions we
are<00:01:19.950> going<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.400> hope<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.630> how<00:01:21.810> to

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
are going to hope that you know how to

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
are going to hope that you know how to
do<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.500> do<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.920> quickly<00:01:23.159> they<00:01:23.820> would

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
do this and do this quickly they would

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
do this and do this quickly they would
give<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.240> values<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:24.960> kind<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.380> easily

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
give you values which are kind of easily

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.830 
give you values which are kind of easily
and<00:01:26.130> calculate<00:01:27.060> able<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> should<00:01:27.750> be

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and calculate able but you should be

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.319 
and calculate able but you should be
able<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.009> make<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:30.150> some

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
able to do this so make some do some

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.330 
able to do this so make some do some
exercises<00:01:30.960> around<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.380> thing<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.159> if<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
exercises around this thing so if a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.240 
exercises around this thing so if a
person<00:01:32.520> has<00:01:32.700> six<00:01:33.090> three<00:01:33.390> liters<00:01:34.070> plasma<00:01:35.070> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
person has six three liters plasma and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210 
person has six three liters plasma and
his<00:01:35.460> hematocrit<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.030> forty<00:01:36.689> percent<00:01:37.009> then<00:01:38.009> how

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
his hematocrit is forty percent then how

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.830 
his hematocrit is forty percent then how
much<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.610> blood<00:01:38.790> volume<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
much is the blood volume so here is a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.370 
much is the blood volume so here is a
blood<00:01:40.049> volume

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
blood volume

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.490 
blood volume
if<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.860> person<00:01:41.159> has<00:01:41.310> six<00:01:41.970> liter<00:01:42.180> plasma<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.200> his

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
if a person has six liter plasma in his

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.700 
if a person has six liter plasma in his
emetic<00:01:43.860> rate<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.100> 35%<00:01:44.520> so<00:01:45.090> one<00:01:45.270> minus<00:01:45.530> 0.35<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
emetic rate is 35% so one minus 0.35 and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.649 
emetic rate is 35% so one minus 0.35 and
that<00:01:47.040> would<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> blood<00:01:47.579> volume<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.450> do

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that would be the blood volume so do

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539 
that would be the blood volume so do
this<00:01:48.899> exercise<00:01:49.409> maybe<00:01:49.680> take<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.250> page

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
this exercise maybe take a little page

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
this exercise maybe take a little page
tag<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.720> say<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:52.439> to

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
tag it and say that this is how to

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.910 
tag it and say that this is how to
calculate<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> blood<00:01:53.399> volume<00:01:53.930> all<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.500> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
calculate the blood volume all right so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.580 
calculate the blood volume all right so
so<00:01:56.100> far<00:01:56.340> what<00:01:56.820> we<00:01:56.969> have<00:01:57.149> established<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.869> that

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
so far what we have established is that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.319 
so far what we have established is that
we<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:59.040> various<00:01:59.430> body<00:02:00.290> compartments<00:02:02.119> we<00:02:03.119> do

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
we have various body compartments we do

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.010 
we have various body compartments we do
not<00:02:03.479> yet<00:02:03.930> know<00:02:03.960> why<00:02:04.759> fluids<00:02:05.759> stay<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.689> these

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
not yet know why fluids stay in these

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.580 
not yet know why fluids stay in these
compartments<00:02:07.789> why<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:08.849> we<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.509> 40%<00:02:09.989> staying

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
compartments why do we have 40% staying

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.270 
compartments why do we have 40% staying
here<00:02:10.800> why<00:02:11.129> not<00:02:11.310> 50<00:02:11.640> here<00:02:11.849> why<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.330> 60

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
here why not 50 here why not 60

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.570 
here why not 50 here why not 60
here<00:02:13.520> why<00:02:14.209> do<00:02:14.270> we<00:02:14.510> have<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.110> remaining<00:02:15.590> 20%

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
here why do we have the remaining 20%

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.240 
here why do we have the remaining 20%
here<00:02:17.590> remember<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:18.709> are<00:02:18.740> talking<00:02:19.010> about<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
here remember we are talking about the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.000 
here remember we are talking about the
body<00:02:19.430> weights<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:20.209> 20%<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> body<00:02:21.709> weight

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
body weights the 20% of the body weight

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.420 
body weights the 20% of the body weight
otherwise<00:02:22.700> about<00:02:23.569> 2/3<00:02:24.260> here<00:02:24.740> and<00:02:24.980> one-third

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
otherwise about 2/3 here and one-third

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.090 
otherwise about 2/3 here and one-third
over<00:02:25.670> here<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:26.600> why<00:02:26.780> do<00:02:26.840> we<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.110> 2/3<00:02:27.950> over

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
over here so why do we have 2/3 over

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.160 
over here so why do we have 2/3 over
there<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.760> why<00:02:28.910> do<00:02:29.240> we<00:02:29.420> have<00:02:29.600> one-third<00:02:29.959> over

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
there and why do we have one-third over

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.270 
there and why do we have one-third over
here<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:30.830> have<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.250> talk<00:02:31.489> about<00:02:31.670> those<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:34.010> this

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
here we have to talk about those so this

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.190 
here we have to talk about those so this
is<00:02:34.489> now<00:02:34.910> going<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.300> be<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.480> one<00:02:35.780> which<00:02:36.170> is

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
is now going to be the one which is

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.620 
is now going to be the one which is
going<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.590> help<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.880> hospital<00:02:38.360> floors

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
going to help you on the hospital floors

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.440 
going to help you on the hospital floors
now<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.590> things<00:02:40.040> which<00:02:40.250> is<00:02:40.370> coming<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.910> really

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
now the things which is coming is really

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.240 
now the things which is coming is really
important<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.380> let's<00:02:43.300> go<00:02:44.300> back<00:02:44.769> and<00:02:45.769> clean<00:02:46.040> up

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
important so let's go back and clean up

00:02:46.250 --> 00:03:03.570 
important so let's go back and clean up
the<00:02:46.370> board<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.760> little<00:02:46.910> bit

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.150 

okay

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
okay

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.080 
okay
so<00:03:07.160> once<00:03:07.790> again<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:09.290> is<00:03:09.470> what<00:03:09.620> we<00:03:09.740> have<00:03:10.090> so

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
so once again this is what we have so

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.520 
so once again this is what we have so
the<00:03:11.209> important<00:03:11.630> thing<00:03:11.660> to<00:03:11.810> understand<00:03:12.319> is

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
the important thing to understand is

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.949 
the important thing to understand is
what<00:03:13.280> are<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.670> compositions<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.750> these

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
what are the compositions of these

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.070 
what are the compositions of these
compartments<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:16.390> when<00:03:17.390> we<00:03:17.510> talk<00:03:17.720> about<00:03:17.870> the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
compartments and when we talk about the

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.720 
compartments and when we talk about the
compositions<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.770> these<00:03:18.920> compartments<00:03:19.310> why

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
compositions of these compartments why

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.900 
compositions of these compartments why
do<00:03:19.790> we<00:03:20.500> why<00:03:21.500> are<00:03:21.740> we<00:03:21.890> so<00:03:22.100> interested<00:03:22.130> in

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
do we why are we so interested in

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.160 
do we why are we so interested in
understanding<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.600> composition<00:03:24.140> the

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
understanding the composition the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.900 
understanding the composition the
importance<00:03:24.709> of<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.980> composition<00:03:25.550> is<00:03:25.700> that

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
importance of the composition is that

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.060 
importance of the composition is that
number<00:03:26.570> one<00:03:26.780> these<00:03:27.380> things<00:03:27.440> are<00:03:27.800> going<00:03:27.950> to

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
number one these things are going to

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.510 
number one these things are going to
affect<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.910> patient<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:30.110> for<00:03:30.260> example<00:03:30.709> let's

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
affect the patient so for example let's

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.690 
affect the patient so for example let's
say<00:03:31.700> we<00:03:31.730> have<00:03:32.090> sodium<00:03:32.620> present<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.280> XSL

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
say we have sodium present in the XSL

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.870 
say we have sodium present in the XSL
you<00:03:34.819> know<00:03:34.940> fluid<00:03:35.380> the<00:03:36.380> presence<00:03:37.190> of<00:03:37.340> the

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
you know fluid the presence of the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.240 
you know fluid the presence of the
sodium<00:03:38.300> in<00:03:39.610> itself<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:41.410> an<00:03:42.410> important<00:03:42.920> factor

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
sodium in itself is an important factor

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.699 
sodium in itself is an important factor
for<00:03:43.280> our<00:03:43.489> homeostasis<00:03:44.320> sodium<00:03:45.320> as<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.560> know

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
for our homeostasis sodium as you know

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.620 
for our homeostasis sodium as you know
is<00:03:45.830> very<00:03:45.860> important<00:03:46.489> for<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.880> functioning<00:03:47.450> of

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
is very important for the functioning of

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.949 
is very important for the functioning of
our<00:03:47.780> neurons<00:03:48.580> so<00:03:49.580> if<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.910> sodium<00:03:50.330> level<00:03:50.750> goes

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
our neurons so if the sodium level goes

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.620 
our neurons so if the sodium level goes
down<00:03:51.320> we<00:03:52.100> would<00:03:52.280> start<00:03:52.580> having<00:03:52.820> neurological

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
down we would start having neurological

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.990 
down we would start having neurological
effects<00:03:54.019> similarly<00:03:54.890> chloride<00:03:55.489> very

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
effects similarly chloride very

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.090 
effects similarly chloride very
important<00:03:56.450> for<00:03:56.660> for<00:03:57.170> other<00:03:57.350> function

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
important for for other function

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.460 
important for for other function
similarly<00:03:58.580> calcium<00:03:59.030> very<00:03:59.239> important<00:03:59.630> for<00:03:59.810> so

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
similarly calcium very important for so

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.380 
similarly calcium very important for so
we<00:04:01.160> have<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.489> understand<00:04:01.880> what<00:04:02.090> are<00:04:02.120> the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
we have to understand what are the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.320 
we have to understand what are the
compositions<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.470> these<00:04:03.980> compartments<00:04:04.430> not

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
compositions in these compartments not

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.449 
compositions in these compartments not
just<00:04:05.660> for<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.989> functional<00:04:06.440> part<00:04:06.620> but<00:04:06.920> also<00:04:07.160> to

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
just for the functional part but also to

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.759 
just for the functional part but also to
understand<00:04:07.940> why<00:04:08.269> the<00:04:08.330> volume<00:04:09.080> is<00:04:09.290> maintained

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
understand why the volume is maintained

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:12.280 
understand why the volume is maintained
the<00:04:09.950> way<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.100> is<00:04:10.280> maintained<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:11.079> alright<00:04:12.079> in

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the way it is maintained so alright in

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.560 
the way it is maintained so alright in
our<00:04:12.560> next<00:04:12.620> lecture<00:04:13.459> what<00:04:13.910> we<00:04:13.940> will<00:04:14.209> do<00:04:14.360> is

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
our next lecture what we will do is

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.349 
our next lecture what we will do is
we'll<00:04:15.110> start<00:04:15.470> looking<00:04:15.920> at<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.640> compositions

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
we'll start looking at the compositions

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.910 
we'll start looking at the compositions
of<00:04:17.600> various<00:04:18.130> fluids<00:04:19.130> thank<00:04:19.790> you
