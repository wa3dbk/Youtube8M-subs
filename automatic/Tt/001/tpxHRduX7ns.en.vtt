00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
yeah the really nice thing is that they

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.429 
yeah the really nice thing is that they
have<00:00:21.369> a<00:00:21.400> 10<00:00:21.730> millimeter<00:00:21.970> core<00:00:22.570> inside<00:00:23.199> the

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
have a 10 millimeter core inside the

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.580 
have a 10 millimeter core inside the
axle<00:00:23.890> and<00:00:24.160> then<00:00:24.669> they<00:00:25.269> machined<00:00:25.930> it<00:00:26.140> down<00:00:26.349> to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
axle and then they machined it down to

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.409 
axle and then they machined it down to
eight<00:00:26.769> millimeters<00:00:27.009> where<00:00:27.730> your<00:00:27.849> bearing<00:00:28.150> sit

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
eight millimeters where your bearing sit

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.069 
eight millimeters where your bearing sit
for<00:00:28.900> like<00:00:29.020> unbendable<00:00:29.829> performance<00:00:30.550> so<00:00:31.270> not

00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:32.079 
for like unbendable performance so not

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.630 
for like unbendable performance so not
like<00:00:32.199> calibers<00:00:32.710> they're<00:00:32.980> not<00:00:33.129> going<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.309> bend

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
like calibers they're not going to bend

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.299 
like calibers they're not going to bend
they're<00:00:34.210> going<00:00:34.329> to<00:00:34.420> stay<00:00:34.600> pretty<00:00:35.170> solid<00:00:35.530> they

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
they're going to stay pretty solid they

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.369 
they're going to stay pretty solid they
also<00:00:36.489> have<00:00:36.699> a<00:00:36.760> ball<00:00:37.000> pivot<00:00:37.239> which<00:00:37.780> allows<00:00:38.080> for

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
also have a ball pivot which allows for

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.050 
also have a ball pivot which allows for
more<00:00:38.530> lean<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:39.760> your<00:00:39.790> turn

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
more lean to your turn

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.690 
more lean to your turn
that<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.420> makes<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:42.930> nice

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.780 

and<00:00:45.820> one<00:00:46.540> thing<00:00:46.720> I<00:00:46.810> notice<00:00:47.170> about<00:00:47.260> these<00:00:47.500> traps

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
and one thing I notice about these traps

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.940 
and one thing I notice about these traps
they<00:00:50.120> just<00:00:50.390> they<00:00:50.660> feel<00:00:50.900> really<00:00:51.230> bulky<00:00:51.590> but

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
they just they feel really bulky but

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.530 
they just they feel really bulky but
when<00:00:52.130> you're<00:00:52.310> like<00:00:52.700> carbon<00:00:53.150> bottom<00:00:53.420> or

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
when you're like carbon bottom or

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.560 
when you're like carbon bottom or
anything<00:00:53.900> like<00:00:53.930> that<00:00:54.790> going<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:55.970> initiate<00:00:56.540> a

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
anything like that going to initiate a

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.400 
anything like that going to initiate a
slide<00:00:56.930> they're<00:00:57.530> just<00:00:57.560> super<00:00:57.980> stable<00:00:58.400> and<00:00:59.410> kill

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
slide they're just super stable and kill

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.649 
slide they're just super stable and kill
it<00:01:00.590> all<00:01:01.100> around

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.149 

can<00:01:04.780> take<00:01:04.960> them<00:01:05.079> up<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.320> speeds<00:01:05.740> but<00:01:05.979> then

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
can take them up I speeds but then

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.890 
can take them up I speeds but then
they're<00:01:06.999> still<00:01:07.299> really<00:01:07.560> responsive<00:01:08.560> that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.170 

put<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.440> hand<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.250> be<00:01:12.460> positive

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
put the hand to be positive

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.330 
put the hand to be positive
I<00:01:15.850> think<00:01:16.850> they<00:01:16.970> come<00:01:17.180> 48<00:01:17.840> degrees<00:01:18.230> stock<00:01:19.100> with

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
I think they come 48 degrees stock with

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.160 
I think they come 48 degrees stock with
the<00:01:19.490> hangar<00:01:19.730> how<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:19.910> is<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.300> then<00:01:20.900> if<00:01:21.050> you

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
the hangar how it is and then if you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.360 
the hangar how it is and then if you
flip<00:01:21.410> it

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
flip it

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.640 
flip it
so<00:01:24.370> I've<00:01:24.820> heard<00:01:25.060> some<00:01:25.240> stuff<00:01:25.480> like<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.410> stop

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
so I've heard some stuff like the stop

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.920 
so I've heard some stuff like the stop
pushing<00:01:27.100> suck<00:01:27.550> this<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.360> this<00:01:28.510> there<00:01:28.780> to

thing I was going to say was these
trucks<00:01:57.340> really<00:01:57.760> like<00:01:58.030> they're<00:01:58.300> not<00:01:58.450> like

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
trucks really like they're not like

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.310 
trucks really like they're not like
caliber<00:02:00.040> where<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.600> kind<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:01.900> want<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.170> have<00:02:02.290> a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
caliber where you kind of want to have a

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.610 
caliber where you kind of want to have a
neutral<00:02:03.060> tightness<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:05.050> makes<00:02:05.290> too<00:02:05.470> much

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
neutral tightness that makes too much

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.160 
neutral tightness that makes too much
sense<00:02:05.680> for<00:02:06.040> like<00:02:06.310> or<00:02:06.970> Paris<00:02:07.540> where<00:02:07.810> they<00:02:07.960> have

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
sense for like or Paris where they have

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.090 
sense for like or Paris where they have
to<00:02:08.320> be<00:02:08.440> written<00:02:08.649> sort<00:02:09.040> of<00:02:09.130> loose

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
to be written sort of loose

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.700 
to be written sort of loose
but<00:02:11.700> these<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.210> be<00:02:12.360> written<00:02:13.020> either<00:02:13.260> like

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
but these can be written either like

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.780 
but these can be written either like
loose<00:02:14.250> or<00:02:14.640> tight<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.000 

they<00:02:18.299> still<00:02:18.659> feel<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:18.989> responsive<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.860> nice

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
they still feel a responsive and nice

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.010 
they still feel a responsive and nice
and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.010 
and
I<00:02:21.080> think<00:02:21.980> they're<00:02:22.130> just<00:02:22.160> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:23.170> powerful

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
I think they're just kind of a powerful

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.960 
I think they're just kind of a powerful
like<00:02:25.440> they're<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> closest<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.280> precision<00:02:26.670> as

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
like they're the closest to precision as

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.990 
like they're the closest to precision as
you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.240> get<00:02:27.420> out<00:02:27.570> mestra<00:02:28.460> sup-<00:02:29.460> that<00:02:29.970> i

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
you can get out mestra sup- that i

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.550 
you can get out mestra sup- that i
thought<00:02:30.270> was<00:02:30.360> prayer<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.720> coolest<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.320> try

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
thought was prayer the coolest we try

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.680 
thought was prayer the coolest we try
these<00:02:31.620> trucks<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.460> can't<00:02:33.240> see<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.510> because<00:02:33.600> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
these trucks is can't see it because of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.380 
these trucks is can't see it because of
my<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.110> but<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.860> 10<00:02:35.160> millimeter<00:02:35.550> axle<00:02:36.060> comes

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
my will but the 10 millimeter axle comes

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.640 
my will but the 10 millimeter axle comes
out<00:02:36.630> only<00:02:37.580> probably<00:02:38.580> half<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.510> mil<00:02:39.750> just<00:02:40.290> a<00:02:40.380> tiny

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
out only probably half a mil just a tiny

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.250 
out only probably half a mil just a tiny
little<00:02:40.800> bit<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.790> create<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.300> little<00:02:42.570> extra<00:02:42.990> like

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
little bit to create a little extra like

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.530 
little bit to create a little extra like
built-in<00:02:44.070> speed<00:02:44.550> washer<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.120> precision

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
built-in speed washer like precision

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.590 
built-in speed washer like precision
trucks<00:02:46.020> would<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.100> only<00:02:47.460> need<00:02:47.610> one<00:02:48.060> like

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
trucks would so you only need one like

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.620 
trucks would so you only need one like
four<00:02:48.990> speed<00:02:49.710> rings<00:02:50.010> instead<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.730> eight<00:02:51.060> so

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
four speed rings instead of eight so

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.810 
four speed rings instead of eight so
you're<00:02:51.840> dr.<00:02:52.050> losing<00:02:52.470> another<00:02:53.280> thing<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
you're dr. losing another thing is the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.330 
you're dr. losing another thing is the
base<00:02:54.120> plate<00:02:54.300> comes<00:02:54.870> with<00:02:55.260> different<00:02:55.980> mounting

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
base plate comes with different mounting

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.750 
base plate comes with different mounting
options<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:57.420> like<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:58.650> know<00:02:58.680> how<00:02:59.010> on<00:02:59.310> a<00:02:59.370> normal

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
options so like you know how on a normal

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.510 
options so like you know how on a normal
like<00:03:00.090> caliber<00:03:00.630> or<00:03:00.870> Paris<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.890> two

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
like caliber or Paris you would have two

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.190 
like caliber or Paris you would have two
holes<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> back<00:03:03.300> of<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.540> base<00:03:03.690> plate<00:03:03.870> for

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
holes in the back of the base plate for

holes in the back of the base plate for
old<00:03:04.380> school<00:03:04.740> or<00:03:04.950> new<00:03:05.010> school<00:03:05.250> mounting<00:03:05.940> well

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
old school or new school mounting well

this<00:03:06.750> one<00:03:06.930> has<00:03:06.960> two<00:03:07.290> holes<00:03:07.500> in<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.830> back<00:03:08.010> and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
this one has two holes in the back and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.240 
this one has two holes in the back and
two<00:03:08.700> holes<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.270> rough<00:03:09.630> here<00:03:09.960> so<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:11.010> way<00:03:11.190> you

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
two holes up rough here so that way you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.310 
two holes up rough here so that way you
can<00:03:11.670> like<00:03:11.880> make<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.420> wheelbase<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.990> little

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
can like make a wheelbase a little

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.020 
can like make a wheelbase a little
shorter

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.030 

still<00:03:16.360> old<00:03:16.900> school<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.440> just<00:03:20.650> gives<00:03:20.830> a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
still old school but it just gives a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.170 
still old school but it just gives a
little<00:03:21.069> more<00:03:21.370> adjustability

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
little more adjustability

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.339 
little more adjustability
