00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we designed all the components to

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.240 
we designed all the components to

and<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> watch<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.710> could<00:01:01.860> just<00:01:02.010> snap<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and if you watch I could just snap it

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.920 
and if you watch I could just snap it
into<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.760> shell<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> basically<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> can

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
into the shell and so basically you can

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.219 
into the shell and so basically you can
assemble<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.500> entire<00:01:07.860> drum<00:01:08.160> set<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.759> about<00:01:09.360> 20
