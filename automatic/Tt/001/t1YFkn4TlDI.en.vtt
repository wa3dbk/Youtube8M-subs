00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.350 
made out of basically all cotton and
then<00:02:32.650> there's<00:02:32.950> a<00:02:33.160> bit<00:02:33.370> of<00:02:33.400> spandex<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:34.180> there

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
then there's a bit of spandex on there

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.809 
then there's a bit of spandex on there
as<00:02:34.450> well<00:02:35.130> this<00:02:36.130> was<00:02:36.340> made<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.670> China<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
as well this was made in China and the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.850 
as well this was made in China and the
part<00:02:42.819> right<00:02:42.970> here<00:02:43.300> has<00:02:44.019> lost<00:02:44.290> stitching<00:02:44.709> on<00:02:44.830> it
