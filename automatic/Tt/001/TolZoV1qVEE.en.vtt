00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
rights when you play good with the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.240 
rights when you play good with the
pistols<00:02:06.479> because<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.469> pistols<00:02:07.860> are<00:02:07.979> not

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
pistols because the pistols are not

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.080 
pistols because the pistols are not
really<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.330> an<00:02:10.140> overpowered<00:02:10.800> weapon<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
course when you have

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.320 
course when you have
will<00:02:13.680> they<00:02:13.980> are<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.670> difficult<00:02:15.180> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
will they are kind that difficult to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.020 
will they are kind that difficult to
handle<00:02:15.510> because<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.710> limited<00:02:17.310> ammo<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
in translation right there because

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
in translation right there because
sometimes<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.970> will<00:02:24.150> find<00:02:24.450> yourself

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
sometimes you will find yourself

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.680 
sometimes you will find yourself
shooting<00:02:25.650> at<00:02:25.860> really<00:02:26.820> close<00:02:26.850> range<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
shooting at really close range and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.200 
shooting at really close range and
missing<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.410> they<00:02:29.220> are<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.580> sometimes

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
missing and they are just sometimes

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.240 
missing and they are just sometimes
inaccurate<00:02:30.600> so<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.290> course<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.650> cannot<00:02:31.860> slay

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
inaccurate so of course you cannot slay

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.700

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the game of the assault rifles when you

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.199 
the game of the assault rifles when you
use<00:02:37.290> those<00:02:37.590> pictures<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.640> just

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
use those pictures you have to just

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.420 
use those pictures you have to just
measure<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.080> situation<00:02:40.650> every<00:02:41.100> single<00:02:41.250> time

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
measure the situation every single time

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.810 
measure the situation every single time
in<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.330> game<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.870> relied<00:02:43.410> on<00:02:43.410> intuition<00:02:44.130> yeah

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
in this game I relied on intuition yeah

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.210 
in this game I relied on intuition yeah
true<00:02:45.360> matrix<00:02:45.840> tie<00:02:46.020> right<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.709> was<00:02:46.950> trying

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
true matrix tie right there I was trying

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.970 
true matrix tie right there I was trying
to<00:02:47.490> predict<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.420> situations<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.500> was<00:02:49.800> trying

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
to predict the situations I was trying

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.430 
to predict the situations I was trying
to<00:02:50.250> predict<00:02:50.670> where<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.330> enemies<00:02:51.690> will<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
to predict where the enemies will be and

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.400 
to predict where the enemies will be and
I<00:02:53.280> did<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.910> pretty<00:02:53.970> good<00:02:54.450> job<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.870> guess<00:02:55.170> because

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
I did a pretty good job I guess because

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.070 
I did a pretty good job I guess because
on<00:02:55.860> look<00:02:56.760> at<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:57.209> moment<00:02:57.480> right<00:02:57.780> there<00:02:57.840> I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
on look at that moment right there I

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.530 
on look at that moment right there I
just<00:02:58.530> avoided<00:02:58.680> those<00:02:59.459> bullets<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.300> they

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
just avoided those bullets like they

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.720 
just avoided those bullets like they
were<00:03:00.690> nothing<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.230> just<00:03:01.290> turned<00:03:01.800> around<00:03:02.010> on<00:03:02.430> him

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
were nothing I just turned around on him

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.630 
were nothing I just turned around on him
and<00:03:02.940> this<00:03:03.870> was<00:03:04.110> like<00:03:04.380> slowing<00:03:05.100> down<00:03:05.430> the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
and this was like slowing down the

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.960 
and this was like slowing down the
situation<00:03:06.209> realizing<00:03:07.050> where<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:07.709> were<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.220> of

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
situation realizing where we were and of

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.729 
situation realizing where we were and of
course<00:03:09.360> throwing<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.810> smoke<00:03:10.080> grenade<00:03:10.110> we<00:03:10.560> get

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
course throwing a smoke grenade we get

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.280 
course throwing a smoke grenade we get
out<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.250> difficult<00:03:11.730> situation<00:03:12.330> helps<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.050> lot

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
out of difficult situation helps a lot

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.010 
out of difficult situation helps a lot
and<00:03:13.530> this<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.520> what<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.880> can<00:03:15.239> pretty<00:03:15.450> much<00:03:15.570> do

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
and this is what you can pretty much do

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.600 
and this is what you can pretty much do
when<00:03:16.260> you're<00:03:16.440> using<00:03:16.650> duel<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.250> pistols

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
when you're using duel with pistols

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.360 
when you're using duel with pistols
because<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.080> really<00:03:19.650> close<00:03:19.980> your

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
because you have to be really close your

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.729 
because you have to be really close your
opponent<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.299> be<00:03:21.480> at<00:03:21.739> point-blank

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
opponent you have to be at point-blank

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.680 
opponent you have to be at point-blank
range<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.580> to<00:03:23.700> be<00:03:23.850> at<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.180> really<00:03:24.480> close

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
range you have to be at the really close

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.380 
range you have to be at the really close
range<00:03:25.049> to<00:03:25.290> hit<00:03:25.470> your<00:03:25.620> opponents<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
range to hit your opponents and

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.729 
range to hit your opponents and
sometimes<00:03:27.390> when<00:03:27.630> they<00:03:27.840> camp<00:03:28.110> like<00:03:28.440> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
sometimes when they camp like that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.490 
sometimes when they camp like that
because<00:03:28.950> i<00:03:29.459> saw<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.180> kill<00:03:30.510> cam<00:03:30.720> later<00:03:30.989> on<00:03:31.380> i

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
because i saw that kill cam later on i

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.009 
because i saw that kill cam later on i
saw<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.980> little<00:03:32.459> bit<00:03:32.730> where<00:03:33.000> she<00:03:33.180> wasn't<00:03:33.660> i

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
saw a little bit where she wasn't i

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.479 
saw a little bit where she wasn't i
realized<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.680> he<00:03:34.860> was<00:03:35.010> standing<00:03:35.250> there

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
realized that he was standing there
