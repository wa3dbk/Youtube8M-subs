give<00:04:56.220> us<00:04:56.250> some<00:04:56.400> very<00:04:56.669> clear<00:04:57.240> data<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.990> it

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
give us some very clear data and it

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.950 
give us some very clear data and it
therefore<00:04:58.940> confirms<00:04:59.940> in<00:05:00.210> our<00:05:00.360> mind<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.840> we

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 
can actually measure whether there is an

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.920 
can actually measure whether there is an
improvement<00:06:56.160> within<00:06:56.670> the<00:06:56.790> trade<00:06:57.060> and<00:06:57.330> the

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
improvement within the trade and the

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.080 
improvement within the trade and the
encouraging<00:06:58.380> factor<00:06:58.830> is<00:06:59.010> that<00:06:59.520> it's<00:06:59.700> moving

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
encouraging factor is that it's moving
