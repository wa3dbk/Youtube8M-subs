00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 when they learned that you are interested 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.799
 Anji how the transition took place both possible 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.119
 representations of all this sees in 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:22.109
 end of season I was told that level 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 there are interests there too so here is the place 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.529
 December were negotiated and here at the end 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.929
 December , everything went well 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.059
 turned out and signed a contract team 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.250
 seed and first place therefore every 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.380
 I have had this step forward as far as I am 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.379
 I know you are not only he was interested 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.440
 yes yes yes there were other applications and others 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.100
 The teams called well, as if Anji 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.079
 principle can be said immediately before 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.520
 tolerance I already have the hall in interest so he 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.840
 same was the priority on the option for me 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.930
 when I immediately said that the first first 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.149
 the team go it was yourself like here 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.710
 This is the first season you evaluate here 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.970
 yours their level and really you 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.439
 managed to show more 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.280
 stable successful group comparison with 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.590
 previous seasons difficult answer so 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.409
 teams anyway completed stock 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.040
 together to his first part of the championship then 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.110
 that I managed to score five goals there 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.500
 how it contributed and what he 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.650
 I kill them I know that even though I could 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.290
 He scored 6 but could have scored 16, what he 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.090
 much moment in drawn here to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.100
 Unfortunately I do not know why on 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.980
 progress altogether before 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.760
 Makhachkala played 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.560
 yes Makhachkala was still I played for the torpedo 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.890
 2000 seems to us a year and also came 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.940
 we play it ourselves a long time ago it was 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.350
 but at the stadium seems dynamo Makhachkala 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.120
 yah 30 programs 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.180
 that is, then mom meets 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.150
 inconvenience mr though but could also not 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.490
 succeeded but nevertheless this one you are not 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.310
 the only gate of them and speaking for 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.980
 Podolsk see a way, yes it does 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.010
 forgot about publishing was doing it 1 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:13.220

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.410
 as far as I know you are a graduate from sdyushor 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.170
 the zenith of St. Petersburg Sergei will be said 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.720
 to divide the number so how would most 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.280
 promising in their generation so far on 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.920
 top level you didn't have to play 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.170
 in general dreamed of ringing for play at all 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.730
 probably any St. Petersburg boy 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.120
 groups come to school 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.410

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.470
 how such a dream was not much 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.810

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.230

 for the same generally with them somehow talked 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.640
 need constantly with albert so far 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.160
 constantly communicate, in principle, not very 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.750
 It happened so much I do not know very much 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.390
 talked a lot about knives during 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.500
 season here I am somehow interested but 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.740
 how did it happen 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.770
 with overclocking, I also know good guys 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.750
 not much to tell interesting that is 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.580
 you still don't know what you can 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.710
 render you life then year was 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.960
 albert loves to tell stories 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.400
 therefore, there is a lot to be with him 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.920
 communicate now constantly communicate 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.720
 so from your partners in other 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.880
 Here are the teams you have found 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.100
 Alexander Krivoruchko with whom together 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.520
 played the salt of the tangenta were familiar 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:09.730
 like that, really, too, salute played bags 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.530
 fry we play it together 1 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.739
 school was taught but here is not the same 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.140
 so naturally I was with them 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.720
 here with whom he is there she is gazimagomedov 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.120
 we crossed paths with him too 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.370
 level as a chirkin grisha also intersect 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.130
 A little view and I've watched photos 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.110
 some of yours and on them you are often under 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.540
 number 10 i.e. for different teams in 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.460
 this under this number acted as 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.440
 often you got such a popular 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.860
 numbered for many it pay and 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.560
 under it played for it I but gave everything 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.360
 I just played 50 hockey 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.290
 so in any team when he came 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:51.640
 tried about 10 here but where are we too 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:53.169
 Council played that's why I try to give 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.690
 if there is no other choice 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.660
 you mentioned father he really 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.440
 played for the St. Petersburg ska hockey player 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.930
 has gone 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.150
 but it's generally surprising that you didn't go by 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.850
 his footsteps are more on football naira 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.410
 was interesting because somehow when 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.660
 the little one was up to skate 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.090
 after games dad when played after game 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.660
 went out riding the hell not visible 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:20.590
 recognized you outstanding case there is not 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:24.080
 I saw Ovechkin like that 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.550
 that's why it's so easy in summer 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.610
 ghans and was in the yard playing 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.160
 the folder noticed is adjusted at the school all 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.300
 in those seven years it turned out to be in an interview in 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.170
 one you said that 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.990
 vonso time father brought to god can tame 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.790
 ni mo testers on this come on since 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.120
 cheer for this cube and liking not 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:46.670
 change well yes hard the last five 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.660
 years but no on earth anyway manchester 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.630
 do you like cola 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.430
 and what is the fate of you t-shirts it is by the way 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.470
 was just bought in a store or is it 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.980
 just an apple would not be honest not 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:00.020
 I know, but I think Iâ€™m buying them soon. 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.020
 fate didn't know everything was gone because and 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.630
 many moved mom and dad so 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.160
 there is somewhere between sweden and finland 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.710
 russia patina 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.570
 no football hobbies free 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.310
 time because now at the training camp 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:17.450
 Perhaps this is especially true to those 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:22.310
 occupy yourself created an hour after 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:23.870
 afternoon sleep so the show overcame principle 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.350
 nothing especially usually here with the guys 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.419
 can play playstation as well 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.620
 began to be seen now so mom rock 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.620
 I forgot to take a book 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:38.270
 yes with two brothers called your 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:40.249
 contract prohibits you from playing against 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.800
 the dynamo is right there in the first match for 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:47.979
 which season plays just for 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:51.349
 do not prohibit if you score like this one 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:53.499
 we are actually adding up in our 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:56.449
 fans for us because the fans 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:58.249
 teams don't say down constantly 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.309
 support creative celebrate 

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:04.939
 Probably but I will not be exactly like this 

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:07.069
 tribute to our fans here well, 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.379
 so of course the shuttlecock itself to score someone 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:11.120
 consider here on the game yes but not 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.580
 we will take a instead of in the table about 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.830
 emergence as anzhi's main competitors 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.779
 fight for 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:21.259
 think all the same it seems to me 

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:23.569
 seems thick too good teams there with 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:26.029
 soon good gas ready then we play 

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:28.909
 up to that middle know everyone who's there 

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:31.159
 this is the top five for everyone 

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:33.800
 last to fight so heavy 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:36.800
 fighting pissing out thick from wings on 

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.819
 departures the game is why it will be hard 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.129
 us in the first game 

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:42.129
 take it and then everything will be fine
