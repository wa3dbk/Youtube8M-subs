 dog and what do I have to buy 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.559
 pay attention at all 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.639
 We answer these and other questions 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.639
 now in the video

 many dog ​​schools recommend the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.599
 use of harnesses especially for 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.789
 dogs are very restless on a leash 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.980
 go easy scare or one 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.079
 pronounced hunting is one 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.940
 dishes are particularly suitable for 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.949
 fast jerky movements 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.199
 the pressure point shifts to the 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.180
 chest of the animal and thus relieves 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.140
 nip the delicate neck and 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.420
 back area 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.949
 Moreover, the move easier rose 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.949
 intervene in hot situations 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.289
 also the time of the leash shifted 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.420
 in the harness from the neck to the 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.070
 Back area is an important point 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.620
 in the communication between the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.629
 Animals is the neck plays in social 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.489
 interactions play a crucial role 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.770
 an unrestricted freedom of movement 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.479
 in this area allows the dog 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.390
 despite leash in meetings with 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.940
 kindred an unaffected 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.940
 body language and more differentiated 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 expressive possibilities 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.780
 in different training methods and 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.930
 this is often done in dog sports 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.090
 Work tool with the on or off of the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.770
 the dog knows when he works 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.560
 have to focus and when that 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 Training is stopped at activities like 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.640
 the mantrailing or to the sport of sports 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.770
 mainly under lion tension 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.450
 the glass is distributed 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.780
 evenly over the whole 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.730
 chest muscles of the dog in comparison 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.590
 the collar is usually something 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.170
 more expensive and also the handling is 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.180
 not every dog ​​gets used to it at first 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.190
 is excited about the procedure and can 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.450
 put that over the head even as 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.250
 feel threatening 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.979
 here is the patience of herrchen and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.940
 fish and one or the other 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.940
 asked convincing little things 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.019
 Another disadvantage of straying is 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.610
 the faster pollution by the 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.680
 romp with other dogs and 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.360
 enjoy rolling in the grass 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.470
 cleaned much more often 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.470
 be as collars 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.660
 badly fitting harnesses can also 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.670
 restrict the freedom of movement or 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.320
 the dog by chafing at 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.330
 run uncomfortable 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.250
 When buying must necessarily on the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.050
 be paid attention to accuracy 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.940
 the shoulder blades and elbows 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.800
 should be completely free in the movement 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.800
 and the dishes must not slip 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.740
 buckles to adjust the size 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.720
 facilitate the adjustment in the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.430
 collar should be soft material 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.660
 and no scratchy stitches or 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.660
 ornaments 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.960
 in choosing the right tableware 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.520
 must also on the anatomy of the dog 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.320
 be considered 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.330
 not every dish is suitable for 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.490
 every breed will be in the specialized trade 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.970
 different models are offered 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.650
 partly differ greatly from each other 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.240
 to get the right harness for your dog
