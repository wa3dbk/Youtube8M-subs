talking about some of the limitations of
planar<00:01:01.230> transistors<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.490> then<00:01:02.640> we're<00:01:02.730> surely

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
planar transistors and then we're surely

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
planar transistors and then we're surely
level<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.510> larger<00:01:03.900> than<00:01:04.020> life<00:01:04.230> models<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
level is larger than life models that

show what helping pets work and giving
you<00:01:07.470> our<00:01:07.530> partners<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.160> visualization<00:01:08.460> yes

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
you our partners and visualization yes

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.490 
you our partners and visualization yes
so<00:01:09.240> getting<00:01:09.420> down<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> 40<00:01:10.290> nanometers

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so getting down there to 40 nanometers

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.010 
so getting down there to 40 nanometers
now<00:01:11.040> like<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> huge<00:01:11.550> thing<00:01:11.880> right<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
now like a huge thing right it's a

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.630 
now like a huge thing right it's a
continuous<00:01:13.470> progress<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.070> continue<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
continuous progress we continue to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.610 
continuous progress we continue to
shrink<00:01:15.420> note<00:01:15.720> after<00:01:15.900> note<00:01:16.050> every<00:01:16.440> two<00:01:16.590> years

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
shrink note after note every two years

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.160 
shrink note after note every two years
it's<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> natural<00:01:17.820> progression<00:01:17.940> with<00:01:18.750> FinFETs

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
it's a natural progression with FinFETs

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.660 
it's a natural progression with FinFETs
were<00:01:19.320> changing<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> architecture<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.520> the

but from a scaling perspective it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.180 
but from a scaling perspective it
continues<00:01:25.260> the<00:01:25.350> scaling<00:01:25.710> we've<00:01:25.860> been<00:01:25.979> doing

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
continues the scaling we've been doing

surrounding<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.530> bins<00:01:58.039> to<00:01:58.580> give<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> very<00:01:59.030> good

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
surrounding the bins to give a very good

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.190 
surrounding the bins to give a very good
control<00:02:02.439> performance<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.479> how<00:02:05.570> small<00:02:05.810> is<00:02:06.020> this

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
control performance so how small is this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.440 
control performance so how small is this
these<00:02:07.070> are<00:02:07.189> all<00:02:07.250> designed<00:02:07.700> at<00:02:07.939> the<00:02:07.970> these

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
these are all designed at the these

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.120 
these are all designed at the these
FinFETs<00:02:08.899> are<00:02:09.019> designed<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.319> be<00:02:09.440> 40<00:02:09.920> nanometers

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
FinFETs are designed to be 40 nanometers

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.250 
FinFETs are designed to be 40 nanometers
so<00:02:10.459> this<00:02:10.610> there'd<00:02:11.239> be<00:02:11.390> billions<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.870> these<00:02:12.019> on

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
so this there'd be billions of these on

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.620 
so this there'd be billions of these on
a<00:02:12.290> chip<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.800> what<00:02:13.430> does<00:02:13.580> 40<00:02:13.940> nanometers<00:02:14.120> if

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
a chip so what does 40 nanometers if

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.140 
a chip so what does 40 nanometers if
this<00:02:15.350> is<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.920> 14<00:02:16.310> nanometer<00:02:16.489> typically

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
this is the 14 nanometer typically

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.729 
this is the 14 nanometer typically
refers<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.810> critical<00:02:18.170> dimension<00:02:18.319> which

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
refers to the critical dimension which

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.559 
refers to the critical dimension which
is<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.100> which<00:02:19.220> is<00:02:19.400> roughly<00:02:19.640> roughly<00:02:20.239> this

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
is that which is roughly roughly this

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.900 
is that which is roughly roughly this
dimension<00:02:21.049> from<00:02:21.200> here<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.470> here<00:02:21.620> roughly<00:02:22.069> once

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
dimension from here to here roughly once

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.820 
dimension from here to here roughly once
you<00:02:23.000> get<00:02:23.150> into<00:02:23.390> these<00:02:23.510> generations<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:24.680> not

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
you get into these generations it's not

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.559 
you get into these generations it's not
precisely<00:02:25.280> 14<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.060> sort<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.299> in<00:02:26.450> the

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
precisely 14 it's sort of in the

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.479 
precisely 14 it's sort of in the
vicinity<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.230> you<00:02:27.290> have<00:02:27.410> 40<00:02:27.709> nanometer<00:02:28.160> here

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
vicinity so you have 40 nanometer here

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.550 
vicinity so you have 40 nanometer here
which<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.480> transistor<00:02:30.290> what<00:02:30.500> do

and ol data stuff what is that these are
different<00:02:35.239> this<00:02:35.840> is<00:02:36.019> the<00:02:36.140> gate<00:02:36.319> that<00:02:36.440> controls

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
different this is the gate that controls

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.590 
different this is the gate that controls
the<00:02:36.950> current<00:02:37.220> flow<00:02:37.400> these<00:02:38.000> are<00:02:38.180> different

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
the current flow these are different

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.900 
the current flow these are different
resists<00:02:39.200> or<00:02:39.260> fins<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.830> they're<00:02:39.980> called<00:02:40.220> so<00:02:40.790> in

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
resists or fins as they're called so in

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.849 
resists or fins as they're called so in
this<00:02:41.000> case<00:02:41.239> this<00:02:41.480> is<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.690> three<00:02:42.019> fin<00:02:42.230> transistor

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
this case this is a three fin transistor

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.530 
this case this is a three fin transistor
where<00:02:43.310> current<00:02:43.609> flows<00:02:43.820> in<00:02:44.030> these<00:02:44.209> three

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
where current flows in these three

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.860 
where current flows in these three
pounds<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.620> does<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:45.980> mean<00:02:46.160> 3d<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:47.480> 3d

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
pounds so does that mean 3d the 3d

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.390 
pounds so does that mean 3d the 3d
aspect<00:02:48.019> has<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:48.739> with<00:02:48.859> the<00:02:48.950> fact<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.250> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
aspect has to do with the fact that the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.160 
aspect has to do with the fact that the
fin<00:02:49.609> is<00:02:49.760> coming<00:02:50.090> out<00:02:50.299> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.570> body<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.019> see

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
fin is coming out of the body you see

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.680 
fin is coming out of the body you see
here<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:52.040> essentially<00:02:52.549> flat<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.359> so

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
here it's it's essentially flat and so

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.180 
here it's it's essentially flat and so
that's<00:02:53.870> why<00:02:54.049> they're<00:02:54.440> calling<00:02:54.650> these<00:02:54.859> 3d

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
that's why they're calling these 3d

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.800 
that's why they're calling these 3d
transistors<00:02:55.730> because<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.090> thing<00:02:56.299> comes<00:02:56.480> out

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
transistors because the thing comes out

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.900 
transistors because the thing comes out
of<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.109> body<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.650> is<00:02:58.100> controlled<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:58.640> three

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
of the body and is controlled on three

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.350 
of the body and is controlled on three
sides<00:02:59.090> that's<00:02:59.510> really

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
sides that's really

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.610 
sides that's really
and<00:03:01.190> for<00:03:02.190> sure<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.460> going<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.640> work<00:03:03.620> every
