00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:12.090
 Its not something else that I feel 20 4 date 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 Youth inde seconds 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.890
 I 've never been able to say that personality is endogenous . 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.320
 I have yet to see four correctly . 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.850
 Concept not properly got 09:00 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.939
 If you do it, 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.580
 Oh that's a little 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:35.420
 Personality is changing a little bit. 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:39.560
 Is it a turning point in your life 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.190
 It 's more like a monk. 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:47.690
 1000 times more prayer 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.470
 Also're many air because a lot of little good if you're just a little favor 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.680
 I will. 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.680
 4 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.200
 You've been to the world . 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.129
 Yes, 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.140
 Ah what 10 date of severe primary column 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.510
 I went to the sentence first. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:17.620
 The reason is very Danish 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:22.870
 So now when you still think magnetic properties now being in his thoughts godaeeo 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:27.820
 Because there is a tendency to fall into my mind rather than to understand the other side 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:31.510
 If this is easy to build day after day hapda 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.800
 So I anhangeo well this far yet become so conversation is not good 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.690
 Because of 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:42.280
 The opponents to do something a little too relaxed conversation designed 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:47.590
 So it may not be so popular with women. 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.650
 So first I realize that I have a fence 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.910
 This sort of Oh Yeah on 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:59.440
 It's spreading a little bit like this captivity for me. 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.840
 So the relationship with the person I'd say the van doing a little nervous to do so, 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.160
 I can talk comfortably. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.720
 It's a big deal. 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 If so, of the people who were naturally present 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.630
 Or you can meet a new person 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:24.330
 I can get some of the spirits of people who can talk continuously. 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:26.910
 Such self uteun some worked examples survive a lot of people, not the center 4 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.840
 This concept'll need during their huh 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.239
 Ah 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:37.910
 So if you start drinking first, 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.910
 Do you want me to lay off your foundation in two years?
