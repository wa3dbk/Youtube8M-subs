00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.610
 Now see my dear friend, I do an hour here 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.160
 well 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.160
 level the soil a little bit trim 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.230
 I installed the bricks 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.460
 around 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:54.070
 arrange everything at the level of all that was 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.070
 Well that did not yet palis's shorter 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.050
 and filled of course laying 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:10.460
 restore but so that they are under their 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:15.580
 weight made yourself a bed here even 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.009
 now and now the soil around them 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:23.150
 it settles well, I have a little bit of fossa 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:27.369
 more done because shovel trenches 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.430
 on it is a little wider than the eggpans 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.590
 see a flask 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.820
 begin well rather they begin 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:44.200
 continue to issue 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.200
 moisture to the soil now when it feeds on 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.100
 about hole soil in all of them 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 freeze a little 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:05.310
 and so now I'm like this 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.150
 sides of the west wall 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 Now I will cover this limestone right here. 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.450
 so that the bricks do not fall 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.740
 out but because when i am now 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:26.390
 straw put yourself you know they can 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:32.850
 out the mouth and so happy to cover 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:35.000
 limestone but also probably here i am not 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.000
 I will 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.400
 daughters class 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:46.200
 To tamp a bunch I'm probably straight 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:51.510
 put bricks for good 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 so even I have no doubt that I 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.100
 I will find and if I find him I will go there in the forest 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.640
 at the top of some logs so as not to 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:07.580
 boards there in size there it is wide and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.580
 I will take in length 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.700
 illness i think i will find bricks a 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.020
 my flasks work
