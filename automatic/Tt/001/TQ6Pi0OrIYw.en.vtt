00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
Stokes and Panesar and that's it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
Stokes and Panesar and that's it
Stokes<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> proper<00:02:05.700> that's<00:02:05.939> when<00:02:06.149> they<00:02:06.270> want

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
Stokes is a proper that's when they want

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
Stokes is a proper that's when they want
to<00:02:06.600> prop<00:02:06.780> six<00:02:07.200> proper<00:02:07.500> battle<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.950> cry<00:02:08.129> out<00:02:08.160> of

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
to prop six proper battle and cry out of

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
to prop six proper battle and cry out of
form<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.090> had<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> pick<00:02:09.450> another<00:02:09.569> batsman

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
form so they had to pick another batsman

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.770 
form so they had to pick another batsman
by<00:02:10.709> taking<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.340> Monty<00:02:11.610> Panesar<00:02:11.730> risk

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
by taking the Monty Panesar risk

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.210 
by taking the Monty Panesar risk
essentially<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.260> they<00:02:13.380> had<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.040> back

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
essentially what they had to do is back

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.830 
essentially what they had to do is back
themselves<00:02:14.459> up<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:14.940> another<00:02:15.180> singer<00:02:15.480> so

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
themselves up with another singer so

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.080 
themselves up with another singer so
while<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.500> may<00:02:16.650> not<00:02:16.680> make<00:02:17.010> 100%<00:02:17.459> sense<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
while it may not make 100% sense and

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.090 
while it may not make 100% sense and
make<00:02:18.270> sense<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.690> their<00:02:18.959> version<00:02:19.380> of<00:02:19.560> logic<00:02:19.980> at

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
make sense in their version of logic at

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.530 
make sense in their version of logic at
the<00:02:20.160> moment<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.580> think<00:02:20.880> it<00:02:20.940> does<00:02:21.090> make<00:02:21.240> sense<00:02:21.390> I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the moment I think it does make sense I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.690 
the moment I think it does make sense I
think<00:02:21.569> he's<00:02:21.810> he's<00:02:22.080> only<00:02:22.200> 22<00:02:22.530> he's<00:02:23.340> going<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.580> be

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
think he's he's only 22 he's going to be

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.949 
think he's he's only 22 he's going to be
a<00:02:23.730> really<00:02:23.910> good<00:02:24.090> cricketer<00:02:24.420> he's<00:02:24.600> also<00:02:24.750> quite

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
a really good cricketer he's also quite

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.990 
a really good cricketer he's also quite
quick<00:02:25.290> he<00:02:25.709> reverses<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.400> ball<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.819> think

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
quick he reverses the ball and I think

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.330 
quick he reverses the ball and I think
that<00:02:27.150> could<00:02:27.270> become<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:28.290> of<00:02:28.470> an<00:02:28.950> issue<00:02:29.100> in

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that could become more of an issue in

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.790 
that could become more of an issue in
this<00:02:29.459> test<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:29.970> goes<00:02:30.270> on<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.140> he<00:02:31.230> really

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
this test as it goes on and he really

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.440 
this test as it goes on and he really
can<00:02:32.040> bat<00:02:32.400> whether<00:02:32.700> he's<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:32.880> test<00:02:33.090> number<00:02:33.270> six

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
can bat whether he's a test number six

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.880 
can bat whether he's a test number six
right<00:02:33.630> now<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> don't<00:02:34.080> know<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.530> don't<00:02:34.830> think

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
right now I don't know I don't think

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.080 
right now I don't know I don't think
he's<00:02:35.069> actually<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.370> better<00:02:35.550> pass<00:02:35.700> when<00:02:35.970> Chris

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
he's actually a better pass when Chris

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.870 
he's actually a better pass when Chris
votes<00:02:36.270> right<00:02:36.600> now<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:37.860> think<00:02:37.920> his<00:02:38.310> scope<00:02:38.670> is

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
votes right now and I think his scope is

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.720 
votes right now and I think his scope is
enormous<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.450> think<00:02:39.600> he's<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.900> mean<00:02:40.590> he's<00:02:40.950> a
