00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
turns into a job and it's both or it's

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.490 
turns into a job and it's both or it's
neither<00:01:55.580> and<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:55.939> just<00:01:56.090> do<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.500> doesn't

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
neither and you just do it doesn't

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.810 
neither and you just do it doesn't
matter<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:58.130> really<00:01:58.490> doesn't<00:01:58.759> matter

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820

personally<00:01:59.720> I<00:01:59.930> wouldn't<00:02:00.380> want<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.159> for

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
personally I wouldn't want to do it for

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.840 
personally I wouldn't want to do it for
both<00:02:01.520> but<00:02:02.650> there<00:02:03.650> is<00:02:03.829> like<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:04.369> just<00:02:04.549> really

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
both but there is like it's just really

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.760 
both but there is like it's just really
annoys<00:02:05.180> me<00:02:05.420> because<00:02:05.450> you're<00:02:05.720> not<00:02:05.869> gonna<00:02:06.020> it's

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
prefer PewDiePie like just because I've

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.580 
prefer PewDiePie like just because I've
respected<00:03:14.030> more<00:03:14.330> because<00:03:14.570> Smosh<00:03:14.930> it's<00:03:15.410> not

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
respected more because Smosh it's not

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.540 
respected more because Smosh it's not
like<00:03:15.680> it's<00:03:15.860> not<00:03:16.130> an<00:03:16.250> admirable<00:03:16.700> thing<00:03:16.940> or<00:03:17.210> a

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
like it's not an admirable thing or a

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.790 
like it's not an admirable thing or a
bad<00:03:19.550> thing<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:20.030> have<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.300> team<00:03:20.510> but<00:03:21.110> it's<00:03:21.620> just

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
bad thing to have a team but it's just

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.470 
bad thing to have a team but it's just
the<00:03:21.860> effort<00:03:22.190> that<00:03:22.220> they<00:03:22.430> have<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.150> put<00:03:23.300> in<00:03:23.390> this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
the effort that they have to put in this

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.600 
the effort that they have to put in this
as<00:03:23.660> much<00:03:23.840> PewDiePie<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:25.070> really<00:03:25.400> do<00:03:25.490> think

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
as much PewDiePie and I really do think
