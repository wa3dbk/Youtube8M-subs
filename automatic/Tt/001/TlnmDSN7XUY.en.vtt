00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.370

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
 of course, and of course it goes on 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.039
 with the unboxing of the beyerdynamic mmx 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.359
 I've already got 300 there before 23 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.099
 years unboxing closed 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.539
 meanwhile the version has completely 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.510
 changed slightly and that's the same 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.620
 variant as manufactory edition 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.100
 maybe you have the video for it 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.630
 seen 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 I 've had that two weeks ago 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.860
 as presented as the headset 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 personally configure can be black 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.340
 is the standard variant but there are 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.930
 also different shades and colors 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.460
 if you like this video over the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.719
 configuration did not see 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.489
 you should be able to do that now 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.850
 be curious what I unpack now 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 become 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.120

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.770
 and multimedia headset made in germany 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.399
 already on the unboxing table 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.949
 landed 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.530
 the manufactory edition here from 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 beyerdynamic has a basic price of 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.210
 299 euro also normal depending on the 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 chosen equipment may vary 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.220
 for that you get loud beyerdynamic that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.530
 Ultimate Gaming Headset The New 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
 standards set in the detailed sound 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 and exceptionally powerful reproduction 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.530
 even in low frequency range 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.210
 offers and you can also completely 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.140
 nice to see 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.000
 Test reports are on top 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.560
 printed up to no longer works and 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.740
 the whole, for example, just on 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.110
 beginning of the year test victory at pc 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 games hardware in terms of gaming headsets 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.040
 but we want to do it now 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.590
 take a look in the carton 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.450
 and look what is here was the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.759
 nemec typical is the whole in such a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.680
 small backpack packed with it 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.810
 whole for example on your journey to 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.460
 Lahn is safely housed or not 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.939
 easy to stow away at home 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.189
 can 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.509
 He throws in a very small view 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.320
 or can you already see I have one 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.759
 very extravagant variation selected 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.000
 and I have this all in here 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.920
 Design white gold as I said 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.880
 there was a separate video that was 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.619
 can choose anything 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.149
 and there is the model stop for example 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.039
 also in plain black or with 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.450
 red applications and so on and so on 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.240
 on 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.650
 we do not need a manual 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.390
 I do it once I grab the cable 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.220
 from there you can see we have here 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.170
 also a wider connection for the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.790
 Hifi system that can be unscrewed 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.890
 so they are the normal three and a half 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.730
 millimeter jack for your pc 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.580
 have a total of five years warranty there 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.630
 beyerdynamic on the mmx 300 and that is 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.820
 of course , quite a hammer 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.890
 It was an absolute hammer, too 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.440
 when I unpacked the good piece 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.570
 and for the first time laser engraved 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.910
 Sirius lettering on the headset 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.560
 I did not discover it and did not grin 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.640
 I wanted to get more out of my face 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.500
 I 'll have it all that evening too 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.210
 posted on facebook and i believe so 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.870
 fast has in recent times has never been a 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.120
 photo likes collected yes that is mmx 300 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.520
 a completely closed headset that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.620
 means the earcups are complete 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.460
 circumaural and also the whole 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.780
 Sound insulating effect about 18 db a 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.150
 be from the outside noise 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.130
 withdrawn that means you will 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.370
 really complete only in the gaming 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.530
 sound sucked in so to speak 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.660
 additional feature of the mmx 300 is 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.800
 of course the absolutely brilliant and horny 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.300
 wearing comfort 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.130
 I miss that one at the one 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.860
 or another cheap headset then 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.990
 That if you have such a part in two hours 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.060
 or three times whole drew somehow evening 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.950
 on has that somehow then so 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.690
 an uncomfortable feeling of pressure on the 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.670
 head gets that one has here at this 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.740
 upholstery and also like the whole hanger 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.590
 constructed is not at all yes 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.270
 So I think that's with the 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.860
 softest and cuddly sst oppolzer 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.110
 how you can have it at all and it is 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.000
 as I said really extremely big 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.830
 so that even if you 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.860
 you should have a lot louder with it 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.450
 No problems the microphone gets something 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.340
 We now see in the picture that 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.660
 owns a swan than that means one 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.250
 it can swing that way up and down 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.410
 and turn down is contains but 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.120
 unfortunately no news function has for it 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.620
 but already such a pop up shop on top 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.840
 integrated and that is one too 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.310
 Feature of cheap headset 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.070
 quite often misses that 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.510
 Speech quality just right 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.220
 can properly convince that means with 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.050
 such a microphone came in the reason 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.239
 also make commentaries or 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.510
 just has a really good sound in the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.280
 teamspeak skype and so on I will 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.360
 you all the individual technical data 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.380
 again below in the video 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.030
 description of left 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.500
 but it was directly noticed that 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.480
 I look at the 600 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.400
 You have chosen janto then 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.020
 either the good hifi amplifier or 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.890
 we with me on the thick sound card 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.360
 can operate 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.730
 what just another one 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.730
 more natural and slightly better sound 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.100
 Picture generally leads to the sound though 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.450
 really absolutely to kneel down and me 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.590
 I always have many headsets 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.230
 tested and I have several before 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.390
 years the mmx 300 celebrated and it is 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.610
 Sound technically I still find it 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.590
 Absolutely the awesome is the hottest 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.510
 headset then you take so many details 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.610
 otherwise that was just like that in his 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.169
 Klangbrei go down so for the games 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.060
 the heights are such a small one 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.830
 a bit exaggerated I say now 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.910
 that you take steps and finesse too 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.220
 can perceive very well 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.870
 the bassist is pretty powerful you have one 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.419
 proper dynamics and such and it is 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.280
 you just play with it and I have to 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.960
 say you celebrate that yes you put it on 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.419
 you dive into the sound world 1 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.140
 and it really is like the hottest part 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:22.090
 the sound of what is simply on the market 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.070
 yes, of course, I also know that 300 euros 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.720
 A lot of money is really right for that 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.240
 he was a real premium 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.850
 Gaming Headset has been around for years 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.100
 in every test of his absolute tips 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.750
 Positioning repeatedly under proof 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.160
 and if you are such an out of the box 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.040
 So box product is really looking for 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.610
 headphones including microphone there he comes 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.380
 on the mmx 300 quasi not over so 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.810
 my dear gaming front that was it 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.320
 the headset presentation by beyerdynamic 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.510
 mmx 300 in the manufactory edition like 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.000
 said the part is also in discreet 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.680
 black or in other shade that 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.020
 please pay attention to it 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.790
 which order you pay at 600 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.680
 above he needs just as I said either 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.440
 a very good headphone amplifier 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.360
 or the corresponding soundcard the 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.370
 I get that kind of performance 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.410
 thought to finish we put the good 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.390
 again in the sirius edition 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.130
 so that he can look like that again 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.620
 Overall, looks and also for me 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.479
 when talking right now a whole 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.760
 Muted perception because of the headset 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.710
 is weird isolated you can 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.270
 megageil on the gaming sound 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.919
 that was definitely it 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.120
 for today if you liked it then 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.970
 Let me thumb up there 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.970
 until the next video and skin in 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.000
 yes and if you still have it for now 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.830
 should be interested in how to do this 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.720
 headset can then configure 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.390
 I 'll definitely see you here again 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.160
 the other headset where I link you 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.800
 show how to use the website and 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.600
 what possibilities there are 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.610
 on the other side you find one 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.530
 video to the asos soundcard i 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.390
 current user and if the yet 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.950
 should not have done long ago 

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.570
 it also under here subscribe 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.000
 button and then it was 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:05.860
 Now really for today with the headset 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.860
 Video from Bavaria agree
