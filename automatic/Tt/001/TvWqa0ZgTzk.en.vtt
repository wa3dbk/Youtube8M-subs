very<00:02:18.000> happy<00:02:18.270> because<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.810> scar<00:02:19.050> was<00:02:19.230> one<00:02:19.380> of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
very happy because the scar was one of

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.950 
very happy because the scar was one of
the<00:02:19.530> best<00:02:19.710> guns<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.130> modern<00:02:20.400> warfare<00:02:20.550> 3<00:02:20.900> one<00:02:21.900> of

father do you know the guns uh uh uh I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120 
father do you know the guns uh uh uh I
don't<00:02:27.780> think<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.320> any<00:02:28.470> complaints<00:02:28.800> from

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
don't think I have any complaints from

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.180 
don't think I have any complaints from
this<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.580> fear<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:31.140> gun<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.590> gonna<00:02:31.770> come<00:02:32.040> in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
this I fear that a gun is gonna come in

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.010 
this I fear that a gun is gonna come in
like<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.490> type<00:02:32.730> 25<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.480> that's<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.840> be

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
like the type 25 and that's going to be

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.440 
like the type 25 and that's going to be
very<00:02:34.190> overpowered<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:36.300> that's

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
very overpowered just because that's

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.630 
very overpowered just because that's
what<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.810> mostly<00:02:37.080> seen<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.650> trailers<00:02:38.460> and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.110 
stuff like that but um you know we'll
have<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.770> wait<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.040> see<00:02:41.220> but<00:02:41.640> other<00:02:41.850> than<00:02:42.030> that
