downfall to the heavy big
antek<00:02:13.319> hairpiece<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.180> this<00:02:16.040> huge

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
antek hairpiece and that is this huge

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.149 
antek hairpiece and that is this huge
seam<00:02:17.580> in<00:02:18.030> her<00:02:18.239> hair<00:02:18.739> normally<00:02:19.739> good<00:02:19.920> smells

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
seam in her hair normally good smells

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.490 
seam in her hair normally good smells
much<00:02:20.670> better<00:02:21.060> about<00:02:21.420> hiding<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.049> seam<00:02:22.319> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
much better about hiding the seam and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.869 
much better about hiding the seam and
the<00:02:22.560> hair<00:02:22.709> pieces<00:02:23.159> where<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.519> head<00:02:23.640> comes

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
the hair pieces where the head comes

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.780 
the hair pieces where the head comes
apart<00:02:24.209> but<00:02:24.930> she's<00:02:25.170> got<00:02:25.409> like<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.950> canyon<00:02:26.549> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
apart but she's got like a canyon of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.670 
apart but she's got like a canyon of
seam<00:02:27.090> going<00:02:27.360> on<00:02:27.599> there<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.379> not<00:02:28.530> very

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
seam going on there it's not very

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.069 
seam going on there it's not very
attractive<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.879> really<00:02:30.480> very<00:02:30.599> visible

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
attractive and it's really very visible

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.819 
attractive and it's really very visible
when<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.590> pose<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.549> figure<00:02:32.849> from<00:02:33.030> all<00:02:33.269> angles

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
when you pose the figure from all angles

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.220 
when you pose the figure from all angles
so<00:02:34.829> let's<00:02:35.010> take<00:02:35.220> her<00:02:35.310> apart<00:02:35.750> she<00:02:36.750> comes<00:02:36.959> apart

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
so let's take her apart she comes apart

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.839 
so let's take her apart she comes apart
really<00:02:37.379> easily<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.190> see<00:02:38.400> when<00:02:38.819> I

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
really easily as you can see when I

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.850 
really easily as you can see when I
pulled<00:02:39.090> on<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.299> front<00:02:39.540> there<00:02:39.750> she<00:02:40.590> popped

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
pulled on the front there she popped

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.280 
pulled on the front there she popped
right<00:02:41.159> out<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.459> back<00:02:41.610> piece<00:02:41.909> as<00:02:42.120> well<00:02:42.329> she

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
right out of the back piece as well she

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.530 
right out of the back piece as well she
really<00:02:43.409> shouldn't<00:02:43.680> slide<00:02:44.129> out<00:02:44.549> of<00:02:44.940> her<00:02:45.329> head

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
really shouldn't slide out of her head

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960 
really shouldn't slide out of her head
and<00:02:45.840> hair<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.920> easily<00:02:47.579> there<00:02:47.730> should<00:02:47.879> be<00:02:47.940> a

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
and hair that easily there should be a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.610 
and hair that easily there should be a
little<00:02:48.209> bit<00:02:48.359> more<00:02:48.510> tug<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.109> it<00:02:49.260> because

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
little bit more tug to it because

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.770 
little bit more tug to it because
otherwise<00:02:50.519> she<00:02:50.879> could<00:02:50.910> just<00:02:51.090> fall<00:02:51.269> apart<00:02:51.420> at

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
otherwise she could just fall apart at

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.710 
otherwise she could just fall apart at
any<00:02:51.870> inopportune<00:02:52.620> time<00:02:53.069> like<00:02:53.430> when<00:02:54.359> she<00:02:54.540> falls

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
any inopportune time like when she falls

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.289 
any inopportune time like when she falls
off<00:02:54.930> her<00:02:55.049> stand<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:56.250> that's<00:02:56.400> just<00:02:56.700> not<00:02:56.849> right

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
off her stand and that's just not right

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.050 
off her stand and that's just not right
so<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.290> can<00:02:58.440> see<00:02:58.620> this<00:02:58.739> gigantic<00:02:59.250> back<00:02:59.790> head
