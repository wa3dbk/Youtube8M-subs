00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hall youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.279
 new vt land video i was again 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 at a discounter around the corner in 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.040
 reste regal look and there I have with 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.049
 he found a break to drink the whole thing 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.710
 is also still with ebay are chocolate 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 drink on it and behind are 32 languages 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.220
 printed on it I have that in the form 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.170
 I never believe in Germany 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.460
 I did not say it was not 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.070
 intended for the german market 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.010
 Of course I will now 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 There is nothing to be expected and expected here 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.390
 Good of the way ebay chocolate bar is 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 I actually a fan but to drink 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.790
 I do not really like it yet 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 imagine 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 Somehow nothing stands behind 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.809
 Shake it before you drink it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.329
 I do it anyway and then 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.850
 Of course we have our calories 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 values ​​what's in there so art 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.899
 I'm pretty strong but I assume 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 we have a stand somewhere the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:01:00.120
 bottle has to figure 3 150 milliliters 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.589
 and I've been a converted 350 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 milliliters are 250 calories so before 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.030
 I can read myself with a drink I can 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.189
 me neat also directly two cans 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.560
 pull in red bull and have almost the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.890
 double the amount of liquid should that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.130
 Whole is in drink bottles design 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:24.930
 just held something to meetings 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.150
 something very small 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.180
 then to suck it out, I imagine 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.930
 Extreme does not want to say disgusting now 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.610
 but interesting before but first the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.590
 color test so it should now 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.210
 actually milky creamy come out 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.210
 or nothing comes out 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.810
 second try 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.509
 okay that works great again 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.030
 as I rehearsed then screw it 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.020
 what's ok here is the protective film 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.990
 in between 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.759
 So let's go all in first 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.170
 great if I have such a thing and that 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.700
 first so open and then I have here 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.400
 this part tried what i did 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:21.750
 would like to lie down so ideal for traveling 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.819
 but it looks cacau moderately yes 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.489
 So that would not now so 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.000
 chocolatically presented as form of as 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.300
 color it smells her like chocolate 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.099
 milk and not like in the cinema maybe 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.480
 so easy after the chocolate from 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.310
 milky way okay now but now 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.900
 but also the taste test as well as from 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.970
 manufacturer provided from the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.209
 Nuckelflasche when I have ever 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.209
 from the video to jerk and cheers 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.519
 Much better than I have thought 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.829
 at this point say number one cacau 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.610
 Also, sucking seems to drink part 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:15.390
 but to go well so also from the experience 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:16.470
 I'm okay now I'm okay 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.209
 just do not live from these 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.780
 suckling cocoa but suckling bottles 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:27.510
 the whole thing is going on in terms of taste 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.600
 okay even if you have to say it 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.600
 tastes less vienna with ebay than like 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.440
 a normal tetra pak on so with 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:44.130
 h milk and the whole stuff when I am 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.930
 The chocolate would have to be very easy to guess 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.319
 the show of taste of wikibay 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.280
 somewhere at the very back 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.280
 otherwise it could also be said here 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.859
 only in addition to cacau tetra cacau in it 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:59.849
 be filled which are then cools represents 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.730
 and before then shake it 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.260
 the stuff tastes just as well so the 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.870
 price I do not know here now 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.630
 more is now through now 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.030
 not made with the drinks 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.099
 Closure can play around with but 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.530
 I'll just say that 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.019
 on top of this branded product you can 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.349
 save yourself and also completely 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.699
 Let's continue in some discounter's 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.680
 buy standard cacau things 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.569

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.800
