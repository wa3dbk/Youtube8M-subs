chords<00:00:58.200> as<00:00:58.380> their<00:00:58.710> relative<00:00:59.340> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.480> guitar

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
chords as their relative to the guitar

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.740 
chords as their relative to the guitar
neck<00:01:01.110> so<00:01:01.350> for<00:01:01.560> instance<00:01:01.980> we're<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.280> be

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
neck so for instance we're going to be

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.290 
neck so for instance we're going to be
here<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.920> not<00:01:05.070> technically<00:01:05.520> an<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.910> chord

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.300 
here this is not technically an a chord

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.390 
here this is not technically an a chord
because<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.200> dropped<00:01:07.500> down<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.280> we're

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because it's dropped down but we're

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
because it's dropped down but we're
going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> call<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.119> beat<00:01:09.450> because<00:01:10.050> that's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
going to call it a beat because that's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.100 
going to call it a beat because that's
the<00:01:10.530> shape<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.800> we're<00:01:11.100> doing<00:01:11.190> or<00:01:11.460> here<00:01:12.110> this

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the shape that we're doing or here this

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
the shape that we're doing or here this
is<00:01:13.320> our<00:01:13.440> deep

just<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.370> can<00:02:16.580> get<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> feel<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.240> without

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
just so you can get a feel of it without

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:33.110 
just so you can get a feel of it without
me<00:02:18.340> yappin<00:02:19.340> away<00:02:19.760> okay<00:02:20.540> here<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.020> go

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.760 

so<00:02:34.120> that's<00:02:34.330> how<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.540> play<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.810> more<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:35.440> time

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
so that's how you play it more in time

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.940 
so that's how you play it more in time
than<00:02:36.490> when<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.510> taught<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.840> slow<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.770> not

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
than when we just taught it slow so not

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.570 
than when we just taught it slow so not
so<00:02:39.130> bad

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
so bad

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.430 
so bad
not<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:39.970> bad<00:02:40.120> at<00:02:40.270> all<00:02:40.330> I<00:02:40.390> know<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.750> guys<00:02:41.050> can<00:02:41.290> do

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
not so bad at all I know you guys can do

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.590 
not so bad at all I know you guys can do
this<00:02:41.560> now<00:02:41.890> let's<00:02:42.460> go<00:02:42.640> into<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.000> pre-chorus

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
this now let's go into the pre-chorus

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.840 
this now let's go into the pre-chorus
we're<00:02:43.900> going<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.080> do<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.500> like<00:02:44.590> an<00:02:44.860> F<00:02:45.160> sus<00:02:45.610> and

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
we're going to do it's like an F sus and

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.070 
we're going to do it's like an F sus and
there's<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.090> couple<00:02:46.300> different<00:02:46.660> ways<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:46.810> we

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
there's a couple different ways that we

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.880 
there's a couple different ways that we
can<00:02:47.230> do<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.620> or<00:02:48.010> I'm<00:02:48.460> sorry<00:02:48.610> f-sharp<00:02:49.890> so

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
can do this or I'm sorry f-sharp so

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.870 
can do this or I'm sorry f-sharp so
you're<00:02:51.100> here<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:52.570> need<00:02:52.750> these<00:02:52.960> two<00:02:53.290> notes

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
you're here and we need these two notes

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.490 
you're here and we need these two notes
so<00:02:54.880> you're<00:02:55.060> holding<00:02:55.270> like<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.570> 5<00:02:55.930> chord<00:02:56.320> but

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
so you're holding like a 5 chord but

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.080 
so you're holding like a 5 chord but
then<00:02:56.620> hitting<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.010> E<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:58.480> B<00:03:00.030> now<00:03:01.030> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
then hitting the E and the B now the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.390 
then hitting the E and the B now the
thing<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.690> we<00:03:02.050> don't<00:03:02.080> want<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.560> hit<00:03:02.740> this<00:03:02.950> G

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
thing is we don't want to hit this G

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.970 
thing is we don't want to hit this G
because<00:03:04.240> it<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.720> nasty<00:03:05.050> note<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.800> chord

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
because it is a nasty note in the chord

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.440 
because it is a nasty note in the chord
so<00:03:06.250> there's<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.460> couple<00:03:06.640> things<00:03:06.820> we<00:03:07.000> can<00:03:07.150> do<00:03:07.330> to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
so there's a couple things we can do to

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.360 
so there's a couple things we can do to
avoid<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.900> we<00:03:08.380> can<00:03:08.590> mute<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:10.770> not<00:03:11.770> all<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.220> it

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
avoid that we can mute it not all of it

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.120 
avoid that we can mute it not all of it
but<00:03:12.850> just<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.270> G<00:03:13.540> or<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:14.320> can<00:03:14.500> do<00:03:14.680> like<00:03:14.920> an

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
but just the G or we can do like an

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.839 
but just the G or we can do like an
f-sharp<00:03:15.870> sus<00:03:16.870> for<00:03:17.260> shape

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.380 

that<00:03:20.120> helps<00:03:20.569> or<00:03:20.749> mute<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.219> fourth<00:03:22.640> string<00:03:23.060> and

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
that helps or mute the fourth string and

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.199 
that helps or mute the fourth string and
that<00:03:23.989> then<00:03:24.499> you<00:03:24.650> can<00:03:24.829> that<00:03:25.370> gets<00:03:25.579> rid<00:03:25.760> of<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:25.999> G

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
that then you can that gets rid of the G

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:27.910 
that then you can that gets rid of the G
right<00:03:26.450> there

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
right there

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.450 
right there
either<00:03:28.370> way<00:03:29.410> anyway<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.590> fine<00:03:30.830> so<00:03:31.040> we<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.280> that

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
either way anyway is fine so we do that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.900 
either way anyway is fine so we do that
F<00:03:31.640> sharp<00:03:32.060> 7<00:03:32.330> times<00:03:32.720> our<00:03:32.870> F<00:03:33.050> sharp<00:03:33.430> minor<00:03:34.430> sus4

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
F sharp 7 times our F sharp minor sus4

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.250 
F sharp 7 times our F sharp minor sus4
and<00:03:35.750> share<00:03:36.110> obsess<00:03:36.410> for<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:37.010> -<00:03:37.400> s<00:03:37.550> 4<00:03:37.760> -<00:03:37.970> a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
and share obsess for that - s 4 - a

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.710 
and share obsess for that - s 4 - a
and<00:03:40.410> then<00:03:41.069> repeat<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:44.610> can<00:03:44.730> play<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.239> any

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
and then repeat that you can play a any

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.130 
and then repeat that you can play a any
way<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.230> feel<00:03:46.500> like<00:03:46.590> it<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:48.480> that's

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
way that you feel like it and that's

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.140 
way that you feel like it and that's
your<00:03:49.319> free<00:03:49.530> course<00:03:49.800> when<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.069> say<00:03:50.280> memory

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
your free course when you say memory

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.110 
your free course when you say memory
memory<00:03:51.450> memory<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.290> then<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.250> don't<00:03:53.819> have

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
memory memory and then the I don't have

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.630 
memory memory and then the I don't have
a<00:03:54.150> gun<00:03:54.450> part<00:03:54.840> we're<00:03:54.989> going<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.140> do<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.379> B<00:03:55.920> I<00:03:56.220> think

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
a gun part we're going to do a B I think

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.790 
a gun part we're going to do a B I think
he<00:03:56.910> doesn't<00:03:57.209> fool<00:03:57.390> me<00:03:57.599> actually<00:03:58.140> I<00:03:58.500> was<00:03:58.680> going

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
he doesn't fool me actually I was going

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.100 
he doesn't fool me actually I was going
to<00:03:58.860> say<00:03:59.010> b5<00:03:59.550> which<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.390> not<00:04:00.540> bad<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.050> think

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
to say b5 which is not bad but I think

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.229 
to say b5 which is not bad but I think
you<00:04:01.319> can<00:04:01.470> do<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> full<00:04:01.890> beam<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:03.420> then<00:04:04.230> d5<00:04:05.239> open

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
you can do a full beam and then d5 open

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.860 
you can do a full beam and then d5 open
position

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:18.790 

t5

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.400 

now<00:04:19.800> the<00:04:19.860> only<00:04:20.160> other<00:04:20.730> part<00:04:21.270> is<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:22.170> solo

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
now the only other part is the solo

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.950 
now the only other part is the solo
which<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:22.950> relatively<00:04:23.460> easy<00:04:23.850> so<00:04:24.240> it's<00:04:24.660> it's

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
which is relatively easy so it's it's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.690 
which is relatively easy so it's it's
really<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.320> lick<00:04:25.620> upfront<00:04:26.010> that<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:26.430> think<00:04:26.610> is

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
really the lick upfront that I think is

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.070 
really the lick upfront that I think is
going<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.880> take<00:04:27.090> you<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.300> most<00:04:27.480> time<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:27.810> then

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
going to take you the most time and then

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.020 
going to take you the most time and then
the<00:04:28.170> Barre<00:04:28.350> chord<00:04:28.680> if<00:04:29.400> you're<00:04:29.640> not<00:04:29.820> familiar

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
the Barre chord if you're not familiar

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.540 
the Barre chord if you're not familiar
with<00:04:30.390> how<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.960> play<00:04:31.170> Barre<00:04:31.380> chords<00:04:31.680> but<00:04:31.890> now

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
with how to play Barre chords but now

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.960 
with how to play Barre chords but now
let's<00:04:33.000> go<00:04:33.240> into<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.870> solo<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.520> solo<00:04:35.760> is

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
let's go into the solo so the solo is

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
let's go into the solo so the solo is
going<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.150> start<00:04:36.540> on<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.320> 3rd<00:04:37.770> string<00:04:37.950> 6<00:04:38.700> fret

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990
