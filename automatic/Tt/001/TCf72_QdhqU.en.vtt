 Even in Cologne on the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.370
 gamescom and that's why it was heard 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.370
 Besides

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.940
 Among others , smash brothers played 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.739
 the world we have a lot to play 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.540
 in the hour then look at us that time 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.760
 to the ladies and gentlemen of 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.920
 nintendo have just eaten us and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.380
 drinks are served 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.380
 stay for it and catch it now 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.909
 the knife is one of the classic 4 60 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.909
 meter passed 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.620
 the browser is only while you are 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.760
 Here a delicious kneading told 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.290
 ingo times what we do now 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.820
 So, as we said, we have a lot 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.260
 great line up have more fun 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.250
 we just played the same we go 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.600
 still over to do 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.580
 and otherwise we would still very much 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 worthy of yoshi's the world a two 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.030
 player multiplayer in one 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.190
 wonderful optics which we on each 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.940
 case should try now 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.140
 excuses then we go right in 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.720
 medias res I hope we do not have to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.850
 go far because I'm very lazy though 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.890
 Here we go, I think controls 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.500
 with the left thumb a red one 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.210
 mosque and a colleague is the green one 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.560
 joschi and you are a team you can 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.330
 you eat each other but that 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.180
 only if it is really necessary 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.000
 instead of eggs, you have balls of wool this time 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.340
 the duck drag you and you have to 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.320
 safe or have you this level 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.410
 get through from a to b there is no 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.120
 time limit that the beautiful and how in 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.660
 yoshi's island you can also balls 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.950
 shoot 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:50.300
 they are now running through the connect 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:52.489
 could fly through the area 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.650
 always nice especially when crocheted 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.450
 are crazy capped what I am 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.090
 By the way, also extremely cool is that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.730
 you can walk on clouds you can 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.150
 beforehand shoot yourself like that and you are 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.830
 you will suddenly become a huge 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.020
 Loving wool balls want the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.690
 wrapping whole world in wool so 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.769
 she suffocates like that and sina said i want 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.880
 that he likes to play two you can 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.320
 I go on paper 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.420
 well, that's all the work for us 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.870
 while you are doing great here I just do it 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.870
 on the next 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:38.360
 porsche for had taken 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:41.800
 suggest water my love we 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.800
 play bayonetta 2 now 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.650
 I 've been with all this before 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.970
 Frodo played the first part and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:56.300
 it turned out pretty much so 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.490
 how can you describe that shit and 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.590
 Now let's see how the second part 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.180
 so I will be allowed to say that because I have 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.130
 I gave the first part a chance 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.960
 I'm quite unaware of it did not know 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.780
 what it is about and have it from the beginning 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.940
 watched and just have 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.630
 meanwhile, here are drifting in 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:21.140
 taba and that's why we look 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.300
 that was probably a critic they looked like that 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.880
 just a bloody death one 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.920
 In the fabulous, mind you, there is 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.670
 first part of a scene just like that 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.610
 looks 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.890
 why is that just the same? 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.660
 a bit darker gloomier gives everything 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.670
 it in the first part also where you but 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.680
 say the cool thing about bayonetta is 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.120
 See these huge ones anyway now 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.220
 this huge monster goes the man 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.690
 Okay we have to fight now 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.780
 changed location and now have 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.790
 Immediately the chance to play platoon 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.160
 we call it a very creative shooter 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.070
 because it's not really about it 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.780
 your teammates or your opponents 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.680
 but you have the cannon 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.060
 and with that you cover the playing surface of the 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.920
 playing field and the more you have covered 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.130
 the better because you win with it 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.660
 The End 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.430
 you can dive through these colors and 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.010
 something is different wait 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.970
 multicolored that looks super funny 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.950
 what we see now, I am once 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.910
 curious how she plays so I have to first 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.050
 make even a workout I have with the 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.150
 control I have to cope 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.930
 apparently with the controller quasi 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.160
 control view 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.390
 I can target things two 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.040
 Games balance I have to burst 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.750
 I can bring from here as well 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.580
 by the way , I already have the 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.350
 insider tip the walls do not just count 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.540
 the floor 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.820
 yes, I have also noticed exactly one 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.920
 to trade a bit because the control 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.890
 a controller is actually still a 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.210
 a little bit strange , that's how the mind works 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.350
 I have a card down in it is even 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.730
 not seen what I have again 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:51.450
 press because then was to player 54 too 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:53.520
 that's what it's all about 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.000
 This is a work I tell you 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.560
 the eyes of many critics say we are 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.870
 very very very very proud it is 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:05.580
 really a great feeling so ours 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:08.300
 conclusion to the nintendo book is a 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:12.350
 good jacobs in the middle of the picture thank you 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:15.330
 have tested many cool things 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.610
 So you can definitely be 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.690
 We look forward to, for example, yoshi's 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.070
 what was it called world believe i would have 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.790
 now also can derive me because 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.110
 everything from the front, that's for sure 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:28.820
 really fun at the same time 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.960
 look on 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.860
 We are still walking in this direction 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.470
 times for the optics otherwise was blazing 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.630
 it will be one for thun age platoon 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.560
 To be a huge racecourse and of course that 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.380
 new super smash bros 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.540
 for fans of the series that has the over 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:48.800
 Protector So we like this game 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.800
 will also like the new part 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:06.740
 I'm from focus online so of the 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:08.990
 interviewed Christian is supposed to bring 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.430
 what has the text caliber actually text 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.710
 calibra reports on the latest 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.059
 Game trends and even movies have news 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.939
 So we actually completely net 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:18.349
 Everything that I see offers 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:19.490
 But you do not care about that now 

00:07:18.349 --> 00:07:20.240
 I once heard the network differently 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.020
 should look like 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.039
 oh so yes so more and that is 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.039
 decay then listen here 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:38.229
 Ok, so it's all Hello section once 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:44.080
 the interview can or who you are 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:44.080
 I come from planet made from text 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.259
 we make news news possible 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:01.240
 that is often I think that is 

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:01.240
 comes professionally
