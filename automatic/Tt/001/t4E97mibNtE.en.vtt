00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
year and it's big we believe that

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.610 
year and it's big we believe that
presidents<00:05:33.120> around<00:05:33.390> 3,000<00:05:34.110> greyhounds<00:05:34.560> a

year that are euthanized we understand
that<00:05:37.530> number<00:05:37.950> is<00:05:38.220> a<00:05:38.729> number<00:05:38.940> which<00:05:39.150> is<00:05:39.360> too

that number is a number which is too

that number is a number which is too
high<00:05:39.840> and<00:05:40.590> we've<00:05:40.740> said<00:05:40.950> about<00:05:41.130> putting<00:05:41.460> in

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
high and we've said about putting in

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.219 
high and we've said about putting in
place<00:05:41.759> a<00:05:41.789> number<00:05:42.389> of<00:05:42.479> actions<00:05:42.780> which<00:05:43.020> will

place a number of actions which will

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.230 
place a number of actions which will
