00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.069
 will not be massive and we could do 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.970
 the same not to borrow cute but if 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.830
 we do something like that by talking 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.330
 policy could end up in sg or when 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.320
 the cut will do less hands already 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.910
 we have to manage a small newspaper 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.900
 but hey the Europeans often 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.189
 a few days maybe we get motivated 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.109
 hello to all you said when I 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.369
 really go to a shitty world there 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.210
 85 people around the world so far 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.050
 of money than three and a half billion 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.960
 Do you find that normal 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.340
 well yeah rise individualism is 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 everywhere pushes us to become calves 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.980
 who is interested in nothing after our little ones 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.739
 life and not just at the next winner 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 of this flight but serious must we 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.840
 know for example you know what 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.050
 this is the first expense item of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.149
 the state 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.469
 all those unemployed who do not care 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.110
 salary of those rotten who we 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.120
 govern we are more the way 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.860
 it's just a payment of interest from 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.210
 debt by debt no I have some 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.500
 interests but it's a lot of 50 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.850
 billion euros a year and guess 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.030
 how we got there the bottom 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.329
 poor the government the blacks the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 men 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.699
 the sh'ti she seemed to sleep the 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.070
 gay night sun however he dresses 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.030
 they waltzed the sphere actually coast 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.140
 after the second world war the 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.040
 European countries have created full leverage 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.270
 to help rebuild 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.680
 except that suddenly it makes the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.820
 value of the currency for Texans getting 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.990
 reproduce it was decided that the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.310
 government had to borrow from 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 private banks like everyone with 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.799
 interests this is the other 73 that has 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.460
 been adopted by all the treaties 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.110
 Europeans since 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.159
 result France especially with 1900 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.030
 billion euros of debt and 50 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.430
 billion euros of interest every 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.689
 years but we could do otherwise 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.490
 the principle is simple one borrows from 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.810
 zero rate to buy one is at 3% so 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.810
 we would still have so much debt but 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.650
 without the interests but for that it is necessary 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.060
 someone close to the billions and 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.740
 billion euros at zero interest and its share 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.970
 the central bank nobody will do it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.290
 call it debt monetization 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.850
 and that is precisely what is forbidden 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.509
 by law 73 should speak my 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.530
 first condition that the second 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.500
 condition is that our leaders 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.310
 include a minimum what they do 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 for example we can not buy 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.470
 all of a sudden that makes 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.030
 far too many euros in circulation 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.590
 to avoid this problem 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.820
 it is estimated that arafat 200 billion 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.290
 euros a year could do the job 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 then yes it will take any time 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.810
 buy back but at least we would not have a 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.100
 inflation that burst the ceiling away to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.540
 term anyway the idea is to 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.920
 recover the 50 billion euros per 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.090
 year that our dear politicians have 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.469
 slipped into the pocket of the world of 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.520
 finance but some the honesty of 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.170
 say that the finance at the origin of all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.369
 our ills the poll for example this is 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.810
 not the fault of the bankers it's just 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.190
 that we are not competitive enough and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.080
 why not what the euro is too expensive 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.850
 in reality we are in a society 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.930
 it is said that more is better is you will 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.280
 more gruff the stronger the more 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.360
 performing well when we are told that we 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.280
 is to bring the world's strongest 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.980
 we tend to think that we 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.150
 is the world's strongest reality 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.800
 it's me that the enemy forces and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.120
 dear and saturday two very simple things 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.280
 what we bring and my dear and his 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 escort is more expensive the one in tribute 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.730
 fishermen have good price except that 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.140
 the occurrence we sell more so when 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.520
 the inpe bulbs and when the 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.530
 multinationals relocate 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.790
 the result a hate it creates unemployment 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.930
 yet the Germans the slippers 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.460
 veauche my office buddy 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.450
 yeah but the Germans it's been 15 years 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.650
 that they tighten the belt he authorizes 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.940
 salaries at 400 euros 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.720
 in addition he has a population that lives so 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.950
 there was time to find money 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.450
 and as a strong currency 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.550
 it would make scenarios is perfect 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.470
 for them finally it's not the same thing 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.490
 we have lots of young people and pennon ringer I 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.840
 you did not speak greece and spain 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.860
 besides all the nobel prizes 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.030
 of economy agree that 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.590
 the euro is too expensive for the euro zone 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.640
 No, it's a solution that only helps 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.650
 Atomic Germans 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.300
 if we go out of the euro the more the sound gets 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.590
 wants to explode no but that's a 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.600
 urban legend the price of oil is 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.709
 35% of the bugle, therefore, not the price 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.880
 would not expose it and we could 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.240
 make up for it easily with the drops 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.670
 of taxes 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.620
 we could recover 50 billion and 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.050
 stop offshoring his flop I 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.220
 could the price but yes it's easy it 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.200
 just convince all countries of the 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.190
 euro area to change the treaties 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.450
 convince Germany to devalue then 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.410
 that it's against his interests and 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.519
 to convince the banks that 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.340
 to make a cross on 50 billion 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.769
 euros per year and otherwise we change 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.370
 currency not have to be hot the one concept that 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.760
 is very popular among 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.069
 Eurosceptics or Europhobes 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.879
 it's the one of common currencies and not 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.170
 single currency 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.310
 the idea is to keep the euro for 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.659
 facilitate exchanges between countries 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.950
 but in addition to that to each member country 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.780
 and his own currency that would be defined 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.650
 according to euros for example for 1 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.959
 euro equals 1 dollar 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.760
 it would be a Euro native of Martigues in the e40 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.470
 also offering a euro and it goes up 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.610
 is equal to 70 euro cents each 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.079
 country could well have its own 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.190
 currency while keeping the profits 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.440
 shared management by many 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.879
 country it's a little fn light your thing on 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.220
 will manage to pass anyway 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.329
 he says he does not see the relation to the sure 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.590
 always so much money flow when we 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.439
 know at this talk one wants to succeed in 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.060
 2002 in the name I was 10 years old we are not 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.950
 far right so better 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.549
 I give you back to baseball and we 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.230
 europe ti amo meet you that's why 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.970
 May 21st, do not abstain 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.220
 have the courage to vote for a list 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.139
 neither system nor extreme voted for standing 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.280
 France is together we will build 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.280
 finally a new europe 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.940
 all the Nobel Prize for Economics 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.039
 agree that the euro is this 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.039
 that the euro is too expensive for the area
