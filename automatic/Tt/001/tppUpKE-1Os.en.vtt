from the side with the Rambler it comes
up<00:00:23.460> from<00:00:23.610> the<00:00:23.699> very<00:00:23.970> back<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.930> allows<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
up from the very back this allows you to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.590 
up from the very back this allows you to
thread<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.020> in<00:00:28.789> where<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.940> the<00:00:30.390> lid

thread this one in where the the lid

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.279 
thread this one in where the the lid
will<00:00:30.930> never<00:00:31.250> slide<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.910> over<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.050> bag

will never slide up and over the bag
where<00:00:34.739> right<00:00:35.489> now<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.729> way<00:00:35.999> I<00:00:36.030> tighten<00:00:36.569> mine

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
where right now the way I tighten mine

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.090 
where right now the way I tighten mine
is<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.050> kind<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.350> tighten<00:00:37.649> over<00:00:37.679> the<00:00:37.890> back<00:00:38.069> of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
is I kind of tighten over the back of

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.250 
is I kind of tighten over the back of
the<00:00:38.309> frame<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.940> can't<00:00:39.179> slide<00:00:39.479> down<00:00:39.510> but

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
the frame so it can't slide down but

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.340 
the frame so it can't slide down but
it'll<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.309> time<00:00:41.609> it<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.149> slide<00:00:42.539> down<00:00:42.809> this

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
it'll over time it can slide down this

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.939 
it'll over time it can slide down this
way<00:00:43.760> with<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.170> once<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.319> have<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.710> tight

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
way with this once you have it tight

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.669 
way with this once you have it tight
it's<00:00:47.819> static<00:00:48.359> it's<00:00:48.629> right<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.289> doesn't

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
it's static it's right there it doesn't

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.009 
it's static it's right there it doesn't
allow<00:00:49.859> it<00:00:50.069> to<00:00:50.249> slide<00:00:50.609> or<00:00:50.760> rotate<00:00:51.120> over<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.019 
allow it to slide or rotate over the

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.569 
allow it to slide or rotate over the
cool<00:00:52.289> thing<00:00:52.499> about<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.159> what<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.370> worked

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
cool thing about this and what we worked

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.219 
cool thing about this and what we worked
on<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> while<00:00:54.269> is<00:00:54.569> most<00:00:56.600> packs<00:00:57.600> we've<00:00:57.899> seen

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
compression straps here I'll go into it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.670 
compression straps here I'll go into it
later<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.910> be<00:01:15.060> ran<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:16.260> know<00:01:16.290> back

later can actually be ran you know back
to<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.100> frame

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
away from the frame this compression

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
away from the frame this compression
strap<00:01:25.980> here<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.150> run<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.510> through<00:01:27.780> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
strap here you run it through this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.480 
strap here you run it through this
common<00:01:28.440> loop<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.590> back<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> lid<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.460> that

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
common loop and back to the lid so that

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.430 
common loop and back to the lid so that
will<00:01:32.760> double<00:01:32.940> up<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.450> basically<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.260> hold

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
will double up as a basically to hold

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.230 
will double up as a basically to hold
your<00:01:34.620> lid<00:01:34.800> up<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.160> your<00:01:35.340> compression<00:01:35.910> strap

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
your lid up and your compression strap

your lid up and your compression strap
one<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> things<00:01:37.620> like<00:01:37.830> I<00:01:38.010> said<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.850> we

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
one of the things like I said that we

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.310 
one of the things like I said that we
kind<00:01:39.480> of<00:01:39.510> figured<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.900> right<00:01:40.050> at<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> very

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
kind of figured out right at the very

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
kind of figured out right at the very
end<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.890> will<00:01:41.100> also<00:01:41.520> have<00:01:41.760> a<00:01:41.790> ladder<00:01:42.060> lock

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
end this will also have a ladder lock

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.050 
end this will also have a ladder lock
sewn<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.990> you're<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.890> running<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> lid<00:01:44.490> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
sewn on you're not running the lid you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.730 
sewn on you're not running the lid you
can<00:01:45.240> run<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.630> piece<00:01:45.900> of<00:01:46.080> webbing<00:01:46.230> through

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
can run this piece of webbing through

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.560 
can run this piece of webbing through
the<00:01:46.860> common<00:01:47.280> loop<00:01:47.460> there'll<00:01:48.150> be<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.300> ladder

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the common loop there'll be a ladder

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.290 
the common loop there'll be a ladder
lock<00:01:48.870> sewn<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.650> here<00:01:49.980> that's<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.970> your

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
lock sewn in right here that's also your

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.990 
lock sewn in right here that's also your
upper<00:01:51.659> compression<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.650> you<00:01:53.640> don't<00:01:53.820> need<00:01:53.940> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
upper compression and you don't need to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000 
upper compression and you don't need to
do<00:01:54.150> anything<00:01:54.720> with<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.110> frame<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.680> make<00:01:55.860> this

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
do anything with the frame to make this

if you weren't running the lid you can

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.270 
if you weren't running the lid you can
take<00:03:11.720> this<00:03:11.930> webbing<00:03:12.440> that's<00:03:12.800> hooked<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.160> the

lid now and it'll actually come with
tensioning<00:03:16.459> female<00:03:16.850> buckles<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.750> those<00:03:18.110> will

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
tensioning female buckles and those will

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.289 
tensioning female buckles and those will
just<00:03:18.320> hook<00:03:19.010> back<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.430> itself<00:03:19.850> if<00:03:20.030> you're<00:03:20.180> not

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
just hook back to itself if you're not

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.590 
just hook back to itself if you're not
running<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.660> lid<00:03:21.100> next<00:03:22.100> thing<00:03:22.420> give<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.510> an

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.400 
running the lid next thing give you an
idea<00:03:23.750> size-wise<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:26.780> is<00:03:26.989> one<00:03:27.170> of<00:03:27.260> our

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
idea size-wise this is one of our

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.390 
idea size-wise this is one of our
standard<00:03:28.209> medium<00:03:29.209> side<00:03:29.720> pockets<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.620> that

started<00:04:00.320> off<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.530> base<00:04:00.709> idea<00:04:01.070> was<00:04:01.220> up<00:04:01.340> up

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
started off the base idea was up up

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.720 
started off the base idea was up up
making<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:02.060> dt3<00:04:02.540> more<00:04:03.080> functional<00:04:03.730> she

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
making a dt3 more functional she

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.660 
making a dt3 more functional she
extended<00:04:05.390> this<00:04:05.570> panel<00:04:06.170> and<00:04:06.380> was<00:04:07.250> able<00:04:07.640> to

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
extended this panel and was able to

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.800 
extended this panel and was able to
allow<00:04:08.269> for<00:04:08.989> two<00:04:09.280> this<00:04:10.280> is<00:04:10.340> a<00:04:10.700> large<00:04:11.120> belt<00:04:11.600> pouch

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
allow for two this is a large belt pouch

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.390 
allow for two this is a large belt pouch
you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.680> run<00:04:14.110> two<00:04:15.110> larges<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.890> they<00:04:16.220> don't

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
you can run two larges and they don't

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.800 
you can run two larges and they don't
actually<00:04:16.549> get<00:04:16.940> in<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.150> way<00:04:17.269> of<00:04:17.299> each<00:04:17.570> other

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
actually get in the way of each other

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.560 
actually get in the way of each other
now<00:04:18.049> so<00:04:18.440> before<00:04:18.919> if<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.970> were<00:04:20.090> running<00:04:20.269> two

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
now so before if you were running two

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.990 
now so before if you were running two
larges<00:04:21.019> on<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.229> side<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.500> a<00:04:21.919> mountain<00:04:22.460> warrior

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
larges on the side of a mountain warrior

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.040 
larges on the side of a mountain warrior
or<00:04:23.270> something<00:04:23.720> else

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
or something else

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.020 
or something else
these<00:04:24.710> would<00:04:24.950> kind<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.220> be<00:04:25.370> jumbled<00:04:25.970> up

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
these would kind of be jumbled up

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.920 
these would kind of be jumbled up
together

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
together

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.200 
together
now<00:04:27.139> you've<00:04:27.740> got<00:04:27.949> plenty<00:04:28.160> of<00:04:28.310> room<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:29.030> get<00:04:29.150> to

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
now you've got plenty of room to get to

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.360 
now you've got plenty of room to get to
both<00:04:29.630> when<00:04:30.139> you<00:04:30.229> hook<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.560> up<00:04:30.710> since<00:04:31.009> there<00:04:31.220> is

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
both when you hook it up since there is

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.110 
both when you hook it up since there is
