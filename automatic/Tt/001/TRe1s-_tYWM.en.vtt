 hello welcome to the padlock 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.000
 in this video they will bring this 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.250
 how to activate and deactivate the status of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.779
 wintering for those who do not know the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.960
 wintering inference state is that 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.390
 it can be your computer 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.150
 It has not been as they have it with a 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.150
 program and that has open windows 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.630
 work in some windows 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 what it does is that it 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.110
 it's like it's totally turned off 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:50.140
 computer and then it will stay in 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:52.600
 been like this without losing anything nothing more already 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.870
 you can learn it and there it is all as 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.840
 wear is how it is more than anything 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.080
 state of suspend let's suspend 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.110
 and if you when I have so much memory 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.190
 because you're like suspended and you see 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.190
 that has a little 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.950
 blinking if it consumes ram memory 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.230
 and also the battery when you have 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.010
 about so much but it's like it's going 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.810
 tired too but in winter not in 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.510
 the winter is for totally but 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.120
 that keeps all everything was very 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.930
 rne 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.840
 was a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.890
 the active jobs you have open 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.290
 77 they keep until they learn the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.710
 computer 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.600
 put it back as it was and then I 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.240
 I would say it's better to not have 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.900
 what to turn off if you have a jet of conso 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.780
 open and you say you have to open 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.610
 everything not then nothing else exists is a 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.750
 winter and ready 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:02:00.440

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.890
 deactivate it good what we're going to do 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.060
 is 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.950
 search for a start of md 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.100
