00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
won't answer that but there is an easy

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.799 
won't answer that but there is an easy
trick<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.690> solve<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.950> you<00:00:46.950> take<00:00:47.190> your<00:00:47.809> 53

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
trick to solve this you take your 53

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:59.810 
trick to solve this you take your 53
Andrew<00:00:49.620> -<00:00:52.010> 53<00:00:53.329> so<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.140> have<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:56.270> 53<00:00:58.820> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
Andrew - 53 so then we have this 53 and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:11.859 
Andrew - 53 so then we have this 53 and
a<00:01:01.280> 3<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:05.240> what<00:01:06.240> do<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.369> 53<00:01:08.369> plus<00:01:09.380> this

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
a 3 so what do we do we do 53 plus this

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:23.810 
a 3 so what do we do we do 53 plus this
365<00:01:14.090> we<00:01:15.090> divide<00:01:15.509> 65<00:01:16.320> by<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.689> eat<00:01:20.630> then<00:01:22.400> we<00:01:23.400> do

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
365 we divide 65 by to eat then we do

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:35.800 
365 we divide 65 by to eat then we do
our<00:01:24.200> 3<00:01:27.500> 3<00:01:29.270> 3<00:01:32.450> 3

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.690 

that<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.229> online<00:01:39.290> we<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.320> take<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:40.979> these

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
that is online we just take that these

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:50.779 
that is online we just take that these
two<00:01:41.939> answers<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:49.070> 53<00:01:50.070> times<00:01:50.520> she

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
two answers so we know that 53 times she

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.469 
two answers so we know that 53 times she
should<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.509> too<00:01:51.780> late<00:01:51.960> online
