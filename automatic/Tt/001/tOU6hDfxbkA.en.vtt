00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
back that is midway down the knife but

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.749 
back that is midway down the knife but
it<00:00:28.680> still<00:00:28.890> maintains<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:30.439> sage<00:00:31.759> tradition

it's titanium and iron wood beautiful
knife<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> lock<00:00:43.230> back<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.770> nice

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
knife on this the the lock back is nice

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160 
knife on this the the lock back is nice
and<00:00:44.219> solid<00:00:44.510> we're<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.660> gonna<00:00:45.750> close<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> up

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and solid we're just gonna close it up

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.600 
and solid we're just gonna close it up
here<00:00:46.230> really<00:00:46.530> quick<00:00:46.860> take<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> look<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.520> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
here really quick take a look at it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.080 
here really quick take a look at it
closed<00:00:48.739> reversible<00:00:49.739> pocket<00:00:50.129> clip<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.910> can

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
closed reversible pocket clip so you can

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.670 
closed reversible pocket clip so you can
have<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.480> for<00:00:51.780> right<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> left<00:00:52.980> hand<00:00:53.340> carry

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
have it for right and left hand carry

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.619 
have it for right and left hand carry
just<00:00:55.680> beautiful<00:00:56.520> as<00:00:56.640> far<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> goes

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
just beautiful as far as it goes

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.260 
just beautiful as far as it goes
the<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.500> differences<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.090> said

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the the differences are like I said

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
the the differences are like I said
that's<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> lock<00:01:01.530> back

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that's going to be the lock back

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.580 
that's going to be the lock back
function<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> other

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
function on that and then the other

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.530 
function on that and then the other
difference<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.770> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:09.030> weight<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
difference is going to be the weight and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.340 
difference is going to be the weight and
that's<00:01:10.049> because<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.960> Ironwood<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that's because of the Ironwood and the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.640 
that's because of the Ironwood and the
the<00:01:14.340> solid<00:01:15.150> titanium<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> see<00:01:16.380> here

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the solid titanium that you see here

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.109 
the solid titanium that you see here
with<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> bolster<00:01:18.259> compared<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.530> other

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
with the bolster compared to the other

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.080 
with the bolster compared to the other
Spyderco<00:01:21.119> sages<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.790> like<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.060> example

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
Spyderco sages and so like for example

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.130 
Spyderco sages and so like for example
the<00:01:24.540> sage<00:01:24.750> one<00:01:25.820> we've<00:01:26.820> got<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.119> here<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the sage one we've got one here with the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.069 
the sage one we've got one here with the
carbon<00:01:28.500> fiber<00:01:28.970> super<00:01:29.970> light<00:01:30.180> because<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.990> is

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
carbon fiber super light because it is

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.620 
carbon fiber super light because it is
carbon<00:01:31.500> fiber<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.920> mean<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:33.240> weight<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
carbon fiber I mean the the weight on

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.340 
carbon fiber I mean the the weight on
its<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:34.110> point<00:01:34.350> two<00:01:34.500> ounces<00:01:34.790> versus<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
its three point two ounces versus the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.630 
its three point two ounces versus the
titanium<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> Ironwood<00:01:37.950> which<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> going

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
titanium and the Ironwood which is going

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780 
titanium and the Ironwood which is going
to<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.939> four<00:01:39.210> point<00:01:39.450> two<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.369> as<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.640> can

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
to be four point two so but as you can

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.109 
to be four point two so but as you can
see<00:01:42.470> from<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> two<00:01:43.829> knives<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.340> they're

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
see from the two knives here they're

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.420 
see from the two knives here they're
going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:46.460> pretty<00:01:47.460> much<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.759> same<00:01:47.939> length

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
going to be pretty much the same length

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.130 
going to be pretty much the same length
the<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:51.149> blade<00:01:51.360> length<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> be

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the the blade length is going to be

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
the the blade length is going to be
exactly<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> same<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> three<00:01:53.399> inches<00:01:53.790> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
exactly the same as the three inches and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
exactly the same as the three inches and
then<00:01:54.750> it's<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.140> handle<00:01:55.470> itself<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
then it's the handle itself that's the

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
then it's the handle itself that's the
difference<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.719> length<00:01:58.290> there<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.810> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
difference in in length there so the the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.289 
difference in in length there so the the
sage<00:02:01.110> 4<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> 4th<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
sage 4 is going to be the 4th in the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.190 
sage 4 is going to be the 4th in the
lineup<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.750> sages<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.829> sage<00:02:05.070> one

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
lineup of the sages we have the sage one

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.740 
lineup of the sages we have the sage one
which<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.819> with<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> liner<00:02:09.179> lock<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
which is this one with a liner lock and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.610 
which is this one with a liner lock and
then<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.160> sage<00:02:11.430> 2<00:02:12.319> which<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.500> also

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
then you have the sage 2 which is also

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.040 
then you have the sage 2 which is also
tight

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
tight

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.040 
tight
with<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.320> frame<00:02:16.710> lock<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.570> then<00:02:18.570> we<00:02:18.750> have<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
with a frame lock and then we have the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.750 
with a frame lock and then we have the
sage<00:02:19.260> 3<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.930> blue<00:02:22.260> g10<00:02:22.680> handle<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:23.280> then

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
sage 3 with the blue g10 handle and then

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.180 
sage 3 with the blue g10 handle and then
it's<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.090> bolt<00:02:24.560> action<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:25.860> they<00:02:25.980> call

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
it's the bolt action is what they call

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
it's the bolt action is what they call
for<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.460> locking<00:02:26.880> mechanism<00:02:27.420> on<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.840> so

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
for the locking mechanism on it and so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.710 
for the locking mechanism on it and so
that<00:02:28.320> just<00:02:28.680> slides<00:02:28.890> back<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:30.030> close<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
that just slides back to close it and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.370 
that just slides back to close it and
then<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.650> also<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.030> see<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.270> moved<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.230> lock

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
then it also you can see it moved a lock

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.790 
then it also you can see it moved a lock
