a<00:00:12.690> major<00:00:12.990> part<00:00:13.200> at<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.769> end<00:00:13.950> you<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.160> going<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
a major part at the end you are going to

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.570 
a major part at the end you are going to
get<00:00:14.910> spotted<00:00:15.330> but<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.440> your<00:00:16.830> penalty<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.340> so

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
get spotted but that your penalty is so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
get spotted but that your penalty is so
little<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.690> doesn't<00:00:18.960> matter<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.380> main

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
little that it doesn't matter the main

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.870 
little that it doesn't matter the main
reason<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.859> don't<00:00:20.039> want<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.340> spotted<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
reason you don't want to get spotted is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.080 
reason you don't want to get spotted is
because<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.920> know<00:00:23.039> they<00:00:23.220> start<00:00:23.519> shooting<00:00:23.730> you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
because you know they start shooting you

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.620 
because you know they start shooting you
and<00:00:24.359> if<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.140> haven't<00:00:25.320> eliminated<00:00:26.630> the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and if you haven't eliminated the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.500 
and if you haven't eliminated the
targets<00:00:28.170> then<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.849> very

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
targets then it's going to be very

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.950 
targets then it's going to be very
difficult<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.960> get<00:00:31.940> silently<00:00:32.940> anyway<00:00:33.450> there

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
difficult to get silently anyway there

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.280 
difficult to get silently anyway there
you<00:00:34.110> just<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.590> wait<00:00:34.770> until<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> guard<00:00:37.079> is

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you just have to wait until the guard is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.350 
you just have to wait until the guard is
just<00:00:37.710> about<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.160> move<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.850> there's<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.090> little

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
just about to move and there's a little

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.310 
just about to move and there's a little
wiggle<00:00:39.950> for<00:00:40.950> lack<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.340> better<00:00:41.370> word<00:00:42.320> before

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
you have to wait until that guard has

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.560 
you have to wait until that guard has
gone<00:00:57.660> through<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:58.230> wait<00:00:58.379> until<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.980> hear

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the sound of a door opening twice and I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.140 
the sound of a door opening twice and I
intended<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> throw<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
intended to throw it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
intended to throw it
the<00:01:06.590> statue<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.720> table<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> counter

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the statue at the table at the counter

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.350 
the statue at the table at the counter
but<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> doesn't<00:01:11.760> matter<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.210> get

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
but it doesn't matter if you get

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
but it doesn't matter if you get
slightly<00:01:12.930> wrong<00:01:13.110> because<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.650> doesn't<00:01:13.890> spot

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
slightly wrong because it doesn't spot

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.700 
slightly wrong because it doesn't spot
you<00:01:14.430> either<00:01:14.909> way<00:01:15.240> even<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.290> stay<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you either way even if you stay in a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.929 
you either way even if you stay in a
corner<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.250> actually<00:01:17.580> works<00:01:17.759> out

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
corner and this actually works out

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.170 
corner and this actually works out
because<00:01:19.040> because<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.340> much<00:01:20.970> shorter

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because because it's a much shorter

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.320 
because because it's a much shorter
