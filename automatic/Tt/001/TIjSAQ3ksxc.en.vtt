00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.099
 Hello and welcome back to Germany 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.519
 the blogs nice that they are back 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.110
 are 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.459
 no, that's not just a new one 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.019
 Workshop I do not have to from too 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.380
 My wife takes me home from home 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.080
 We have to go here for our newest 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.490
 achievement geese for a long time 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.929
 I always wanted to have a cherished dream 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.369
 chickens are beautiful but I know them 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.720
 do not like to know who they are 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.520
 simply being chattered I am glad 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.039
 me right on the building domicile 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.789
 at the tinkering yesterday on the 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.320
 throw a glance on it fast 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.059
 I had time all winter 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.739
 I do not have to build to make things 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.800
 made last week without further ado 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.940
 spontaneously ordered two geese 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.079
 Yesterday still on the fast 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.340
 some kind of goose-sty 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.280
 I put the thing together 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.530
 is well done 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.940
 are housed namely in the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.870
 there is a rabbit hutch in the anteroom 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.519
 wherever hay and straw were stored and 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.680
 we just have a corner of 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:10.990
 disconnected very simple matter 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.470
 Although there is less room for straw though 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.470
 I can live with that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.080
 the whole domizil should be so one and a half 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.080
 be two square meters 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.200
 with a door and then I'm not there 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.190
 purely crawling need to make our server 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:36.549
 even with a lid up 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.220
 The whole thing is so unpleasant to move 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.220
 thing to keep clean 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.819
 at the moment is still a pretty difficult one 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.690
 wood door turn but that will change 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:57.009
 there comes a plastic closure to it 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.850
 is safe and then So, at first 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.850
 make yourself comfortable 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.909
 and you should with us for possibility 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.909
 lacking nothing 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360
 first of all 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.989
 there they are in there 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.310
 two pieces one gray one white one big 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.550
 moment I have never in my life 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.700
 I just touched it if I got it 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.700
 created 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:54.200
 I hurt you so nothing are the cute but 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:09.980
 quite clear that after an upset what have you 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:09.980
 or yes yes it is true 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.000
 Of course I do not know how long now 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.620
 they have to stay in there 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.540
 I suppose that can be directly out 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.370
 so sometimes they add my clothes 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.500
 tag is not a wing because you have to 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.950
 Let's see here this is not a wing 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.959
 quickly as long as I sit in there 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.579
 I have to leave that now 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.329
 let out how they live here 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.670
 I should show you the same and pure in 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.639
 a new domicile 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:45.959
 You can not stop it now, yeah 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:48.720
 important that the gray now that completely 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.180
 or completely he could not say that 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.220
 So that's exactly what you can recognize 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.220
 determine the length of the house 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.230
 I do not know but I'm not 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.370
 certainly I really wanted you 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.420
 But sometimes the kids keep it that way 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.459
 can eat a goose egg but the 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.989
 seem to have been told that the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.510
 this year no self applies though 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.000
 the geese are not laying eggs that would be 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.419
 only next year will show 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.859
 this trial as like this make 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.730
 with us as we cope with it 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:36.840
 but I think the first very cute 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:40.190
 yes yes notorious wings are so well 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.190
 you in and a new domicile 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.970
 I suppose I'll go first now 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.530
 For a whole while a week 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.210
 or have to stay in here longer 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:58.140
 so that there do not directly certain 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.550
 Be like the current and the fodder 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:03.590
 I also have to take care of it 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:07.920
 he likes to say they are omnivorous 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.270
 chicken feed but somehow I have to 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.920
 think 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.160
 they still can not get out on the 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.610
 There is no idyllic meadow there 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.510
 sight 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.310
 So I do not know how to do that 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:29.750
 I do n't have porsche 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:32.040
 but I'm so hungry 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.540
 So I suppose geese are 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.490
 Quite price reductions are none 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.710
 salad is safe from that in the beginning 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.070
 should that be where the lives are supposed to live here 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.420
 separated with such a piece of fence 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.420
 Be right there from here 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:57.020
 and then I can go for it 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:00.110
 change the whole area with 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:03.260
 compost is free here i have too 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.230
 no idea how much space and was 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.550
 Ultimately needed because I have 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.590
 heard of people who are essential 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.730
 less space available too 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.020
 like to keep but are even now 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.110
 at least not just our suggestion 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.830
 and then it is natural 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.230
 expandable 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.180
 with this piece fence around the back 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.540
 my god to notes to the football field 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:27.170
 from the children great new access 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.480
 I'm excited maybe he is 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.740
 any spectators outside themselves 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.520
 so familiar to me a few tips 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.440
 can give 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.670
 Of course, one feeds to become fat 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.640
 maybe someone is there 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.560
 if you can say 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.070
 otherwise on the left are also 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.420
