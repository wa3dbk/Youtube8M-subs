00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:29.989
 to us that gets up that does not 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.489
 up does not have to go no I never you 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.480
 I said that if you are not the owner of the 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.960
 ball 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.970
 I was not going to be able to do sports tourism 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.370
 I always played with the ball and I want 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.329
 keep playing I do not want to break the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.120
 illusion and much less the way of being 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:50.210
 of very brief people is how they are 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.390
 doing for 4 3 4 weeks 55 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.000
 weeks a very good sports project to 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.379
 Sunday night on channel 9 what 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.620
 they started competing in the program 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.300
 sports channel 13 where they arrived not 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.730
 they only started to compete you equaled 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 to the rating 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.070
 where the competition 9 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.800
 they sent them to the document for a million 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.170
 of dollars but not the channel actually 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.600
 by use 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.420
 of images supposedly of all and 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.130
 citizen competitions we use 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.420
 two types of images the two programs 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.720
 that we are some images of them 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.149
 for a particular reason of niembro and 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.220
 as degrees there is no other part because 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.479
 highlights from the programs the things that 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.100
 we want to use for him to do 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.470
 a click or something of that was the second 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.049
 letter document the Thursday the first 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.180
 had to do with images of these in 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.070
 others the first program we tell the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.539
 letters kept us camera and the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.780
 left next to the stadium happens to us the 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.340
 match lanús racing for example the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.289
 bed accreditations us back 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.509
 we ask for tournaments and competitions 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.310
 the company that competes with us for 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.259
 which happens to us that suddenly on Friday 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.940
 at half past six we do not know if 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.520
 we can enter a camera to the court not 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.799
 It is powerful completing the authorization 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.929
 from the cameras to those who have the 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.920
 monopoly or you do not handle the color 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.920
 of the environment 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.880
 and private 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.280
 there is possible so much fear of convenience 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.940
 is something that makes the power also of 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.630
 macro 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.120
 I also touch 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.450
 and is politically responsible for this 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.250
 institutionally that there is a contract 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.020
 between the afa and tournaments and competitions a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.940
 exclusivity contract that violates 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.210
 some laws for example the law of the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.210
 competition 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.860
 and it does not surprise me that kind of wanted 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.260
 compete what I did not want to compete great 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.050
 fear of moisture and head competition 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.210
 and once from martín ferro and again 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.520
 radio deal was of a type that 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.080
 we respected ourselves professionally and that 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.810
 he liked to repeat and if he wins me 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.670
 he wins and life is not like that, but 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.680
 it's one thing to compete with productions 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.990
 independent or other types of 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.670
 levels from other monopolies and a 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.200
 thing is to compete be itself which is what 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.020
 that normally does he have all 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.550
 your programs in different channels one 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.200
 that compete in same hours but 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.090
 this is the only independent program 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.860
 Messi was competing with a program 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.770
 who made the decision made during 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.990
 the broker in principle sent us a 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.640
 letter arrived the letter the second letter 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.190
 tournament document to the channel and 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.600
 us on Wednesday and Friday the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.770
 channel not when a letter document to 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.410
 we 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.700
 the only thing I wanted to say is all the 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.290
 programs that did not belong to this 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.120
 competition at some point were 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.920
 bought by tournaments and competitions by 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.350
 so today there is no program 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.480
 independent and on the other hand what 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.190
 I mean beyond the fact 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.700
 journalistic of not being able to follow 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.260
 expressing yourself out there is this not all in 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.340
 journalism is if you do not work there 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.520
 you're dead the same, no, I do not mean 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.390
 for many of those there are a lot 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.340
 we have samples of adhesion 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.020
 all the time the same journalists 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.870
 because the magazines and towers of 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.870
 competition I sell utilities has 40 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:24.730
 33 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.730
 so let's fight it
