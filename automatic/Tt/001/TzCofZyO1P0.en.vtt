of a font size I'm giving it a border
and<00:03:28.250> let's<00:03:29.150> see<00:03:29.300> what<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.510> looks<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:29.810> now

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
and let's see what that looks like now

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.890 
and let's see what that looks like now
so<00:03:30.860> if<00:03:30.920> we<00:03:31.040> hover<00:03:31.220> over<00:03:31.310> that<00:03:31.640> you<00:03:32.600> can<00:03:32.720> see<00:03:32.810> it

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
so if we hover over that you can see it

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.570 
so if we hover over that you can see it
just<00:03:32.930> pops<00:03:33.290> out<00:03:33.590> because<00:03:33.860> I've<00:03:34.040> made<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.340> 80

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
just pops out because I've made it 80

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.080 
just pops out because I've made it 80
pixels<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.330> put<00:03:35.570> this<00:03:35.690> ring<00:03:35.990> around<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:38.060> you

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
pixels I put this ring around it so you

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.580 
pixels I put this ring around it so you
can<00:03:38.270> get<00:03:38.390> pretty<00:03:38.480> crazy<00:03:38.840> with<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.410> while

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
can get pretty crazy with it and while

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.110 
can get pretty crazy with it and while
you<00:03:39.740> may<00:03:39.920> not<00:03:39.950> want<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.490> this<00:03:40.670> exact

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
you may not want to do this exact

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.910 
you may not want to do this exact

menu on a white background is kind of
problematic<00:04:59.960> so<00:05:00.320> what<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.530> can<00:05:00.710> do<00:05:00.950> is<00:05:01.190> I<00:05:01.670> can

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
problematic so what I can do is I can

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.520 
problematic so what I can do is I can
pull<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.180> same<00:05:02.450> menu<00:05:02.810> and<00:05:03.050> just<00:05:03.230> change<00:05:03.440> the

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.960 
pull this same menu and just change the
colors<00:05:03.890> to<00:05:03.920> something<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.370> will<00:05:04.580> stand<00:05:04.790> out

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
colors to something that will stand out

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.540 
colors to something that will stand out
better<00:05:05.240> for<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:05.990> single<00:05:06.470> page<00:05:06.650> without<00:05:07.400> it

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
better for that single page without it

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.980 
better for that single page without it
affecting<00:05:07.640> all<00:05:08.180> of<00:05:08.210> my<00:05:08.390> other<00:05:08.510> pages<00:05:08.810> that

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
affecting all of my other pages that

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.320 
affecting all of my other pages that
have<00:05:09.380> that<00:05:09.560> same<00:05:09.860> menu<00:05:10.130> so<00:05:10.880> that's<00:05:11.090> what<00:05:11.240> we're

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
have that same menu so that's what we're

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.370 
have that same menu so that's what we're
going<00:05:11.420> to<00:05:11.480> take<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.720> look<00:05:11.930> at<00:05:12.110> in<00:05:12.260> the<00:05:12.350> next
