00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
this map but for the purpose of this

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.380 
this map but for the purpose of this
video<00:00:25.980> I<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.400> ok<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:26.849> not<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.029> better

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
video I was like ok there's not a better

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.230 
video I was like ok there's not a better
map<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.900> there<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.619> kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.980> show<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:29.910> point

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
map out there to kind of show my point

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.089 
map out there to kind of show my point
then<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.170> map<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.560> there's<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> lot<00:00:32.009> of

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
then this map because there's a lot of

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.470 
then this map because there's a lot of
long<00:00:32.219> lines<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> sight<00:00:32.759> there's<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> lot<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
long lines of sight there's a lot of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.150 
long lines of sight there's a lot of
close-range<00:00:33.960> engagements<00:00:34.290> there's<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.100> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
close-range engagements there's just a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.380 
close-range engagements there's just a
lot<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> scenarios<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.239> put

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
lot of scenarios that you can put

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.360 
lot of scenarios that you can put
yourself<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:37.110> makes<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.219> good

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
yourself in that makes it a really good

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.430 
yourself in that makes it a really good
area<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.850> showcase<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> weapon<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.140> think<00:00:40.320> that's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
area to showcase a weapon I think that's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
area to showcase a weapon I think that's
probably<00:00:40.649> why<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.070> many<00:00:41.219> youtubers<00:00:41.700> use<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.149> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
probably why so many youtubers use it I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.030 
probably why so many youtubers use it I
try<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> stay<00:00:43.170> away<00:00:43.200> from<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
try to stay away from it but for the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.200 
try to stay away from it but for the
purpose<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.489> video<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.059> works

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
purpose of this video I think it works

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
purpose of this video I think it works
perfectly<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:45.960> we're<00:00:46.050> gonna<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.289> talking

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
perfectly because we're gonna be talking

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220 
perfectly because we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.100> magazine-fed<00:00:47.610> LMGs<00:00:48.110> we're<00:00:49.110> gonna

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
about the magazine-fed LMGs we're gonna

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.720 
about the magazine-fed LMGs we're gonna
be<00:00:49.350> using<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> m27<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.520> kind<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
be using the m27 just to kind of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
be using the m27 just to kind of
highlight<00:00:50.910> my<00:00:51.210> example<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> goes<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.620> all

magazine-fed LMGs the l86 the RPK the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.970 
magazine-fed LMGs the l86 the RPK the
qbb<00:00:56.219> let's<00:00:57.180> see<00:00:57.239> how<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.980> m36

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

qbb let's see how that when they m36
mg36<00:00:59.940> yeah<00:01:00.270> i<00:01:00.300> think<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.600> what<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
mg36 yeah i think that's what it is I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.540 
mg36 yeah i think that's what it is I
always<00:01:01.170> want<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.469> call<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> m36<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.460> is

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
always want to call it the m36 but it is

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.850 
always want to call it the m36 but it is
the<00:01:02.670> mg36<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:04.049> goes<00:01:04.199> for<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the mg36 so it goes for all the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070 
the mg36 so it goes for all the
magazine-fed<00:01:05.670> LMGs<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.780> makes<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
magazine-fed LMGs and what makes it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.660 
magazine-fed LMGs and what makes it
magazine-fed<00:01:07.500> well<00:01:07.860> if<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> pull<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> magazine

because<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> m27<00:01:31.079> has<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> pretty<00:01:31.710> solid<00:01:31.890> fire

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
because the m27 has a pretty solid fire

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.249 
because the m27 has a pretty solid fire
rate<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.299> pretty<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.630> weapon<00:01:33.780> overall<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
rate it's a pretty good weapon overall I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.370 
rate it's a pretty good weapon overall I
think<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> m27<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.310> probably<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
think the m27 is probably you know the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.859 
think the m27 is probably you know the
most<00:01:37.650> popular<00:01:38.100> magazine<00:01:38.579> fed<00:01:38.790> LMG<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.450> think

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
most popular magazine fed LMG I think

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.539 
most popular magazine fed LMG I think
that<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.619> could<00:01:40.770> probably<00:01:41.009> make<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that I think I could probably make that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
that I think I could probably make that
assumption<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> lot<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> people

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
assumption because I see a lot of people

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.499 
assumption because I see a lot of people
using<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> lot<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> people<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.299> go

one in the chamber where should I go

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.280 
one in the chamber where should I go
with<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.360> heavy<00:01:57.540> barrel<00:01:57.719> which<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.020> gonna

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
with the heavy barrel which is gonna

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.929 
with the heavy barrel which is gonna
give<00:01:58.439> me<00:01:58.590> better<00:01:58.829> accuracy<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.790> also

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
give me better accuracy and it's also

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
give me better accuracy and it's also
going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> make<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.229> damage

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
going to make it so that my damage

going to make it so that my damage
drop-off<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> little<00:02:02.850> bit<00:02:03.030> slower<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
drop-off is a little bit slower so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
drop-off is a little bit slower so
you're<00:02:03.689> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.899> hold<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.350> damage<00:02:04.740> at

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
range much better with the heavy barrel

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.969 
range much better with the heavy barrel

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
and I'm gonna be switching to the heavy

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.830 
and I'm gonna be switching to the heavy
barrel<00:02:29.670> here<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.150> guys<00:02:30.240> can<00:02:30.360> kind<00:02:30.600> of<00:02:30.690> get

barrel here so you guys can kind of get

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
barrel here so you guys can kind of get
an<00:02:30.930> idea<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.800> know<00:02:31.890> me<00:02:32.130> using<00:02:32.550> the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
an idea of you know me using the

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
an idea of you know me using the
extended<00:02:33.060> mags<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> differences

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
extended mags and then the differences

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.260 
extended mags and then the differences
with<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.350> heavy<00:02:34.530> barrel<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.100> from<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.060> point

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
with the heavy barrel so from this point

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.060 
with the heavy barrel so from this point
forth<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.900> video<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.380> will<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.740> with<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
forth in the video it will be with the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.830 
forth in the video it will be with the
heavy<00:02:38.250> barrel<00:02:38.360> just<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.510> clear<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.720> any

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
heavy barrel just to clear up any

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.930 
heavy barrel just to clear up any
confusion<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:40.650> heavy<00:02:40.950> barrel<00:02:41.220> what<00:02:41.400> exactly

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
confusion but heavy barrel what exactly

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.490 
confusion but heavy barrel what exactly
benefit<00:02:42.390> wise<00:02:42.570> are<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.840> getting<00:02:43.200> with<00:02:43.290> this

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
benefit wise are you getting with this

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.930 
benefit wise are you getting with this
thing<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:43.770> I'm<00:02:43.830> gonna<00:02:43.950> talk<00:02:44.130> about<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.400> m27

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
thing now I'm gonna talk about the m27

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.000 
thing now I'm gonna talk about the m27
but<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.420> can<00:02:45.600> translate<00:02:45.780> over<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.440> most<00:02:46.830> of

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
but this can translate over to most of

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.520 
but this can translate over to most of
the<00:02:47.100> magazine-fed<00:02:47.970> LMGs<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.230> want<00:02:49.440> to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
the magazine-fed LMGs it's but I want to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.110 
the magazine-fed LMGs it's but I want to
use<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.740> m27<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.340> an<00:02:50.490> example<00:02:50.760> because<00:02:50.970> I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
use the m27 as an example because I

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.490 
use the m27 as an example because I
think<00:02:51.300> it's<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.570> one<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.930> most<00:02:52.050> people<00:02:52.410> are

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
think it's the one that most people are

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.230 
think it's the one that most people are
familiar<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.520> one<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.820> first<00:02:54.030> ones

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
familiar with it's one of the first ones

familiar with it's one of the first ones
your<00:02:54.360> unlock<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.660> mean<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.050> like<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> default

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
your unlock I mean it's like the default

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.860 
your unlock I mean it's like the default
you<00:02:56.010> know<00:02:56.100> LMG<00:02:56.550> on<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:57.090> support<00:02:57.450> class<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.810> if

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
you know LMG on the support class so if

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.750 
you know LMG on the support class so if
you've<00:02:57.990> never<00:02:58.110> played<00:02:58.290> support<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.550> hop

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
you've never played support and you hop

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.130 
you've never played support and you hop
on<00:02:59.940> there<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.240> can<00:03:00.330> use<00:03:00.540> this<00:03:00.690> weapon<00:03:01.020> right

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
on there you can use this weapon right

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.860 
on there you can use this weapon right
away<00:03:01.440> but<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.550> know<00:03:02.730> naked<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.510> thing<00:03:03.690> only

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
away but you know naked this thing only

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.710 
away but you know naked this thing only
has<00:03:04.200> an<00:03:04.320> aim<00:03:04.440> down<00:03:04.620> sight<00:03:04.890> accuracy<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.720> 0.4

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
has an aim down sight accuracy of 0.4

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.570 
has an aim down sight accuracy of 0.4
but<00:03:07.350> if<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.500> slap<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.890> heavy<00:03:08.100> barrel<00:03:08.310> on<00:03:08.550> it

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
but if you slap the heavy barrel on it

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.880 
but if you slap the heavy barrel on it
it<00:03:08.880> goes<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.240> 2.2<00:03:09.990> which<00:03:10.560> at<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:10.740> point

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it goes up 2.2 which at that point

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.190 
it goes up 2.2 which at that point
you're<00:03:11.340> basically<00:03:11.970> having<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.660> glorified

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
you're basically having a glorified

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.570 
you're basically having a glorified
assault<00:03:13.530> rifle<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.980> mean<00:03:14.160> if<00:03:14.310> you're<00:03:14.430> just

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
assault rifle I mean if you're just

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.490 
assault rifle I mean if you're just
using<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.940> default<00:03:15.120> magazine<00:03:15.810> you've<00:03:16.260> got

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
using the default magazine you've got

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.229 
using the default magazine you've got
plenty<00:03:16.680> of<00:03:16.860> rounds<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.280> know<00:03:17.640> you're<00:03:18.030> pretty

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
plenty of rounds you know you're pretty

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.270 
plenty of rounds you know you're pretty
accurate<00:03:18.690> with<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.989> thing<00:03:19.170> so<00:03:19.470> heavy<00:03:19.890> barrel

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
accurate with this thing so heavy barrel

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.949 
accurate with this thing so heavy barrel
definitely<00:03:20.880> increases<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.570> quite

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
definitely increases it quite

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.590 
definitely increases it quite
substantially<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:23.489> my<00:03:23.730> eye<00:03:23.760> is<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.180> biggest

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
substantially but my eye is the biggest

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.270 
substantially but my eye is the biggest
advantage<00:03:24.989> doesn't<00:03:25.230> necessarily<00:03:25.950> come<00:03:26.160> in

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
advantage doesn't necessarily come in

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.770 
advantage doesn't necessarily come in
accuracy<00:03:26.640> because<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:27.000> lot<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.239> people<00:03:27.540> can<00:03:27.660> be

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
accuracy because a lot of people can be

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.449 
accuracy because a lot of people can be
accurate<00:03:28.140> with<00:03:28.290> weapons<00:03:28.680> no<00:03:28.890> problem<00:03:29.310> it's

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
accurate with weapons no problem it's

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.970 
accurate with weapons no problem it's
not<00:03:29.580> always<00:03:29.820> a<00:03:29.970> huge<00:03:30.300> deal<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:31.410> be<00:03:31.560> accurate

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
not always a huge deal to be accurate

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.380 
not always a huge deal to be accurate
with<00:03:32.130> weapons<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.610> have<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> bigger<00:03:33.060> spread

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
with weapons that have a bigger spread

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.550 
with weapons that have a bigger spread
you<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.690> got<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.900> be<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.019> little<00:03:34.200> bit<00:03:34.410> more

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
you just got to be a little bit more

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.050 
you just got to be a little bit more
patient<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.160> your<00:03:35.310> shots<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.790> big

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
patient with your shots the big

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.300 
patient with your shots the big
advantage<00:03:36.510> comes<00:03:36.780> in<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.739> has<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> quicker

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
advantage comes in that it has a quicker

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.220 
advantage comes in that it has a quicker
time<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.760> kill<00:03:38.970> between<00:03:39.180> about<00:03:39.570> thirty<00:03:39.930> five

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
time to kill between about thirty five

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.320 
time to kill between about thirty five
meters<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.950> fifty<00:03:41.310> meters<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:42.030> has<00:03:42.180> a

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
meters and fifty meters it has a

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.910 
meters and fifty meters it has a
substantially<00:03:43.019> higher<00:03:43.050> time<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.650> kill<00:03:43.830> it

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
substantially higher time to kill it

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.650 
substantially higher time to kill it
because<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.370> does<00:03:44.580> hold<00:03:44.850> its<00:03:45.060> damage<00:03:45.480> much

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
because it does hold its damage much

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.050 
because it does hold its damage much
longer<00:03:46.080> once<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.650> get<00:03:46.800> outside<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.550> 50

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
longer once you get outside of the 50

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.550 
longer once you get outside of the 50
meter<00:03:48.269> range<00:03:48.600> though<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.019> heavy<00:03:49.230> barrel<00:03:49.410> is

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
meter range though the heavy barrel is

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.990 
meter range though the heavy barrel is
really<00:03:49.830> not<00:03:49.980> giving<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.459> much<00:03:50.640> advantage

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
really not giving you much advantage

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.210 
really not giving you much advantage
besides<00:03:51.900> more<00:03:52.110> accurate<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.769> at<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.010> point

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
besides more accurate so at that point

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.009 
besides more accurate so at that point
you<00:03:53.730> know<00:03:53.850> it's<00:03:54.120> nice<00:03:54.300> when<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.690> go<00:03:54.810> outside

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
you know it's nice when you go outside

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.020 
you know it's nice when you go outside
in<00:03:55.440> those<00:03:55.560> bigger<00:03:55.860> ranges<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.489> have<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.730> more

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
in those bigger ranges to have a more

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.360 
in those bigger ranges to have a more
accurate<00:03:57.209> weapon<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.980> know<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.160> could

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
accurate weapon so you know you could

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.040 
accurate weapon so you know you could
say<00:03:59.640> that<00:03:59.790> it's<00:03:59.910> more<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.300> latent<00:04:00.660> advantage

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
say that it's more of a latent advantage

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.350 
say that it's more of a latent advantage
and<00:04:01.290> that's<00:04:01.950> why<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.130> personally<00:04:02.910> prefer<00:04:03.330> to

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
and that's why I personally prefer to

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.060 
and that's why I personally prefer to
use<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.019> heavy<00:04:04.200> barrel<00:04:04.380> on<00:04:04.590> these<00:04:04.709> weapons

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
use the heavy barrel on these weapons

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.920 
use the heavy barrel on these weapons
over<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.459> extended<00:04:05.760> mags<00:04:06.000> especially<00:04:06.720> on<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
m27 now if you get in there with like

m27 now if you get in there with like
the<00:04:08.790> L<00:04:09.150> 86<00:04:09.660> which<00:04:09.840> does<00:04:10.080> reload<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> little<00:04:10.830> bit

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
the L 86 which does reload a little bit

the L 86 which does reload a little bit
slower<00:04:11.390> sometimes<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.510> might<00:04:12.660> want<00:04:12.720> to

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
slower sometimes you might want to

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.420 
slower sometimes you might want to
consider<00:04:13.200> using<00:04:13.320> the<00:04:13.739> extended<00:04:14.040> mags<00:04:14.220> just

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
consider using the extended mags just

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.759 
consider using the extended mags just
because<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.760> does<00:04:14.910> have<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.120> slower<00:04:15.420> reload<00:04:15.769> but

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
because it does have a slower reload but

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.620 
because it does have a slower reload but
I<00:04:16.799> personally<00:04:17.190> just<00:04:17.459> I<00:04:17.760> found<00:04:18.299> that<00:04:18.419> all<00:04:18.600> of

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
I personally just I found that all of

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.870 
I personally just I found that all of
these<00:04:18.900> magazine-fed<00:04:19.769> LMGs<00:04:19.890> just<00:04:20.549> work<00:04:20.700> a

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
these magazine-fed LMGs just work a

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.880 
these magazine-fed LMGs just work a
substantial<00:04:21.750> amount<00:04:21.900> better<00:04:22.169> if<00:04:22.410> you<00:04:22.620> put<00:04:22.800> the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
substantial amount better if you put the

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.110 
substantial amount better if you put the
heavy<00:04:23.039> barrel<00:04:23.220> on<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.520> because<00:04:23.669> at<00:04:23.789> that<00:04:23.880> point

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
heavy barrel on it because at that point

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.880 
heavy barrel on it because at that point
you're<00:04:24.300> just<00:04:24.510> using<00:04:24.720> eight<00:04:24.990> you're<00:04:25.590> using<00:04:25.770> it

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
you're just using eight you're using it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.320 
you're just using eight you're using it
as<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.010> salt<00:04:26.220> rifle<00:04:26.550> that<00:04:26.729> essentially<00:04:27.210> has

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
as a salt rifle that essentially has

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.710 
as a salt rifle that essentially has
more

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
more

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.000 
more

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.140 
get smoked with some of these
magazine-fed<00:04:47.130> LMGs<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.880> because<00:04:48.120> people

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
magazine-fed LMGs just because people

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
one heavy barrel and in my experiences

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.720 
one heavy barrel and in my experiences
that's<00:05:25.080> just<00:05:25.350> it's<00:05:25.680> just<00:05:25.860> overall<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.340> better

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730

situations where I'm benefiting from the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
heavy barrel itself then I would with a

heavy barrel itself then I would with a
