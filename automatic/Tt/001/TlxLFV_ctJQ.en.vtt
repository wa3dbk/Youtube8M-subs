00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello welcome to my channel now 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.819
 I come with the results of the day number 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.010
 5 of the salad diet on day 5 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.590
 we have to eat the fish chicken meat 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.990
 red I decided to eat fish I know 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.880
 because it is one of the meats that less 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 Calorie has the day it touched me 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 work I got up at 5 I have to 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.930
 getting to work at 7 I got to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.760
 do half an hour on the elliptical machine 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 because for that now it has already been 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.109
 immediate has to prepare me what 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.269
 what should be my food and get ready 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.369
 so I had to stop at half an hour 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.890
 and for that of the 7 and a half already I was 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.290
 I am eating my first my first dish 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.809
 salad with fish already to achieve the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
 11 I have to eat with all my friends 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 very good time I can eat at the time 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.410
 that dances friends of work and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.289
 my husband also because my husband 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 he also works in the same place as me 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.940
 when I go to work a friend of 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.949
 we carry chicken in sauce 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.379
 barbecue with white rice and also 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 salad with dressing wear brands 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.390
 element like how you have no idea 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.430
 Oh, I do not know, because chicken is the one that has 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.510
 barbecue I like a lot and although if 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.190
 I could eat chicken 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.840
 I had the barbecue sauce I did not want 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.430
 eat and that I was going to affect something the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.010
 amount of weight I was going to lose is not 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.780
 so optimistic with other days like 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.180
 you can see yesterday I lost 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.240
 my eye weight and this discouraged me 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.670
 cumin and fish with my salad like 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.950
 he craved the food as much as he wanted 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.350
 he grabbed a little bit of courage to what is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.240
 the fish and the salad and then apart 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 as well as yesterday there was no 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.910
 lost so much weight as it was worth 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.180
 It's worth it and I said not good, so here I go 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.970
 to endure and yes if I could ride it 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.160
 combined that I already started to work and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.430
 the time of departure my husband bought himself 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.690
 some chips of those of hachiro leaflets 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.090
 of those who have chili 2000 and 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.820
 greatest weakness that I have of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.340
 truth, I can not get the chips 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.110
 contain and we would have eaten it and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.479
 I said that we give one for lost 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.670
 for him and he tells me where they ended 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.750
 times to buy another bag for 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.789
 can its perfume 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.850
 because I was really being made 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.370
 water my mouth and how my food does not 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.550
 I had enjoyed it so much I wanted to 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.860
 eat something rich then they say I'm going 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.020
 to strain and I will not buy other chips 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.060
 I was grateful at the end for not having it 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.950
 done when my mom came home 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.080
 speak to tell me he had made broth 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.140
 of beef to me you already know that the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.880
 Beef broth is my favorite food I felt 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.760
 that yesterday was like I was 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.400
 putting a cage of people and all 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.860
 they were like that trying to break 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.450
 the diet because to me in case of network you 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.060
 I like it but I like to eat it with 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.090
 tortilla I like to eat it with chilito 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.709
 Iza lemon continue my fisherman 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.200
 We stay at home all those I 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.750
 supporting me in this they give me many friends and 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.380
 I do not want them to look bad when I lose 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.640
 a little bit of weight is like that today 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.520
 I feel that they look bad but really 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.200
 I'm doing everything I have to do 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.070
 several of you came to comment 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.960
 one day I think it was when I uploaded the video 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.610
 of the bananas 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.740
 he has lost a pound when he was 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.970
 losing a lot at the beginning they put 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.280
 that right now I'm in my last few pounds 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.400
 then that is already the most difficult of 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.310
 lose and are right the little things that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.320
 you really help me to follow 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.510
 continue to continue to follow and then almost 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.400
 we finished that only two are missing 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.590
 days that I am already like that arriving 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.570
 there in the end I only ate three 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.910
 food dishes so he told them 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:47.050
 I wanted to eat four but I tell them 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.090
 I already grabbed him as courage I do not know I wanted to 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.700
 eat chicken I wanted to eat broth from 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.890
 Sergio 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.610
 having to eat the fish dish 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.890
 with salad like I do not know if it has 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.550
 happened to you who are eating something 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.379
 to force if you're 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.180
 you take a little courage and I feel that 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.489
 I did badly today because I did 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.349
 only 30 minutes when I was 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.500
 doing my daughters of the hour tomorrow 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.930
 I'm going to replace it, I'm sure I'm going to 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.790
 to be able to do an hour because it 's the end of 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.500

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.450

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.800
 little bit more of exercises below 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.210

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.200
 examples of the meals that we made 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.710
