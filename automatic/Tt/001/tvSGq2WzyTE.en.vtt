00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.210 
when I was test driving the 2014 beetle
was<00:03:05.019> that<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.349> handled<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:05.829> an<00:03:05.950> aluminum

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
was that it handled like an aluminum

really<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.340> big<00:03:09.489> thing<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.760> earns<00:03:10.060> that

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
really the big thing that earns that

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.930 
really the big thing that earns that
reputation<00:03:10.690> is<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.200> steering<00:03:11.769> I<00:03:12.040> mean<00:03:12.609> this<00:03:12.790> is

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
reputation is a steering I mean this is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.789 
reputation is a steering I mean this is
like<00:03:13.090> turning<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.540> rudder<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:14.140> mean<00:03:14.349> it's<00:03:14.530> kind

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
like turning a rudder I mean it's kind

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.130 
like turning a rudder I mean it's kind
of<00:03:14.859> slow<00:03:15.129> off-center<00:03:15.940> it's<00:03:16.450> not<00:03:16.750> really

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
of slow off-center it's not really

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.250 
of slow off-center it's not really
direct<00:03:17.530> but<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.609> thing<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.000> is<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.599> does<00:03:20.019> have

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
direct but the thing is is it does have

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.289 
direct but the thing is is it does have
a<00:03:20.290> feeling<00:03:20.769> equality<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:21.640> that<00:03:21.670> really<00:03:22.030> is

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
a feeling equality and that really is

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.839 
a feeling equality and that really is
one<00:03:23.019> of<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.260> big<00:03:23.500> things<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:24.040> sets<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.579> car
