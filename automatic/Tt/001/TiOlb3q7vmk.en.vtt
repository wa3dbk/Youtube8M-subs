00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.100
 I am of course very sad that we 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.870

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.760

 there were great moments to throw 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.250
 the puck however we didn't do that and in 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.689
 in principle, this decided the outcome because 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.649
