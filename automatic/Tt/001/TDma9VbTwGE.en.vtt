00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.439
 the last one that says it has just been 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.879
 edited says throughout the past year 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.480
 by a magazine in Argentina and now has 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:14.339
 out edited is called dieran surubÃ­ 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.260
 is a text by Pedro Mairal is a 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.470
 Argentine writer works for cinema 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.470
 as well 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.230
 and I like to do it because I really did 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.029
 what I wanted with which I 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 I think doing what you want and 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.430
 that suddenly you like the other one is already 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:33.790
 it's a let me go I really liked doing it 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.739
 I played I had fun in no time what 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.379
 I did not miss a minute, which is what 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.610
 that usually happens in all good for this 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.320
 for the relationship that I found in that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.059
 I think that for the moment it is the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.070
 what has been better for me for a long time 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.790
 that we all handle with internet 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.110
 and me came in handy in that 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.210
 I can present my work through 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.149
 social networks and yes that has 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.649
 served to get a job they did not 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.519
 known different parts of the world with 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:03.039
 which would be more and said it's something 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.899
 which is an enemy on the other hand too 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.410
 it seems to me that we have to couple the 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.410
 world of paper 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.030
 I for example the last one of the my 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.700
 penultimate book that is patagonia made 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.799
 a special version for ipad and it has not 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.140
 worked within what what 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.030
 suppose that it has to work today in 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.069
 day that is pretty little 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.469
 well at least it has moved and has 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.700
 taken a little out of that doubt to see what 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:31.780
 could happen with a book 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.850
 on ipad we have put a lot of music on 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.370
 details to do it differently to 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.210
 a simple 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:43.240
 pdf sample so that's a bit of 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.830
 management with social networks the most is 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720
 a little bit a day 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.500
 I think it works but the relationship 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.430
 is what 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.000
 it has to do with drawing the painting 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.690
 and a text that is in the background 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.810
 the way it represents the different is 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.520
 maybe the graphic novel or the comic or the 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.150
 comic 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.950
 has more to do with the sequential and what 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.220
 illustrated has more to do with 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.740
 represent a special moment within 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.560
 of that text bring what is done to a 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.000
 more poetic side perhaps in one with a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.430
 single idea to represent 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.010
 many things that are being said in a 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.720
 certain moment a change the other is 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.550
 a little more 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.960
 sequential has more to do with the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.530
 how time 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.860
 organize the time to assemble it from another 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.460
 way that is a little bit asia to flight from 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.430
 bird the difference 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.200
 to see I went 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.000
 and absorbing many things for 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.800
 a lot of time right now I think everything 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.930
 that is already in 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.170
 and well, I've been doing 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.310
 trying to do something with all that 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.310
 I have copied and absorbed 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.150
 and good is that moment I'm 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.790
 living now but equal my 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.819
 influences are always what I read about 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.439
 literature or not so much comic book I'm not 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.630
 to read a lot of comics for more than what 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:18.550
 to do 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.550
 and the cinema is what most 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:26.200
 what influences me most when it comes to 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.510
 think a story to add because 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.040
 good depends on each author of each 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.420
 author to draw from illustrator the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.519
 feeling that I have is that I should not 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.580
 refer to what is read but to another 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.510
 another instance to generate there is a 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:46.019
 space a little more 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.640
 strange or different if one draws what 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:52.860
 it reads it seems to me that this is the 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.480
 for me it's a mistake I find boring 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.390
 I find it boring to see it and I 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.860
 it would be boring to fall into that trap 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.860
 I think that is a bit the 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.730
 the point that needs to be resolved until 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.290
 how do I do with this that I read and with this 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.820
 that I look at suddenly generates another 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.820
 situation that is a tone
