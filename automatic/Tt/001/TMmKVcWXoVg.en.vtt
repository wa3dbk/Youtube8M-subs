00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
against doing that and after they you

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.009 
against doing that and after they you
know<00:04:03.590> our<00:04:03.890> wash<00:04:04.489> thoroughly<00:04:04.970> either<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.930> the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
dishwasher by hand I would still take

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.920 
dishwasher by hand I would still take
the<00:04:08.810> step<00:04:09.079> to<00:04:09.739> boil<00:04:10.130> all<00:04:10.790> your<00:04:11.120> jars<00:04:11.390> just<00:04:11.750> for
