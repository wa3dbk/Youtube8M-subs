and exit clock town now what we're going

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.210 
and exit clock town now what we're going
to<00:02:10.420> do<00:02:10.539> here<00:02:10.569> is<00:02:10.929> bypass<00:02:11.620> all<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.099> that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
to do here is bypass all of that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.060 
to do here is bypass all of that
and<00:02:13.370> just<00:02:13.970> go<00:02:14.120> ahead<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.600> exit<00:02:15.350> clock<00:02:15.830> town

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
and just go ahead and exit clock town

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.440 
and just go ahead and exit clock town
anyway<00:02:16.340> though<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.640> is<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.060> guard<00:02:17.330> I

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
anyway though this is the right guard I

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.500 
anyway though this is the right guard I
know<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.750> gives<00:02:18.020> just<00:02:18.350> poster<00:02:18.800> right<00:02:18.980> there

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
know that gives just poster right there

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.670 
know that gives just poster right there
getting<00:02:20.510> past<00:02:20.750> them<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:20.990> actually<00:02:21.410> really

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
getting past them is actually really

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.040 
getting past them is actually really
simple<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.310> isn't<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.670> hard<00:02:23.000> look<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.570> do<00:02:23.780> I

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
simple this isn't a hard look to do I

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.990 
simple this isn't a hard look to do I
know<00:02:24.440> I<00:02:24.470> spends<00:02:24.830> two<00:02:24.950> half<00:02:25.160> minutes<00:02:25.520> finding

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
know I spends two half minutes finding

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 
know I spends two half minutes finding
the<00:02:26.090> right<00:02:26.240> guard<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:27.140> do<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.470> just<00:02:27.650> start<00:02:27.890> off

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
the right guard we do to just start off

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.950 
the right guard we do to just start off
on<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.220> left<00:02:28.460> side<00:02:28.670> each<00:02:29.360> side<00:02:29.420> step

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
on the left side each side step

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.630 
on the left side each side step
backwards<00:02:30.380> make<00:02:30.620> sure<00:02:30.740> easy<00:02:30.890> targeting<00:02:31.490> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
backwards make sure easy targeting and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.430 
backwards make sure easy targeting and
then<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.880> kind<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.300> grind<00:02:33.020> up<00:02:33.200> against

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
then you kind of like grind up against

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.310 
then you kind of like grind up against
this<00:02:33.560> right<00:02:33.830> wall<00:02:34.600> if<00:02:35.600> you<00:02:35.720> get<00:02:35.870> stuck<00:02:36.200> where

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
this right wall if you get stuck where

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.690 
this right wall if you get stuck where

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
let go of busy target and just kind of

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.270 
let go of busy target and just kind of
like<00:02:41.780> reposition<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:42.800> just<00:02:42.980> kind<00:02:43.190> of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
like reposition and then just kind of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.220 
like reposition and then just kind of
like<00:02:43.400> walk<00:02:43.700> backwards<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.630> lot<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.810> force

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
like walk backwards with a lot of force

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.590 
like walk backwards with a lot of force
like<00:02:46.130> this<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.640> start<00:02:46.850> balancing<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.420> he

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
like this you start balancing and he

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.990 
like this you start balancing and he
will<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:47.870> move<00:02:48.080> right<00:02:48.290> all<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.770> way<00:02:49.000> now

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000

this<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.209> where<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.600> glitches<00:02:50.840> start<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.320> come

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
this is where the glitches start to come

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.820 
this is where the glitches start to come
in<00:02:51.740> as<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:53.330> notice<00:02:53.630> there<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:53.870> no<00:02:54.140> music

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
is a little bit glitchy now I'm just

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.539 
is a little bit glitchy now I'm just
going<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.450> head<00:03:53.720> towards<00:03:54.320> the<00:03:54.500> woods<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.920> took

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
going to head towards the woods I took

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.210 
going to head towards the woods I took
the<00:03:55.700> long<00:03:55.880> way<00:03:55.910> around<00:03:56.239> on<00:03:56.750> accident<00:03:57.290> and

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.220 

usually<00:04:01.220> when<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.850> approach<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:02.420> area<00:04:02.930> for

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
usually when you approach this area for

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.380 
usually when you approach this area for
the<00:04:03.260> first<00:04:03.590> time<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:04.160> get<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.519> long<00:04:04.760> cutscene

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
the first time you get a long cutscene

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.160 
the first time you get a long cutscene
with<00:04:06.080> skull<00:04:06.440> kid<00:04:07.480> but<00:04:08.480> that's<00:04:08.720> because<00:04:08.959> it's

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
with skull kid but that's because it's

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.320 
with skull kid but that's because it's
kinda<00:04:09.709> like<00:04:09.769> a<00:04:10.010> time-sensitive<00:04:10.640> triggers

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
kinda like a time-sensitive triggers

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.640 
kinda like a time-sensitive triggers
neighing<00:04:11.600> worse<00:04:11.810> you've<00:04:12.230> already<00:04:12.380> completed

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
neighing worse you've already completed

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.430 
neighing worse you've already completed
a<00:04:13.010> portion<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:14.630> get<00:04:14.810> a<00:04:14.840> cut<00:04:15.019> scene<00:04:15.230> right

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
a portion you get a cut scene right

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.130 
a portion you get a cut scene right
about<00:04:15.620> here<00:04:16.130> we<00:04:17.090> will<00:04:17.209> not<00:04:17.359> get<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.810> at<00:04:18.019> the

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
about here we will not get that at the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.740 
about here we will not get that at the
moment<00:04:18.290> because<00:04:18.650> there<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.600> we<00:04:20.600> haven't

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
moment because there is we haven't

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.880 
moment because there is we haven't
completed<00:04:21.109> that<00:04:21.229> part<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.530> the<00:04:21.590> game<00:04:21.739> to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
completed that part of the game to

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.950 
completed that part of the game to
trigger<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.310> so<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.669> just<00:04:22.849> acts<00:04:23.120> like<00:04:23.330> you

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
trigger it so it just acts like you

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.719 
trigger it so it just acts like you
haven't<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:25.070> can<00:04:25.190> just<00:04:25.310> go<00:04:25.460> ahead<00:04:25.580> and

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
haven't and you can just go ahead and

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.010 
haven't and you can just go ahead and
explore<00:04:26.300> that<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.510> can

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
explore that you can

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.800 
explore that you can
I<00:04:27.080> go<00:04:27.620> pretty<00:04:27.979> deep<00:04:28.099> in<00:04:28.520> I'm<00:04:29.210> not<00:04:29.389> going<00:04:29.599> to<00:04:29.690> go

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
I go pretty deep in I'm not going to go

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.089 
I go pretty deep in I'm not going to go
very<00:04:29.840> far<00:04:31.990> since<00:04:32.990> we<00:04:33.229> do<00:04:33.349> not<00:04:33.379> have<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.830> sword

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
very far since we do not have the sword

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.399 
very far since we do not have the sword
and<00:04:34.340> other<00:04:34.639> things<00:04:35.030> we<00:04:35.539> would<00:04:35.750> not<00:04:35.870> be<00:04:35.930> able<00:04:36.110> to

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
and other things we would not be able to

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.149 
and other things we would not be able to
progress<00:04:36.620> very<00:04:36.860> far<00:04:37.490> into<00:04:37.759> the<00:04:37.970> game<00:04:38.000> and

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
progress very far into the game and

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.070 
progress very far into the game and
there<00:04:40.159> really<00:04:40.370> is<00:04:40.580> no<00:04:40.699> point<00:04:40.729> in<00:04:41.090> trying<00:04:41.330> so

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
there really is no point in trying so

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.860 
there really is no point in trying so
I'm<00:04:42.139> just<00:04:42.289> going<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.560> go<00:04:42.919> ahead<00:04:43.069> and<00:04:43.599> turn<00:04:44.599> back
