hey<00:00:00.329> guys<00:00:00.630> Jessica<00:00:00.900> Donnelly<00:00:01.410> here<00:00:01.560> with

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
hey guys Jessica Donnelly here with

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.409 
hey guys Jessica Donnelly here with
another<00:00:01.949> toy<00:00:02.190> review<00:00:02.250> and<00:00:02.760> say<00:00:02.909> I'm<00:00:03.030> reviewing

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
another toy review and say I'm reviewing

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.340 
another toy review and say I'm reviewing
many<00:00:04.080> wheels<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:05.040> construction<00:00:05.759> says

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
many wheels the construction says

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.770 
many wheels the construction says
there's<00:00:07.350> three<00:00:07.830> different<00:00:08.309> types<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:09.570> many

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
there's three different types of many

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.940 
there's three different types of many
wheel<00:00:09.990> sets<00:00:10.410> there's<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.639> rescue<00:00:11.969> set<00:00:12.650> there<00:00:13.650> is

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
wheel sets there's a rescue set there is

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.259 
wheel sets there's a rescue set there is
the<00:00:14.160> construction<00:00:14.730> set<00:00:14.940> which<00:00:15.089> we're

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the construction set which we're

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.210 
the construction set which we're
reviewing<00:00:15.540> today<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.170> then<00:00:16.980> there's<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
reviewing today and then there's a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.470 
reviewing today and then there's a
military<00:00:17.640> set<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.029> there's<00:00:18.180> three

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
military set and there's three

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.660 
military set and there's three
variations<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.350> each<00:00:19.560> making<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.279> too<00:00:20.430> little

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
variations of each making it too little

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.509 
variations of each making it too little
9<00:00:21.410> now<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.710> we're<00:00:22.890> done<00:00:22.980> with<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.250> blurry

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
9 now that we're done with the blurry

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.040 
9 now that we're done with the blurry
part<00:00:24.170> let's<00:00:25.170> get<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> review<00:00:26.420> now<00:00:27.420> many

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
part let's get to the review now many

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
part let's get to the review now many
wheels<00:00:28.320> are<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> same<00:00:29.369> size<00:00:29.670> as<00:00:30.000> Micro

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
wheels are about the same size as Micro

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.610 
wheels are about the same size as Micro
Machines<00:00:30.710> just<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.369> car<00:00:33.149> for<00:00:33.540> comparison<00:00:34.380> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
Machines just a car for comparison I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.720 
Machines just a car for comparison I
have<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.250> rescue<00:00:35.579> car<00:00:36.059> here<00:00:37.399> alright<00:00:38.399> there

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
have this rescue car here alright there

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.200 
have this rescue car here alright there
you<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:39.090> see<00:00:39.329> just<00:00:39.570> about<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> same<00:00:40.829> size<00:00:42.860> and

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
you can see just about the same size and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.729 
you can see just about the same size and
so<00:00:45.210> Micro<00:00:45.960> Machines<00:00:46.050> they<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.559> make

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
so Micro Machines they don't make

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.910 
so Micro Machines they don't make
anymore<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.820> many<00:00:48.030> wheels<00:00:48.270> existing<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.350> big

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
anymore so many wheels existing is a big

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.520 
anymore so many wheels existing is a big
deal<00:00:50.280> because<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.390> my<00:00:51.780> Commission's<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.410> get

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
deal because it my Commission's can get

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.959 
deal because it my Commission's can get
pretty<00:00:52.800> expensive<00:00:52.949> since<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.820> make

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
pretty expensive since they don't make

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.360 
pretty expensive since they don't make
them<00:00:54.149> anymore<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> these<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.680> along<00:00:55.920> pretty

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
them anymore and these go along pretty

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.479 
them anymore and these go along pretty
well<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.510> old<00:00:57.660> Micro<00:00:58.199> Machines

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
well with the old Micro Machines

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.709 
well with the old Micro Machines
playsets<00:00:59.489> either<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.239> they're<00:01:00.359> great<00:01:00.570> way<00:01:00.690> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
playsets either so they're great way to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.950 
playsets either so they're great way to
supplement<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.559> Micro<00:01:01.920> Machines<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.690> same

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
supplement your Micro Machines the same

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.039 
supplement your Micro Machines the same
time<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:05.790> people<00:01:06.119> are<00:01:06.420> about<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> same

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
time the the people are about the same

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.550 
time the the people are about the same
scale<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.619> Micro<00:01:08.010> Machines<00:01:08.570> people<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
scale as the Micro Machines people so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.940 
scale as the Micro Machines people so
for<00:01:10.950> comparison<00:01:12.080> Micro<00:01:13.080> Machines<00:01:13.200> soldier

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
for comparison Micro Machines soldier

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.580 
for comparison Micro Machines soldier
prepared<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.909> our<00:01:15.090> construction<00:01:15.689> worker<00:01:17.030> and

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
prepared to our construction worker and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.859 
prepared to our construction worker and
just<00:01:19.590> very<00:01:19.950> nice<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.060> these<00:01:21.330> toys<00:01:21.600> they're

a great standalone toy because they're

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.730 
a great standalone toy because they're
small<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.390> take<00:01:24.540> them<00:01:24.689> with<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.140> but

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
review this set comes with its gate very

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.560 
review this set comes with its gate very
similar<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.770> gate<00:01:53.100> from<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.670> rescue<00:01:54.210> set
