 on a plane with honor inside the fuselage of the house 

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:07.859
 tanks the amount of fuel is 5000

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.489
 so the total amount of fuel 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.800

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.270
 off 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.050
 the idea of â€‹â€‹shutting off the fireplug of this

 fire extinguishing button is pressed 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.830
 there are two on the plane

 work 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.849
 it also makes it easier to start the engine 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.239
 as the starter spins only
