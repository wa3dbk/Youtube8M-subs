people<00:00:39.170> are<00:00:39.440> most<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:39.739> time<00:00:39.860> when<00:00:40.040> I'm

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
people are most the time when I'm

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.860 
people are most the time when I'm
teaching<00:00:40.250> students<00:00:40.879> they<00:00:41.030> have<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.269> tendency

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
teaching students they have a tendency

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.479 
teaching students they have a tendency
to<00:00:41.900> flat<00:00:42.320> pick<00:00:42.590> on<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:42.800> guitar<00:00:43.040> what<00:00:43.280> i<00:00:43.309> mean

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
to flat pick on the guitar what i mean

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.460 
to flat pick on the guitar what i mean
by<00:00:43.610> flat<00:00:43.879> pick<00:00:44.150> is<00:00:44.570> if<00:00:44.750> you<00:00:44.870> have<00:00:44.989> a<00:00:45.019> look<00:00:45.230> at<00:00:45.350> my

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
by flat pick is if you have a look at my

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.540 
by flat pick is if you have a look at my
thumb<00:00:46.360> it<00:00:47.360> is<00:00:47.960> facing<00:00:48.530> parallel<00:00:49.160> to<00:00:49.430> the

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
thumb it is facing parallel to the

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.030 
thumb it is facing parallel to the
string<00:00:49.879> and<00:00:50.120> since<00:00:50.660> i'm<00:00:50.870> cheap<00:00:51.500> and<00:00:51.890> don't

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.040 
string and since i'm cheap and don't

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.320 
string and since i'm cheap and don't
have<00:00:52.220> more<00:00:52.460> camera<00:00:52.790> angles<00:00:53.000> i<00:00:53.059> think<00:00:53.239> i'm<00:00:53.300> just

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
have more camera angles i think i'm just

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.540 
have more camera angles i think i'm just
going<00:00:53.540> to<00:00:53.570> walk<00:00:53.690> closer<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.110> camera<00:00:54.550> so

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
going to walk closer to the camera so

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
going to walk closer to the camera so
you<00:00:55.610> can<00:00:55.700> see<00:00:56.000> here<00:00:56.390> my<00:00:56.870> thumb<00:00:57.879> pics<00:00:58.879> parallel

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
you can see here my thumb pics parallel

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.799 
you can see here my thumb pics parallel
to<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.930> string<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:01.730> in<00:01:02.059> order<00:01:02.210> to<00:01:02.360> achieve<00:01:02.570> a

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
to the string and in order to achieve a

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.930 
to the string and in order to achieve a
greater<00:01:03.230> amount<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.680> speed<00:01:04.070> if<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.489> answer<00:01:04.820> is

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
greater amount of speed if the answer is

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.219 
greater amount of speed if the answer is
simple<00:01:04.970> what<00:01:05.509> you're<00:01:05.660> going<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.840> want<00:01:05.990> to<00:01:06.080> do

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
simple what you're going to want to do

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.230 
simple what you're going to want to do
hold<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.220> pic<00:01:07.369> of<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:07.550> same<00:01:07.789> manner<00:01:08.000> that<00:01:08.149> you

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
hold the pic of the same manner that you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.240 
hold the pic of the same manner that you
normally<00:01:08.390> would<00:01:08.780> but<00:01:09.649> you're<00:01:09.860> going<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.039> want

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
normally would but you're going to want

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.580 
normally would but you're going to want
to<00:01:10.310> angle<00:01:10.700> your<00:01:10.850> thumb<00:01:11.180> down<00:01:11.920> like<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:14.590> so

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
to angle your thumb down like this so

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.770 
to angle your thumb down like this so
angling<00:01:16.039> your<00:01:16.220> thumb<00:01:16.490> on<00:01:16.700> a<00:01:16.820> down<00:01:17.420> position

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
angling your thumb on a down position

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.499 
angling your thumb on a down position
like<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.350> allows<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.610> pic<00:01:19.789> to<00:01:20.000> glide

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
like that allows the pic to glide

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.940 
like that allows the pic to glide
through<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:20.990> string<00:01:21.320> almost<00:01:21.649> like<00:01:21.860> you're

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
through the string almost like you're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.590 
through the string almost like you're
kind<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:22.280> cutting<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.759> string<00:01:23.060> instead<00:01:23.420> of

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
kind of cutting the string instead of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.960 
kind of cutting the string instead of
flat<00:01:24.470> picking<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:25.009> here<00:01:25.340> if<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:25.670> give<00:01:25.940> you

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
flat picking it here if I just give you

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.919 
flat picking it here if I just give you
a<00:01:26.060> little<00:01:26.149> bit<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.390> all<00:01:26.539> you<00:01:28.599> you<00:01:29.599> can<00:01:29.780> almost

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
a little bit of all you you can almost

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:31.600 
a little bit of all you you can almost
hear<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.560> resistance<00:01:31.130> it'll<00:01:31.310> give<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.550> a

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
hear the resistance it'll give you a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.830 
hear the resistance it'll give you a
little<00:01:31.759> bit<00:01:31.940> of<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.090> different<00:01:32.420> kind<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.599> a<00:01:32.660> tone

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
little bit of a different kind of a tone

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.589 
little bit of a different kind of a tone
watch<00:01:33.470> what<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:33.709> angle<00:01:33.920> my<00:01:34.069> thumb<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:38.360> has<00:01:38.569> a

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:38.599 
watch what I angle my thumb it has a

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.419 
watch what I angle my thumb it has a
different<00:01:39.170> kind<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.530> sound<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:40.039> it<00:01:40.069> but<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.340> it

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
different kind of sound to it but I it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.910 
different kind of sound to it but I it
allows<00:01:40.700> me<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:41.060> pick<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.300> lot<00:01:41.539> faster<00:01:42.050> so<00:01:42.560> I<00:01:42.860> do

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
allows me to pick a lot faster so I do

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.020 
allows me to pick a lot faster so I do
that<00:01:43.369> technique<00:01:44.979> any<00:01:45.979> time<00:01:46.280> I'm<00:01:46.490> looking<00:01:46.819> for

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
that technique any time I'm looking for

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.609 
that technique any time I'm looking for
a<00:01:47.060> great<00:01:47.270> amount<00:01:47.509> of<00:01:47.630> speed<00:01:47.959> now<00:01:48.170> flatpicking

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
a great amount of speed now flatpicking

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.830 
a great amount of speed now flatpicking
still<00:01:48.950> has<00:01:49.160> its<00:01:49.340> purpose<00:01:49.729> if<00:01:49.940> I'm<00:01:50.300> looking<00:01:50.450> for

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
still has its purpose if I'm looking for

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.210 
still has its purpose if I'm looking for
a<00:01:50.869> good<00:01:51.080> amount<00:01:51.319> of<00:01:51.440> chunks<00:01:51.979> am<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.429> this<00:01:52.580> area

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
a good amount of chunks am in this area

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.320 
a good amount of chunks am in this area
flatpicking<00:01:55.220> is<00:01:55.489> going<00:01:55.610> to<00:01:55.670> be<00:01:55.759> a<00:01:55.789> great<00:01:55.970> sound

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
flatpicking is going to be a great sound

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.669 
flatpicking is going to be a great sound
for<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.690> but<00:01:56.869> any<00:01:56.989> time<00:01:57.140> you're<00:01:57.259> trying<00:01:57.530> to

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
for that but any time you're trying to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.919 
for that but any time you're trying to
achieve<00:01:57.830> great<00:01:58.399> amount<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.700> speed<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.630> you

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
achieve great amount of speed and you

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.389 
achieve great amount of speed and you
leave<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.200> pic<00:02:00.410> down<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:00.800> definitely<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.369> way

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
leave the pic down is definitely the way

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.190 
leave the pic down is definitely the way
to<00:02:01.520> go<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.270> leave<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:02.630> with<00:02:02.780> a<00:02:02.810> little<00:02:02.989> bit<00:02:03.140> of

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
to go so leave you with a little bit of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.109 
to go so leave you with a little bit of
leg<00:02:03.590> that<00:02:03.619> you<00:02:03.920> can<00:02:04.099> use<00:02:04.310> to<00:02:04.489> try<00:02:04.700> that<00:02:04.910> on<00:02:04.970> your

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
leg that you can use to try that on your
