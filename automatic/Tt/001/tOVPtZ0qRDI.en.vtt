blonde<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:30.720> started<00:00:31.109> getting<00:00:31.260> lighter<00:00:31.710> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
blonde so we started getting lighter and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.729 
blonde so we started getting lighter and
lighter<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.579> lighter<00:00:32.759> over<00:00:33.300> time<00:00:33.590> when<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
lighter and lighter over time when you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.790 
lighter and lighter over time when you
go<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.489> lighter<00:00:36.090> color<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.380> seems

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
go a lighter color like that it seems

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.970 
go a lighter color like that it seems
like<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:39.170> keeps<00:00:40.170> getting<00:00:40.500> lighter<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
like it just keeps getting lighter and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.779 
like it just keeps getting lighter and
so<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.149> felt<00:00:42.899> as<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.500> had<00:00:43.829> gotten<00:00:44.070> too<00:00:44.460> light

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
so I felt as if it had gotten too light

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.410 
so I felt as if it had gotten too light
so<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.149> wanted<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> go<00:00:45.870> back<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.890> towards<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so I wanted to go back more towards the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.209 
so I wanted to go back more towards the
ash<00:00:48.989> blonde<00:00:49.559> color<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.219> used<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:51.050> so

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
ash blonde color that I used to have so

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.090 
ash blonde color that I used to have so
since<00:00:53.219> Garnier<00:00:53.640> didn't<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.570> um<00:00:55.100> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
since Garnier didn't have one um I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
since Garnier didn't have one um I
decided<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.120> wanted<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> try<00:00:57.719> clairol

to<00:02:44.430> leave<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.730> in<00:02:44.850> extra<00:02:45.180> time<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.410> this

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
to leave it in extra time but in this

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.010 
to leave it in extra time but in this
case<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.820> freaked<00:02:48.210> out<00:02:48.420> about<00:02:48.750> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
case I was so freaked out about the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.260 
case I was so freaked out about the
color<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.560> was<00:02:49.740> seeing<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.340> my<00:02:50.580> hair<00:02:50.970> that

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
color that I was seeing in my hair that

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.540 
color that I was seeing in my hair that
I<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:53.270> washed<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.570> after<00:02:54.840> 20<00:02:55.440> minutes<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:56.010> was

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
I I washed it out after 20 minutes I was

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.160 
I I washed it out after 20 minutes I was
petrified<00:02:57.150> that<00:02:57.480> you<00:02:58.170> know<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.620> had<00:02:59.040> ruined<00:02:59.700> it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
petrified that you know I had ruined it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.150 
petrified that you know I had ruined it
so<00:03:01.170> um<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.900> didn't<00:03:04.380> end<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.650> coming<00:03:04.980> out

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
so um it didn't end up coming out

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.360 
so um it didn't end up coming out
magenta<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.930> was<00:03:07.290> really<00:03:07.620> surprised<00:03:08.070> that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
magenta and I was really surprised that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.120 
magenta and I was really surprised that
the<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.000> color<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.870> formula<00:03:10.260> because<00:03:11.010> it

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
the the color of the formula because it

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.440 
the the color of the formula because it
wasn't<00:03:11.460> like<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.790> when<00:03:11.940> i<00:03:12.000> used<00:03:12.300> to<00:03:12.420> use

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
wasn't like that when i used to use

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.540 
wasn't like that when i used to use
garnier<00:03:12.900> or<00:03:13.470> even<00:03:14.010> when<00:03:14.100> i<00:03:14.190> used<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.490> use

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
garnier or even when i used to use

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.090 
garnier or even when i used to use
l'oreal<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.930> never<00:03:16.290> seen<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:16.860> happen

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
l'oreal so I never seen that happen

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.690 
l'oreal so I never seen that happen
before<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.940> bite<00:03:18.240> thank<00:03:18.600> God<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.590> didn't<00:03:20.520> come

before I bite thank God it didn't come

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.580 
before I bite thank God it didn't come
out<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.060> color<00:03:21.270> that<00:03:21.540> was<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.050> bottom<00:03:22.230> cuz

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
out the color that was in the bottom cuz

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.990 
out the color that was in the bottom cuz
that's<00:03:22.770> not<00:03:22.950> what<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.130> was<00:03:23.250> gone<00:03:23.460> for<00:03:23.490> at<00:03:23.850> all

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
that being said though it did come out a

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.890 
that being said though it did come out a
lot<00:03:27.600> warmer<00:03:28.020> in<00:03:28.470> tone<00:03:28.800> then<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:30.180> wanted<00:03:30.780> I

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
talking about I used the urban decay

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.650 
talking about I used the urban decay
naked<00:03:46.860> palette<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:48.320> I<00:03:49.320> used<00:03:49.710> I<00:03:52.790> used<00:03:53.790> toast<00:03:54.390> it

on<00:03:55.440> my<00:03:55.740> lids<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.900> used<00:03:57.900> smog<00:03:58.730> whoop<00:03:59.730> smog<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:00.840> the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
on my lids I used smog whoop smog in the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.920 
on my lids I used smog whoop smog in the
crease<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.800> then<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:02.730> used<00:04:03.120> version<00:04:03.540> as<00:04:03.900> a

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
crease and then I used version as a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.350 
crease and then I used version as a
highlight<00:04:04.560> now<00:04:05.160> clearly<00:04:05.670> those<00:04:06.150> are<00:04:06.570> um<00:04:08.360> warm

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
highlight now clearly those are um warm

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.910 
highlight now clearly those are um warm
colors<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:11.660> see<00:04:12.660> how<00:04:12.990> they<00:04:13.170> sort<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.560> blend

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
colors and see how they sort of blend

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.880 
colors and see how they sort of blend
with<00:04:14.310> my<00:04:14.490> hair<00:04:14.760> color<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:17.310> wasn't<00:04:18.299> really

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
with my hair color so I wasn't really

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.470 
with my hair color so I wasn't really
you<00:04:19.890> know<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.040> wasn't<00:04:20.520> trying<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.940> do<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.120> warm

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
you know I wasn't trying to do a warm

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.450 
you know I wasn't trying to do a warm
tone<00:04:21.720> but<00:04:22.020> that's<00:04:22.200> what<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.590> ended<00:04:23.010> up<00:04:23.130> being

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
tone but that's what it ended up being

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.950 
tone but that's what it ended up being
this<00:04:23.700> is<00:04:23.880> certainly<00:04:24.210> not<00:04:24.450> cool<00:04:24.780> tone

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
this is certainly not cool tone

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.510 
this is certainly not cool tone
so<00:04:26.919> I'm<00:04:27.580> kind<00:04:27.940> of<00:04:28.090> disappointed<00:04:28.449> um<00:04:29.259> it<00:04:30.130> ended

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so I'm kind of disappointed um it ended

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.670 
so I'm kind of disappointed um it ended
up<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:31.060> depth<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.810> color<00:04:32.050> i<00:04:32.169> think<00:04:32.560> is

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
up the depth of the color i think is

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.040 
up the depth of the color i think is
pretty<00:04:32.889> much<00:04:33.130> what<00:04:33.340> i<00:04:33.370> was<00:04:33.610> going<00:04:33.819> for<00:04:33.940> but<00:04:34.479> the

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
pretty much what i was going for but the

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.860 
pretty much what i was going for but the
tone<00:04:35.319> is<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:36.039> warmer<00:04:36.759> than<00:04:36.940> what<00:04:37.210> i<00:04:37.270> intended

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
tone is is warmer than what i intended

over<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.120> cost<00:06:16.330> of<00:06:16.509> the<00:06:16.599> next<00:06:16.870> month<00:06:17.080> and<00:06:17.320> then

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
easy to go lighter and cooler when

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:33.390 
easy to go lighter and cooler when
