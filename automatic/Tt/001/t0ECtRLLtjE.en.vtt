Hello, it’s Ro! Welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies, today I got so many requests

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.240
for something Hello Kitty, and I’ve been
getting these requests for weeks, so

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.380
I was like, OK, before I start doing creepy
Halloween stuff, I’m gonna do something

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.439
Hello Kitty.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.380
Hello Kitty!

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.429
I went to Michaels and I found this really
cute Kitty cake pan, and I think it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.320
was like, $10, I’ll put a link below so
that you can go order it and check it

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.510
out if you’re interested. Da-na-new!

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.510
So today, we are gonna make a Hello Kitty
Cake!

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.710
The things that you’ll need today will be:
a big mixing bowl, electric beater, or

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.140
you can use a whisk, whatever you want, spatula,
1/3 cup of butter, a cup of water,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.300
3 eggs, I’m using yellow box cake mix, but
you can use any of your favorite recipes,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
just make sure that the cake mix doesn’t
have anything chunky like large chocolate

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.410
chips, or nuts, you want a very smooth cake
batter. Because we’re gonna be

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.220
using fondant. And Pam baking spray, but you
can use Crisco or anything else to

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.400
coat your pan.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.080
Let’s get started!

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.680
Once your batter is done you’re gonna preheat
the oven to 325, and you’re gonna bake

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.049
for about 35 minutes.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.229
We’re also going to grease the Hello Kitty baking
pan, make sure to get all the corners…

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.500
And then you’re just going to pour in a
bunch of batter!

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.070
Ahhhhhh, waterfall of batter!

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.470
And then we put it in the oven!

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.900
So, while that’s baking, fun fact, we got
a new piece of art in the kitchen,

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.479
you have to check it out!

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.079
Uh, my roommate Dodger ordered this, its 1
of her favorite artists, 2 hipster

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.060
Hobbits drinking coffee. I really like it
because her and I both really, really

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.479
like coffee, we’re from the Northwest so
we kind of love Starbucks, so…

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.479
And they’re both Hobbits, and we’re both
really small, so we’re like, it’s us!

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.440
And this ones saying, it comes in Venti, I’m
so getting one! So this is the new

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.260
fancy piece of art in the kitchen!

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.800
I was like, these walls look so bare, I used
to have Rosie the Riveter over here

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.590
but, uh, she fell off the wall. I think actually
Day9, I think he knocked it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.390
off the wall and it broke or something. I’m
not sure, it was on an episode of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.520
Nerdy Nummies, this is a dangerous wall.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.330
Cakes readys!

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.830
To decorate! I looks so cute! It came
out of the oven, make sure it’s had

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.520
plenty of time to cool, and then I took a
cake leveler and I leveled it so

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.620
that it’s all the same. And now we are going
to frost. I am using a vanilla

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.120
buttercream frosting. You want to use thick
and creamy frostings because they

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.980
really make the best substrate to lay fondant
on. The whipped are a little too

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.300
light and they kind of move around too much.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.440
And you’re just gonna take a glob and frost
the entire cake.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.810
Once your cake is completely frosted, it’s
time to roll out the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.110
white fondant and put it on top.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.660
I put the fondant on top of wax paper and
then I coated it with a little bit

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.500
of powdered sugar, so that the fondant doesn’t
stick to the table.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.080
Roll it over the top!

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.400
Boom!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.780
And then you’re just gonna go along the
sides of your cake. Push down, connecting

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.230
the fondant to the frosting. Then you go along
the edges and cut off the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.930
excess fondant. I’m using a little, uh,
roll-y cutter and going around.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.280
Ta-da! Here is the white fondant all on top
of the cake. And the next thing we’re

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.040
gonna do is make her red bow out of red fondant.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.340
Now I’m taking the red fondant, I’m gonna
roll it out,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.640
just a little, just a little bit. Just a little
bit!

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.140
Take a pinch of powdered sugar, just a little,
put it in the corner where the bow

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.620
is, because we’re gonna mold the fondant
to look just like the bow!

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.910
Give, give it a little pfft, pfft! Yeah, to
get the excess out of there.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.670
And in your face is the best, pfft, pfft!

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.770
Way to bake!

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.130
Pfft!

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.560
Now we’re gonna take the red fondant, we’re
just gonna press it in there, and then

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.400
what we’re gonna do is peel it up, and it
will have that mold in there,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.900
and then we’ll cut it out and put it on
the cake.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.800
Don’t worry if there’s powdered sugar
on top of you fondant, because you can just

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.460
take a paper towel and just brush it off,
because it’s just sugar, doesn’t matter,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.770
no big deal!

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.400
Now, the final decoration step, we’re just
gonna add a little bit of frosting for

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.760
her eyes, nose and whiskers!

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.900
Little kitty cat!

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.640
Ta-da! Here’s our Hello Kitty Cake! She’s
so cute! I love her big bow,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.980
yum-num-num-num-num!

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.420
Aw!

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.520
