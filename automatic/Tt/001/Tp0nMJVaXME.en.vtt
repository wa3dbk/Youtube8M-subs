a little<00:01:12.040> bit<00:01:12.189> of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
a little bit of

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.330 
a little bit of
distraction<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:15.050> we're<00:01:15.230> okay

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.420 

all<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.910> apparently<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.570> dude<00:01:25.430> just

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
all right so apparently this dude just

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.450 
all right so apparently this dude just
get<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:26.760> of<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.940> foot<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:31.130> says<00:01:32.130> if<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
get out of the foot here says if this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.450

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.990 

or<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:45.710> all<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.340> turns<00:01:47.550> out<00:01:47.790> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
or not all right so it turns out that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.420 
or not all right so it turns out that
for<00:01:48.750> whatever<00:01:48.900> reason<00:01:49.050> game<00:01:49.890> gave<00:01:50.160> me<00:01:50.190> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
for whatever reason game gave me the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
for whatever reason game gave me the
wrong<00:01:50.550> location<00:01:50.760> first<00:01:51.450> off<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.050> I<00:01:52.080> had<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
wrong location first off and I had to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.650 
wrong location first off and I had to
reset<00:01:52.620> the<00:01:52.800> assassination<00:01:53.610> target<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.450> now

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
reset the assassination target and now

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.390 
reset the assassination target and now
it's<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:55.229> sitting<00:01:55.440> us<00:01:55.620> to<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.830> real<00:01:56.010> HQ

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
it's actually sitting us to the real HQ

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.740 
it's actually sitting us to the real HQ
which<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> nuclear<00:01:56.910> power<00:01:57.330> plant<00:01:57.390> which<00:01:57.720> is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
which is a nuclear power plant which is

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.730 
which is a nuclear power plant which is
what<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.020> thought<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:58.880> a<00:02:00.260> little<00:02:01.260> exchange

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
what I thought it was a little exchange

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.170 
what I thought it was a little exchange
it<00:02:01.890> told<00:02:02.160> me<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> go<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> other

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it told me to go out in the other

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.750 
it told me to go out in the other
location<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.470> essentially<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.220> remember

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
location which essentially I remember

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.810 
location which essentially I remember
correctly<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.180> gang<00:02:06.570> activity<00:02:07.310> where<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
correctly a gang activity where the

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.660 
correctly a gang activity where the
Luchadors<00:02:09.390> maybe<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.080> don't<00:02:11.070> know<00:02:11.130> either<00:02:11.370> way

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
Luchadors maybe I don't know either way

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.690 
Luchadors maybe I don't know either way
