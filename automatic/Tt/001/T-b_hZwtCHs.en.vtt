00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hey mein is how you were welcome to 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.130
 a video for guys this time we 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.049
 we found inside the map with 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.590
 alternatives to the rest and then we are 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.120
 inside a 100% functional calculator 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.860
 boys is really something very cool 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.420
 so we'll start here you can see 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.449
 that on the sides we have torches and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.800
 for here a very rare pyramid 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.270
 so we have some signs 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.000
 We put to read says this calculator 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.439
 was created by playmaker remember 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.090
 that the playmaker channel will be in 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.740
 the execution of this video and it says yes 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.480
 you are making a noise of the map by 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.090
 please give me some credit that we're 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.469
 giving playmaker credit and says youtube and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 remember that your twitter is also in 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.829
 the description as well as the link 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.300
 download this super maps and that here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.239
 we have another says this took me around 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 of a week working 3 hours a day 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.399
 So here we have something that we 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.059
 it says of pedis all more of the pedestal 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.050
 of mathematics something like that not to be a 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 mark we have what are the digits 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.690
 guys out here to do something that is 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.770
 the first number which we have to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.500
 enter by this part simply 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.359
 voting what would be what would be a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.370
 little bit of sand so now that we have 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.739
 the directed ones that would be from 0 to 9 in 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.450
 total would be 10 here we have what 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.430
 are the signs that would be the most sign 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.140
 and the minus sign just in case we want 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 subtract or add and here we have what 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.799
 would be the second digit and home of the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.659
 same and then here what would come out 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.969
 results either less or its x 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.289
 top of the negative so no 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.030
 we want now mind is actually more 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.530
 so a super cool job and then for 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 here we have a hole which should 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.740
 work as spawn I suppose but good 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.979
 we appeared over there which is a 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.140
 small mistake so well we already have what 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.030
 which is number 6 of Malaga and then in 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.799
 This map I recommend you just in case 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.210
 they have an iphone 4 a ipod touch of 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.130
 fourth generation do not download it anymore 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.780
 that this causes the end , you will see 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.720
 end so now that we have the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.420
 digits we will put in the number 6 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.369
 we will be now 6 minus 9 so 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.360
 we choose our digit that is yes 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.310
 we put put a one area outside 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 difficult protection and let's put and here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.030
 can see what change is already changing 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.310
 you can see that we put 6 and then here to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.899
 I change the minus sign I did it very fast 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.459
 but good to the sign more forgiveness and 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.369
 would have changed the number 6 is in 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:07.590
 reality super excellent work 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.110
 Extraordinary orgasm of the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.940
 restÃ³n and here we have what it would be 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.849
 enter the next digit that in this 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.610
 case would be a 9 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.190
 because we do not put 6 + 4 that would give us 10 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.530
 so we put one that number 4 and 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.940
 Well, I would start to draw what is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.580
 result over here so I'll start what 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.840
 that of the or because it is a relax so 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.140
 we put here you and you can see that 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.160
 will begin to go down we have the number zero 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.720
 we have number one and so 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.910
 successively until number nine well 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.260
 that all three and four and here 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.849
 it would come out what is the result so 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.930
 prepare for the garlic since I'm going to 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.700
 try before but good had to 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.670
 share it so in a few moments 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.769
 will start what is the lowered gravel 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.410
 and then you can see the image as it is 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:52.220
 it works so why do not they go down because 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.640
 does not go down and so I think it should start 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:01.290
 I put 6 plus 4 and not sum to me ok 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.590
 are already thinking but see it 0 and the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.000
 1 this is actually surprised guys 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.440
 now I did not have so much lan because then I did not 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.630
 had to go down so much but then in 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.970
 amazing reality a super mega map 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.440
 hyper great to be downloaded in 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.599
 serious is super cool and then now 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.850
 we will go out to what it is to see everything that is 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.410
 this mechanism that would be with signs 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.350
 with cactus and so many things more than 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.490
 they are used to do it 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.830
 alternatives to redstone so let's 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:27.290
 the bottom part and good here we have 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.150
 what is all the work behind this 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.440
 great thing they see that we have all the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.120
 numbers that touch us just in case 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.310
 We raise the 5 and it is a job of 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.650
 day as he says three hours a day like this 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.780
 that in this and here we have a source 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.790
 very strange that looks like witchcraft and we 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.960
 then this would be all sailors there 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.670
 liked do not forget to give you there 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.380
 subscribe and share it on your networks 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.090
 ares remember that the goal is 12 thousand 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.110
 magners at this moment we are I think that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.280
 I do not know how many I think 11,624 what 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.690
 which is very energetic woke up after 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.980
 Yesterday you can not upload video 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.050
 because I had a family event and 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.400
 then you can not then a thousand apologies and 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.140
 Well tomorrow we will have another 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.460
 video like this except on Sunday and 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.410
 that on Sundays and it makes me almost 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.300
 impossible and it is a video the days 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.800
 Sunday is because it would be an extra video and 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.840
 it's because we love each other then these two 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.220
 guys remember the hi I think it's 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.720
 nothing and can go through the channel of 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.220
 creator who was very epic then 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.990
 that 's all we'll see you in the next 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.990
 thanks for seeing you goodbye
