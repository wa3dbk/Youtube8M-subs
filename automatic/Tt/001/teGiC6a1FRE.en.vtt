00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.030
 George 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.729
 but I think the Milan in these two 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.399
 years had the misfortune of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.640
 meeting a great juventus will be a 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.500
 match between two teams that will try 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.939
 also this year to be protagonists 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.939
 to win 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.399
 and even today I think he put a 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.520
 negative record because we took goals 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:55.400
 after 20 seconds 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:58.490
 on the first shot on goal as far as the 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.570
 team like Milan is never the beginning 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:06.070
 that one is tv is hosting this shot 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.170
 I have to kill whoever we are 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.130
 put in a good mood 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.330
 we started playing 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.940
 to break even and then to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.040
 to spread in the second half though 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.560
 may in the end there was a moment of 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.030
 leave but why we took this 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.450
 goal that certainly could be 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.450
 avoided 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.580
 first of all we hope to arrive with 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.260
 two goals ahead of Milan 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:06.400
 like the pact with Bologna and Turin 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:08.470
 because it would already have been a good basis 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.600
 a great group reaction and it is 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.120
 arrived a victory that allows us to 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.860
 get to this stop for sure 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.890
 so many many more positive things than 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.890
 negative
