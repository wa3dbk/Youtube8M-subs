the<00:01:16.500> CMYK<00:01:17.360> you'll<00:01:18.360> notice<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.350> those

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
the CMYK you'll notice we can see those

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.450 
the CMYK you'll notice we can see those
that<00:01:19.770> redundant<00:01:20.250> spot<00:01:20.520> colors<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.430> a

that redundant spot colors this is a

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.280 
that redundant spot colors this is a
very<00:01:23.550> obvious<00:01:24.210> problem<00:01:24.630> since<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.080> end

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
very obvious problem since we will end

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.570 
very obvious problem since we will end
up<00:01:25.470> with<00:01:25.500> extra<00:01:26.100> plates<00:01:28.190> to<00:01:29.190> correct<00:01:29.460> this

up with extra plates to correct this

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.520 
up with extra plates to correct this
issue<00:01:29.760> we<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.420> add<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.660> ink<00:01:30.810> remapping<00:01:31.110> step

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
issue we will add an ink remapping step

issue we will add an ink remapping step
within<00:01:31.770> our<00:01:32.010> workflow<00:01:33.260> I'm<00:01:34.260> going<00:01:34.620> to<00:01:34.770> edit

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
within our workflow I'm going to edit

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.170 
within our workflow I'm going to edit
the<00:01:35.159> existing<00:01:35.280> workflow<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.390> job

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.060 

and<00:01:41.300> I'm<00:01:41.510> going<00:01:41.870> to<00:01:41.900> add<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.560> ink<00:01:42.710> remapping

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
and I'm going to add the ink remapping

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.790 
and I'm going to add the ink remapping
step<00:01:43.900> I'm<00:01:44.900> going<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.110> place<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.320> after

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
step I'm going to place it after

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.150 
step I'm going to place it after
pre-flight<00:01:47.140> there<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.260> nothing<00:01:48.410> to<00:01:48.560> configure

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
pre-flight there is nothing to configure

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.220 
pre-flight there is nothing to configure
and<00:01:49.340> then<00:01:49.490> the<00:01:49.610> ink<00:01:49.730> remapping<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.140> a

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
and then the ink remapping it's just a

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.170 
and then the ink remapping it's just a
pause<00:01:51.440> point<00:01:51.860> from<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.160> workflow<00:01:52.580> so<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.120> we

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
pause point from the workflow so that we

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.760 
pause point from the workflow so that we
can<00:01:53.330> access<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.840> inquiry<00:01:54.050> mapping<00:01:54.410> tool<00:01:56.770> when

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
I close the workflow configuration it'll

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.100 
I close the workflow configuration it'll
automatically<00:02:00.830> recycle<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.580> job<00:02:02.020> send<00:02:03.020> it

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
automatically recycle the job send it

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.440 
automatically recycle the job send it
through<00:02:03.140> pre-flight<00:02:03.800> and<00:02:03.979> then<00:02:04.760> pause<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:05.300> ink

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
through pre-flight and then pause at ink

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.410 
through pre-flight and then pause at ink
remapping<00:02:06.040> now<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:07.430> can<00:02:07.670> access<00:02:07.880> my<00:02:08.240> ink

want to convert to CMYK to do so I just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.960 
want to convert to CMYK to do so I just
check<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:48.410> box<00:02:48.440> and<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.459> will<00:02:49.580> use<00:02:49.760> the
