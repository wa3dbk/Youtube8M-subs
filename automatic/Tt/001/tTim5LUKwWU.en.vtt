00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.250
 today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.180
 how to download music so 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.460
 extract music from CDs with the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.489
 windows media player 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 but this time under windows xp 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.899
 and yes because the xp version and the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.550
 seven version are not the same at last 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.469
 are not are it's the same thing 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.219
 they do the same function but they do not 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.450
 are not presented the same so for 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.510
 start let's go to the menu 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.309
 start and so in the name after that's true 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.360
 that it depends finally we will go when 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.860
 even in the start menu for you 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.469
 show so you are in every 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.660
 programs and you 're going to search so 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.390
 an accessory I think accessories and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.740
 entertainment here you are at the state 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 entertainment and you will find 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.799
 so the windows media player you 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.979
 click on it and throw it and the 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.979
 here is 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.570
 so there he will charge he will normally 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:31.930
 put me the cd I inserted 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:37.360
 for this demonstration if he wants 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:43.070
 go fast please 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:46.580
 So here it is rather atmosphere the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:52.180
 hugh laurie talk the american actor 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:56.750
 who interprets so dr house for 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.070
 extract the music from this cd so there they 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:05.710
 ask me for an update I do not do 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.710
 not you are copied from a cd 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.319
 click on it and you have the titles 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.240
 that they appear so we go 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:25.060
 keep anyway to take the title 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.860
 the title of the aib we will keep so 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.870
 we know we all sections and we 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.150
 try it's all here to go more 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.190
 quickly and we select only the title that 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.530
 we are therefore interested in this case let 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.740
 them talk 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.010
 once this one effect you can 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.460
 to copy the music so you do 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.460
 to copy 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.150
 and 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.690
 normally if all goes well I mean well 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.690
 if all goes well 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.020
 here 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.020
 the extraction begins to be done so there 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.110
 it'll be long I'll rope it will 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.100
 to be very long so in the meantime I'm going 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.100
 pause 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.599
 here 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.129
 so the cd is now finally the title 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:24.150
 that we chose for this 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:28.739
 demonstration was transferred he was 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.510
 investigated copying was extracted us 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.519
 can now assert the reader 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.569
 windows media 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:38.519
 so we will go now 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:43.530
 in my documents were going into the 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:48.530

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:51.209
