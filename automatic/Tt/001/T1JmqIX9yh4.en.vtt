00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.700 

that's<00:05:36.100> how<00:05:36.220> he's<00:05:36.400> going<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:36.670> water<00:05:37.560> with<00:05:38.560> his

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
that's how he's going to water with his

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:48.470 
that's how he's going to water with his
weed<00:05:38.980> killer<00:05:44.610> and<00:05:45.610> head<00:05:45.910> up<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.180> kitchen<00:05:46.630> I

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
weed killer and head up to the kitchen I

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.610 
weed killer and head up to the kitchen I
probably<00:05:49.480> could<00:05:49.720> have<00:05:49.750> put<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.080> banana<00:05:50.380> peel

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
probably could have put the banana peel

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.850 
probably could have put the banana peel
here<00:05:51.040> and<00:05:51.250> maybe<00:05:51.400> a<00:05:52.140> little<00:05:53.140> quicker<00:05:53.470> with<00:05:53.710> his

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
here and maybe a little quicker with his

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:09.150 
here and maybe a little quicker with his
next<00:05:54.190> trick<00:06:07.470> okay<00:06:08.470> so<00:06:08.530> he's<00:06:08.770> got<00:06:08.890> to<00:06:08.920> go<00:06:09.070> and

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
next trick okay so he's got to go and

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.370 
next trick okay so he's got to go and
brush<00:06:09.340> his<00:06:09.400> teeth<00:06:09.700> yeah<00:06:10.270> obviously<00:06:10.900> if<00:06:11.260> I'd

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
brush his teeth yeah obviously if I'd

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.220 
brush his teeth yeah obviously if I'd
put<00:06:11.530> the<00:06:11.650> banana<00:06:11.980> here<00:06:12.810> we<00:06:13.810> wouldn't<00:06:13.990> have<00:06:14.140> to

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.230 
put the banana here we wouldn't have to

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.480 
put the banana here we wouldn't have to
sit<00:06:14.440> through<00:06:14.470> this<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:17.350> there's<00:06:18.070> a<00:06:18.160> shoe

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
sit through this and there's a shoe

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:32.780 
sit through this and there's a shoe
brush<00:06:26.670> we<00:06:27.670> might<00:06:28.000> have<00:06:28.030> timed<00:06:28.510> it<00:06:28.690> better<00:06:28.870> to

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.730 

with<00:06:33.790> the<00:06:33.910> banana<00:06:34.150> peel<00:06:34.560> because<00:06:35.560> I<00:06:35.710> don't

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
with the banana peel because I don't

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.420 
with the banana peel because I don't
think<00:06:36.100> we<00:06:36.190> got<00:06:36.220> all<00:06:37.470> got<00:06:38.470> the<00:06:38.590> maximum<00:06:39.040> points

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
think we got all got the maximum points

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.750 
think we got all got the maximum points
by<00:06:39.610> letting<00:06:39.940> this<00:06:40.080> banana<00:06:41.080> peel<00:06:41.380> rest<00:06:42.370> here

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
by letting this banana peel rest here

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:51.390 
by letting this banana peel rest here
for<00:06:42.790> so<00:06:43.150> long<00:06:48.390> but<00:06:49.390> we'll<00:06:49.540> see<00:06:49.750> I<00:06:50.250> think<00:06:51.250> all

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
for so long but we'll see I think all

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:59.950 
for so long but we'll see I think all
we've<00:06:51.550> got<00:06:51.700> to<00:06:51.790> do<00:06:51.880> is<00:06:52.000> get<00:06:52.120> like<00:06:52.360> 50<00:06:52.750> percent

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:07.809 

and<00:07:00.710> there<00:07:00.919> we<00:07:01.130> go<00:07:01.280> ninety-four<00:07:01.880> percent<00:07:06.819> yeah

00:07:07.809 --> 00:07:07.819 
and there we go ninety-four percent yeah

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.409 
and there we go ninety-four percent yeah
mitten<00:07:08.330> that<00:07:08.449> last<00:07:08.720> six<00:07:09.560> percent<00:07:10.009> was<00:07:10.849> if<00:07:11.180> we

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:11.419 
mitten that last six percent was if we

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.210 
mitten that last six percent was if we
time<00:07:11.810> that<00:07:12.050> banana<00:07:12.349> peel<00:07:12.590> just<00:07:12.860> a<00:07:12.919> little<00:07:13.099> bit
