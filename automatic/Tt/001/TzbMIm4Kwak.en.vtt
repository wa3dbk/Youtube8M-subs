00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 i 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:14.020
 now let's see how we can make one 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.910
 to combat the 'absolute tuta' the 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.949
 'tuta absoluta' is a micro moth that 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.539
 acts normally at night of the short 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.910
 biological cycle and high power 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.919
 pay in a year or so I can 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.900
 turn on hundreds of generations are more 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.429
 or less than 16 meters in length and 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.650
 remain negative during the day 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.929
 hidden among the leaves and life 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.680
 average of these micro moths is 6 to 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.570
 10 days the males and 15 days and they are 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.670
 causing great damage in the sun 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.530
 days and more specifically especially in 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.570
 the tomato although it can also affect 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.769
 the aubergine or the potato we are going to see 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.750
 how can we make a ginger tea 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.570
 to fight them for our you 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.160
 we will use 50 grams of ginger powder 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.079
 or if we have no option or not 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.969
 we found in the supermarket with some 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.769
 ginger roots that we can buy 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.149
 also in supermarket or we can 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.649
 plant with us I leave you for the 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.809
 community of how we can plant 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.129
 our ginger roots if not what 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.199
 we get in powder is going to touch us 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.120
 scratch the ginger roots with a 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.800
 grater we can go scratching our root 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.610
 of ginger until you get 50 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.410
 grams more 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.450
 although as I say it is much more 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.500
 interesting to get it in powder and it 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.330
 You can get in any 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.250
 let's forget a liter and a half 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.630
 of water with a rosemary leaf as 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.340
 you see here that will help us to 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.200
 our tea when I get to this point 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.090
 when the water is boiling already when 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.620
 is coming out these little bubbles what 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.110
 let's do is stop the fire and 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.000
 let it stand 45 minutes before 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.590
 add the ginger the beginning of this 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.540
 tea is very simple and because it is based on 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.370
 the ginger because the ginger contains 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.229
 a substance that is called jÃ­ber zinc 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.120
 I will not leave it in the description of 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.890
 video how it is written that affects the 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.140
 larvae of the tuta and scare away 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.050
 we add them and remove 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.850
 the mixture very well if we have some 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.740
 group as we see here we will try it 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.840
 remove with the spoon removing everything 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.850
 very well once we have finished 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.710
 remove and remove all groups is very 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.780
 important to cover well because the oil 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.520
 essential ginger is very volatile 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.580
 so we cover it, let it rest 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.950
 for 24 hours after 24 hours 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.080
 we uncover and we are going to add 6 grams of 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.060
 soy lecithin soy cystine 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.670
 we can buy granulated or in tablets 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.930
 and we are adding it we add 6 grams 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.670
 that will help us fix 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.590
 active ginger let's go 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.209
 stirring every bit during the 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.519
 next half hour meanwhile what 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.409
 let's let it rest and this is going to 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.329
 help fix the active principle of 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.040
 ginger go to the half hour we're going 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:29.290
 to strain to remove the remains of the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.420
 discipline of soybeans and rosemary and so 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.889
 we only have the tea to apply 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.260
 in our plants we will mix in 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:37.500
 our sprayer a part of the tea of 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.500
 ginger 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.640
 and four parts of water 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.340
 perfect we close and we're going to apply 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.200
 about our tomatoes we will apply this 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
 tea to the whole crop we will try to spray 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.190
 all parts of the plant from the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.640
 leaves to the stem even to the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.710
 fruit and we are going to repeat this process a 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.300
 once every seven days this works for you 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.640
 better preventive than if we already have 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.590
 installed the plague so take advantage if 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.880
 you still do not have the right to apply it 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.560
 we have already seen how simple it is 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.360
 prepare our have ginger for 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.670
 fight the absolute tuta or the moth 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.710
 of the tomato if we had something left over 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.090
 of tea we would have made besides we can 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.700
 store it in a closed bottle 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.110
 hermetically in a shady place 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.370
 and nothing you already know that you liked the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.900
 video I could do now I like me 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.160
 you can comment what you want and 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.570
 subscribe to the channel if you are not 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.190
 subscribed that we always put things here 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.810
 interesting about plants and about 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.810
 orchards until the next video
