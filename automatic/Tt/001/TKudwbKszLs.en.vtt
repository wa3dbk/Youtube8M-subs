00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 from today 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.660
 today I come with a video that is a 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.850
 food that with me or a rule that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.470
 with me I do not know how they like it more than 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 call the day 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.470
 and it's because today is the premiere the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 avengers the avengers and I'll go to 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.610
 cinema with my boyfriend 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.989
 then it looks like a very good idea 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.690
 show them as if always 6 pepillo 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.550
 it came when I'm going to go out like in a 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.440
 occasion like the one we go to the movies and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.420
 good 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.629
 Come with me to see how beautiful that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.300
 I have adomis cristito as a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.860
 rent with an arrangement in the nails that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 I want here I am not very hot nor so 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.489
 so so cute 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.170
 I think it's like an option as very 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.269
 simple truth do not delay me more than 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.670
 five minutes ink did not I the then 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:07.560
 it is something like very casual but I think 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.259
 that if they want something more from the front 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.670
 elaborated then do it in advance 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.030
 before and I thought that 's how I 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.700
 understand today then 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.610
 Accompany me to fix I'll start with 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.580
 the makeup and wants to be to use the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.670
 I'm going to put this in the area 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.800
 of the dark circles on the forehead is the cullen 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.649
 lips good I'm like it lit up 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.610
 enough parts of my face and now 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.979
 I'm going to mix with the base that from the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.130
 tone of my skin as they realized 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.140
 do not blur the concealer until 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.530
 apply the base so that everything is mixed 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.530
 very well 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 now I'm going to make up my eyebrows using 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.960
 a shadow that makes my eyebrows 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.890
 see natural color and they will not be so 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.890
 so makeup 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.709
 I'm going to put a bit of illuminator in the 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:19.890
 eyelids so that the shadow that now 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.069
 go to put fix all day 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.180
 I'm going to put some orange shadow on 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.180
 the mobile eyelid 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.490
 and a shade more coffee if it is in the arc 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.490
 of our eyelids 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.170
 now I'm going to blur it very well for 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.000
 you see a single color in a mixture 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.190
 pied 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.260
 I put false eyelashes because to me 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.170
 I like what the eyes look like when I use 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.030
 eyelashes and I'll hide them a little 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.030
 with the help of a liquid eyeliner 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.470
 now I'm going to put a little blush on the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.780
 area of â€‹â€‹the cheeks and near the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.090
 I'm also going to mix my 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.820
 eyelashes using lash on the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.860
 false eyelashes and in the true ones and not 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.160
 I forgot to make up the eyelashes of 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.160
 down 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.709
 Now I'm going to use a lipstick you can use 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.420
 the lipstick that you want most and so that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.780
 I will last you all day what I will do 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.390
 put some powder or shadows with 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.620
 a shadow applicator and this will make 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.470
 the vial lasts all day 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.180
 here apply a purple shadow so that 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.180
 the lips look more purple 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.910
 for the hairstyle what you want is to put 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.670
 a little heat protector on the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.030
 hair and well do not touch on the 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.800
 dryer that I did not show you here but 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.459
 now after it's dry my 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:18.680
 hair I'm going to use the iron and with it 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.680
 I will make some very loose waves 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.830
 maybe at the beginning it is difficult for you 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.200
 do it but nothing you miss trying 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.090
 between the front of a mirror so that 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.650
 You yourself can see how the 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.650
 waves and that you're not going to burn 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.820
 and that's how the hair is going to be 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.760
 with the makeup I did not want to be a 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.300
 most weird and good hairstyle my outfit 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.340
 today is the avengers t-shirt a jean 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.340
 a pair of jeans in blue jeans 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.610
 and some drops as well as very cowgirls 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.159
 I love 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.770
 I also wanted to paint my nails and what 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.460
 did it was on the ring finger to put enamel 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.460
 White 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.770
 and on the other nails blue glaze and 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.300
 frost enamel 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.460
 when the enamels the things of ccoo what 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.530
 What I did was make a blue line in the 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.530
 center of the nail horizontally 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.110
 and some vertical lines also of 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:36.689
 blue color this trying to mimic 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.689
 a little captain america hat 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:40.139
 ah 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.629
 and I made a little triangle to make 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.629
 the letter of america 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.320
 then he hopes that it stays very well 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.240
 finish decorating the other nails for 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.480
 to be seen in more vivid colors and 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.610
 apply a transparent enamel base 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.440
 to make it more durable the 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.440
 enamel tea picking nails 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.440
 and that's how my dreams were 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:26.030
