25 D which can be run at 115 or 130
volts<00:00:37.410> AC<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.520> can<00:00:38.879> support<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> 3

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
volts AC it can support up to 3

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.970 
volts AC it can support up to 3
horsepower<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.410> you<00:00:40.500> will<00:00:40.680> need<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
horsepower but you will need that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.529 
horsepower but you will need that
heatsink<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.820> see<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.360> left

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
heatsink you can see over on the left

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.330 
heatsink you can see over on the left
and<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.440> only<00:00:43.559> problem<00:00:43.829> with<00:00:44.010> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
and the only problem with this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.880 
and the only problem with this
controller<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.690> runs<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.110> either<00:00:46.350> 90

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
controller is that it runs in either 90

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.930 
controller is that it runs in either 90
volt<00:00:47.039> or<00:00:47.219> 180<00:00:47.910> volt<00:00:48.210> mode<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:49.440> motor<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.489> think

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
volt or 180 volt mode the motor I think

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.930 
volt or 180 volt mode the motor I think
is<00:00:51.059> 100<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.840> either<00:00:52.020> 130<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.770> 135<00:00:53.250> volts

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
is 100 and it's either 130 or 135 volts

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.959 
is 100 and it's either 130 or 135 volts
so<00:00:54.570> what<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> haven't<00:00:55.859> done<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.730> be

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
so what I haven't done but what can be

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.180 
so what I haven't done but what can be
done<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.750> set<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:57.989> at<00:00:58.199> 90<00:00:58.620> volts<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.010> then

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
done is to set it at 90 volts and then

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.689 
done is to set it at 90 volts and then
using<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:01.530> pots<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.340> bottom<00:01:02.519> of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
using the the pots down at the bottom of

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.490 
using the the pots down at the bottom of
the<00:01:02.789> controller<00:01:03.090> those<00:01:03.329> white<00:01:03.570> ones<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.290> can

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the controller those white ones you can

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.680 
the controller those white ones you can
adjust<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> voltage<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.150> more<00:01:06.360> speed<00:01:06.630> out

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
adjust the voltage to get more speed out

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.170 
adjust the voltage to get more speed out
of<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.260> done<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.530> yet

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180

it's<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.460> two<00:02:05.670> ceramic<00:02:06.530> fuses<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it's just the two ceramic fuses and I

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.680 
it's just the two ceramic fuses and I
bought<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> couple<00:02:08.700> extra<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.509> saw

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
bought a couple extra I think you saw

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.170 
bought a couple extra I think you saw

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
four in the previous shot that way if I

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.150 
four in the previous shot that way if I
ever<00:02:12.270> blow<00:02:12.660> these<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.770> more

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
ever blow these I have more

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.460 
ever blow these I have more
on<00:02:14.280> hand<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.990> because<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.080> ended<00:02:16.260> up<00:02:16.320> getting

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
on hand and because I ended up getting

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.140 
on hand and because I ended up getting
him<00:02:16.680> from<00:02:16.890> McMaster<00:02:17.370> did<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.850> already<00:02:17.940> say<00:02:18.060> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
him from McMaster did I already say that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.000 
him from McMaster did I already say that
and<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> didn't<00:02:18.960> want<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.350> wait<00:02:19.560> I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
and so I didn't want to have to wait I

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.950 
and so I didn't want to have to wait I

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960

what<00:02:27.660> I'm<00:02:27.780> pointing<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.080> here<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.670> fused

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
what I'm pointing to here is the fused

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.760 
what I'm pointing to here is the fused
incoming<00:02:33.030> AC<00:02:33.270> line<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.140> then<00:02:34.260> there's<00:02:34.500> the

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
incoming AC line and then there's the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.500 
incoming AC line and then there's the
second<00:02:35.250> line<00:02:35.460> so<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:35.940> is<00:02:36.090> where<00:02:36.300> you'll

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
second line so this is where you'll

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.440 
second line so this is where you'll
bring<00:02:36.840> your<00:02:37.320> power<00:02:37.830> from<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> wall<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.850> then

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
bring your power from the wall and then

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.650 
bring your power from the wall and then
these<00:02:39.840> two<00:02:40.110> terminals<00:02:40.500> are<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.190> DC<00:02:41.660> lines

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
these two terminals are the DC lines

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.460 
these two terminals are the DC lines
that<00:02:42.960> you'll<00:02:43.080> take<00:02:43.380> up<00:02:43.740> to<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.700> motor<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
that you'll take up to the motor the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.200 
that you'll take up to the motor the
last<00:02:46.740> thing<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.100> needs<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.550> be<00:02:47.640> done<00:02:47.850> our

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
last thing that needs to be done our

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.720 
last thing that needs to be done our
jumpers<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.830> see<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.160> first<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:50.610> is

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
jumpers so you can see this first one is

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.510 
jumpers so you can see this first one is
the<00:02:50.760> 230<00:02:51.390> or<00:02:51.720> 115<00:02:52.470> volt<00:02:52.710> jumper<00:02:53.010> I've<00:02:53.190> got<00:02:53.370> mine

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
the 230 or 115 volt jumper I've got mine

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.150 
the 230 or 115 volt jumper I've got mine
already<00:02:53.760> set<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.030> 230<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.720> then<00:02:55.350> here<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
already set to 230 and then here is the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.280 
already set to 230 and then here is the
tach<00:02:56.550> 90<00:02:57.240> 180<00:02:58.760> output<00:02:59.760> jumper<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.780> right<00:03:01.140> now

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
tach 90 180 output jumper and right now

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.620 
tach 90 180 output jumper and right now
it's<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.770> 180<00:03:02.190> position<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.880> mistakingly

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
it's in the 180 position I mistakingly

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.280 
it's in the 180 position I mistakingly
moved<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.260> over<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.480> T<00:03:06.480> position<00:03:06.810> which

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
moved this over to the T position which

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.440 
moved this over to the T position which
is<00:03:07.470> not<00:03:07.500> right<00:03:08.070> it<00:03:08.340> needs<00:03:08.520> to<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.060> 90

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
is not right it needs to be on the 90

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.980 
is not right it needs to be on the 90
volt<00:03:09.630> position<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.350> my<00:03:10.560> motor<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.630> I'll<00:03:12.630> show

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
volt position for my motor and I'll show

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.320 
volt position for my motor and I'll show
you<00:03:13.050> where<00:03:13.260> I've<00:03:13.380> got<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:13.680> fixed<00:03:14.070> in<00:03:14.340> this

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
you where I've got that fixed in this

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.990 
you where I've got that fixed in this
last<00:03:15.570> shot<00:03:15.780> here<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.800> is<00:03:16.920> mounted<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.640> can<00:03:17.820> see

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
last shot here it is mounted you can see

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.150 
last shot here it is mounted you can see
the<00:03:18.120> two<00:03:18.270> AC<00:03:18.480> lines<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.200> two<00:03:19.350> DC<00:03:19.709> lines<00:03:19.920> over

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
the two AC lines the two DC lines over

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.120 
the two AC lines the two DC lines over
on<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.370> right<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:21.180> three<00:03:21.630> black<00:03:22.530> wires<00:03:22.860> at

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
on the right the three black wires at

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.380 
on the right the three black wires at
the<00:03:23.160> bottom<00:03:23.520> left<00:03:23.820> those<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.300> the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
the bottom left those go to the

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.300 
the bottom left those go to the
potentiometer<00:03:25.200> you'll<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.800> have<00:03:25.950> to<00:03:26.040> figure

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
potentiometer you'll just have to figure

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.640 
potentiometer you'll just have to figure
that<00:03:26.400> out<00:03:26.550> on<00:03:26.790> your<00:03:26.970> own<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:28.020> you<00:03:28.230> mess<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.590> up

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
that out on your own if you mess it up

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.440 
that out on your own if you mess it up
you're<00:03:28.830> not<00:03:28.950> going<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> ruin<00:03:29.430> anything<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.150> if

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
you're not going to ruin anything so if

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.660 
you're not going to ruin anything so if
you<00:03:30.810> turn<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.170> pot<00:03:31.350> up<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.920> your<00:03:32.130> motor<00:03:32.310> gets

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
you turn the pot up and your motor gets

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.630 
you turn the pot up and your motor gets
slower<00:03:32.940> you've<00:03:33.360> wired<00:03:33.570> it<00:03:33.750> backwards<00:03:34.430> for<00:03:35.430> now

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
slower you've wired it backwards for now

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.830 
slower you've wired it backwards for now
I've<00:03:36.090> simply<00:03:36.570> mounted<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:38.840> plastic

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
I've simply mounted this to a plastic

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.080 
I've simply mounted this to a plastic
lid<00:03:40.560> which<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:41.010> screwed<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.520> underside<00:03:42.060> of

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
lid which is screwed to the underside of

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.050 
lid which is screwed to the underside of
my<00:03:42.420> mill<00:03:43.200> stand<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.860> then<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.459> drilled<00:03:44.790> some

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
my mill stand and then I drilled some

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
doing that because it hasn't really been

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.199

a priority I have the enclosure I have a
lot<00:04:18.480> of<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.780> hardware<00:04:19.440> accessories<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.820> for

lot of the hardware accessories so for
now<00:04:21.540> this<00:04:21.989> works<00:04:22.229> just<00:04:22.440> fine<00:04:22.650> it's<00:04:23.039> kind<00:04:23.220> of

now this works just fine it's kind of

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.440 
now this works just fine it's kind of
trashy<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.000> keeps<00:04:24.150> us<00:04:24.300> from

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
trashy but it keeps us from

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.840 
trashy but it keeps us from
electrocuting<00:04:25.050> ourselves<00:04:25.610> anyway<00:04:26.610> that's<00:04:26.760> it

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850
