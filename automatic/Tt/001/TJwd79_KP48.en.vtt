to<00:02:28.700> control<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.150> air<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:35.320> lobe<00:02:36.320> is

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
to control that air so that that lobe is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.380 
to control that air so that that lobe is
the<00:02:36.770> first<00:02:37.040> thing<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.310> inflates<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.270> then

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
the first thing that inflates and then

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.320 
the first thing that inflates and then
this<00:02:40.660> lobe<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.140> second<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.800> inflates

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.510 

and<00:02:48.070> then<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.220> last<00:02:49.460> lobe<00:02:50.800> okay<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.100> that's

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
and then the last lobe okay and that's

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.790 
and then the last lobe okay and that's
what<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.940> want<00:02:53.210> right<00:02:53.600> there<00:02:53.960> I'm<00:02:54.380> gonna<00:02:54.590> go

we're gonna split it in half and we're

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.340 
we're gonna split it in half and we're
gonna<00:03:23.270> place<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.860> right<00:03:24.860> here<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:26.020> this<00:03:27.020> is

going to tie we're going to tie this

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.550 
going to tie we're going to tie this
together<00:03:32.810> around<00:03:33.590> those<00:03:33.920> 5<00:03:34.910> inch<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:36.050> 5<00:03:36.320> inch

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
together around those 5 inch the 5 inch

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.210 
together around those 5 inch the 5 inch
round<00:03:36.890> so<00:03:37.760> go<00:03:37.940> ahead<00:03:38.240> and<00:03:38.450> tie<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:42.980> like

kind of rotate this so that this is the

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.610 
kind of rotate this so that this is the
center

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
center

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.560 
center
at<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.830> top<00:04:15.069> Center<00:04:15.580> and<00:04:15.790> what<00:04:16.269> you're<00:04:16.419> going

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
to do is we're going to inflate this cuz

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.190 
to do is we're going to inflate this cuz
that's<00:04:22.540> gonna<00:04:22.750> be<00:04:23.020> your<00:04:23.230> ear<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:26.080> you're

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200

that's gonna be your ear and you're
gonna<00:04:26.320> make<00:04:26.560> a<00:04:26.590> loop<00:04:26.950> about<00:04:27.880> like<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:29.220> go

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
gonna make a loop about like that go

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.510 
gonna make a loop about like that go
ahead<00:04:30.520> and<00:04:30.700> tie<00:04:31.450> that<00:04:31.480> off<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.380> then<00:04:33.190> you<00:04:33.220> can

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
ahead and tie that off and then you can

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.030 
ahead and tie that off and then you can
tie<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:34.150> this<00:04:34.300> other<00:04:34.570> this<00:04:35.380> other<00:04:35.620> piece

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
tie it to this other this other piece

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.340 
tie it to this other this other piece
that's<00:04:36.550> here<00:04:37.330> go<00:04:37.660> ahead<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.669> tie<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.350> once

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
that's here go ahead and tie that once

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:52.020 
that's here go ahead and tie that once
and<00:04:42.070> twice<00:04:44.400> we'll<00:04:45.400> clean<00:04:45.700> that<00:04:45.729> up<00:04:50.669> okay<00:04:51.669> so

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
and twice we'll clean that up okay so

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:01.379 
and twice we'll clean that up okay so
this<00:04:52.270> then<00:04:53.040> splits<00:04:54.990> comes<00:04:55.990> down<00:04:56.290> here<00:04:59.700> and<00:05:00.700> so

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
this then splits comes down here and so

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:11.070 
this then splits comes down here and so
now<00:05:01.600> you<00:05:01.660> have<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.729> ears<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:04.180> your<00:05:04.210> horse<00:05:10.080> and
