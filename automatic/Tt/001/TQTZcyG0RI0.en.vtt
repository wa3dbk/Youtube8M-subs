00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
lot for that a lot of that is is just

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.330 
lot for that a lot of that is is just
consistency<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.080> bringing<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.650> on<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:14.160> nightly

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
consistency and bringing it on a nightly

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.750 
consistency and bringing it on a nightly
basis<00:00:14.820> um<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:16.680> know<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.830> think<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.400> just<00:00:17.430> kind

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
basis um you know I think we just kind

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.590 
basis um you know I think we just kind
of<00:00:17.820> let<00:00:18.390> off<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> gas<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.990> it's<00:00:20.300> we<00:00:21.300> got<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
of let off the gas I it's we got the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.939 
of let off the gas I it's we got the
point<00:00:21.810> where<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> think<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.260> thought<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.830> was

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
point where I think we thought it was

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
point where I think we thought it was
just<00:00:23.160> coming<00:00:23.640> easy<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.869> didn't<00:00:25.080> have

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
just coming easy and and you didn't have

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.859 
just coming easy and and you didn't have
to<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.099> things<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.869> you

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
to do a lot of little things and you

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.419 
to do a lot of little things and you
know<00:00:27.960> work<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.320> hard<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> job<00:00:29.400> done

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
know work is hard to get the job done

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.060 
know work is hard to get the job done
and<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:30.630> took<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> breath<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.349> Internet<00:00:31.949> up

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
and we took a breath and Internet up

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.440 
and we took a breath and Internet up
hurting<00:00:32.279> us<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> we<00:00:32.700> couldn't<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.239> catch

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
hurting us and we couldn't really catch

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.110 
hurting us and we couldn't really catch
up<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.309> like<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.399> said<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.700> where<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.000> at<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
up so like I said it's where you at a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.420 
up so like I said it's where you at a
young<00:00:36.300> team<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.500> next<00:00:37.710> step<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.070> learning

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
young team and the next step is learning

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.549 
young team and the next step is learning
from<00:00:38.610> those<00:00:38.790> mistakes<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.600> making<00:00:40.440> sure

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
from those mistakes and and making sure

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
from those mistakes and and making sure
it<00:00:40.620> doesn't<00:00:40.829> happen<00:00:40.950> again<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.969> great<00:00:42.239> yeah

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it doesn't happen again it's great yeah

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.750 
it doesn't happen again it's great yeah
and<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.930> mean<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.980> big<00:00:44.460> part<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and I mean I think a big part of that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.220 
and I mean I think a big part of that
too<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> comfort<00:00:45.629> level<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.079> group

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
too is the comfort level with the group

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.190 
too is the comfort level with the group
that<00:00:46.260> we<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:48.149> potential<00:00:49.079> of

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
that we have here and the potential of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.090 
that we have here and the potential of
you<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.940> what<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.829> with

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
and you know if I think outside of of us

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.580 
and you know if I think outside of of us
you<00:01:30.720> know<00:01:30.750> maybe<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> can<00:01:31.229> be<00:01:31.320> misconstrued

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
but I think in a lot of those places

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.760 
but I think in a lot of those places
when<00:01:33.659> guys<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:34.049> chance<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> play<00:01:34.530> there

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
when guys have a chance to play there

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
when guys have a chance to play there
and<00:01:34.799> see<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> city's<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.579> about<00:01:35.820> and
