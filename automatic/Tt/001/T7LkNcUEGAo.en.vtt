00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello then I wanted to show you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.809
 a little trick if you break your 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.860
 touch like that happens very often 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 and you know of course you can not 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.580
 most use even just open the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.140
 window and then use all that and we 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.689
 never know if you want to recover 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 photos or documents 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 eventually there is a possibility 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.469
 so of course we start on the principle or 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 touch is broken so the screen 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.660
 works of course so when you 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 turn on your screen you have that it 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.629
 necessarily you can not use the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:54.770
 right so to a small solution that's 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:58.980
 this cable is a high cable and I 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.949
 simply with a hold then I 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:08.010
 will work with a mini usb plug 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:10.470
 usb and a standard usb socket 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.659
 so you can plug into this 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.630
 taken a keyboard or for what we 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 regards a mouse still there by 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.830
 example I'm going to take a mouse without 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.170
 wire I'm going to plug this 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.750
 usb 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:36.180
 that's it and that I branch at the level of 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:43.079
 mini usb plug here they have the same 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:46.890
 taken to load it so I plug and 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:53.700
 you so I also connect the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.439
 mouse and here you see the mouse 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.930
 that they have room then I have a small 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.369
 concern is that I like and the screen to 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.240
 upside down for you to see at 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.820
 the place which makes me 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.119
 it's upside down 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.910
 a bit special but it does not matter 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:13.510
 so I'm going to show you that with this 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.000
 mouse you can use your 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.220
 Tablet 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.060
 so I'm coming back here so I'm going to try 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:24.430
 of here then for example if you 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.019
 want to save photos recover 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.550
 pictures 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.959
 so we go to gallery there I made 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.120
 small photos of three small photos 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:39.610
 so we want to get this picture here 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.650
 so after course you send it here 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.650
 by mail for example I will recover 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.580
 my photos by mail 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.980
 so here I will have my picture displayed here 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.780
 I would have just called to type my 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.549
 mail address 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:03.489
 so we will type we will type and eric 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:08.670
 riquet with Eric lehoux and we forget the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.049
 hic the noria rx and no it's not that 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.010
 so as I wanted to say the screen is 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:23.140
 upside down it's paul top it's here 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:29.680
 thirty eight 38 tac 30 8 6 30 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:33.850
 so they show up here here we have I 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.250
 send it here and so this photo 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.260
 arrive on my mail I would have taken 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.310
 that she has recovered so that's 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.139
 nice if you want to laugh and 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.639
 recover the photos of the records he goes 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.170
 I need to work a little more for 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.549
 see how to recover folders but 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.000
 for now if she for the 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:57.100
 photo recovery so already it's 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.310
 not bad and then eventually you 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.579
 can use well on your tablet 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:06.400
 even if the screen is faded to continue 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.220
 some applications and possibly 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.920
 go on your mail all that finally 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.230
 good 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.200
 it is a troubleshooting of course the touch 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.160
 good it will have to change it or 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.299
 eventually replace the tablet 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.770
 but it helps to troubleshoot 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:29.650
 here it is just a payday so 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:31.940
 this little this little usb usb cable 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.169
 know nothing it's worth two euros that I 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.730
 believe two euros fifty I had to 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.990
 pay two euros fifty you go 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.400
 on ebay you type otg automatically 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.590
 you fall on it 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.650

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.410
