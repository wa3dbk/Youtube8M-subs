than enough for what I have in here but

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.349 
than enough for what I have in here but
it's<00:04:08.930> better<00:04:09.109> to<00:04:09.290> have<00:04:09.440> more<00:04:10.340> nest<00:04:10.639> boxes<00:04:11.150> than

it's better to have more nest boxes than

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:11.800 
it's better to have more nest boxes than
not<00:04:11.510> enough

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
not enough

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.619 
not enough

that way again you also don't have to

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:15.809 
that way again you also don't have to
worry<00:04:14.720> too<00:04:15.139> much<00:04:15.169> about

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
worry too much about
