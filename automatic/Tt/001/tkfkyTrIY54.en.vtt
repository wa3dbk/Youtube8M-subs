00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 friends, hello everyone with you and this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.340
 channel send and so long ago there was a video 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.620
 zalman z12 plus ege I told 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 its advantages and the most important disadvantages and 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.250
 cons a little later came the video about 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.320
 how i upgraded the cooling 20 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.789
 case and thereby lower a little 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 CPU temperature and all 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 components in general in this video i 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.619
 I will show you how I will continue to improve my 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.960
 body and made in noise and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.750
 making vibration isolation and using two 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.800
 materials 1 two millimeter 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.840
 vibration-absorbing it consists of thin 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.320
 aluminum sheet outside and bitumen 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.059
 inside 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 the concrete part is pretty sticky with it 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.170
 need to work very carefully in 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.879
 sound quality pay or I used 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
 5mm foam it has 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.540
 closed pores as a result of sound getting 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 on the surface of the foam does not reflect on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 him as well absorbed he has a flexible 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.450
 The basis of these materials can be purchased in 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 car shop one sheet each 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.469
 material is also enough for work 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
 we will need a clerical knife and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.550
 a few spare blades a tape measure or 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.710
 ruler tool for rolling 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.300
 vibration isolation and 10 years ago to engage 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.010
 insulation cars and I stayed 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.780
 tool can use any 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.150
 handy tool handle pliers 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.189
 the key is generally anything at first 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.990
 I will put material on sidewalls before 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.880
 applying either scavenger surface 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.740
 must be degreased and wiped dry 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.840
 not to scratch the cover i put it 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.540
 on the same foam rubber the most from I 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.030
 already cut to size try on like 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 Everything is normal very important to the material 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.119
 did not bother to close the lid in advance 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.100
 check what places the cover 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.840
 in contact with the body 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 back vibram from on top of it and on 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.119
 glue foam he cut the same 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 size 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.860
 Well , let's start separating the paper backing 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.540
 bitumen by the way if the room is cool 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 for better laying it is necessary to warm up 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 material hair dryer material is not very thick 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.020
 a regular hair dryer does not fit 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.850
 building need itself very beginning 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.200
 clearly and smoothly suggest material so 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.799
 how then to tear it off practically 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.799
 is impossible 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.790
 as said before roll the material 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.530
 can any tool at hand 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.390
 I will use the card roller 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.010
 You need to roll up to the maximum 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.690
 flat surface i mean to 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.030
 bumps on the surface of the material not 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.050
 protested to press with great effort i didn't 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.170
 I advise as there is a possibility 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.690
 push the metal itself that's the result that 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.820
 I get further put 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.100
 paramon and once again trying on shooting 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.080
 substrate protecting adhesive base 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.880
 I take off gradually as sticking 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.320
 since the layer is very sticky now not 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.320
 hurrying and neatly sticking 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.120
 bulging surpluses can be cut off 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.890
 stationery knife with 2 doors produced 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.690
 tezhe action here time spent 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.000
 a bit more when cutting material 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.890
 as the walls with the front panel window 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.930
 you need all the free space gluing 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.640
 Brahma there and foam rubber it can be done 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.380
 in small pieces but again 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.140
 make sure that the material does not interfere 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.239
 normal fixing of the housing panel after 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.560
 processing panel took the following look I 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.540
 I tried to cover as much as possible 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.400
 all sorts of places on the corners of foam rubber 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.800
 stuck without vibro moda so put in 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.600
 these places it did not work with the top 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.160
 to make a lid everything exactly the same 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.130
 these actions will get rid of 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.750
 vibrations and parasitic sound also its 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.420
 I put a different sandwich under the basket 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.760
 hard drives and top 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.050
 over a basket of 525 inch devices in 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.180
 ideally the same procedure is necessary 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.130
 do the back of the case which 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.420
 attached motherboard but in this 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.069
 the body she is almost all 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.140
 perforated isolate simply 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.959
 I do not want to remind you how the wall sounded 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.930
 to vibro and noise insulation and so it sounds 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.370
 after the ringing completely disappeared and the sound became 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.350
 deaf to determine the coefficient 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.720
 efficacy show the result and 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.340
 noise meter before and after isolation all 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.769
 case fans is controlled through 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.900
 reobas three 120 millimeter fans 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.820
 exhibited on the mode of operation about 1000 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.709
 1,100 revs 1,140 millimeters 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.180
 the fan runs at 800 rpm 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.370
 CPU cooler fan rotation 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.120
 makes 800 per minute of turnover 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.110
 1250 video card turntables per minute 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.670
 since skill is professional 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.440
 noise meter I will 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.000
 use the program for the phone when 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.549
 computer off show room 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.560
 is 22 23 decibels as a result 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.079
 up to noise and vibration isolation phone 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.489
 showed 5053 decibels and after 45-46 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.799
 judging by the performance of the phone 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.540
 rain came down about 57 decibels 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.820
 but the body feels much quieter 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.340
 all the unpleasant sounds disappeared and in simple 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.169
 only sound from the air flow is heard and so 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.150
 say conclusion and summing up 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.979
 in the shown way it is possible to lower not bad 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.810
 the noise level of the entire hull as a whole but 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.669
 along with noise reduction will also be 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.530
 temperature rise as the case itself 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.300
 by itself is also a heat exchanger 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.430
 although again the hulls are painted well you 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.440
 transfer heat much worse than not 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.330
 Painted such a procedure I do not recommend 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.000
 carry out buildings with poor cooling 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.020
 or 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.030
 about installing additional 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.620
 fans once again remind you 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.270
 very carefully examine the place which 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.160
 you are going to process and so after 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.290
 insulation all components of the steel body on 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.060
 place smoothly strictly speaking 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.440
 so i did all the work on 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.570
 noise and vibration isolation of your body 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.430
 is it worth doing or not worth deciding 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.000
 only Alan but with you there was a woman and a channel 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.080
 pixels 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.080
 know more and be me
