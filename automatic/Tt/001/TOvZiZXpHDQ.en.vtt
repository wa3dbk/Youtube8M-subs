open it up and hook it in just above

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.869 
open it up and hook it in just above
where<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.199> LED<00:00:55.410> ends<00:00:55.640> simply<00:00:56.640> turn<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
where the LED ends simply turn the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
where the LED ends simply turn the
needle<00:00:57.239> round<00:00:57.500> push<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.649> back<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:59.010> inside

pierce<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> film<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.010> sticking<00:01:05.220> out

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
pierce a film so it's sticking out

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.940 
pierce a film so it's sticking out
literally<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> end<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.450> tag<00:01:09.450> ends<00:01:09.750> a

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
literally on the end of the tag ends a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.800 
literally on the end of the tag ends a
few<00:01:10.950> million<00:01:11.130> hook<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> actual<00:01:12.119> gate<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.570> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
few million hook the actual gate on and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.499 
few million hook the actual gate on and
close<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.830> then<00:01:14.400> simply<00:01:14.729> retrieve

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
close it up and then simply retrieve

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.020 
close it up and then simply retrieve
that<00:01:15.659> back<00:01:15.900> through<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.549> use<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> little<00:01:17.850> bar

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that back through I use a little bar

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.999 
that back through I use a little bar
just<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> put<00:01:18.750> into<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> loop<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.740> makes<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
just to put into the loop just makes it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.219 
just to put into the loop just makes it
a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:20.369> easier<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.909> simply<00:01:21.840> by<00:01:22.020> just

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
a little bit easier and simply by just

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.289 
a little bit easier and simply by just
pressing<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.890> actual<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.909> little<00:01:24.119> bulge

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
pressing on the actual the little bulge

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.140 
pressing on the actual the little bulge
air<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.810> twisting<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> needle<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.820> pull<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
air and twisting the needle just pull it

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
air and twisting the needle just pull it
back<00:01:27.390> through<00:01:27.689> gently<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.799> that's

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
back through gently I think that's

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609 
back through gently I think that's
important<00:01:30.060> as<00:01:30.150> well<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.479> an<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.659> oh<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.560> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
important as well as an it oh I think a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.410 
important as well as an it oh I think a
lot<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> problems<00:01:32.100> with<00:01:32.970> gate<00:01:33.180> latches

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
lot of the problems with gate latches

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
lot of the problems with gate latches
that<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.020> actually<00:01:34.290> made<00:01:34.439> for

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that they are not actually made for

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.340 
that they are not actually made for
fishing<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.509> they're<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.540> delicate

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
fishing and they're very delicate

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899 
fishing and they're very delicate
needles<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.159> what<00:01:38.280> you'll<00:01:38.400> find<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
needles and I think what you'll find is

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.120 
needles and I think what you'll find is
by<00:01:39.119> direct<00:01:39.810> Paul<00:01:40.049> you're<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> snap<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
by direct Paul you're going to snap the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.580 
by direct Paul you're going to snap the
tip<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.180> bend<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:43.079> actual<00:01:43.380> needle

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
tip of the the bend of the actual needle

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.679 
tip of the the bend of the actual needle
off<00:01:43.740> just<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.460> gentle<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.119> as<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> notice

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
off just be gentle and as you notice

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
off just be gentle and as you notice
stage<00:01:46.170> twisting<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.159> twisting<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> tags<00:01:47.820> not

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
stage twisting is twisting the tags not

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.490 
stage twisting is twisting the tags not
pulling<00:01:48.240> straight<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.720> twisting<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.409> it's

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
pulling straight is twisting and it's

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.100 
pulling straight is twisting and it's
just<00:01:49.619> working<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.540> what<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:51.990> with

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
just working it and on what you get with

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.810 
just working it and on what you get with
that<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.040> few<00:01:53.100> more<00:01:53.399> seconds

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
that is it just for a few more seconds
