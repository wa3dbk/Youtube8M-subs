is<00:00:28.140> running<00:00:28.470> through<00:00:28.590> chips<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.000> just

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
is running through chips but I just

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.510 
is running through chips but I just
can't<00:00:30.449> tell<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.019> there<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.380> latency<00:00:32.130> and

I don't know that just sounds so so good
this<00:02:44.670> reminds<00:02:45.000> me<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.360> 80s<00:02:45.690> prog<00:02:45.960> band<00:02:45.990> 90s<00:02:46.920> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
this reminds me of a 80s prog band 90s I

the things about this i like is you can
take<00:03:17.280> any<00:03:17.490> piece<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.210> move<00:03:18.330> it<00:03:18.450> anywhere<00:03:18.600> you

want<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:20.040> signal<00:03:20.460> i<00:03:20.640> just<00:03:21.330> put<00:03:21.930> this

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
want in the signal i just put this

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.040 
want in the signal i just put this
course<00:03:22.470> or<00:03:22.950> flanger<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:23.970> front<00:03:24.420> what<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.840> that

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
course or flanger in front what is that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.790 
course or flanger in front what is that
I<00:03:25.320> believe<00:03:25.560> it's<00:03:25.860> course<00:03:26.190> it's<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:27.900> phaser<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
I believe it's course it's a phaser the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.980 
I believe it's course it's a phaser the
mxr<00:03:29.280> right<00:03:29.550> put<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.390> in<00:03:30.510> front<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> amp

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
mxr right put that in front of the amp

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.870 
mxr right put that in front of the amp
you<00:03:31.470> think<00:03:31.680> that's<00:03:31.830> how<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:31.980> d<00:03:32.130> van<00:03:32.340> Halen<00:03:32.730> did

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
you think that's how I d van Halen did

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:44.930 
you think that's how I d van Halen did
it<00:03:33.000> I<00:03:33.150> don't<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.810> I've<00:03:34.020> heard<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:43.940> don't

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
it I don't know I've heard so I don't

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.790 
it I don't know I've heard so I don't
know<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.150> tell<00:03:45.239> me<00:03:45.450> sound<00:03:46.320> close<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:48.800> thought

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
know you tell me sound close I thought

00:03:49.800 --> 00:04:07.660 
know you tell me sound close I thought
so<00:03:50.420> little<00:03:51.420> tremolo<00:03:52.020> for<00:03:52.290> you

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.550 

and<00:04:08.670> then<00:04:09.120> we<00:04:09.269> get<00:04:09.390> into<00:04:09.540> the<00:04:09.719> company<00:04:10.049> presets

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and then we get into the company presets

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.940 
and then we get into the company presets
there's<00:04:11.219> a<00:04:11.280> bunch<00:04:11.519> here<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:12.959> don't<00:04:13.680> want<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:13.859> get

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
there's a bunch here I don't want to get

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.400 
there's a bunch here I don't want to get
into<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.159> lot<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.579> I<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.900> wanted<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.229> show

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
into a lot of that I just wanted to show

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.999 
into a lot of that I just wanted to show
you<00:04:16.440> these<00:04:16.769> amps<00:04:17.310> basically<00:04:18.620> how<00:04:19.620> could<00:04:19.829> they

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
you these amps basically how could they

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:48.830 
you these amps basically how could they
sound<00:04:20.400> boom<00:04:47.180> speaking<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.240> effects<00:04:48.599> let's

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
sound boom speaking of effects let's

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.080 
sound boom speaking of effects let's
check<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.169> out<00:04:49.259> this<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.400> noise<00:04:50.520> gate<00:04:50.880> if

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
check it out this is the noise gate if

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.960 
check it out this is the noise gate if
you<00:04:51.240> double<00:04:51.539> tap<00:04:51.720> it<00:04:52.590> takes<00:04:52.919> you<00:04:53.160> over<00:04:53.699> to

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
you double tap it takes you over to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.640 
you double tap it takes you over to
where<00:04:54.090> they<00:04:54.240> are<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.750> i<00:04:54.780> guess<00:04:55.199> with<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.410> pro

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
where they are so i guess with the pro

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.189 
where they are so i guess with the pro
you<00:04:55.830> have<00:04:55.979> in<00:04:56.099> Nora's<00:04:56.340> gate<00:04:56.720> let<00:04:57.720> me<00:04:57.930> turn<00:04:58.080> the

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
you have in Nora's gate let me turn the

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.689 
you have in Nora's gate let me turn the
volume<00:04:58.530> down<00:04:59.660> if<00:05:00.660> you<00:05:00.840> go<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.470> amps<00:05:01.979> double

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
volume down if you go to the amps double

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.860 
volume down if you go to the amps double
tap<00:05:02.880> we<00:05:03.870> have<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> black<00:05:04.800> duo<00:05:05.220> positive<00:05:06.090> grid<00:05:06.419> we

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
tap we have a black duo positive grid we

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.140 
tap we have a black duo positive grid we
have<00:05:07.020> at<00:05:07.169> we'd<00:05:07.729> have<00:05:08.729> an<00:05:08.880> AC<00:05:10.220> we<00:05:11.220> have<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.400> plexi

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
have at we'd have an AC we have a plexi

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.339 
have at we'd have an AC we have a plexi
looks<00:05:12.599> like<00:05:14.180> here<00:05:15.180> we<00:05:15.300> have<00:05:15.479> another<00:05:15.599> one<00:05:15.990> when

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
looks like here we have another one when

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.500 
looks like here we have another one when
we<00:05:16.380> have<00:05:16.620> he<00:05:16.800> write<00:05:17.039> the<00:05:17.159> lead<00:05:17.370> 800<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.180> guess

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
we have he write the lead 800 I guess

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.080 
we have he write the lead 800 I guess
that's<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.810> marshal<00:05:19.169> as<00:05:19.289> well<00:05:19.580> this<00:05:20.580> is<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:20.789> tread

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
that's a marshal as well this is a tread

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.149 
that's a marshal as well this is a tread
plate<00:05:21.419> probably<00:05:21.840> like<00:05:21.990> a<00:05:22.020> mess<00:05:22.320> music<00:05:23.010> boogie

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
plate probably like a mess music boogie

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.899 
plate probably like a mess music boogie
something<00:05:23.729> like<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:24.770> let's<00:05:25.770> go<00:05:25.979> back<00:05:26.250> we

00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:26.909 
something like that let's go back we

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.050 
something like that let's go back we
have<00:05:27.120> some<00:05:27.419> eqs<00:05:28.349> and<00:05:28.590> effects<00:05:28.979> drop<00:05:29.729> them<00:05:29.880> in

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
have some eqs and effects drop them in

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.589 
have some eqs and effects drop them in
here<00:05:31.400> if<00:05:32.400> you<00:05:32.550> guys<00:05:32.580> can<00:05:32.880> see<00:05:32.909> that<00:05:33.240> at<00:05:33.330> home

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
here if you guys can see that at home

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.670 
here if you guys can see that at home
probably<00:05:34.169> get<00:05:34.409> the<00:05:34.530> angle<00:05:34.680> all<00:05:34.979> messed<00:05:35.220> up

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
probably get the angle all messed up

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.529 
probably get the angle all messed up
there's<00:05:37.680> your<00:05:37.800> EQ<00:05:38.220> pedal<00:05:38.669> and<00:05:38.880> let's<00:05:39.360> check

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 
there's your EQ pedal and let's check

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.920 
there's your EQ pedal and let's check
out<00:05:39.690> Margie<00:05:40.080> alright<00:05:40.620> delay<00:05:40.949> we<00:05:41.220> have<00:05:41.400> a

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
out Margie alright delay we have a

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.219 
out Margie alright delay we have a
double<00:05:42.930> tap<00:05:43.169> we<00:05:43.830> have<00:05:44.720> there's<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.870> digital

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
double tap we have there's the digital

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.399 
double tap we have there's the digital
delay<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:46.800> then<00:05:47.460> we<00:05:47.550> have<00:05:47.669> the<00:05:47.820> echo<00:05:48.090> of

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
delay and then we have the echo of

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.600 
delay and then we have the echo of
course<00:05:49.409> you<00:05:49.530> can<00:05:49.680> go<00:05:49.800> to<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.039> positive<00:05:50.190> grid

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
course you can go to the positive grid

here we have a spring reverb and we have

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:15.050 
here we have a spring reverb and we have
a<00:06:12.889> digital<00:06:13.889> reverb

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
a digital reverb

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.500

again<00:06:15.900> before<00:06:16.470> I<00:06:16.710> say<00:06:17.340> adios<00:06:17.790> to<00:06:17.820> you<00:06:18.270> I'd<00:06:18.480> like

again before I say adios to you I'd like
to<00:06:18.780> also<00:06:18.900> show<00:06:19.350> you<00:06:19.669> there<00:06:20.669> is<00:06:20.700> a<00:06:20.880> tuna<00:06:25.970> and

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
when you get it right green light comes

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.520 
when you get it right green light comes
on<00:06:29.580> you<00:06:29.910> probably<00:06:30.570> can't<00:06:30.780> tell<00:06:30.990> from<00:06:31.230> there

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
on you probably can't tell from there

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.550 
on you probably can't tell from there
but<00:06:31.980> it<00:06:32.220> is<00:06:32.720> anything<00:06:33.720> like<00:06:33.930> what<00:06:34.169> the<00:06:34.290> tuner

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
but it is anything like what the tuner

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.200 
but it is anything like what the tuner
it<00:06:34.740> cuts<00:06:34.980> your<00:06:35.100> signal<00:06:35.520> so<00:06:35.760> no<00:06:35.940> one<00:06:36.060> has<00:06:36.090> to

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
it cuts your signal so no one has to

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.379 
it cuts your signal so no one has to
hear<00:06:36.570> you<00:06:36.830> there<00:06:37.830> is<00:06:38.070> a<00:06:38.100> sampler<00:06:38.700> you<00:06:38.970> can<00:06:39.150> set

the length of your loop that you want to
jam<00:06:42.750> to<00:06:43.020> it<00:06:43.260> has<00:06:43.950> a<00:06:43.980> metronome<00:06:44.520> that<00:06:44.760> you<00:06:45.030> can

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
your the loop tempo and you're playing

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
your the loop tempo and you're playing
back<00:06:50.400> to<00:06:50.660> volume<00:06:52.130> so<00:06:53.130> yeah<00:06:53.280> it's<00:06:53.490> a<00:06:53.550> very<00:06:53.760> cool

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970 
back to volume so yeah it's a very cool

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.340 
back to volume so yeah it's a very cool
app<00:06:54.240> i<00:06:54.630> believe<00:06:55.320> it<00:06:55.410> was<00:06:55.500> only<00:06:55.760> 999<00:06:57.350> the

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
app i believe it was only 999 the

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.040 
app i believe it was only 999 the
positive<00:06:58.919> grid<00:06:59.220> GM<00:06:59.820> plug<00:07:00.060> well<00:07:00.389> if<00:07:00.510> i<00:07:00.660> zoom<00:07:00.690> out

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 
positive grid GM plug well if i zoom out

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.969 
positive grid GM plug well if i zoom out
here<00:07:01.290> I<00:07:01.490> think<00:07:02.490> it<00:07:02.610> was<00:07:02.729> twenty<00:07:03.120> dollars<00:07:03.479> and

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
here I think it was twenty dollars and

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:07.520 
here I think it was twenty dollars and
it's<00:07:04.979> very<00:07:05.250> simple<00:07:05.550> it's<00:07:05.880> just<00:07:06.450> that's<00:07:07.260> it

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530

right there so from positive grid we

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.409
