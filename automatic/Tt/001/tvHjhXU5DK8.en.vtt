the<00:00:34.710> reed<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.280> mouthpiece<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.270> then<00:00:37.140> slip

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the reed on the mouthpiece and then slip

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.130 
the reed on the mouthpiece and then slip
the<00:00:37.559> ligature<00:00:38.250> over<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> top<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.660> don't<00:00:39.930> like

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the ligature over the top I don't like

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.760 
the ligature over the top I don't like
that<00:00:40.610> because<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.360> tip<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> reed<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.440> very

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
that because the tip of the reed is very

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.819 
that because the tip of the reed is very
delicate<00:00:44.130> and<00:00:44.640> it's<00:00:44.879> very<00:00:45.180> easy<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:46.050> snap<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
delicate and it's very easy to snap it

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.270 
delicate and it's very easy to snap it
or<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.309> break<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.540> tip<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> reed<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
or to break the tip of the reed so this

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.770 
or to break the tip of the reed so this
is<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> way<00:00:50.640> I've<00:00:50.910> done<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.510> years<00:00:51.660> and

move it up you can move it down you can

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:23.449 
move it up you can move it down you can
move<00:01:21.149> it<00:01:21.299> left<00:01:21.539> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:21.899> move<00:01:22.109> it<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:22.469> but

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
move it left you can move it right but

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:26.359 
move it left you can move it right but
the<00:01:23.609> perfect<00:01:23.909> spot<00:01:24.469> is<00:01:25.469> just<00:01:26.039> to<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the perfect spot is just to have a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.199 
the perfect spot is just to have a
little<00:01:27.090> sliver<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.959> black<00:01:28.499> at<00:01:28.859> the<00:01:28.979> top<00:01:29.219> so

00:01:30.199 --> 00:01:30.209 
little sliver of black at the top so

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.949 
little sliver of black at the top so
mitch<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.719> this<00:01:31.169> correct<00:01:31.829> yes<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.310> no<00:01:32.459> no<00:01:33.389> I<00:01:33.689> can

00:01:33.949 --> 00:01:33.959 
mitch is this correct yes or no no I can

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.870 
mitch is this correct yes or no no I can
see<00:01:34.200> there's<00:01:34.529> a<00:01:34.859> little<00:01:35.130> gap<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.429> between

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
see there's a little gap in between

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.019 
see there's a little gap in between
right<00:01:36.869> well<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:38.039> is<00:01:38.099> better<00:01:38.549> than<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:39.029 
right well then this is better than is

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.239 
right well then this is better than is
that<00:01:39.149> right<00:01:39.329> no<00:01:39.719> it's<00:01:40.200> off<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.529> the<00:01:40.649> side<00:01:40.859> and

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
that right no it's off to the side and

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.190 
that right no it's off to the side and
it's<00:01:41.459> bulging<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.029> the<00:01:42.149> top<00:01:42.359> so<00:01:42.749> take<00:01:43.169> a

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
it's bulging out the top so take a

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.889 
it's bulging out the top so take a
little<00:01:43.439> bit<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.739> time<00:01:44.090> adjust<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.599> see

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
little bit of time adjust it so you see

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.800 
little bit of time adjust it so you see
a<00:01:45.929> little<00:01:46.289> thin<00:01:46.590> tip<00:01:46.919> and<00:01:47.209> then<00:01:48.209> what<00:01:48.419> you<00:01:48.569> want

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
a little thin tip and then what you want

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.289 
a little thin tip and then what you want
to<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.409> tighten<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.310> ligature<00:01:50.819> but<00:01:51.060> don't

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
to do is tighten the ligature but don't

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.620 
to do is tighten the ligature but don't
