here<00:00:35.880> we<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.150> a<00:00:36.180> screw<00:00:36.480> driver<00:00:36.630> which<00:00:36.930> is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
here we have a screw driver which is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.050 
here we have a screw driver which is
used<00:00:37.290> for<00:00:37.530> removing<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.160> screws<00:00:38.700> from<00:00:38.970> the

used for removing the screws from the
bottom<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.660> your<00:00:39.690> MacBook<00:00:40.170> Air<00:00:40.380> there<00:00:41.040> are

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
bottom of your MacBook Air there are

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.860 
bottom of your MacBook Air there are
several<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.730> them<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.090> remove<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.690> some

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
several of them to remove and some

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.570 
several of them to remove and some
actually<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.410> some<00:00:43.650> glue<00:00:43.860> adhesive<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
actually have some glue adhesive on it

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.160 
actually have some glue adhesive on it
which<00:00:44.820> helps<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> keep<00:00:45.330> into<00:00:45.600> place<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.080> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
which helps it keep into place so you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.750 
which helps it keep into place so you
need<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.470> use<00:00:46.650> a<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:46.860> bit<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.190> extra<00:00:47.430> effort

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
need to use a little bit of extra effort

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.410

sometimes<00:00:49.520> also<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.580> get<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.850> black<00:00:51.030> screw

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
sometimes also you get this black screw

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.940 
sometimes also you get this black screw
driver<00:00:51.630> which<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:51.990> used<00:00:52.200> for<00:00:52.440> removing<00:00:52.650> the

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
driver which is used for removing the

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.650 
driver which is used for removing the

more<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.139> SanDisk<00:01:49.740> flash<00:01:50.689> NAND<00:01:51.689> modules

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
more of the SanDisk flash NAND modules

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.819 
more of the SanDisk flash NAND modules
and<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:53.639> is<00:01:53.789> a<00:01:53.819> proprietary<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.679> goes

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
and there is a proprietary and that goes

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.980 
and there is a proprietary and that goes
on<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.249> heirs<00:01:56.579> logic<00:01:57.179> board<00:01:57.389> now<00:01:57.600> peeling

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
on to your heirs logic board now peeling

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
on to your heirs logic board now peeling
back<00:01:58.139> the<00:01:58.200> thermal<00:01:58.920> pad<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.789> little<00:02:00.149> bit

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
back the thermal pad just a little bit

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.069 
back the thermal pad just a little bit
you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.409> see<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.969> controller<00:02:02.969> is

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
you can see that the controller is

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.319 
you can see that the controller is
controlled<00:02:04.079> by<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.409> sand<00:02:04.950> force<00:02:05.279> controller<00:02:05.999> so

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
controlled by a sand force controller so

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.580 
controlled by a sand force controller so
it<00:02:06.509> definitely<00:02:06.689> offers<00:02:07.259> plenty<00:02:07.439> of

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:12.689 
gigabit per second drive so you can have

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:13.950

installing the SSD into your MacBook Air
is<00:02:22.870> actually<00:02:23.290> incredibly<00:02:24.040> simple<00:02:24.280> all<00:02:24.700> you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
is actually incredibly simple all you

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.280 
is actually incredibly simple all you
have<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.120> do<00:02:25.210> is<00:02:25.330> remove<00:02:25.570> all<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.080> screws

out with the OWCA SSD screw that into

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.240 
out with the OWCA SSD screw that into
place<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.320> put<00:02:38.380> your<00:02:38.590> bottom<00:02:38.890> plate<00:02:39.100> and

one that one worked for a while more on
that<00:03:40.240> in<00:03:40.420> a<00:03:40.570> little<00:03:40.810> while<00:03:40.960> so<00:03:41.350> on<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.800> the

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
that in a little while so on to the

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.350 
that in a little while so on to the
benchmarks<00:03:42.400> for<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.730> unit<00:03:43.090> that<00:03:43.240> was

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
benchmarks for the unit that was

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.070 
benchmarks for the unit that was
actually<00:03:43.750> working<00:03:43.930> for<00:03:44.830> a<00:03:44.860> while<00:03:45.160> hint<00:03:45.550> hint

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
actually working for a while hint hint

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.150 
actually working for a while hint hint
so<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.230> is<00:03:47.350> what<00:03:47.470> we're<00:03:47.620> looking<00:03:47.860> at<00:03:47.980> in

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
so this is what we're looking at in

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.270 
so this is what we're looking at in
terms<00:03:48.790> of<00:03:49.060> raw<00:03:49.600> reads<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.470> writes<00:03:50.830> speeds

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
terms of raw reads and writes speeds

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.400 
terms of raw reads and writes speeds
this<00:03:51.940> is<00:03:52.000> what<00:03:52.300> it<00:03:52.390> looks<00:03:52.570> like<00:03:52.630> when<00:03:52.990> compared

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
this is what it looks like when compared

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.930 
this is what it looks like when compared
to<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.830> Apple<00:03:54.870> SSD<00:03:55.870> as<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.830> can<00:03:56.980> see<00:03:57.280> the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
to the Apple SSD as you can see the

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.480 
to the Apple SSD as you can see the
Apple<00:03:58.360> SSD<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.080> actually<00:03:59.740> a<00:03:59.950> little<00:04:00.310> bit

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
Apple SSD is actually a little bit

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.480 
Apple SSD is actually a little bit
faster<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.180> most<00:04:01.480> of<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:01.900> tests<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:03.040> the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
faster in most of the tests so the

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.100 
faster in most of the tests so the
horizontal<00:04:04.450> axis<00:04:04.900> actually<00:04:05.590> deals<00:04:05.860> with<00:04:06.010> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
horizontal axis actually deals with the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.270 
horizontal axis actually deals with the
size<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.590> data<00:04:08.830> that's<00:04:09.100> being

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
size of the data that's being

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.700 
size of the data that's being
transferred<00:04:09.820> from<00:04:10.090> the<00:04:10.390> computer<00:04:10.900> over<00:04:11.560> to

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
transferred from the computer over to

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.510 
transferred from the computer over to
your<00:04:11.830> SSD<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.180> goes<00:04:13.330> everywhere<00:04:13.870> from<00:04:14.520> half

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
your SSD so it goes everywhere from half

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.430 
your SSD so it goes everywhere from half
a<00:04:15.670> megabyte<00:04:16.090> all<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.660> way<00:04:16.780> up<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.140> eight

megabytes<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.220> size<00:04:18.570> obviously<00:04:19.570> when<00:04:19.720> you're

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
megabytes in size obviously when you're

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.900

dealing<00:04:20.109> with<00:04:20.140> larger<00:04:20.710> files<00:04:20.950> those<00:04:21.430> transfer

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
dealing with larger files those transfer

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.090 
dealing with larger files those transfer
quicker<00:04:22.180> than<00:04:22.510> a<00:04:22.750> bunch<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.290> small<00:04:23.560> ones<00:04:23.740> and

quicker than a bunch of small ones and

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.120 
quicker than a bunch of small ones and
for<00:04:24.700> most<00:04:24.910> of<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.120> tests<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.960> Apple<00:04:26.380> SSD<00:04:26.919> was

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
for most of the tests the Apple SSD was

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.720 
for most of the tests the Apple SSD was
actually

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
actually

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.790 
actually
a little<00:04:28.120> bit<00:04:28.240> faster<00:04:28.480> can<00:04:29.290> you<00:04:29.380> notice<00:04:29.680> that

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
a little bit faster can you notice that

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.100 
a little bit faster can you notice that
sort<00:04:30.010> of<00:04:30.160> thing<00:04:30.400> probably<00:04:30.940> not<00:04:31.390> so<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.780> most

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
sort of thing probably not so to most

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.050 
sort of thing probably not so to most
people<00:04:32.440> this<00:04:32.590> shouldn't<00:04:32.920> really<00:04:32.980> matter<00:04:33.310> but

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
people this shouldn't really matter but

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.790 
people this shouldn't really matter but
for<00:04:34.090> those<00:04:34.390> of<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:34.630> who<00:04:34.780> like<00:04:34.930> numbers<00:04:35.320> this

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
for those of you who like numbers this

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.520 
for those of you who like numbers this
is<00:04:35.980> what<00:04:36.130> they<00:04:36.250> look<00:04:36.460> like<00:04:37.260> also<00:04:38.260> if<00:04:38.410> you're

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
is what they look like also if you're

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.870 
is what they look like also if you're
actually<00:04:38.890> wondering<00:04:39.280> where<00:04:39.430> these<00:04:39.550> numbers

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
actually wondering where these numbers

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.760 
actually wondering where these numbers
came<00:04:40.060> from<00:04:40.120> these<00:04:40.750> came<00:04:41.020> from<00:04:41.200> Windows

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
came from these came from Windows

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.040 
came from these came from Windows
through<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.400> program<00:04:42.640> called<00:04:42.850> a<00:04:43.390> doubt<00:04:43.630> disk

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
through a program called a doubt disk

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.440 
through a program called a doubt disk
benchmark<00:04:44.740> it's<00:04:45.340> typically<00:04:45.760> a<00:04:45.910> standard

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450 
benchmark it's typically a standard

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.180 
benchmark it's typically a standard
program<00:04:46.630> that's<00:04:46.990> used<00:04:47.050> when<00:04:47.470> testing<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:47.920> raw

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
program that's used when testing the raw

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.970 
program that's used when testing the raw
transfer<00:04:49.030> speeds<00:04:49.330> for<00:04:49.810> drives<00:04:50.050> so<00:04:50.680> this<00:04:50.860> is

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
transfer speeds for drives so this is

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.160 
transfer speeds for drives so this is
where<00:04:51.130> those<00:04:51.250> numbers<00:04:51.280> came<00:04:51.760> from<00:04:51.970> now<00:04:52.810> for

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
where those numbers came from now for

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.570 
where those numbers came from now for
the<00:04:53.260> negative<00:04:53.620> part<00:04:53.890> I'm<00:04:54.070> sorry<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.310> don't<00:04:54.400> have

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
the negative part I'm sorry I don't have

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.980 
the negative part I'm sorry I don't have
any<00:04:54.760> other<00:04:54.880> clips<00:04:55.150> to<00:04:55.300> show<00:04:55.450> you<00:04:55.510> this<00:04:55.720> is<00:04:55.870> all

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
any other clips to show you this is all

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.600 
any other clips to show you this is all
I<00:04:56.020> recorded<00:04:56.740> so<00:04:56.920> you're<00:04:57.070> just<00:04:57.160> gonna<00:04:57.280> have<00:04:57.520> to

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
I recorded so you're just gonna have to

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.170 
I recorded so you're just gonna have to
look<00:04:57.730> at<00:04:57.850> me<00:04:58.060> opening<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.960> SSD<00:04:59.530> up<00:04:59.880> anyway<00:05:00.880> the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
look at me opening the SSD up anyway the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.970 
look at me opening the SSD up anyway the
first<00:05:01.750> unit<00:05:02.170> that<00:05:02.200> I<00:05:02.320> received<00:05:02.710> as<00:05:02.890> I

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
first unit that I received as I

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.040 
first unit that I received as I
mentioned<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.400> little<00:05:03.550> earlier<00:05:03.760> was<00:05:04.450> actually

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
mentioned a little earlier was actually

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.860 
mentioned a little earlier was actually
dead<00:05:05.440> on<00:05:05.620> arrival<00:05:05.860> so<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.580> did<00:05:06.730> not<00:05:06.760> work<00:05:07.120> when

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
dead on arrival so it did not work when

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.230 
dead on arrival so it did not work when
ODBC<00:05:08.590> sent<00:05:08.830> me<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:09.040> second<00:05:09.430> drive<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:10.090> one

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
ODBC sent me the second drive that one

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.240 
ODBC sent me the second drive that one
worked<00:05:10.450> without<00:05:10.840> any<00:05:11.110> problems<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.010> that's

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
worked without any problems and that's

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.040 
worked without any problems and that's
again<00:05:12.730> where<00:05:13.030> these<00:05:13.180> performance<00:05:13.780> numbers

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
again where these performance numbers

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.000 
again where these performance numbers
came<00:05:14.290> from<00:05:15.510> however<00:05:16.510> after<00:05:17.380> one<00:05:17.650> month<00:05:17.830> of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
came from however after one month of

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.420 
came from however after one month of
using<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:19.390> from<00:05:19.660> September<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:20.320> October<00:05:20.430> it

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
using it so from September to October it

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.090 
using it so from September to October it
all<00:05:21.700> of<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:21.910> sudden<00:05:22.240> died<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:23.080> was<00:05:23.560> in<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.830> middle

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
all of a sudden died I was in the middle

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.440 
all of a sudden died I was in the middle
of<00:05:24.220> using<00:05:24.580> my<00:05:24.670> MacBook<00:05:25.060> Air

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
of using my MacBook Air

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.270 
of using my MacBook Air
all<00:05:25.570> of<00:05:25.960> a<00:05:26.020> sudden<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.500> audio<00:05:26.890> that<00:05:27.040> I<00:05:27.100> was

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
all of a sudden the audio that I was

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.790 
all of a sudden the audio that I was
playing<00:05:27.460> through<00:05:27.610> iTunes<00:05:28.030> stopped<00:05:28.690> my<00:05:29.410> cursor

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
playing through iTunes stopped my cursor

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.010 
playing through iTunes stopped my cursor
would<00:05:29.950> still<00:05:30.190> move<00:05:30.460> but<00:05:30.880> I<00:05:31.090> wouldn't<00:05:31.480> if<00:05:31.900> I

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
would still move but I wouldn't if I

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.270 
would still move but I wouldn't if I
were<00:05:32.170> to<00:05:32.260> click<00:05:32.440> on<00:05:32.560> something<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.010> couldn't

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
were to click on something I couldn't

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.070 
were to click on something I couldn't
move<00:05:33.400> any<00:05:33.580> of<00:05:33.670> the<00:05:33.760> windows<00:05:33.790> then<00:05:34.720> shortly

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
move any of the windows then shortly

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.080 
move any of the windows then shortly
after<00:05:35.320> that<00:05:35.440> my<00:05:35.830> cursor<00:05:36.040> stopped<00:05:36.460> moving<00:05:36.700> so

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
after that my cursor stopped moving so

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.070 
after that my cursor stopped moving so
the<00:05:37.330> OWCA<00:05:38.250> SSD<00:05:39.250> died<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.570> second<00:05:40.960> one<00:05:41.050> that

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
the OWCA SSD died the second one that

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.360 
the OWCA SSD died the second one that
sent<00:05:41.590> me<00:05:41.710> broke<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:43.470> then<00:05:44.470> when<00:05:44.620> I<00:05:44.650> told<00:05:44.740> owz

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
sent me broke and then when I told owz

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.100 
sent me broke and then when I told owz
about<00:05:45.700> this<00:05:45.910> they<00:05:46.120> pretty<00:05:46.600> much<00:05:46.810> said<00:05:47.080> that

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
about this they pretty much said that

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.490 
about this they pretty much said that
this<00:05:47.920> is<00:05:48.100> something<00:05:48.820> that<00:05:48.850> SSDs<00:05:49.570> can<00:05:49.780> do<00:05:49.960> after

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
this is something that SSDs can do after

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.440 
this is something that SSDs can do after
a<00:05:50.530> while<00:05:50.740> they<00:05:50.950> will<00:05:51.100> typically<00:05:51.670> die<00:05:51.940> down<00:05:52.210> and

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
a while they will typically die down and

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.320 
a while they will typically die down and
stop<00:05:52.810> working<00:05:53.050> this<00:05:53.410> is<00:05:53.560> sort<00:05:53.830> of<00:05:53.890> normal<00:05:54.330> but

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
stop working this is sort of normal but

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.450 
stop working this is sort of normal but
my<00:05:55.420> issue<00:05:55.630> is<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:56.230> happened<00:05:56.590> in<00:05:56.710> just<00:05:57.190> one

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
my issue is that it happened in just one

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.390 
my issue is that it happened in just one
month<00:05:57.640> of<00:05:57.850> usage<00:05:58.270> for<00:05:58.510> their<00:05:59.500> first<00:05:59.770> SSD<00:06:00.250> that

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
month of usage for their first SSD that

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.370 
month of usage for their first SSD that
they<00:06:00.520> sent<00:06:00.730> me<00:06:00.820> to<00:06:01.090> not<00:06:01.420> work<00:06:01.630> at<00:06:01.780> all<00:06:01.960> on

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
they sent me to not work at all on

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.860 
they sent me to not work at all on
arrival<00:06:03.310> and<00:06:03.460> for<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.150> second<00:06:04.480> one<00:06:04.570> to<00:06:04.720> die

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
arrival and for the second one to die

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.900 
arrival and for the second one to die
after<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.230> month<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:06.070> right<00:06:06.310> there<00:06:06.490> tells<00:06:06.760> me

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
after a month that right there tells me

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.810 
after a month that right there tells me
enough<00:06:07.150> about<00:06:07.660> owca's<00:06:08.320> reliability<00:06:09.040> to<00:06:09.670> where

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
enough about owca's reliability to where

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.970 
enough about owca's reliability to where
I<00:06:10.120> don't<00:06:10.360> think<00:06:10.660> people<00:06:10.900> should<00:06:11.140> risk<00:06:11.650> their

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
I don't think people should risk their

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.120 
I don't think people should risk their
data<00:06:12.280> in<00:06:12.580> time<00:06:13.030> and<00:06:13.390> money<00:06:13.660> in<00:06:14.020> their<00:06:14.710> products

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
data in time and money in their products

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.610 
data in time and money in their products
I<00:06:15.510> mean<00:06:16.510> that's<00:06:16.720> that's<00:06:17.020> just<00:06:17.230> the<00:06:17.320> way<00:06:17.440> it<00:06:17.590> is

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
I mean that's that's just the way it is

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.280 
I mean that's that's just the way it is
so<00:06:18.220> for<00:06:18.880> them<00:06:19.000> to<00:06:19.030> simply<00:06:19.390> say<00:06:19.660> that<00:06:19.900> this<00:06:20.080> is

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290 
so for them to simply say that this is

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.080 
so for them to simply say that this is
normal<00:06:20.920> wear<00:06:21.100> and<00:06:21.130> tear<00:06:21.400> of<00:06:21.460> a<00:06:21.640> solid<00:06:21.940> state

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
normal wear and tear of a solid state

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.240 
normal wear and tear of a solid state
drive<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.600> for<00:06:23.320> it<00:06:23.380> to<00:06:23.440> just<00:06:23.560> die<00:06:23.770> like<00:06:23.800> that

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
drive and for it to just die like that

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.000 
drive and for it to just die like that
that<00:06:24.880> to<00:06:25.120> me<00:06:25.260> from<00:06:26.260> both<00:06:26.410> a<00:06:26.560> consumer

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
that to me from both a consumer

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.560 
that to me from both a consumer
standpoint<00:06:27.280> and<00:06:27.790> sort<00:06:28.000> of<00:06:28.090> person<00:06:28.450> who

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
standpoint and sort of person who

standpoint and sort of person who
reviews<00:06:28.930> tech<00:06:29.260> that<00:06:29.950> just<00:06:30.550> doesn't<00:06:30.760> seem
