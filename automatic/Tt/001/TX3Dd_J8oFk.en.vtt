00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.779
 Have you ever wondered why there is such a huge debt? Or why experts and governments look 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.001
 completely incapable of solving the current debt crisis? 

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:13.062
 The reason can not be because they are trying to correct the present 

00:00:13.062 --> 00:00:18.087
 banking system. But the current banking system is completely vicious. In fact, this system 

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:23.039
 which has buried us all under a massive mountain of debt. 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.032
 In the next 3 minutes I will show you how the bank system ensures 

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:31.065
 that the vast majority of the population will end up sinking into debt and why, if we allow banks 

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:35.055
 to continue to operate as before, it will be the most terrible thing for the economy and society 

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:40.016
 generally. 

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:44.042
 But first, where do you think you've got all this indebtedness? Many people will admit that, 

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:49.003
 banks must take money from savers before they can borrow a borrower. 

00:00:49.003 --> 00:00:53.026
 Are not the banks doing so? They take money from the people who save and they lend with that money 

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.559
 businesses and people who need money? 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.068
 Well, not exactly. 

00:00:57.068 --> 00:01:02.032
 Here is the truth that not many people know. In fact, a bank does not need to have any 

00:01:02.032 --> 00:01:04.082
 money before he can give credit to someone. 

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:09.043
 When you mortgage something in a bank, the bank does not take that money from Savings Bank 

00:01:09.043 --> 00:01:10.089
 someone's grandmother. 

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:16.002
 NO. Instead, this bank just buys digits into the account opened in your name, on her computer. 

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:21.000
 You get a huge bundle of money in your bill, and a big bundle of debt you will 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.077
 you pay in the next 25 years. 

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:28.085
 The money you took on credit was created out of nothing and was simply put into your account. 

00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:32.056
 We know that this is not a belief, but you do not have to take our word of trust. 

00:01:32.056 --> 00:01:37.939
 The Central Bank itself says, "When banks lend, they create new ones 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.001
 deposits for those who borrow money "These bank deposits are simple 

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.909
 the numbers in your account. 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.619
 Martin Lulf, the chief economist editor of the Financial Times, says "Essentials 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.042
 the modern monetary system is creating money from nothing, from private 

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.024
 banks presented as lending " 

00:01:55.024 --> 00:02:00.067
 Almost all the money we use today is created in this way, from nothing, from the banks when 

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:02.579
 give loans. 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.025
 And the only way we as a society we can take that money is like, we sink 

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.063
 in debts to banks. 

00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:12.969
 In other words, almost every English pound we need in the economy to move the business, trade, 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:18.189
 factories, schools, hospitals must first be borrowed from banks. 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:23.889
 And if a man, one million pounds, we all have to have a million pounds of debt. 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.073
 If we try not to sink into debt, then banks will not be able to generate money and the economy 

00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:30.629
 will stop. 

00:02:30.629 --> 99:59:59.000
 This is, in fact, the privatization of the power to create money. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
