people's heads as possible that seems a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.720 
people's heads as possible that seems a
bit<00:00:42.450> gruesome<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.960> guess<00:00:43.140> seems<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:44.010> kind<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
bit gruesome I guess seems it's kind of

a<00:00:44.820> mild<00:00:45.030> word<00:00:45.329> their<00:00:46.010> guillotine<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.129> also

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
a mild word their guillotine was also

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.470 
a mild word their guillotine was also
brought<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> my<00:00:47.789> attention<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.390> was

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
brought to my attention because it was

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
brought to my attention because it was
designed<00:00:48.750> by<00:00:48.809> Paul<00:00:49.110> Peterson<00:00:49.649> who<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.489> know

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
designed by Paul Peterson who you know

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
designed by Paul Peterson who you know
we<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.090> really<00:00:51.180> talk<00:00:51.660> about<00:00:51.719> his<00:00:51.989> designs

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
we don't really talk about his designs

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
we don't really talk about his designs
but<00:00:52.500> he<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.770> came<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> year<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
but he just came out this year with the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.720 
but he just came out this year with the
smash-up<00:00:54.750> which<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.100> excuse<00:00:56.460> me<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
smash-up which was a if you excuse me a

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.869 
smash-up which was a if you excuse me a
smash<00:00:57.120> hit<00:00:57.170> from<00:00:58.170> AEG<00:00:58.559> Games<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> thought

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
smash hit from AEG Games so I thought

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.979 
smash hit from AEG Games so I thought
it'd<00:00:59.940> be<00:01:00.030> interesting<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.390> take<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> look<00:01:00.809> back

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it'd be interesting to take a look back

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
it'd be interesting to take a look back
at<00:01:01.170> guillotine<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.920> why<00:01:02.190> do<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.340> still

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
at guillotine and see why do I still

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:20.030 
at guillotine and see why do I still
have<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.879> game<00:01:03.120> let's<00:01:03.480> take<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.719> look

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.560 

guillotine<00:01:21.040> requires<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.759> good<00:01:21.970> chunk<00:01:22.329> of<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
guillotine requires a good chunk of the

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.530 
guillotine requires a good chunk of the

much<00:02:09.849> they're<00:02:10.060> worth<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:11.190> then<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.370> draw<00:02:12.640> an

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
much they're worth and then you draw an

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.039 
much they're worth and then you draw an
action<00:02:13.000> card<00:02:13.180> whether<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.480> played<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:13.900> or

now you can see these people here have
different<00:02:17.500> point<00:02:17.739> values<00:02:18.220> as<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:18.640> go<00:02:18.790> by<00:02:19.030> and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
different point values as we go by and

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.850 
different point values as we go by and
you<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.780> see<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.019> there's<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.230> martyr<00:02:20.680> who's

me<00:05:43.780> I<00:05:44.080> think<00:05:44.440> for<00:05:44.800> one<00:05:45.070> because<00:05:45.340> this<00:05:45.729> was

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
me I think for one because this was

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.340 
me I think for one because this was
so<00:05:46.210> long<00:05:46.540> ago<00:05:46.570> and<00:05:47.310> it's<00:05:48.310> so<00:05:48.610> cartoony<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:50.230> it

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
so long ago and it's so cartoony that it

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.440 
so long ago and it's so cartoony that it
doesn't<00:05:50.620> bother<00:05:50.740> me<00:05:50.950> as<00:05:51.160> much<00:05:51.370> maybe<00:05:52.270> it

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
doesn't bother me as much maybe it

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.200 
doesn't bother me as much maybe it
should<00:05:52.750> but<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.770> don't<00:05:54.490> know<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.730> that<00:05:54.970> theme

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
should but I don't know that that theme

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.980

you're<00:06:42.250> just<00:06:42.370> playing<00:06:42.669> at<00:06:42.790> the<00:06:42.880> play<00:06:43.090> it

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
you're just playing at the play it

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.680 
you're just playing at the play it
simple<00:06:43.900> fun<00:06:44.650> and<00:06:45.010> as<00:06:45.550> far<00:06:45.700> as<00:06:45.760> I<00:06:45.940> can<00:06:46.030> tell<00:06:46.300> it's

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
simple fun and as far as I can tell it's

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.890 
simple fun and as far as I can tell it's
so<00:06:47.350> quite<00:06:47.889> a<00:06:47.919> few<00:06:48.040> copies<00:06:48.520> it<00:06:48.940> says<00:06:49.540> here<00:06:49.750> on

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:49.900 
so quite a few copies it says here on

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.800 
so quite a few copies it says here on
the<00:06:50.020> Box<00:06:50.200> 30<00:06:50.560> minutes<00:06:50.919> which<00:06:51.070> i<00:06:51.190> think<00:06:51.250> is<00:06:51.580> is

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:51.810 
the Box 30 minutes which i think is is

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.120 
the Box 30 minutes which i think is is
reasonable<00:06:52.810> two<00:06:52.990> to<00:06:53.110> five<00:06:53.289> players<00:06:53.620> and<00:06:53.950> five

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
reasonable two to five players and five

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.800 
reasonable two to five players and five
players<00:06:54.400> works<00:06:54.700> real<00:06:54.970> fine<00:06:55.180> it's<00:06:55.390> not<00:06:55.510> a<00:06:55.570> game

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
players works real fine it's not a game

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.440 
players works real fine it's not a game
where<00:06:55.930> you<00:06:55.990> sit<00:06:56.169> around<00:06:56.320> and<00:06:56.560> then<00:06:57.130> goes<00:06:57.450> taken

00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:58.450 
where you sit around and then goes taken

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.270 
where you sit around and then goes taken
so<00:06:58.600> long<00:06:58.780> for<00:06:59.020> my<00:06:59.140> turn<00:06:59.320> notes<00:06:59.590> real<00:06:59.890> fast

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
so long for my turn notes real fast

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.100 
so long for my turn notes real fast
you<00:07:00.789> can't<00:07:01.030> play<00:07:01.150> an<00:07:01.240> action<00:07:01.360> card<00:07:01.600> then<00:07:01.900> click

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
you can't play an action card then click

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:05.279 
you can't play an action card then click
the<00:07:02.200> first<00:07:02.380> guy<00:07:02.530> so<00:07:02.910> boom<00:07:03.910> the<00:07:04.750> actually<00:07:05.050> cards

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:05.289 
the first guy so boom the actually cards

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:06.810 
the first guy so boom the actually cards

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
have a decent amount of text on but once

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:07.800 
have a decent amount of text on but once
you<00:07:06.910> know<00:07:07.030> what<00:07:07.120> they're<00:07:07.240> doing<00:07:07.479> it's<00:07:07.570> pretty

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
you know what they're doing it's pretty

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.870 
you know what they're doing it's pretty
fast<00:07:08.080> there's<00:07:08.350> nothing<00:07:08.590> complicated<00:07:09.130> not<00:07:09.850> a

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
fast there's nothing complicated not a

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.909 
fast there's nothing complicated not a
lot<00:07:10.150> of<00:07:10.270> rules<00:07:10.510> what<00:07:11.169> does<00:07:11.260> that<00:07:11.380> card<00:07:11.620> mean

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 
lot of rules what does that card mean

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.010 
lot of rules what does that card mean
