00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
adults that were never handled it's it's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.560 
adults that were never handled it's it's
actually<00:00:49.129> I<00:00:49.309> think<00:00:49.430> it's<00:00:49.790> more<00:00:49.850> stress<00:00:50.390> on

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
actually I think it's more stress on

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.810 
actually I think it's more stress on
them<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.960> try<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.350> take<00:00:52.309> them<00:00:52.489> out<00:00:52.610> of<00:00:52.670> the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
them to try and take them out of the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.399 
them to try and take them out of the
cage<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:53.360> put<00:00:53.390> them<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.750> here<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.170> put<00:00:54.290> them

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409 
cage and put them in here and put them

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.509 
cage and put them in here and put them
back<00:00:54.559> every<00:00:54.979> day<00:00:56.260> so<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.589> just<00:00:57.890> leave<00:00:58.220> them<00:00:58.400> in

back every day so I just leave them in
there<00:00:59.379> it's<00:01:00.379> not<00:01:00.559> really<00:01:00.920> worth<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.339> fight
