00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.220 
replay so look at the Hogs they jumping
over<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> wall<00:02:29.650> but<00:02:29.980> anyways<00:02:30.870> those<00:02:31.870> are<00:02:31.900> some

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
over the wall but anyways those are some

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800 
over the wall but anyways those are some
pigs<00:02:32.650> flying<00:02:33.010> right<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:33.519> anyways<00:02:34.330> though<00:02:34.569> I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
pigs flying right there anyways though I

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.869

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.780 
couldn't record my iPad was
malfunctioning<00:02:37.239> like<00:02:37.780> always<00:02:38.220> so<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.250> decided

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
malfunctioning like always so I decided

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.320 
malfunctioning like always so I decided
to<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.349> rerecord<00:02:41.349> it<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.519> with<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:42.970> attack

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
to just rerecord it but with this attack

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.770 
to just rerecord it but with this attack
this<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.140> what<00:02:44.379> proves<00:02:45.569> everyone<00:02:46.569> wrong

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
one layer of wall which is pathetic and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.910 
one layer of wall which is pathetic and
really<00:03:15.730> all<00:03:15.970> i<00:03:16.329> could<00:03:16.569> blame<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.230> myself<00:03:17.410> for

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920

really all i could blame is myself for
this<00:03:18.069> if<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.790> look<00:03:18.940> closely<00:03:19.150> he<00:03:19.420> does<00:03:19.629> have

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
this if you look closely he does have

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.539 
this if you look closely he does have
those<00:03:20.110> level<00:03:20.560> 3<00:03:20.739> multi-target<00:03:21.160> inferno

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
those level 3 multi-target inferno

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.640 
those level 3 multi-target inferno
towers<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.360> other<00:03:22.540> than<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.349> is<00:03:23.500> just

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
towers but other than that this is just

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.920 
towers but other than that this is just
poorly<00:03:23.980> executed<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:24.790> it<00:03:25.390> really<00:03:25.540> shows<00:03:25.810> that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
poorly executed and it really shows that

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.349 
poorly executed and it really shows that
these<00:03:26.109> bases<00:03:27.069> are<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.220> really<00:03:27.700> underestimates

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
these bases are I really underestimates

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
and I have to stop doing that and it's

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.160 
and I have to stop doing that and it's
really<00:03:30.670> pissing<00:03:31.180> me<00:03:31.209> off<00:03:31.269> how<00:03:31.540> bad<00:03:31.780> I'm<00:03:31.900> doing

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
attack I actually examined it

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.279 
attack I actually examined it
almost<00:04:28.280> too<00:04:28.639> much<00:04:28.910> it's<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.930> point<00:04:30.080> where

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
almost too much it's the point where

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.420 
almost too much it's the point where
last<00:04:30.440> time<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.680> said<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:30.979> know<00:04:31.100> what<00:04:31.160> I<00:04:31.280> got

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
last time I said you know what I got

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.309 
last time I said you know what I got
examine<00:04:31.850> these<00:04:31.940> bases<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.539> lot<00:04:32.870> more<00:04:33.080> where<00:04:33.289> I

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
examine these bases a lot more where I

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.930 
examine these bases a lot more where I
examined<00:04:33.770> it<00:04:33.860> too<00:04:34.009> much<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.490> time<00:04:34.759> runs

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
examined it too much and the time runs

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.360 
examined it too much and the time runs
out<00:04:35.120> so<00:04:35.960> if<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.560> don't<00:04:36.740> know<00:04:36.830> dragons<00:04:37.220> are

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
out so if you don't know dragons are

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.029 
out so if you don't know dragons are
really<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.360> tough<00:04:39.020> clan<00:04:39.349> trip<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:39.710> deal<00:04:39.889> with

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
really a tough clan trip to deal with

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.350 
really a tough clan trip to deal with
not<00:04:40.250> that<00:04:40.400> they<00:04:40.520> do<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.669> lot<00:04:40.849> of<00:04:40.880> damage<00:04:41.120> that

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
not that they do a lot of damage that

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.990 
not that they do a lot of damage that

was one thing I had to deal with and now
I<00:05:29.120> noticed<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:29.900> there<00:05:30.110> was<00:05:30.259> one<00:05:30.289> minute<00:05:30.770> 44

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250

seconds<00:05:31.580> left<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:33.199> actually<00:05:33.349> had<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:33.710> go

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
seconds left and I actually had to go

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.499 
seconds left and I actually had to go
into<00:05:34.039> the<00:05:34.159> base<00:05:34.280> really<00:05:34.639> quickly<00:05:34.970> so<00:05:35.000> as<00:05:35.389> you

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:35.509 
into the base really quickly so as you

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.850 
into the base really quickly so as you
can<00:05:35.599> see<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:35.810> place<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.110> jump<00:05:36.259> spell<00:05:36.500> their<00:05:36.710> and

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
can see I place to jump spell their and

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.310 
can see I place to jump spell their and
now<00:05:36.949> I'm<00:05:37.370> gonna<00:05:37.570> have<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.690> King<00:05:38.900> jump<00:05:39.139> over

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320

then I see how much elixir I have and I

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.029 
then I see how much elixir I have and I
choose<00:06:16.610> the<00:06:16.880> best<00:06:17.030> attack<00:06:17.539> for<00:06:17.840> that<00:06:18.020> so<00:06:18.860> let's

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 
choose the best attack for that so let's

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:21.850 
choose the best attack for that so let's
say<00:06:19.219> I<00:06:19.250> have<00:06:19.690> 500,000<00:06:20.690> elixir<00:06:21.020> I'm<00:06:21.650> going<00:06:21.800> to

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
say I have 500,000 elixir I'm going to

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.200 
say I have 500,000 elixir I'm going to
choose<00:06:22.009> go<00:06:22.310> we<00:06:22.460> be<00:06:22.580> because<00:06:22.849> it's<00:06:23.000> still

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
choose go we be because it's still

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.240 
choose go we be because it's still
effective<00:06:23.870> and<00:06:24.139> I<00:06:24.440> could<00:06:24.650> still<00:06:24.860> save<00:06:25.039> a<00:06:25.070> lot

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250

with this attacked the only problem that

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.740 
with this attacked the only problem that
I<00:06:30.650> had<00:06:30.860> to<00:06:30.949> examine<00:06:31.280> was<00:06:32.120> that<00:06:32.330> I<00:06:32.360> didn't

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
I had to examine was that I didn't

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.390 
I had to examine was that I didn't
execute<00:06:33.050> anything<00:06:33.530> wrong<00:06:33.740> it's<00:06:34.070> the<00:06:34.190> fact

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
execute anything wrong it's the fact

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.060 
execute anything wrong it's the fact
that<00:06:34.520> time

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
that time

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.270 
that time
it's<00:06:35.430> a<00:06:35.520> huge<00:06:35.850> issue<00:06:36.590> and<00:06:37.590> it's<00:06:37.890> not<00:06:38.040> like<00:06:38.130> you

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
it's a huge issue and it's not like you

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.680 
it's a huge issue and it's not like you
can<00:06:38.310> do<00:06:38.550> anything<00:06:38.760> about<00:06:38.940> it<00:06:39.120> I<00:06:39.450> mean<00:06:39.600> you

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
can do anything about it I mean you

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.210 
can do anything about it I mean you
can't<00:06:39.930> I<00:06:40.170> mean<00:06:40.290> supercell<00:06:40.860> could<00:06:41.010> obviously

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
can't I mean supercell could obviously

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.760 
can't I mean supercell could obviously
look<00:06:41.580> add<00:06:42.030> some<00:06:42.450> more<00:06:42.630> time<00:06:42.870> but<00:06:43.140> why<00:06:43.380> why

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
look add some more time but why why

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.170 
look add some more time but why why
would<00:06:43.860> they<00:06:44.010> do<00:06:44.130> that<00:06:44.160> the<00:06:44.520> time<00:06:44.700> is<00:06:44.790> perfectly

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
would they do that the time is perfectly

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.110 
would they do that the time is perfectly
fine<00:06:45.270> and<00:06:46.100> really<00:06:47.100> that<00:06:47.400> is<00:06:47.460> going<00:06:47.730> to<00:06:47.790> end<00:06:47.970> up

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
fine and really that is going to end up

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.790 
fine and really that is going to end up
the<00:06:48.270> battle<00:06:48.600> as<00:06:48.690> you<00:06:48.780> can<00:06:48.930> see<00:06:49.170> I<00:06:49.200> just<00:06:49.560> have<00:06:49.680> an

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.760 
the battle as you can see I just have an
elixir<00:06:50.070> storage<00:06:50.490> to<00:06:51.090> take<00:06:51.270> out<00:06:51.420> here<00:06:51.750> and<00:06:51.900> also
