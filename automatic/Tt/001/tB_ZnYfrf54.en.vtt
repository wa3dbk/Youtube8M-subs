this<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.430> another<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.119> could

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this is another one that you could

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.570 
this is another one that you could
rebuild<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.200> different<00:01:13.590> colors<00:01:13.950> following

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
rebuild in different colors following

the<00:01:14.810> instructions<00:01:15.810> just<00:01:17.299> get<00:01:18.439> maybe<00:01:19.439> get<00:01:19.710> rid

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
the instructions just get maybe get rid

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.280

or yellow or black or whatever color you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.310 
or yellow or black or whatever color you
won't<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.340> build<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> different<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.320> if

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
won't and build it a different way if

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.179 
won't and build it a different way if
you<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.619> those<00:01:25.799> parts<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.460> collection

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
you have those parts in your collection

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.819 
you have those parts in your collection
that<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> mini<00:01:29.790> sports<00:01:30.270> car<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:31.590> will

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that is the mini sports car now will

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
that is the mini sports car now will
build<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.460> other<00:01:33.299> vehicle<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.229> go

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
build the other vehicle I think so go

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.100 
build the other vehicle I think so go
Clark<00:01:34.799> all<00:01:35.790> right<00:01:35.939> there's<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.509> go-cart

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
Clark all right there's the go-cart

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
Clark all right there's the go-cart
Scott<00:01:37.950> taillights<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
Scott taillights on it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.270 
Scott taillights on it
get<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.540> 2<00:01:40.110> cylinder<00:01:40.590> engine<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
get the little 2 cylinder engine in the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.130 
get the little 2 cylinder engine in the
back<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> guess<00:01:42.590> no<00:01:43.590> steering<00:01:43.920> wheel<00:01:44.960> have<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
back I guess no steering wheel have to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.639 
back I guess no steering wheel have to
imagine<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.619> there's<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> steering<00:01:47.310> wheel

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
imagine that there's a steering wheel

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.850 
imagine that there's a steering wheel
that's<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:50.100> clerk<00:01:51.140> he<00:01:52.140> use<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> wheel<00:01:52.619> well

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that's to go clerk he use the wheel well

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:02.050 
that's to go clerk he use the wheel well
there<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.810> middle

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.630 

I<00:02:02.290> think<00:02:03.290> that's<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.560> go<00:02:03.710> Clark<00:02:04.009> what<00:02:04.490> do<00:02:04.549> you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
I think that's a go Clark what do you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.399 
I think that's a go Clark what do you
think<00:02:04.850> this<00:02:05.030> uses<00:02:05.329> the<00:02:05.390> least<00:02:05.600> pieces<00:02:06.110> of<00:02:06.259> any

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
think this uses the least pieces of any

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:07.149 
think this uses the least pieces of any
of<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.590> models

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
of the models

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.070 
of the models
oh<00:02:07.569> right<00:02:08.569> here's<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.310> flatbed<00:02:10.310> truck<00:02:11.080> it

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
oh right here's the flatbed truck it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.699 
oh right here's the flatbed truck it
could<00:02:12.260> be<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:14.140> tractor-trailer<00:02:15.140> let<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> what

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
could be a tractor-trailer let the what

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.130 
could be a tractor-trailer let the what
you<00:02:15.830> did<00:02:16.040> with<00:02:16.190> pull<00:02:16.599> it<00:02:17.599> could<00:02:17.750> be<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.959> cab

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
you did with pull it could be the cab

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.630 
you did with pull it could be the cab
unit<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.709> would<00:02:18.860> pull<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.099> tractor-trailer

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
unit that would pull a tractor-trailer

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
unit that would pull a tractor-trailer
that's<00:02:22.640> kind<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.120> looks<00:02:23.180> like<00:02:23.420> from

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
that's kind of what it looks like from

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.350 
that's kind of what it looks like from
the<00:02:23.810> front<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:25.069> scale<00:02:25.370> seems<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.910> be<00:02:26.030> off<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
the front the scale seems to be off to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.270 
the front the scale seems to be off to
get<00:02:26.450> like<00:02:26.660> little<00:02:26.810> macroscopic<00:02:27.470> in<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.099> have

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
get like little macroscopic in that have

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.850 
get like little macroscopic in that have
to<00:02:28.400> go<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.730> but<00:02:29.230> maybe<00:02:30.230> that's<00:02:30.410> what<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.769> is

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
to go in it but maybe that's what it is

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.360 
to go in it but maybe that's what it is
a<00:02:30.890> big<00:02:31.220> big<00:02:31.610> rig<00:02:31.849> instead<00:02:32.360> of<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.690> flat<00:02:33.319> pitch

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
a big big rig instead of a flat pitch

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.289 
a big big rig instead of a flat pitch
they<00:02:35.299> used<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.780> hinge<00:02:36.459> part<00:02:37.459> right<00:02:37.730> there<00:02:37.970> but

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
they used the hinge part right there but

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.059 
they used the hinge part right there but
it<00:02:38.930> doesn't<00:02:39.230> move<00:02:39.319> out<00:02:39.470> it's<00:02:39.680> made<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.890> look

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
it doesn't move out it's made to look

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.650 
it doesn't move out it's made to look
like<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.310> window<00:02:40.730> I<00:02:40.760> thought<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.239> was<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> neat

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
like a window I thought that was a neat

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.530 
like a window I thought that was a neat
use<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.200> hinge<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:43.150> then<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.269> got<00:02:44.390> your

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
use of the hinge and then you got your

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.960 
use of the hinge and then you got your
cheese<00:02:44.750> slopes<00:02:45.019> in<00:02:45.319> inverted<00:02:46.010> there<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.700> way

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
cheese slopes in inverted there this way

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.940 
cheese slopes in inverted there this way
so<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.510> kind<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.720> looks<00:02:47.900> like<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.049> little<00:02:48.260> window

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
so it kind of looks like a little window

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.160 
so it kind of looks like a little window
is<00:02:49.340> open<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.180> side<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.720> course<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
is open on the side of course the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.530 
is open on the side of course the
mirrors<00:02:51.560> seem<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.010> be<00:02:52.099> too<00:02:52.280> far<00:02:52.519> back<00:02:52.760> or<00:02:53.000> maybe

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
mirrors seem to be too far back or maybe

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.759 
mirrors seem to be too far back or maybe
that's<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.810> door<00:02:53.989> handles<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.440> think<00:02:54.620> they've

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
that's the door handles I think they've

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.729 
that's the door handles I think they've
built<00:02:55.310> light<00:02:55.459> mirrors<00:02:56.290> but<00:02:57.290> hey<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:57.470> know

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
built light mirrors but hey you know

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.390 
built light mirrors but hey you know
it's<00:02:57.890> my<00:02:58.040> macro<00:02:58.730> scale<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.480> it's<00:02:59.630> pretty<00:02:59.900> neat

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
it's my macro scale so it's pretty neat

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.500 
it's my macro scale so it's pretty neat
so<00:03:01.400> that's<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.730> trick<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.000> which<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.299> the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
so that's the trick so which of the

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.570 
so that's the trick so which of the
three<00:03:02.720> was<00:03:02.870> your<00:03:03.080> favorite<00:03:03.410> we<00:03:03.500> had<00:03:03.739> in<00:03:04.310> the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.289 
the go-kart and the little truck so
that's<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:14.989> three-in-one<00:03:15.350> creator<00:03:15.829> set<00:03:16.420> I

that's the three-in-one creator set I

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.640

wish<00:03:20.299> these<00:03:20.510> would<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:20.959> be<00:03:21.109> poly<00:03:21.380> bags

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
wish these would just be poly bags

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.229 
wish these would just be poly bags
instead<00:03:22.100> of<00:03:22.190> having<00:03:22.340> these<00:03:22.459> little<00:03:22.640> canisters

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
instead of having these little canisters

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:24.520 
instead of having these little canisters
because<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.630> pay<00:03:23.870> in<00:03:24.019> there<00:03:24.230> for<00:03:24.410> this
