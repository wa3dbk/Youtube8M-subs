00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.680
 welcome friends with you see today 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.720
 we have an interesting video about regimental battles 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.240
 what is available now and what will be introduced 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.550
 Next update Iâ€™ll say for 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.150
 The participation of such battles requires a minimum of 8 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.280
 person 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.860
 so on the evening he entered the community 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.570
 Fu Fu for tests of this mode on this 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.390
 moment regimental battles represent 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.340
 fargo battle 8 for 8 before the fight you can 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.739
 unite the view it's comfortable your 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.450
 partner will be highlighted in green total 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.239
 dump you will be easier to come to the rescue 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.460
 your link you have typed aircraft 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.840
 not necessarily one nation can 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.480
 select the optimal setup 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.910
 for example now in fights I see often 2 a 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.970
 that and 4 x 50 which quickly captures 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.740
 height in order to lower the enemy but 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.690
 the main group is already striking 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.360
 got an advantage thanks to the work 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.160
 x50 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.619
 but there were also cunning who take the link 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.240
 one top aircraft for example saber and 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.600
 falls into and against the third era and 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.970
 Needless to say, this is not 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.759
 gods so balance the view at the moment 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.860
 now let's talk about the changes 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.960
 extensions the possibility of regimental battles in 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.150
 next update first change 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.140
 this is the appearance of five leagues in number 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.909
 technology ranks 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.040
 this will avoid surprises 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.440
 which are happening now regimental battles 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.130
 when 8 aircraft retailers are fighting 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.659
 against 7 aircraft 3 p a and 1 saibra 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.729
 in the future may be introduced and 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:53.290
 other additional formats for example 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.150
 16 to 16 rivals in the regimental battles will be 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.229
 match duel 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.909
 team rating 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.369
 team rating will be calculated 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.590
 as the average rating of all 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.600
 team players ie every player 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.970
 will also have your side rating 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.649
 battles in one word team of extras 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.620
 will more often balance against the same 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.120
 extras for players of regimental battles 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.430
 will be introduced such a thing as aging 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.379
 literally it will look like this once in 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.900
 a week if the player does not play lacquer 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.269
 fights his rating decreases for the first 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.780
 week at 10 percent for the second at 20 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.760
 percent 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.060
 starting from the third week and every 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.349
 a further 50 percent 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.950
 natural rating will never fall 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.290
 below zero 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.930
 I will note that these statistics are updated 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.230
 right after the fight and no need 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.870
 wait now for a set of regimental glasses 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.849
 battles victory over stronger 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.950
 adversary with a high rated team 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.349
 increases personal rating of a player and 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.569
 victory over the weaker does not increase 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.150
 completely or slightly increases 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.790
 thus the total contribution of each player 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.450
 very important for the team especially if it is 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.799
 occupies high positions in the rating so far 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.920
 each player will be able to see personal 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.720
 regimental rating on the stick page for now 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.400
 what is it all but me anyway 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.049
 like the steps in the development of the regimental 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.180
 functional is a good way 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.790
 face off before appear 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.909
 real effect with fights on global 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.980
 map on the ground water and air was 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.840
 interesting then subscribe to the channel and 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.849
