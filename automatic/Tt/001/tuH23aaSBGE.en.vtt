 how long have you been dancing this is my 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.650
 third year that I was dancing on behalf of 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.170
 the school and what is needed 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.680
 to belong to this dance team 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.260
 you have to audition with the 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.710
 teacher and she teaches you a few 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.409
 steps as they are like four with accounts 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.019
 of 8 and you also have to discriminate 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.939
 and judges come and you go and now 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.740
 decide if you can enter the group of 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.930
 dance but there are also so that barely 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.150

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.420
 qualification 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.920

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.910

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:29.120

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.860
 I'm not nobody else, it's just me and everyone 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.440
 see how I dance because I like the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.530

 in dance class learn two steps to the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.060
 tip of the letter as the teacher the 28 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.540
 accounts and we have to be all the same 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.880

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.680
