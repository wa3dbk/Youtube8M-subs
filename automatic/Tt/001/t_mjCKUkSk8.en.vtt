00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
drive this is the next back best method

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.799 
drive this is the next back best method
to<00:00:40.230> ensure<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.590> your<00:00:41.280> data<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.879> gone<00:00:42.420> and

to ensure that your data is gone and
you'll<00:00:43.230> still<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> working<00:00:43.950> hard<00:00:44.160> drive

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you'll still have a working hard drive

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.840 
you'll still have a working hard drive
so<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> begin<00:00:46.190> we're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:49.489> do<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> Google

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so to begin we're going to do a Google

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.450 
so to begin we're going to do a Google
search<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.059> ubcd<00:00:52.129> that's<00:00:53.129> short<00:00:53.370> for

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
going to be using boot and nuke so we're

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
going to be using boot and nuke so we're
going<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.610> go<00:03:02.700> ahead<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:02.970> hit<00:03:03.030> enter<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:05.480> then

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
going to go ahead and hit enter and then

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.940 
going to go ahead and hit enter and then
we're<00:03:06.630> going<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.810> go<00:03:06.960> ahead<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:08.450> start<00:03:09.450> in

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
we're going to go ahead and start in

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.810 
we're going to go ahead and start in
interactive<00:03:10.950> mode<00:03:11.130> so<00:03:11.340> we're<00:03:11.490> just<00:03:11.520> going<00:03:11.760> to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
interactive mode so we're just going to

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.460 
interactive mode so we're just going to
hit<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.000> enter<00:03:12.570> key<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:18.120> may<00:03:18.240> take<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.570> few

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
hit the enter key and it may take a few

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.650 
hit the enter key and it may take a few
moments<00:03:19.760> to<00:03:22.459> register<00:03:23.459> our<00:03:23.490> USB<00:03:24.030> devices<00:03:24.330> and

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
moments to register our USB devices and

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.510 
moments to register our USB devices and
drives<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.770> we're<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.070> going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.340> give<00:03:26.490> that

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
drives so we're just going to give that

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.030 
drives so we're just going to give that
a<00:03:26.670> second<00:03:29.450> sometimes<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:31.410> can<00:03:31.590> take<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.800> few

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
a second sometimes it can take a few

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.510 
a second sometimes it can take a few
minutes<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:32.610> just<00:03:33.060> be<00:03:33.570> patient<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:37.400> there<00:03:38.400> we

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
minutes so just be patient and there we

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.350 
minutes so just be patient and there we
are

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
are

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.250 
are

so on this screen you're going to be

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.650 
so on this screen you're going to be
presented<00:03:44.740> with<00:03:44.770> your<00:03:45.040> various<00:03:46.000> disks<00:03:46.450> and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
presented with your various disks and

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.490 
presented with your various disks and
partitions<00:03:47.140> in<00:03:48.210> this<00:03:49.210> example<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:49.990> going<00:03:50.320> to

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
partitions in this example I'm going to

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.610 
partitions in this example I'm going to
format<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:52.260> flash<00:03:53.260> drive<00:03:54.960> an<00:03:55.960> 8<00:03:56.140> gig<00:03:56.350> flash

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
format a flash drive an 8 gig flash

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.060 
format a flash drive an 8 gig flash
drive<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:58.150> can<00:03:59.020> change<00:03:59.320> the<00:03:59.530> options<00:03:59.620> such

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
drive so you can change the options such

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.490 
drive so you can change the options such
as<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.630> method<00:04:01.630> or<00:04:02.160> how<00:04:03.160> many<00:04:03.220> rounds<00:04:04.020> so<00:04:05.020> for

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
as the method or how many rounds so for

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.120 
as the method or how many rounds so for
instance<00:04:05.830> if<00:04:06.010> you<00:04:06.250> hit<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.180> M<00:04:07.480> key<00:04:07.950> you'll<00:04:08.950> be

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
instance if you hit the M key you'll be

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.370 
instance if you hit the M key you'll be
given<00:04:09.490> some<00:04:10.090> choices<00:04:10.300> on<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.660> various<00:04:11.170> wipe

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
given some choices on the various wipe

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.950 
given some choices on the various wipe
methods<00:04:11.860> by<00:04:12.520> default<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.210> selects<00:04:13.720> the

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
methods by default it selects the

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.340 
methods by default it selects the
department<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.770> defense<00:04:15.190> short<00:04:15.820> wipe<00:04:16.350> there

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
department of defense short wipe there

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.410 
department of defense short wipe there
also<00:04:17.620> is<00:04:17.980> a<00:04:18.130> Department<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.640> Defense<00:04:18.700> standard

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
also is a Department of Defense standard

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.500 
also is a Department of Defense standard
wipe<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.769> few<00:04:21.040> other<00:04:21.310> choices<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:22.330> we'll

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
wipe and a few other choices so we'll

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.060 
wipe and a few other choices so we'll
just<00:04:22.750> stay<00:04:23.020> with<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.500> DoD<00:04:24.460> short<00:04:24.940> wipe<00:04:25.180> and

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
just stay with the DoD short wipe and

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
just stay with the DoD short wipe and
then<00:04:27.070> we<00:04:27.250> can<00:04:27.550> go<00:04:28.420> into<00:04:29.310> rounds<00:04:30.310> by<00:04:30.430> pressing<00:04:30.850> R

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
then we can go into rounds by pressing R

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.820 
then we can go into rounds by pressing R
and<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.920> can<00:04:33.220> specify<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.480> number<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.560> times

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
and you can specify the number of times

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.720 
and you can specify the number of times
to<00:04:36.070> run<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.370> white<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:38.410> more<00:04:39.250> paranoid

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
to run the white the more paranoid

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.450 
to run the white the more paranoid
people<00:04:40.150> can<00:04:40.540> increase<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.680> number<00:04:41.920> of<00:04:41.980> rounds

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
people can increase the number of rounds

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.850 
people can increase the number of rounds
just<00:04:42.790> to<00:04:43.450> be<00:04:43.960> certain<00:04:44.350> that<00:04:44.500> everything's

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
just to be certain that everything's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.180 
just to be certain that everything's
gone<00:04:45.070> but<00:04:45.750> for<00:04:46.750> most<00:04:46.930> people<00:04:47.350> one<00:04:47.950> round

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
gone but for most people one round

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.720 
gone but for most people one round
should<00:04:48.490> definitely<00:04:48.940> suffice<00:04:49.660> so<00:04:50.730> you're

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
should definitely suffice so you're

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.530 
should definitely suffice so you're
