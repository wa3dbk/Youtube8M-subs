00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
evolution of the d600 aka that means

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.850 
evolution of the d600 aka that means
we've<00:00:44.489> corrected<00:00:44.940> whatever<00:00:45.539> oil<00:00:45.930> spot<00:00:46.379> issues

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
we've corrected whatever oil spot issues

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.950 
we've corrected whatever oil spot issues
we<00:00:47.070> were<00:00:47.190> having<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.789> least<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.300> hope<00:00:48.570> they

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
we were having at least we hope they

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
we were having at least we hope they
have<00:00:49.200> because<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.100> think<00:00:50.129> about

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
have because you have to think about

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
have because you have to think about
this<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.969> d600<00:00:51.469> came<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.949> year

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
this the d600 came out about a year

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.090 
this the d600 came out about a year
before<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:54.510> camera<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> quick

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
before this camera that is a quick

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.360 
before this camera that is a quick
turnaround<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.629> basically<00:00:58.079> replace<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
turnaround time to basically replace a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.150 
turnaround time to basically replace a
model<00:01:00.000> usually<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.809> least<00:01:00.960> two<00:01:01.230> years<00:01:01.500> or

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
model usually it's at least two years or

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.340 
model usually it's at least two years or
well<00:01:02.910> eighteen<00:01:03.359> months<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.690> two<00:01:03.989> years<00:01:04.019> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
well eighteen months to two years so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.410 
well eighteen months to two years so
that's<00:01:05.070> something<00:01:05.519> interesting<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:06.030> let's<00:01:06.240> go

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that's something interesting so let's go

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.820 
that's something interesting so let's go
through<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> specs<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.619> what's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
through the specs and see what's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.250 
through the specs and see what's
actually<00:01:07.979> changed<00:01:08.850> other<00:01:09.090> than<00:01:09.600> making<00:01:09.840> its<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
actually changed other than making its a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.929 
actually changed other than making its a
6/10<00:01:10.890> instead<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:13.010> 606<00:01:14.010> frames<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.520> second

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
6/10 instead of 606 frames a second

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
6/10 instead of 606 frames a second

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
a big change right there

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.850 
a big change right there
it<00:01:20.820> now<00:01:21.030> has<00:01:21.210> quiet<00:01:21.570> continuous<00:01:22.380> mode<00:01:22.619> at

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
it now has quiet continuous mode at

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.190 
it now has quiet continuous mode at
three<00:01:23.130> frames<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.580> second<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.630> if<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> want<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
three frames a second for if you want to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
three frames a second for if you want to
have<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.560> slightly<00:01:26.070> less<00:01:26.520> louder

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
have a little slightly less louder

shutter when you're shooting
continuously<00:01:28.950> you're<00:01:29.189> still<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> hear

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
continuously you're still going to hear

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
continuously you're still going to hear
it<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.360> an<00:01:30.450> option<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.079> give<00:01:31.229> you

it so it's an option that they give you
better<00:01:32.159> white<00:01:32.520> balance<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.020> most

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
better white balance this is the most

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
better white balance this is the most
exciting<00:01:34.770> thing<00:01:34.799> about<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.400> camera<00:01:35.689> yippee

you're<00:01:43.110> shooting<00:01:43.259> raw<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.860> basically

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you're shooting raw you can basically

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
you're shooting raw you can basically
make<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.240> change<00:01:45.479> when<00:01:45.720> you're<00:01:45.840> done<00:01:46.049> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.170 
make that change when you're done so
here<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.220> same<00:01:47.790> 24<00:01:48.180> megapixel<00:01:48.990> sensor<00:01:49.350> same

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
here we go same 24 megapixel sensor same

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.880 
here we go same 24 megapixel sensor same
thirty-nine<00:01:51.180> point<00:01:51.630> AF<00:01:52.110> system<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.740> they're

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
thirty-nine point AF system so they're

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
thirty-nine point AF system so they're
still<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.340> clumped<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> middle

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
still going to be clumped in the middle

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.359 
still going to be clumped in the middle
like<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:54.990> were<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.380> other<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.829> god

think that anybody looking to get out of
the<00:04:02.989> DX<00:04:03.350> range<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.920> jump<00:04:04.130> into<00:04:04.250> FX<00:04:04.700> glass<00:04:05.030> and

the DX range and jump into FX glass and
FX<00:04:05.540> bodies<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.530> 610<00:04:07.190> is<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.430> good<00:04:07.970> place

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
FX bodies that the 610 is a good place
