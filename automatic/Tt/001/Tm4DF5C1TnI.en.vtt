 space guardian does not fight against evil 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.880

 planet not explored my eyeballs 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:25.320

 beyond the sun 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.860
 on a silver boat 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.360
 I do not finish 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.040
 and finally puddle 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:10.990
 I learned who I am and what I do here is 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.990
 a toy you can not fly not 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.040
 serious 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.040

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.010
 are you thinking well if woody for the first 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.260
 once I think clearly I was right in 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.960
 I'm not a guardian of space 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:42.140
 a negligible toy right on 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.270
 taiwan hey do not you wait the toy is 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.440
 much better than being a guardian of 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:50.270
 space but if it's serious look at that 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.280
 house and a child who believes you are the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.950
 maximum and it's not because you're a guardian 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.890
 of space but because you are a toy 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.330
 you are his toy and me so that 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:05.210
 I would like it because I loved you or you look at yourself 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.700
 you are a buzz lightyear any toy 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.130
 I would give anything to be you 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.840
 rooms shine in the dark 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:18.370
 your helmet to cesc to that house but it's a 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.370
 fantastic toy 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.940
 in fact too fantastic 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.190
 why 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.910
 what's the advantage of a toy like me with 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.480
 a figure lakers in action the only thing 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.480
 What can I do? 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.740
 at my wedding 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.050
 because he's going to want to play andy with me 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.449
 having you still doubt it of portland 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.889
 it will be fun until he grows up like this 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.009
 I like cowboy friend 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.259
 also when it happens I would have my post there 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.710
 that go making me company in the 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.710
 infinite
