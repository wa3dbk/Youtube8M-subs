00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.030
 today we are going to prepare a tiramisu without 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.680
 egg 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.860
 the ingredients that we are going to verify 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.600
 they are one kilo of mascarpone cheese 250 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.969
 grams of sugar glas a shot of 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.820
 coffee liqueur 300 grams of biscuits 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.090
 soletilla 250 milliliters of coffee and cocoa 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.560
 powder for decoration we are going to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.830
 take the weight and with the help of some 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.010
 We are going to stir a bit of rod 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.780
 let us be softer once what 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.030
 we have with one is softer we are going to 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.550
 add more or less half of the sugar 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.010
 glas in which I have previously 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.679
 sifted so that we do not remain raw 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.410
 once we have it mixed more or less 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.140
 well with sugar and cheese 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.280
 we add the other half of the sugar that 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.559
 we had to mix again well as 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.809
 You see, this is what we have ready 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.210
 we add the shot of coffee liqueur if 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.359
 you do not have coffee liquor, you can add 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.640
 rum with coffee liqueur amaretto or whatever 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.640
 you have remember before that osse 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.880
 for himself a little coffee 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.530
 and we will add well if you think a lot 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.940
 the amount of a shot you can 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.659
 add a little less and go testing 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.760
 you depending on how you like the software 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.600
 where we have it well mixed already 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.390
 we have the dough the cream prepared from 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.540
 tiramisu let's take a mold of 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.909
 crystal has to be a mold that is 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.820
 deep and we're going to take the biscuits from 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.550
 soletilla and we are going to place them 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 covering the entire base well to the base 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.180
 we squeeze a little bit and let's take the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.610
 coffee can be a coffee that freshly made 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.229
 what does have to be cold or not 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.119
 from the previous day that you are worth equal and 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.390
 still new also normal is coffee 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.250
 soluble diluted in water as you see this 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.539
 it's a good amount of coffee because 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:58.050
 the cake has to be very good 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:02.990
 soaked coffee and now we add the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.990
 first layer of tiramisu cream 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.500
 to put it as realistic as possible and we're going 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.020
 with the next layer of the biscuits 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 we do the same again as you see in 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.850
 the second layer is also the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.450
 problem because since the cake is going 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.270
 to suck all the coffee 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.140
 let's put the other layer 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.940
 and we're going with the last layer of the 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.370
 biscuits as you see in the last layer 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.600
 as there were several pieces left 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.370
 without covering I have picked up a biscuit and with 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.110
 little pieces then I covered a little bit 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.460
 little and we're going to put through the coffee 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.590
 I tell you, you do not behave while in the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.590
 coffee because they have to be very 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.100
 wet coffee so it's staying 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.770
 other cosos and now as you see we are going to 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.360
 have two options to decorate it you can 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.900
 use a pastry bag and a mouthpiece 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.360
 of round well 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.350
 big and go doing mounds like this but 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.570
 for this technique it has to be the 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.430
 very cold cream you would have it 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.230
 put in the fridge and then decorate it 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.640
 but I like I want it smooth I'm going to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.800
 leverage it has already put it all 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.650
 on top it is better distributed with the 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.940
 spoon help I put it as much 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.090
 liquid possible 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.420
 now let's clean 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.610
 the edges of the mold so that we stay 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.580
 well epic now we are not asked much in 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.800
 the cocoa you have already used a little bit the 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.840
 teaspoon a little more cocoa in 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.480
 powder without sugar you do not have to finish 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.519
 propulsion sugar is worth any type 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.519
 of cocoa powder that you have covered 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 all right 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.240
 all the tiramisu 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.319
 As you can see, you have to cover until you 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:58.670
 note any clear piece of the cream 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.099
 and once we have it well covered with 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.489
 Cocoa does not take you away either 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:08.150
 a good cocoa layer as it will be 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.950
 great and now we are going to clean well 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.739
 the edges of the mold also for 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.480
 remove the excess cocoa and 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.120
 we will cool in the fridge during 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.120
 about 4 or 6 hours or better of a day for 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.590
 the other to be the cream well 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.169
 firm and as you see 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.789
 this is a tiramisu very easy to make and 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.759
 very rich even though it brings us the 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.849
 I assure you that the taste does not 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:34.000
 you will notice that it is without egg I hope that 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.000
 I like you
