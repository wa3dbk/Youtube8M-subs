the<00:01:04.650> imprint<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:06.650> now<00:01:07.650> today<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> ran<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the imprint in now today I ran the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.870 
the imprint in now today I ran the
calibration<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.560> turn<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.119> multi<00:01:12.119> EQ<00:01:12.630> on

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
calibration and to turn that multi EQ on

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
calibration and to turn that multi EQ on
you<00:01:14.880> hold<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.270> button<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.900> turn<00:01:16.500> your<00:01:16.710> curve

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
you hold this button and turn your curve

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.719 
you hold this button and turn your curve
on<00:01:18.110> I've<00:01:19.110> only<00:01:19.320> written<00:01:19.590> one<00:01:19.740> curve<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
on I've only written one curve to it I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.310 
on I've only written one curve to it I
did<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> curve<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> driver's<00:01:21.930> seat<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
did a curve for the driver's seat and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.710 
did a curve for the driver's seat and
then<00:01:22.439> I'm<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> curve<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.270> entire

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
then I'm gonna do a curve for the entire

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.520 
then I'm gonna do a curve for the entire
vehicle<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.470> curve<00:01:25.710> -<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:28.080> makes<00:01:28.259> sense<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.799> me

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
vehicle on curve - it makes sense to me

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.170 
vehicle on curve - it makes sense to me
but<00:01:31.530> after<00:01:31.740> multi<00:01:32.400> EQ<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
but after multi EQ in it with the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.929 
but after multi EQ in it with the
microphone<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.590> sound<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.700> but

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939

with my Kappa Series separates and then
I<00:02:19.640> got<00:02:19.940> these<00:02:20.780> two<00:02:21.140> infinities<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.250> doors

then<00:02:22.970> they<00:02:23.090> got<00:02:23.240> Alpine<00:02:23.660> six<00:02:24.020> by<00:02:24.200> 9s<00:02:24.560> in<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
then they got Alpine six by 9s in the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.730 
then they got Alpine six by 9s in the

now that I'm all tight EQ did the sound

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.930 
now that I'm all tight EQ did the sound
is<00:02:56.150> really<00:02:56.540> good<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.730> really<00:02:58.730> missed

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
is really good and I I really missed

is really good and I I really missed
this<00:02:59.150> just<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.600> standard<00:02:59.840> bass<00:03:00.170> treble

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
this just the standard bass treble

control for while you're driving because
it's<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.140> lot<00:03:03.320> easier<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:05.019> after<00:03:06.019> multi

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
it's just a lot easier but after multi

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.750 
it's just a lot easier but after multi
EQ<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.769> it

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
EQ in it

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.710 
EQ in it
the<00:03:08.180> sound<00:03:08.450> quality<00:03:09.080> is<00:03:09.110> really<00:03:09.560> good<00:03:09.739> it's<00:03:10.720> it

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
the sound quality is really good it's it

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.970 
the sound quality is really good it's it
just<00:03:11.750> made<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.739> nice<00:03:12.980> little<00:03:13.040> difference<00:03:14.980> I

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
just made a nice little difference I

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.680 
just made a nice little difference I
don't<00:03:16.519> know<00:03:16.610> if<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.820> could<00:03:17.000> recommend<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.600> or

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
don't know if I could recommend it or

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.880 
don't know if I could recommend it or
not<00:03:17.870> because<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.230> doesn't<00:03:18.500> sound<00:03:18.650> much

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
not because it doesn't sound much

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.069 
not because it doesn't sound much
different<00:03:18.950> than<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.610> did<00:03:19.760> without<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.209> without

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
different than it did without it without

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.940 
different than it did without it without
the<00:03:21.410> imprint<00:03:21.860> box<00:03:22.070> hooked<00:03:22.340> up<00:03:22.579> so<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:24.739> don't

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
the imprint box hooked up so I don't

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.949 
the imprint box hooked up so I don't
know<00:03:25.040> kind<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.549> a<00:03:25.640> judgment<00:03:25.880> call<00:03:26.209> but<00:03:26.540> I'm

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
know kind of a judgment call but I'm

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.319 
know kind of a judgment call but I'm
gonna<00:03:27.079> test<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.560> out<00:03:27.680> some<00:03:27.920> more<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.180> I'll<00:03:29.180> let

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
gonna test it out some more and I'll let

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.890 
gonna test it out some more and I'll let
you<00:03:29.420> guys<00:03:29.570> know<00:03:29.600> what<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.959> think<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:32.209> far<00:03:32.480> I'm

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
you guys know what I think so far I'm

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.110 
you guys know what I think so far I'm
not<00:03:32.959> really<00:03:33.410> that<00:03:33.620> impressed<00:03:34.130> but<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.940> did

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
not really that impressed but it did

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.819 
not really that impressed but it did
make<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.329> difference<00:03:38.350> compared<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:39.440> deck<00:03:39.680> I

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
make a difference compared to the deck I

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.530 
make a difference compared to the deck I
had<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.370> I<00:03:40.459> think<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.850> was<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.269> CD<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:42.519> 98<00:03:43.540> 27

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
had and I think it was the CD a 98 27

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.060 
had and I think it was the CD a 98 27
and<00:03:45.880> I<00:03:46.880> think<00:03:47.120> sounded<00:03:47.480> amazing<00:03:47.810> but<00:03:48.590> this

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
and I think sounded amazing but this

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.509 
and I think sounded amazing but this
deck<00:03:49.310> here<00:03:49.610> is<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.829> mean<00:03:51.829> it's<00:03:51.980> like<00:03:52.100> seven

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
deck here is I mean it's like seven

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.550 
deck here is I mean it's like seven
years<00:03:52.549> newer<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.360> I<00:03:53.720> don't<00:03:54.019> know<00:03:54.200> it's<00:03:54.410> almost

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
years newer and I don't know it's almost

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.890 
years newer and I don't know it's almost
like<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.920> step<00:03:55.670> backwards<00:03:56.209> as<00:03:56.329> far<00:03:56.540> as<00:03:56.660> sound

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
like a step backwards as far as sound

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.800 
like a step backwards as far as sound
quality<00:03:57.290> but<00:03:57.470> I'm<00:03:57.620> still<00:03:58.480> still<00:03:59.480> trying<00:03:59.720> to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
quality but I'm still still trying to

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.720 
quality but I'm still still trying to
figure<00:04:00.079> it<00:04:00.110> out<00:04:00.320> it's<00:04:00.829> got<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.040> lot<00:04:01.250> of<00:04:01.280> complex

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
figure it out it's got a lot of complex

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.630 
figure it out it's got a lot of complex

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
the microphone without the microphone

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.730 
the microphone without the microphone
it<00:04:27.990> sounds<00:04:28.620> alright<00:04:28.980> but<00:04:29.370> it's<00:04:30.440> it's<00:04:31.440> really

it sounds alright but it's it's really
no<00:04:31.890> comparison<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.240> few<00:04:33.510> multi<00:04:33.900> EQ<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:36.800> so<00:04:37.800> I

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
no comparison to a few multi EQ it so I

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.880 
no comparison to a few multi EQ it so I
would<00:04:38.280> definitely<00:04:38.730> get<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:40.620> sound

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
would definitely get it the sound

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.970 
would definitely get it the sound

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.320 
Imaging is amazing I'm really happy with
it<00:04:45.110> for<00:04:46.110> my<00:04:46.200> first<00:04:46.470> try<00:04:46.740> them<00:04:46.860> through<00:04:47.330> it

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
it for my first try them through it

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.350 
it for my first try them through it
worked<00:04:48.540> pretty<00:04:48.750> good<00:04:49.020> like<00:04:49.590> I<00:04:49.740> said<00:04:49.950> I<00:04:49.980> did<00:04:50.250> the

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
worked pretty good like I said I did the

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.030 
worked pretty good like I said I did the
driver's<00:04:51.360> seat<00:04:51.540> for<00:04:51.600> curb<00:04:52.260> one<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.830> then<00:04:52.920> the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
driver's seat for curb one and then the

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.990 
driver's seat for curb one and then the
whole<00:04:53.220> vehicle<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.240> curve<00:04:54.510> two<00:04:55.730> on<00:04:56.730> the

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
whole vehicle for the curve two on the

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.050 
whole vehicle for the curve two on the
curve<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.980> seems<00:04:59.220> like<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.490> driver's<00:04:59.880> side

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
curve to it seems like the driver's side

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.480 
curve to it seems like the driver's side
is<00:05:00.210> a<00:05:00.300> little<00:05:00.450> bit<00:05:00.630> louder<00:05:00.840> than<00:05:01.020> the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
is a little bit louder than the

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.090 
is a little bit louder than the
passenger<00:05:02.490> side<00:05:03.380> but<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.410> just<00:05:04.770> tweaked<00:05:05.010> the

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
passenger side but I just tweaked the

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.230 
passenger side but I just tweaked the
balance<00:05:05.430> over<00:05:05.730> like<00:05:06.860> two<00:05:07.860> notches<00:05:08.240> towards

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
balance over like two notches towards

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.450 
balance over like two notches towards
the<00:05:09.360> right<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.260> worked<00:05:10.440> out<00:05:10.560> perfectly

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.020 

yeah<00:05:14.460> so<00:05:14.970> yeah<00:05:15.510> it's<00:05:15.840> pretty<00:05:15.960> amazing<00:05:16.260> the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
yeah so yeah it's pretty amazing the

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.410 
yeah so yeah it's pretty amazing the
sound<00:05:18.030> quality<00:05:18.450> is<00:05:18.480> just<00:05:20.060> that's<00:05:21.060> pretty

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
sound quality is just that's pretty

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.320 
sound quality is just that's pretty
optimal<00:05:22.130> you<00:05:23.130> don't<00:05:23.310> even<00:05:23.460> really<00:05:23.640> that's<00:05:24.150> why

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
optimal you don't even really that's why

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.390 
optimal you don't even really that's why
once<00:05:24.840> you<00:05:25.020> do<00:05:25.170> the<00:05:25.320> multi<00:05:25.620> EQ<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.220> don't

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
once you do the multi EQ you don't

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.440 
once you do the multi EQ you don't
really<00:05:26.580> need<00:05:26.880> the<00:05:27.180> Equalization<00:05:28.110> features<00:05:29.450> it

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
really need the Equalization features it

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.030 
really need the Equalization features it
just<00:05:30.630> gives<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.020> bass<00:05:31.170> and<00:05:31.410> treble<00:05:31.590> again

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
just gives you the bass and treble again

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.500 
just gives you the bass and treble again
which<00:05:32.340> I<00:05:32.670> prefer<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:35.060> played<00:05:36.060> with<00:05:36.150> the<00:05:36.300> last

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
which I prefer I played with the last

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.320 
which I prefer I played with the last
couple<00:05:36.690> days<00:05:36.960> without<00:05:37.400> calibrating<00:05:38.400> it<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.880> I

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
couple days without calibrating it and I

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.570 
couple days without calibrating it and I
wasn't<00:05:40.020> really<00:05:40.230> that<00:05:40.380> happy<00:05:40.650> with<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:41.160> but<00:05:41.370> now

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
wasn't really that happy with it but now

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.430 
wasn't really that happy with it but now
that<00:05:41.610> I've<00:05:41.910> DQ'd<00:05:42.360> it<00:05:42.540> and<00:05:42.660> everything<00:05:42.960> I'm<00:05:43.110> I

just<00:05:52.440> did<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.920> multi<00:05:53.330> calibration<00:05:54.330> for

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
just did the multi calibration for

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:02.850 
just did the multi calibration for
all<00:05:56.470> six<00:05:56.889> positions<00:05:58.050> and<00:06:00.449> it<00:06:01.449> sounds<00:06:01.960> really

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
all six positions and it sounds really

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.749 
all six positions and it sounds really
amazing<00:06:03.130> I<00:06:03.669> I<00:06:05.070> definitely<00:06:06.070> like<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.400> way<00:06:06.520> it

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
amazing I I definitely like the way it

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:10.860 
amazing I I definitely like the way it
made<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.539> deck<00:06:07.750> sound<00:06:08.110> normal<00:06:09.780> when<00:06:10.780> you

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
made the deck sound normal when you

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.680 
made the deck sound normal when you
first<00:06:11.050> plug<00:06:11.320> in<00:06:11.530> the<00:06:11.650> imprint<00:06:12.100> mod<00:06:12.880> or<00:06:13.360> a<00:06:13.389> box

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
first plug in the imprint mod or a box

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.620 
first plug in the imprint mod or a box
you're<00:06:14.460> without<00:06:15.460> running<00:06:15.639> the<00:06:15.759> calibration

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
you're without running the calibration

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.540 
you're without running the calibration
you're<00:06:16.930> not<00:06:17.080> quite<00:06:17.320> sure<00:06:17.350> if<00:06:17.860> you<00:06:18.280> made<00:06:18.400> the

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
you're not quite sure if you made the

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.400 
you're not quite sure if you made the
right<00:06:18.669> decision<00:06:18.729> but<00:06:19.570> after<00:06:20.139> going<00:06:20.350> through

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
right decision but after going through

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.439 
right decision but after going through
all<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.860> calibration<00:06:21.550> procedures<00:06:22.120> and

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:22.449 
all the calibration procedures and

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:25.529 
all the calibration procedures and
everything<00:06:22.889> I<00:06:23.889> feel<00:06:24.669> like<00:06:24.850> it<00:06:25.300> made<00:06:25.509> a

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
everything I feel like it made a

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.659 
everything I feel like it made a
definite<00:06:26.020> difference<00:06:26.199> especially<00:06:27.039> when<00:06:27.430> you

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
definite difference especially when you

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:30.689 
definite difference especially when you
put<00:06:27.850> it<00:06:27.940> on<00:06:28.000> driver<00:06:28.949> it<00:06:29.949> just<00:06:30.190> directs<00:06:30.490> the

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
put it on driver it just directs the

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.719 
put it on driver it just directs the
soundstage<00:06:31.300> towards<00:06:31.900> your<00:06:32.169> head<00:06:32.410> and<00:06:32.830> I<00:06:33.490> just

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
soundstage towards your head and I just

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.240 
soundstage towards your head and I just
did<00:06:35.070> one<00:06:36.070> calibration<00:06:36.880> like<00:06:37.120> on<00:06:37.300> my<00:06:37.419> left<00:06:37.720> ear

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
did one calibration like on my left ear

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.100 
did one calibration like on my left ear
first<00:06:39.250> and<00:06:39.729> then<00:06:39.940> another<00:06:40.150> calibration<00:06:40.900> on<00:06:40.960> my

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
first and then another calibration on my

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.180 
first and then another calibration on my
right<00:06:41.350> ear<00:06:41.380> and<00:06:42.479> you<00:06:43.479> know<00:06:43.570> it<00:06:43.690> totally<00:06:43.810> just

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
right ear and you know it totally just

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.060 
right ear and you know it totally just
directs<00:06:45.190> the<00:06:45.400> sound<00:06:45.580> field<00:06:45.970> like<00:06:46.800> directly<00:06:47.800> to

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
directs the sound field like directly to

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.339 
directs the sound field like directly to
your<00:06:48.250> ears<00:06:48.490> which<00:06:49.479> is<00:06:49.510> pretty<00:06:49.840> cool<00:06:50.110> and<00:06:50.260> then

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
your ears which is pretty cool and then

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.900 
your ears which is pretty cool and then
I<00:06:50.470> curved<00:06:50.770> number<00:06:51.039> two<00:06:51.220> I<00:06:51.250> said<00:06:51.460> it<00:06:51.760> for

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:51.910 
I curved number two I said it for

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.839 
I curved number two I said it for
everybody<00:06:52.300> in<00:06:52.449> the<00:06:52.570> vehicle<00:06:52.690> and<00:06:53.550> it<00:06:54.550> sounds

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849 
everybody in the vehicle and it sounds

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.450 
everybody in the vehicle and it sounds
really<00:06:55.060> good<00:06:55.300> I'm<00:06:55.800> I'm<00:06:56.800> pretty<00:06:57.070> happy<00:06:57.280> I

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
really good I'm I'm pretty happy I

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.060 
really good I'm I'm pretty happy I
bought<00:06:57.699> it<00:06:57.880> now<00:06:58.060> I<00:06:58.360> was<00:06:58.930> really<00:06:59.380> skeptical<00:06:59.830> at

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
bought it now I was really skeptical at

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.950 
bought it now I was really skeptical at
first<00:07:00.099> but<00:07:00.639> you<00:07:01.180> just<00:07:01.330> got<00:07:01.510> to<00:07:01.539> keep<00:07:01.750> plugging

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
first but you just got to keep plugging

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.150 
first but you just got to keep plugging
away<00:07:02.229> on<00:07:02.500> it<00:07:02.680> until<00:07:02.770> you<00:07:02.979> get<00:07:03.130> it<00:07:04.979> all<00:07:05.979> right

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 
away on it until you get it all right

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.900 
away on it until you get it all right
might<00:07:06.430> have<00:07:07.389> a<00:07:07.449> good<00:07:07.720> one
