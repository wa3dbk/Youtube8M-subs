00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
here there's gonna be a chance there's a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
here there's gonna be a chance there's a
helicopter<00:00:38.850> spawn<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.600> mostly<00:00:40.260> most<00:00:40.590> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
helicopter spawn and mostly most the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.740 
helicopter spawn and mostly most the
time<00:00:40.860> they<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.190> spawn<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.180> rare<00:00:42.420> amount

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
time they do spawn but that rare amount

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.600 
time they do spawn but that rare amount
they<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:43.920> when<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.460> just

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
they don't but when they do you just

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.760 
they don't but when they do you just
want<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> wait<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.809> helicopter<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.500> land

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
want to wait for the helicopter to land

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.410 
want to wait for the helicopter to land
and<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.460> basically<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.879> shoot<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> driver

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and you basically just shoot the driver

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.450 
and you basically just shoot the driver
but<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.350> did<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.770> too<00:00:49.950> close<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.250> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
but if you did get too close to the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.160 
but if you did get too close to the
actual<00:00:50.700> helicopter<00:00:50.910> wireless<00:00:51.600> London<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
actual helicopter wireless London it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.889 
actual helicopter wireless London it
will<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> fly<00:00:53.879> away<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.180> you'll

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
will just go up and fly away so you'll

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.479 
will just go up and fly away so you'll
need<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> wait<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.379> another<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:55.980> spawn<00:00:56.280> so

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
need to wait for another one to spawn so

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.889 
need to wait for another one to spawn so
there's<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> location<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> map<00:00:57.539> it's

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
there's the location on the map it's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.069 
there's the location on the map it's
pretty<00:00:58.140> close<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> where<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.300> spawn<00:01:00.300> location

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
pretty close to where the spawn location

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380 
pretty close to where the spawn location
of<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> actual<00:01:01.829> mission<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.879> once<00:01:03.090> you've

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
