it's a wonderful opportunity for max and
i<00:02:11.739> think<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:13.530> stages<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.709> we<00:02:14.860> can<00:02:15.010> go<00:02:15.130> in

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
i think the stages that we can go in

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.410 
i think the stages that we can go in
start<00:02:16.980> working<00:02:17.340> on<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.520> bigger<00:02:17.700> bites<00:02:17.940> also

start working on the bigger bites also

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.760 
start working on the bigger bites also
the<00:02:18.570> 125<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.440> 250<00:02:19.770> air<00:02:20.270> will<00:02:21.270> be<00:02:21.390> much<00:02:21.770> they

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
the 125 and 250 air will be much they

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.910 
the 125 and 250 air will be much they
are<00:02:22.950> very<00:02:22.980> important<00:02:23.640> for<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.060> stage<00:02:24.300> and

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
are very important for it this stage and

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.170 
are very important for it this stage and
no<00:02:25.920> we're<00:02:26.100> looking<00:02:26.370> forward<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.760> our<00:02:26.790> come

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
no we're looking forward to our come
