before I start showing you guys how to
do<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.209> there's<00:00:15.990> usually<00:00:16.379> two<00:00:16.619> different

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
do it there's usually two different

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.179 
do it there's usually two different
machines<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.700> can<00:00:17.730> do<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.360> I<00:00:19.080> think<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
machines you can do this on I think the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.550 
machines you can do this on I think the
best<00:00:20.429> one<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.269> on<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.380> like

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
best one to do it on is like one like

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.560 
best one to do it on is like one like
this<00:00:22.740> which<00:00:23.009> is<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.160> gluten<00:00:23.789> gluten<00:00:24.029> raise

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
this which is a gluten gluten raise

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.439 
this which is a gluten gluten raise
machine<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.369> other<00:00:26.609> one<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:26.970> usually<00:00:27.119> have

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
machine the other one they usually have

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.109 
machine the other one they usually have
is<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:28.050> typical<00:00:28.650> ones<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.070> commercial<00:00:29.910> gyms

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
is like typical ones in commercial gyms

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.920 
is like typical ones in commercial gyms
it's<00:00:30.300> just<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> 45<00:00:31.230> degree

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
it's just like a 45 degree

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.510 
it's just like a 45 degree
hyperextension<00:00:33.930> it's<00:00:34.050> kind<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.320> inclined<00:00:34.890> so

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
hyperextension it's kind of inclined so

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.069 
hyperextension it's kind of inclined so
you're<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.789> like<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.420> instead<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> flat

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you're up like this more instead of flat

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.740 
you're up like this more instead of flat
that<00:00:37.770> works<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.460> fine<00:00:38.489> too<00:00:39.000> but<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.360> prefer

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that works just as fine too but I prefer

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.090
