really nice three by three crossed based
on<00:01:11.910> bar<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> idea<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:15.170> originally

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
on bar and this idea is originally

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.340 
on bar and this idea is originally
biphenyl<00:01:17.040> actually<00:01:17.910> phenomen<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:19.320> course

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
there is a link in the description if

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.000 
there is a link in the description if
you<00:01:21.210> want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.600> check<00:01:21.750> out<00:01:21.930> his<00:01:22.140> channel<00:01:22.200> he's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
you want to check out his channel he's

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.030 
you want to check out his channel he's
really<00:01:23.280> good<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.640> redstone<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.300> stuff<00:01:24.660> and

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
really good with redstone and stuff and

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.400 
really good with redstone and stuff and
in<00:01:26.040> his<00:01:26.430> video<00:01:26.640> he<00:01:26.970> also<00:01:27.120> asked<00:01:27.660> us<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:28.020> we

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
in his video he also asked us if we

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.160 
in his video he also asked us if we
could<00:01:28.680> make<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.460> more<00:01:29.970> compact<00:01:30.390> version<00:01:30.660> or

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
could make a more compact version or

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.650 
could make a more compact version or
something<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.880> decided<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.540> with

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
something and I decided to go with

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.590 
something and I decided to go with
something<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.310> version<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.330> more

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
something so this version is not more

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.460 
something so this version is not more
compact<00:01:37.020> than<00:01:37.200> his<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.520> seamless<00:01:39.470> as

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
compact than his but it's seamless as

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
compact than his but it's seamless as
you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> door<00:01:41.580> opens<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you can see here when the door opens it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.050 
you can see here when the door opens it
doesn't<00:01:42.690> show<00:01:42.750> any<00:01:43.170> pistons<00:01:43.650> and<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.760> what<00:01:44.940> it

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
doesn't show any pistons and for what it

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.450 
doesn't show any pistons and for what it
does<00:01:45.240> i<00:01:45.390> think<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.830> compact<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:47.220> good

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
does i think it's compact it's good

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.260 
does i think it's compact it's good
enough<00:01:47.990> well<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.470> good<00:01:49.710> enough<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.310> me<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.180> do

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
enough well not good enough for me to do

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.469 
enough well not good enough for me to do
a<00:01:51.300> tutorial<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.310> just<00:01:53.310> because

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
a tutorial on it just because

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
a tutorial on it just because
unfortunately<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.440> end<00:01:55.530> i<00:01:55.890> found<00:01:56.400> out

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
unfortunately in the end i found out

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.359 
unfortunately in the end i found out
that<00:01:56.910> this<00:01:57.270> design<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.630> directional<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:58.800> it

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that this design is directional so it

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.840 
that this design is directional so it
will<00:01:59.670> work<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:01.009> directions<00:02:03.020> salt<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.289> north

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
will work on directions salt and north

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.370 
will work on directions salt and north
but<00:02:05.850> not<00:02:06.060> withstand<00:02:07.399> question<00:02:08.399> east<00:02:09.380> alright

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
but not withstand question east alright

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.880 
but not withstand question east alright
and<00:02:10.679> yeah<00:02:11.670> well<00:02:12.030> i'm<00:02:12.870> not<00:02:13.020> even<00:02:13.260> sure<00:02:13.410> why<00:02:13.830> this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and yeah well i'm not even sure why this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.270 
and yeah well i'm not even sure why this
design<00:02:14.490> is<00:02:14.520> directional<00:02:15.120> i<00:02:15.270> use<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:16.280> section

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
design is directional i use this section

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.870 
design is directional i use this section
on<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.460> sides<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:19.590> my<00:02:19.830> previous<00:02:20.160> design<00:02:20.640> of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
on the sides from my previous design of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.650 
on the sides from my previous design of
a<00:02:20.910> block<00:02:21.240> swapper<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.170> expendable<00:02:22.950> one<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
a block swapper and expendable one and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.870 
a block swapper and expendable one and
that<00:02:24.660> design<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.260> not<00:02:25.319> directional<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.580> works

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that design is not directional it works

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.170 
that design is not directional it works
everywhere<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:28.050> this<00:02:28.980> thing<00:02:29.310> here<00:02:29.670> doesn't

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
everywhere but this thing here doesn't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.260 
everywhere but this thing here doesn't
work<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.510> everywhere<00:02:31.380> i<00:02:31.700> don't<00:02:32.700> i'm<00:02:32.910> not<00:02:32.970> sure

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
work in everywhere i don't i'm not sure

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.860 
work in everywhere i don't i'm not sure
why<00:02:33.480> just<00:02:34.340> well<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.240> that's<00:02:36.480> why<00:02:36.690> i'm<00:02:36.810> not

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
why just well so that's why i'm not

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.960 
why just well so that's why i'm not
going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.260> do<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.380> tutorial<00:02:37.560> because<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.280> not

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
going to do a tutorial because it's not

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.040 
going to do a tutorial because it's not
as<00:02:39.900> good<00:02:40.200> as<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.650> would<00:02:40.950> like<00:02:41.130> it<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.580> be<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
as good as I would like it to be and the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.790 
as good as I would like it to be and the
the<00:02:43.410> really<00:02:43.740> nice<00:02:43.980> thing<00:02:44.280> about<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.790> door

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
the really nice thing about this door

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.050 
the really nice thing about this door
apart<00:02:46.800> from<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.430> bra<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.850> block

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
apart from the the bra the block

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.030 
apart from the the bra the block
swappers<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.560> double<00:02:49.860> extender

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
swappers is this the double extender

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.540 
swappers is this the double extender
here<00:02:50.520> on<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> top<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.500> left<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.950> design<00:02:53.310> for

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
here on the top I left the design for

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.180 
here on the top I left the design for
the<00:02:53.700> double<00:02:53.910> extender<00:02:54.120> for<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:55.680> final<00:02:56.010> part

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the double extender for the final part

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.420 
the double extender for the final part
and<00:02:57.380> yeah<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.680> reason<00:02:58.860> for<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.400> because

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
and yeah the reason for that is because

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.520 
and yeah the reason for that is because
I<00:02:59.970> know<00:03:00.390> how<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.690> make<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.110> hope<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.470> to

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
I know how to make it the hope is to

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.949 
I know how to make it the hope is to
extend<00:03:01.800> your<00:03:01.950> it's<00:03:02.340> very<00:03:02.670> easy<00:03:03.000> but<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.630> one

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
extend your it's very easy but this one

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.630 
extend your it's very easy but this one
was<00:03:04.500> not<00:03:04.739> as<00:03:04.980> easy<00:03:05.250> as<00:03:05.549> expected<00:03:06.330> because<00:03:07.640> when

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
was not as easy as expected because when

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.470 
was not as easy as expected because when
you<00:03:08.760> do

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
you do

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.479 
you do
double<00:03:09.750> extender<00:03:09.959> using<00:03:10.409> a<00:03:10.440> button<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.250> can

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
double extender using a button you can

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.059 
double extender using a button you can
leave<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.390> block<00:03:12.599> there<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.200> those<00:03:13.739> two

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
leave the block there but those two

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.309 
leave the block there but those two
pistols<00:03:14.430> will<00:03:14.640> be<00:03:14.819> retracted<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.170> the

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
pistols will be retracted this is the

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.949 
pistols will be retracted this is the
easiest<00:03:16.860> way<00:03:17.099> to<00:03:17.159> do<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.730> then<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.720> can

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
easiest way to do it and then you can

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.140 
easiest way to do it and then you can
grab<00:03:19.200> back<00:03:19.440> back<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.010> block<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.519> they<00:03:20.909> will

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
grab back back the block and they will

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.690 
grab back back the block and they will
be<00:03:21.299> retracted<00:03:21.840> once<00:03:22.170> again<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.220> with<00:03:23.549> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
be retracted once again and with the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.690 
be retracted once again and with the
lever<00:03:23.879> it<00:03:24.180> happens<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.870> exactly<00:03:25.440> how<00:03:25.799> you

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
lever it happens just exactly how you

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.020 
lever it happens just exactly how you
see<00:03:26.970> here<00:03:27.269> but<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.500> thing<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:28.980> this<00:03:29.640> design

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
see here but the thing is this design

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.350 
see here but the thing is this design
needs<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.930> pulse<00:03:31.170> it's<00:03:31.500> activated<00:03:32.250> by<00:03:32.610> a<00:03:32.910> button

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
needs a pulse it's activated by a button

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.430 
needs a pulse it's activated by a button
if<00:03:33.510> we<00:03:33.810> break<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:35.340> can<00:03:35.519> see<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:37.319> you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
if we break it we can see it and if you

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.530 
if we break it we can see it and if you
have<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.620> bottle<00:03:38.069> and<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.370> want<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:39.180> piston

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
have a bottle and you want the piston

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.160 
have a bottle and you want the piston
arm<00:03:39.840> should<00:03:40.079> be<00:03:40.230> extended<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:42.090> should<00:03:42.660> keep

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
arm should be extended you should keep

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.140 
arm should be extended you should keep
the<00:03:43.650> memory<00:03:44.250> state<00:03:44.519> somewhere<00:03:44.849> and<00:03:45.239> I<00:03:45.840> use<00:03:46.079> it

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
the memory state somewhere and I use it

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.479 
the memory state somewhere and I use it
d<00:03:48.150> flip-flop<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.989> do<00:03:49.109> that<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.709> simple

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
d flip-flop to do that this simple

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.729 
d flip-flop to do that this simple
design<00:03:50.849> as<00:03:51.150> far<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:51.810> i<00:03:51.900> know<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.230> a<00:03:52.260> designed<00:03:52.560> by

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
design as far as i know is a designed by

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.030 
design as far as i know is a designed by
Grizedale<00:03:53.480> on<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.660> minecraft<00:03:55.140> forums<00:03:55.739> and

Grizedale on the minecraft forums and

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.900 
Grizedale on the minecraft forums and
this<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.269> improved<00:03:57.629> version<00:03:57.920> made<00:03:58.920> by<00:03:59.160> kid

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
this is the improved version made by kid

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.530 
this is the improved version made by kid
mischief<00:04:00.450> so<00:04:01.579> this<00:04:02.579> is<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.730> very<00:04:02.849> compact<00:04:03.269> and

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
mischief so this is a very compact and

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.440 
mischief so this is a very compact and
tiny<00:04:03.959> d<00:04:04.349> flip-flop<00:04:04.859> and<00:04:05.099> what<00:04:05.760> happens<00:04:06.150> here

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
tiny d flip-flop and what happens here

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.190 
tiny d flip-flop and what happens here
is<00:04:06.569> actually<00:04:07.079> very<00:04:07.290> nice<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:08.730> when<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.510> click

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
is actually very nice so when I I click

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.229 
is actually very nice so when I I click
the<00:04:10.319> button<00:04:10.650> on<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.980> other<00:04:11.069> side<00:04:11.400> those

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
the button on the other side those

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.409 
the button on the other side those
torches<00:04:12.540> will<00:04:12.989> turn<00:04:13.230> off<00:04:13.440> for<00:04:13.919> some<00:04:14.430> for<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.209> few

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:15.419 
torches will turn off for some for a few

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.640 
torches will turn off for some for a few
ticks<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.849> this<00:04:17.849> will<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.780> capable<00:04:19.229> of<00:04:19.320> doing

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
ticks and this will be capable of doing

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.039 
ticks and this will be capable of doing
the<00:04:19.769> first<00:04:20.039> retraction<00:04:20.700> as<00:04:21.479> soon<00:04:21.720> as<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.900> press

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
the first retraction as soon as I press

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.469 
the first retraction as soon as I press
the<00:04:22.200> button<00:04:22.500> later<00:04:23.280> two<00:04:23.700> ticks<00:04:23.910> later<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.330> will

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
the button later two ticks later it will

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.100 
the button later two ticks later it will
do<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.810> second<00:04:25.200> fraction<00:04:25.530> and<00:04:26.720> when<00:04:27.720> this

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
do the second fraction and when this

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.050 
do the second fraction and when this
line<00:04:28.410> is<00:04:28.620> d<00:04:28.860> powered<00:04:29.280> also<00:04:30.210> this<00:04:30.599> item<00:04:31.080> will<00:04:31.410> be

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
line is d powered also this item will be

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.060 
line is d powered also this item will be
measured<00:04:33.060> by<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.510> comparator<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.139> so<00:04:34.860> it

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
measured by this comparator and so it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.730 
measured by this comparator and so it
will<00:04:35.280> give<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.460> post<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.210> T<00:04:36.360> flip-flop<00:04:36.840> once

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
will give a post to the T flip-flop once

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.360 
will give a post to the T flip-flop once
the<00:04:37.889> T<00:04:38.099> flip-flop<00:04:38.580> get<00:04:38.820> suppose<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:40.440> will<00:04:40.800> spit

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
the T flip-flop get suppose it will spit

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.839 
the T flip-flop get suppose it will spit
out<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.789> item<00:04:41.910> here<00:04:42.660> into<00:04:43.560> this<00:04:43.740> hopper<00:04:44.550> and

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
out the item here into this hopper and

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.690 
out the item here into this hopper and
this<00:04:45.510> item<00:04:45.750> will<00:04:45.990> be<00:04:46.139> circuit<00:04:46.590> include<00:04:46.979> inside

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
this item will be circuit include inside

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.969 
this item will be circuit include inside
this<00:04:47.880> order<00:04:48.330> hopper<00:04:48.690> but<00:04:49.200> when<00:04:49.470> it<00:04:49.620> passes

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
this order hopper but when it passes

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.460 
this order hopper but when it passes
through<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.789> hopper<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.360> will<00:04:51.660> give<00:04:51.870> also<00:04:52.080> the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
through the hopper it will give also the

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.560 
through the hopper it will give also the
final<00:04:52.680> pools<00:04:53.039> needed<00:04:53.430> for<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:54.240> final

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
final pools needed for the final

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.089 
final pools needed for the final
retraction<00:04:55.139> of<00:04:55.289> the<00:04:55.530> double<00:04:55.770> piston<00:04:55.889> extender

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
retraction of the double piston extender

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:01.400 
retraction of the double piston extender
so<00:04:56.610> let's<00:04:57.270> see<00:04:57.510> that<00:04:57.780> in<00:04:58.169> action<00:04:59.720> yeah<00:05:00.720> we

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
so let's see that in action yeah we

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.260 
so let's see that in action yeah we
could<00:05:01.590> not<00:05:01.770> see<00:05:01.979> what<00:05:02.190> we<00:05:02.610> can<00:05:02.760> see<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:02.970> final

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
could not see what we can see the final

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.779 
could not see what we can see the final
result<00:05:03.599> here<00:05:03.840> also<00:05:04.530> because<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:05.039> item<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.550> not

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
result here also because the item is not

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.900 
result here also because the item is not
here<00:05:06.210> this<00:05:07.199> based<00:05:07.560> on<00:05:07.710> gets<00:05:07.919> retracted<00:05:08.250> so

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
here this based on gets retracted so

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.629 
here this based on gets retracted so
when<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.020> power<00:05:10.229> comes<00:05:10.590> back<00:05:10.770> from<00:05:11.460> the

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
when the power comes back from the

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:14.450 
when the power comes back from the
butter<00:05:11.880> click<00:05:12.300> which<00:05:13.260> one<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.740> will<00:05:13.949> not<00:05:14.130> power

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
butter click which one it will not power

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.550 
butter click which one it will not power
the<00:05:14.820> double<00:05:15.510> extender<00:05:15.660> once<00:05:16.050> again<00:05:16.289> because

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
the double extender once again because

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.890 
the double extender once again because
this<00:05:16.770> block<00:05:16.979> is<00:05:17.160> not<00:05:17.430> here<00:05:17.789> anymore<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.330> this

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
this block is not here anymore and this

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.740 
this block is not here anymore and this
line<00:05:19.110> cannot<00:05:19.380> power<00:05:19.680> anything<00:05:20.159> so<00:05:20.940> this<00:05:21.630> is

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
line cannot power anything so this is

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.800 
line cannot power anything so this is
how<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:21.900> did

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
how I did

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.280 
how I did
and<00:05:23.380> I<00:05:23.530> think<00:05:23.770> it<00:05:23.919> that<00:05:24.190> was<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.550> really<00:05:25.360> nice

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
and I think it that was a really nice

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.560 
and I think it that was a really nice
system<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:27.040> show<00:05:27.220> that's<00:05:27.850> mainly<00:05:28.150> the<00:05:28.389> reason

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
system to show that's mainly the reason

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.220 
system to show that's mainly the reason
why<00:05:28.990> I'm<00:05:29.290> doing<00:05:29.470> this<00:05:29.650> showcase<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.990> yeah<00:05:31.990> the

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
why I'm doing this showcase and yeah the

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.610 
why I'm doing this showcase and yeah the
opposite<00:05:32.590> way<00:05:32.770> is<00:05:33.330> really<00:05:34.330> simple<00:05:34.570> it's<00:05:34.810> just

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
opposite way is really simple it's just

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.129 
opposite way is really simple it's just
the<00:05:36.250> D<00:05:36.460> flip-flop<00:05:36.940> changing<00:05:37.630> states<00:05:37.900> and

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
the D flip-flop changing states and

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.470 
the D flip-flop changing states and
placing<00:05:38.860> this<00:05:38.980> block<00:05:39.220> here<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:39.730> activating

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
placing this block here and activating

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.040 
placing this block here and activating
the<00:05:40.750> double<00:05:41.050> extender<00:05:41.730> completely<00:05:42.840> ya<00:05:43.840> guys

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
the double extender completely ya guys

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.570 
the double extender completely ya guys
so<00:05:44.610> this<00:05:45.610> is<00:05:45.730> basically<00:05:45.850> it<00:05:46.360> for<00:05:46.660> this<00:05:46.780> door

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
so this is basically it for this door

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.560 
so this is basically it for this door
because<00:05:48.580> i'm<00:05:48.730> not<00:05:48.850> going<00:05:49.090> to<00:05:49.150> do<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.360> tutorial
