these<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:38.939> off<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> edge<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.689> something<00:01:39.869> or

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
these are off the edge of something or

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.920 
these are off the edge of something or
you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.890> do<00:01:41.009> them<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.189> any<00:01:41.549> two<00:01:41.790> things<00:01:42.060> above

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you can do them on any two things above

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.539 
you can do them on any two things above
the<00:01:43.110> ground<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.500> are<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.979> least<00:01:44.009> shoulder

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the ground that are at least shoulder

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.020 
the ground that are at least shoulder
width<00:01:44.729> apart<00:01:45.229> next<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.979> polar<00:01:47.189> bear<00:01:47.430> so

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
width apart next up is the polar bear so

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.160 
width apart next up is the polar bear so
for<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.360> pullovers<00:01:48.780> you're<00:01:48.930> definitely

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
for good pullovers you're definitely

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.810 
for good pullovers you're definitely
going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> want<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.829> know<00:01:50.009> how<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.790> a

going to want to know how to do a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.160 
going to want to know how to do a
pull-up<00:01:51.060> first<00:01:51.420> because<00:01:51.810> you're<00:01:51.899> not<00:01:51.990> going

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
pull-up first because you're not going

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
pull-up first because you're not going
to<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> do<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> pull-up<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.369> hold<00:01:53.640> it

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
to need to do a pull-up and hold it

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
to need to do a pull-up and hold it
there<00:01:53.790> while<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.329> bring<00:01:54.509> your<00:01:54.630> legs<00:01:54.810> over<00:01:54.990> if

there while you bring your legs over if

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.160 
there while you bring your legs over if
one's<00:01:55.860> too<00:01:56.070> easy<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> reverse<00:01:57.390> hold<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> at

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
one's too easy do the reverse hold it at

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530 
one's too easy do the reverse hold it at
the<00:01:58.200> chin<00:01:58.500> up<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.799> go<00:01:59.250> back<00:01:59.280> over<00:01:59.700> ideally<00:02:00.450> you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the chin up and go back over ideally you

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
the chin up and go back over ideally you
want<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.049> with<00:02:01.290> straight<00:02:01.619> legs<00:02:01.770> but

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
want to do this with straight legs but

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.069 
want to do this with straight legs but
you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.490> straddle<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.299> reduce<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.750> leverage

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
you can straddle to reduce the leverage

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.050 
you can straddle to reduce the leverage
just<00:02:04.469> make<00:02:04.649> sure<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:05.009> come<00:02:05.369> back<00:02:05.399> together<00:02:05.909> at

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
just make sure you come back together at

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
just make sure you come back together at
a<00:02:06.149> pike<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.570> your<00:02:07.350> legs<00:02:07.530> get<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> top<00:02:08.129> of

a pike as your legs get to the top of
the<00:02:08.340> bar<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
the bar so that you can have that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.229 
the bar so that you can have that
leverage<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.069> pull<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.370> up<00:02:11.520> if<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.120> don't
