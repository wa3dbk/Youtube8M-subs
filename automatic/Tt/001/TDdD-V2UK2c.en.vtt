00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.220
 in a previous video was about what they 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.100

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.180

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.660
 the chapters of the fight in the 13 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.629
 chapters in mp4 format subtitled in 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.750
 Spanish so that they can be 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.660
 enjoying myself personally is one of 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.630
 my favorite series in its genre is a 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.940
 of the best are and belong to me 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.310
 of the word genius for people who 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.729
 they do not know this kind of genre the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 goal 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.840
 this implies a lot of blood 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 mutilations 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.340
 of limbs and head so that 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.560
 Well, to the people who like everything 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.050
 that genre and they are just starting in 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.230
 the anime world is very very 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.240
 recommended memory very highly recommended 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.030
 this series ok 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.360
 Well, all the chapters I have 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.700
 done separately in rar file because 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.010
 I do this because then at times 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.810
 previous that I have uploaded series 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.000
 I had some problems with the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.630
 chapters I did not upload it from a love of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.010
 a correct way so well 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.470
 tablets in a rar file like that 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.290
 is already a little more accessible mediafire 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.330
 that lets me upload it directly 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.060
 so you can download them 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.270
 ok every radar file you have a link 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.670
 staff so that the chapters that 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.700
 you can download them from this one 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.190
 ok just to be able to extract the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.010
 rar file we need the program 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.840
 windrush for people who do not 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.020

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.910
 I'll leave you a YouTube video is not 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.660
 my property but from a person who 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.400
 finish 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.880

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.460
 Right click on the rar file and you 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.920
 we will give in the option of 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.980
 to extract 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.830
 from 10 or they will disappear on 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.830
 file or the format or the chapter 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.530
 pending and then the only thing 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.960
 we would have to do is order the ones from 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.360
 this way 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.180

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.550
 base between 50 between 50 and 55 to 60 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.610
 megabytes so that they can 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.650
 download in a more fluid and 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.110
 much quicker clear true because 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.540
 because the size is really accessible 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.290

 prior to all the content that I give them 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.780
 rise so that they realize they do not 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.700
 they have no viruses any kind of 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.760
 contact problems compatibility 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.430
 so that they can download it from 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.969
 a way 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.620

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.620

 because the chapters can be 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.230

 please ask them what it tells me for what 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.800

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.320
