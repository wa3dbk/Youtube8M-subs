00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.690
 are you talking about netbooks with dito from intel 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.460
 For two years the book has been dominating in just one count 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.869
 but love to share a bit with it, it's a big market and they 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.789
 are immensely popular due to portability and energy consumption 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:17.570
 of course 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.760
 both men first net booklet with a botnet processor, it works perky 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.890
 5 2 2 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.890
 6 3 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.659
 we play 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:28.779
 8 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.879
 the 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.340
 the top 40 60 days at least fifty by buyers on a gigahertz 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.220
 odijk stand by the hd2 60 50 says a cool chipset that time myself comes from the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.000
 is convex 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.700
 The screen is waiting for 7 to 20 pixels which is pretty much the book's normal 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.670
 spoken he does not go further 600 pixels and the height 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.129
 for the van 720 is a whole neighborhood where money can be lost 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.240
 further there are 3 usb ports vg from hdmi out 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.650
 and there are still about 50 gigabytes of hard disks losing all data 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.800
 can 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.630
 then it is possible with booklets that six even use bets 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.760
 afterwards he keeps acting out for five full minutes and as a long time off the book 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.360
 let live in hands the most important difference in process architecture between 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.980
 the 50 and the internet 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.650
 internet and is a good processor that we don't actually use anymore 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.090
 is the pen team 3 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.130
 the reason is very clear old conviction is much more efficient 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.010
 at a throw-in processor hanover processor everything 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.060
 consecutively even though you have to wait for data from another component and the PC 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 with the old one for the processor 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.040
 may the process of thinking arie have to wait anyway i leave something else 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.230
 the result is that he can work much too quickly alongside applications 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.350
 can open faster and that data is therefore transferred efficiently 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.189
 disadvantage of keeping for the processor 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.590
 is that more energy is needed and the process is so complex 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.100
 internet one has managed to somewhat fill the lack with its liberation 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.710
 but you will still notice if an application only needs fat 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.209
 and although the 50 to this victory has a lower clock speed than just one 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.249
 the old for architecture is so much more efficient that it is largely anyway 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.879
 is well made 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.510
 let us want to go on wish market player the rcs par live 5 2 2 with 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.769
 the dsc 50 are compared 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.709
 both riders see three tenths just team with one 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.879
 by coret one to one and a half gigahertz 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.879
 With 3D Mac 2006, the Intel shares easily reach sixteen 169 points 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.429
 compared to 109 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:39.069
 then show clear advantage of the hd2 60 50 that has used shares 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:42.009
 if we look at processor power 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:46.969
 then in the effenaar still but not read in the gasoline in a score of 14 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.070
 149 points for the fm 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.130
 compared to twelve 188 for the shares 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.719
 you must report this 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:58.139
 it did not like this very much from the old stock properties of the 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.049
 The processor watching PC market is actually an atmosphere covering the entire PC 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.539
 testers also raped her hard drive and memory 

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.939
 then we see that it is fairly close together 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:14.199
 daan b half past four then at 52 points compared to 639 for the fm 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.979
 put a very interesting process on the market with the seven 50 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.499
 the fusion technology which means 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:25.570
 processor with graphics chip in a work just unbelievably good it is 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.600
 perfectly possible to play 17 the pvda they were to visit website 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.680
 brigitte sign and all with a very solid battery life 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.870
 in fact, the battery life is actually even a real man of mine 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.869
 can use the internet to draw a letter 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:42.419
 in short, this very good move is certainly 50
