00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
situation for largest record yeah I am

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.459 
situation for largest record yeah I am
yeah<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.700> suppose<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.269> went<00:00:09.809> back<00:00:09.960> initially

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
yeah I suppose we went back initially

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.259 
yeah I suppose we went back initially
probably<00:00:10.860> went<00:00:10.980> back<00:00:11.130> about<00:00:11.280> 10<00:00:11.610> meters<00:00:11.969> and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
probably went back about 10 meters and

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.350 
probably went back about 10 meters and
I'm<00:00:12.920> I'm<00:00:13.920> co2<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.370> bad<00:00:14.580> pass<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> middle<00:00:15.330> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
I'm I'm co2 a bad pass in the middle of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.750 
I'm I'm co2 a bad pass in the middle of
that<00:00:15.509> as<00:00:15.630> well<00:00:15.660> but<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.500> me<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.220> get<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.520> 10

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
that as well but I me to get that 10

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 
that as well but I me to get that 10
meters<00:00:18.060> back<00:00:18.300> which<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.810> did<00:00:18.990> from<00:00:19.289> from<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
meters back which we did from from the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.320 
meters back which we did from from the
boys<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.100> fairness<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.699> carries<00:00:21.090> from

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
boys and fairness and good carries from

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.540 
boys and fairness and good carries from
Dobie<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.680> think<00:00:22.890> claims<00:00:23.130> must<00:00:23.340> have

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
Dobie and I think claims must have

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.250 
Dobie and I think claims must have
carried<00:00:23.730> six<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.180> seven<00:00:24.449> times<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.050> phase

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
carried six or seven times in that phase

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.210 
carried six or seven times in that phase
as<00:00:25.500> well<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.900> so<00:00:27.900> once<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.199> got<00:00:28.289> back<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> 40

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
as well so so once we got back to the 40

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.040 
as well so so once we got back to the 40
you<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.000> probably<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.480> was<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.630> bit<00:00:30.810> little

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
you know probably it was a bit little

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.010 
you know probably it was a bit little
bit<00:00:31.170> on<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.619> bit<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> little<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.759> more

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
bit on a bit on a little bit more

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.060 
bit on a bit on a little bit more
obviously<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> need<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.469> our<00:00:34.620> ninth<00:00:34.829> row

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
obviously we need to get our ninth row

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.880 
obviously we need to get our ninth row

to get to situation when you're-- yeah
yeah<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.070> been<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> plan<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
yeah that would have been the plan and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.060 
yeah that would have been the plan and
you<00:00:51.420> looking<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> penalty<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.739> drop-goal

dare but trying to keep the ball in the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
dare but trying to keep the ball in the
middle<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> pitch<00:00:55.739> as<00:00:56.070> much<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.910> we<00:00:57.030> could

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
middle of the pitch as much as we could

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.860 
middle of the pitch as much as we could
I'm<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:58.739> any<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.460> were<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.879> rock<00:01:00.629> was

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I'm you know any time we were a rock was

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.859 
I'm you know any time we were a rock was
over<00:01:01.199> 240<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.800> supposed<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.460> drop<00:01:02.730> goal<00:01:02.760> I

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.960 

think<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:09.990> i<00:01:10.020> think<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.760> we've

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
think so i think that I'm you know we've

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.810 
think so i think that I'm you know we've
a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> injuries<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> moment<00:01:13.229> I'm<00:01:13.820> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a lot of injuries at the moment I'm you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.640 
a lot of injuries at the moment I'm you
know<00:01:14.909> we're<00:01:15.060> small<00:01:15.299> bit<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.689> transition<00:01:16.200> as

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
know we're small bit of a transition as

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.859 
know we're small bit of a transition as
well<00:01:16.830> i<00:01:16.860> mean<00:01:17.130> i<00:01:17.280> think<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> first<00:01:17.939> time<00:01:18.150> we

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
well i mean i think is the first time we

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.420 
well i mean i think is the first time we
haven't<00:01:19.170> had<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> raleigh<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.009> clerk

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
haven't had you to raleigh a clerk

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.060 
haven't had you to raleigh a clerk

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
were and win a dogfight like that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.460 
were and win a dogfight like that
obviously<00:01:32.189> made<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> lot<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.180> mistakes<00:01:33.470> yeah

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
obviously made a lot of mistakes yeah

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.560 
obviously made a lot of mistakes yeah
would<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:34.890> proud<00:01:38.270> you're<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.390> really

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
would be very proud you're not really

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.999 
would be very proud you're not really
thinking<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:39.990> him<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.439> yeah<00:01:40.710> they<00:01:40.890> were

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
thinking about him but yeah they were

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.249 
thinking about him but yeah they were
nerve-wracking<00:01:41.640> particularly<00:01:42.180> when<00:01:42.360> they

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
nerve-wracking particularly when they

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.780 
nerve-wracking particularly when they
kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.530> got<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.829> bounced<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
kind of got that bounced there and I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
kind of got that bounced there and I
nearly<00:01:45.030> went<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.509> for<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> try<00:01:45.930> route<00:01:46.170> they

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
nearly went to over for a try route they

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
nearly went to over for a try route they
were<00:01:46.710> probably<00:01:46.890> unlucky<00:01:47.399> enough<00:01:47.549> they<00:01:48.479> were
