00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
that basically the car decided that it

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.130 
that basically the car decided that it
was<00:00:21.640> going<00:00:21.910> to<00:00:21.940> drive<00:00:22.330> out<00:00:22.570> of<00:00:22.630> the<00:00:22.810> lane<00:00:22.960> in

the back into the lane for no reason and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.120 
the back into the lane for no reason and
that's<00:00:25.480> really<00:00:25.750> stupid<00:00:26.320> both<00:00:26.470> from<00:00:26.740> a<00:00:26.830> driving

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
and an artificial intelligence

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.960

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.760 
perspective yeah the game isn't exactly
realistic<00:00:31.720> and<00:00:31.930> it'd<00:00:32.109> be<00:00:32.140> different<00:00:32.559> if<00:00:32.649> this

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
realistic and it'd be different if this

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.799 
realistic and it'd be different if this
were<00:00:32.920> an<00:00:33.040> uncommon<00:00:33.550> occurrence<00:00:33.760> but<00:00:34.420> it's<00:00:34.690> not

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
were an uncommon occurrence but it's not

were an uncommon occurrence but it's not
really<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.230> kind<00:00:35.470> of<00:00:35.680> lack<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:35.950> realism

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
really the kind of lack of realism

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.220
