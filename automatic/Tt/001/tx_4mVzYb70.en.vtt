00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
pretty nice so that is actually a nice

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.830 
pretty nice so that is actually a nice
little<00:04:07.320> tweaking<00:04:07.680> its<00:04:07.799> core<00:04:07.980> notification

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
little tweaking its core notification

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.390 
little tweaking its core notification
okay<00:04:09.840> guy<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.200> last<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:10.590> certainly<00:04:10.709> no<00:04:11.190> means

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
okay guy so last but certainly no means

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.979 
okay guy so last but certainly no means
least<00:04:11.549> we<00:04:11.790> look<00:04:11.910> at<00:04:12.030> then<00:04:12.150> last<00:04:12.180> week<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.930> this

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
least we look at then last week and this

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.229 
least we look at then last week and this
one<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.440> called<00:04:13.680> custom<00:04:14.220> spotlight<00:04:14.670> text<00:04:15.090> and

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
one is called custom spotlight text and

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.000 
one is called custom spotlight text and
the<00:04:15.780> edge<00:04:15.930> can<00:04:16.169> probably<00:04:16.440> imagine<00:04:16.590> it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
the edge can probably imagine it

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.009 
the edge can probably imagine it
actually<00:04:17.489> changes<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:18.060> spotlight<00:04:18.450> text<00:04:18.870> so

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
actually changes the spotlight text so

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.199 
actually changes the spotlight text so
as<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.380> can<00:04:19.500> see<00:04:19.709> here<00:04:19.979> we've<00:04:20.940> got<00:04:20.970> this

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
as you can see here we've got this

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.090 
as you can see here we've got this
customized<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.810> say<00:04:21.959> DJ<00:04:22.169> fill<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.740> moment

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
customized to say DJ fill at the moment

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.370 
customized to say DJ fill at the moment
and<00:04:23.220> pretty<00:04:24.180> simple<00:04:24.540> interface<00:04:24.930> if<00:04:25.140> we<00:04:25.229> go

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
and pretty simple interface if we go

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.170 
and pretty simple interface if we go
into<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.680> settings<00:04:25.890> here<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.700> if<00:04:26.910> we<00:04:26.940> just

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
into the settings here and if we just

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.300 
into the settings here and if we just
come<00:04:27.330> out<00:04:27.479> of<00:04:27.539> this<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:28.289> so<00:04:28.500> we<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:28.770> go<00:04:28.890> into

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
come out of this and so we just go into

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.399 
come out of this and so we just go into
it<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:30.210> custom<00:04:30.599> spotlight<00:04:30.960> takes

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
it so custom spotlight takes

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.769 
it so custom spotlight takes
you<00:04:31.860> literally<00:04:32.129> just<00:04:32.369> press<00:04:32.699> typing<00:04:33.599> what<00:04:33.719> you

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:33.779 
you literally just press typing what you

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.659 
you literally just press typing what you
want<00:04:33.899> to<00:04:33.959> type<00:04:34.199> in<00:04:34.409> then<00:04:34.589> press<00:04:34.830> save<00:04:35.039> what's

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
want to type in then press save what's

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:36.859 
want to type in then press save what's
pretty<00:04:35.849> cool<00:04:36.089> about<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.419> is<00:04:36.569> you<00:04:36.719> don't

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:36.869 
pretty cool about this is you don't

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:38.389 
pretty cool about this is you don't
actually<00:04:37.080> have<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:37.379> respring<00:04:37.949> in<00:04:38.099> between

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:38.399 
actually have to respring in between

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:40.429 
actually have to respring in between
changing<00:04:38.879> it<00:04:38.999> which<00:04:39.119> is<00:04:39.239> pretty<00:04:39.269> nice<00:04:39.599> so<00:04:40.259> even

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
changing it which is pretty nice so even
