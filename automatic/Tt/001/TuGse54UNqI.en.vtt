00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
warm-up make sure the cramp doesn't come

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.170 
warm-up make sure the cramp doesn't come
back<00:02:30.090> before<00:02:31.090> moving<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.730> for<00:02:33.730> hanging

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180

knee<00:02:34.390> raises<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.230> leg<00:02:36.220> raises<00:02:36.870> two<00:02:37.870> sets<00:02:38.110> of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
knee raises and leg raises two sets of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.660 
knee raises and leg raises two sets of
10<00:02:38.560> superset<00:02:39.220> with<00:02:39.250> each<00:02:39.549> other<00:02:41.519> that's<00:02:42.519> just

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
10 superset with each other that's just

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:57.819 
10 superset with each other that's just
to<00:02:42.850> activate<00:02:43.120> full<00:02:43.750> core<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:45.130> lower<00:02:45.310> abs

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.679 

so<00:02:58.829> as<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.069> saw<00:02:59.249> on<00:02:59.400> that<00:02:59.430> I'm<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.420> just

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
so as you saw on that I'm not just

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.509 
so as you saw on that I'm not just
dropping<00:03:01.290> my<00:03:01.409> knees<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.859> then<00:03:01.980> crunching<00:03:02.370> up

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
dropping my knees and then crunching up

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.489 
dropping my knees and then crunching up
I'm<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.269> stretching<00:03:03.959> getting<00:03:04.109> a<00:03:04.290> full

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:04.499 
I'm really stretching getting a full

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:06.379 
I'm really stretching getting a full
stretch<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> ABS<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:05.849> crunching

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
stretch of the ABS and then crunching

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.679 
stretch of the ABS and then crunching
all<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.689> way<00:03:06.780> up<00:03:06.930> with<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.230> ABS<00:03:07.379> a<00:03:08.510> lot<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.599> the

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
all the way up with the ABS a lot of the

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.080 
all the way up with the ABS a lot of the
time<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.079> can<00:03:10.319> just<00:03:10.790> engage<00:03:11.790> your<00:03:11.969> hip

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
time you can just engage your hip

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.479 
time you can just engage your hip
flexors<00:03:12.540> which<00:03:12.719> is<00:03:13.139> three<00:03:13.859> pointless<00:03:14.340> if

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
flexors which is three pointless if

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.640 
flexors which is three pointless if
you're<00:03:14.639> trying<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.909> work<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.209> abs<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.659> also

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
you're trying to work the abs and also

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.789 
you're trying to work the abs and also
from<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.900> society<00:03:18.900> that<00:03:18.930> sits<00:03:19.290> down<00:03:19.469> pretty

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
from a society that sits down pretty

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.080 
from a society that sits down pretty
much<00:03:19.919> all<00:03:20.099> the<00:03:20.219> time<00:03:20.430> you're<00:03:20.700> already<00:03:20.849> one

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
much all the time you're already one

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.369 
much all the time you're already one
side<00:03:21.329> affects<00:03:21.689> us<00:03:21.840> so<00:03:21.930> why<00:03:22.049> do<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.169> want<00:03:22.319> to

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
side affects us so why do you want to

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.289 
side affects us so why do you want to
make<00:03:22.530> them<00:03:22.650> tight<00:03:22.859> up<00:03:23.010> then<00:03:23.489> after<00:03:23.849> that<00:03:24.030> I'll

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
make them tight up then after that I'll

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.599 
make them tight up then after that I'll
take<00:03:24.900> about<00:03:25.200> two<00:03:25.530> minutes<00:03:25.560> rest<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.310> then

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
take about two minutes rest and then

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.170 
take about two minutes rest and then
I'll<00:03:26.760> move<00:03:26.969> to<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.209> cables<00:03:27.799> so<00:03:28.799> what<00:03:29.340> I<00:03:29.609> tried

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
I'll move to the cables so what I tried

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.899 
I'll move to the cables so what I tried
to<00:03:30.209> target<00:03:30.540> where<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.870> cables<00:03:31.290> are<00:03:31.730> front<00:03:32.730> on

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
to target where the cables are front on

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.530 
to target where the cables are front on
and<00:03:33.299> then<00:03:34.139> sides<00:03:34.439> so<00:03:35.219> you<00:03:35.250> want<00:03:35.699> one<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.419> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
and then sides so you want one of the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.149 
and then sides so you want one of the
ads<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.169> obliques<00:03:37.409> so<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.799> want<00:03:38.010> the

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
ads and in the obliques so you want the

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.909 
ads and in the obliques so you want the
ones<00:03:38.730> coming<00:03:38.909> across<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.500> I'll<00:03:40.620> start

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
ones coming across and so I'll start

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:44.030 
ones coming across and so I'll start
with<00:03:41.010> normal<00:03:41.549> cable<00:03:41.730> crunches<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:43.040> you'll

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
with normal cable crunches and you'll

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.580 
with normal cable crunches and you'll
see<00:03:44.280> if<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.180> ever<00:03:45.209> see<00:03:45.569> my<00:03:45.750> previous<00:03:46.049> video

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
see if you ever see my previous video

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.610 
see if you ever see my previous video
where<00:03:46.799> I<00:03:46.859> show<00:03:47.189> how<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.370> do<00:03:47.579> this<00:03:47.699> properly

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
where I show how to do this properly

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.830 
where I show how to do this properly
it's<00:03:49.620> essential<00:03:50.189> that<00:03:50.219> you<00:03:50.629> crunch<00:03:51.629> on<00:03:51.810> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
it's essential that you crunch on the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.860 
it's essential that you crunch on the
ABS<00:03:52.109> and<00:03:52.469> not<00:03:52.889> pull<00:03:53.159> from<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.489> hip<00:03:53.639> flexors<00:03:54.090> so

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
ABS and not pull from the hip flexors so

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.189 
ABS and not pull from the hip flexors so
as<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.139> can<00:03:55.290> see<00:03:55.349> what<00:03:55.949> I'm<00:03:56.069> doing<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.489> here

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:57.199 
as you can see what I'm doing it here

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.530 
as you can see what I'm doing it here
then<00:03:58.199> the<00:03:58.439> next<00:03:58.739> exercise<00:03:59.549> I<00:03:59.699> then<00:03:59.849> take<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.359> to

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
then the next exercise I then take it to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.539 
then the next exercise I then take it to
one<00:04:00.930> side<00:04:01.229> so<00:04:01.259> I'm<00:04:01.680> holding<00:04:02.009> it<00:04:02.099> in<00:04:02.129> one<00:04:02.340> arm

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
one side so I'm holding it in one arm

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.809 
one side so I'm holding it in one arm
but<00:04:03.239> your<00:04:04.019> arm<00:04:04.259> must<00:04:04.560> stay<00:04:04.739> still<00:04:05.099> it<00:04:05.489> has<00:04:05.639> to

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
but your arm must stay still it has to

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.809 
but your arm must stay still it has to
stay<00:04:06.000> still<00:04:06.239> you<00:04:06.389> can't<00:04:06.829> jerk<00:04:07.829> it<00:04:08.129> forward<00:04:08.579> it

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
stay still you can't jerk it forward it

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.780 
stay still you can't jerk it forward it
needs<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.359> be<00:04:09.509> set<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:09.870> one<00:04:10.049> place<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:11.009> then

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
needs to be set in one place and then

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.650 
needs to be set in one place and then
crunch<00:04:12.030> across<00:04:12.389> as<00:04:12.569> you<00:04:12.659> can<00:04:12.840> see<00:04:12.959> in<00:04:13.079> the
