00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.220 

it's<00:00:04.740> just<00:00:05.009> made<00:00:05.190> from<00:00:05.460> paper<00:00:06.230> bamboo

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
it's just made from paper bamboo

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.730 
it's just made from paper bamboo
scooters<00:00:08.069> for<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.880> wings

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
scooters for the wings

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.400 
scooters for the wings
and<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:12.210> gave<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> good<00:00:14.539> couple<00:00:15.539> of<00:00:15.780> coats<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
and it gave a good couple of coats of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.900 
and it gave a good couple of coats of
paint

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.560 

and<00:00:20.330> some<00:00:20.750> thick<00:00:21.279> varnish<00:00:22.279> three<00:00:22.730> coats<00:00:23.000> thin

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
and some thick varnish three coats thin

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.910 
and some thick varnish three coats thin
coats<00:00:23.900> of<00:00:24.110> varnish<00:00:25.750> so<00:00:26.750> it's<00:00:26.869> quite<00:00:27.080> rigid<00:00:27.439> and

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
coats of varnish so it's quite rigid and

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.070 
coats of varnish so it's quite rigid and
light<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.029> I<00:00:29.420> took<00:00:29.480> it<00:00:29.720> out<00:00:29.810> for<00:00:29.869> a<00:00:30.080> flight<00:00:30.740> and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
light and I took it out for a flight and

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.380 
light and I took it out for a flight and
the<00:00:33.080> Flies<00:00:33.379> fine<00:00:33.710> doesn't<00:00:34.489> have<00:00:34.640> any<00:00:34.790> slow

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
the Flies fine doesn't have any slow

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.450 
the Flies fine doesn't have any slow
speed<00:00:35.930> flight<00:00:38.320> tends<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.559> spin<00:00:39.920> out<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:40.250> think

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
speed flight tends to spin out I think

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.410 
speed flight tends to spin out I think
because<00:00:40.790> of<00:00:40.970> the<00:00:41.980> swept<00:00:42.980> wing<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:46.730> doesn't

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
because of the swept wing and it doesn't

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.380 
because of the swept wing and it doesn't
have<00:00:47.570> in<00:00:47.809> dihedral<00:00:48.590> really

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:01.130 

it<00:00:53.430> turned<00:00:54.430> out<00:00:54.610> really<00:00:54.809> precise

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.400 

but<00:01:02.140> does<00:01:02.860> go<00:01:03.190> quite<00:01:03.580> fast<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.290> little

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
but does go quite fast it's a little

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.010 
but does go quite fast it's a little
smaller<00:01:05.920> than<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:08.010> plane<00:01:09.010> I<00:01:09.040> got<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:09.700> from

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
smaller than the plane I got it it from

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.600 
smaller than the plane I got it it from
the<00:01:11.040> UMS<00:01:13.350> su-26<00:01:14.910> XP<00:01:15.910> I<00:01:15.940> think<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.630> new<00:01:16.780> model

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the UMS su-26 XP I think the new model

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.800 
the UMS su-26 XP I think the new model
that's<00:01:18.610> where<00:01:18.760> I<00:01:18.820> got<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.090> guts<00:01:19.270> from<00:01:19.570> I

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
that's where I got the guts from I

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:26.310 
that's where I got the guts from I
smashed<00:01:20.170> that<00:01:20.410> went<00:01:20.830> into<00:01:20.950> bits<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:23.340> yeah<00:01:25.320> so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
smashed that went into bits so yeah so

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:36.070 
smashed that went into bits so yeah so
I've<00:01:26.650> got<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:28.590> removable<00:01:29.590> hatch

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.760 

got<00:01:36.710> the<00:01:36.830> set<00:01:37.070> up<00:01:37.250> through<00:01:38.020> battery<00:01:39.020> slides<00:01:39.440> in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
got the set up through battery slides in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:49.630 
got the set up through battery slides in
and<00:01:39.920> out<00:01:41.620> it's<00:01:42.620> pretty<00:01:42.890> easy<00:01:44.560> secure

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.310 

yeah<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:51.080> my<00:01:51.350> next<00:01:51.530> project<00:01:51.800> is<00:01:52.280> actually<00:01:52.490> to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
yeah so my next project is actually to

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.690 
yeah so my next project is actually to
build<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.470> replica<00:01:54.680> of<00:01:55.010> a<00:01:55.190> Spitfire<00:01:56.830> so<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:58.220> make

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
build a replica of a Spitfire so I make

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.580 
build a replica of a Spitfire so I make
a<00:01:58.729> little<00:01:58.970> video<00:01:59.210> showing<00:01:59.720> how<00:01:59.840> that<00:02:00.200> turned

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
a little video showing how that turned

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.590 
a little video showing how that turned
out<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:02.060> need<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.360> borrow<00:02:03.250> or<00:02:04.250> get<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.119> camera

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
out and I need to borrow or get a camera

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:40.240 
out and I need to borrow or get a camera
to<00:02:06.170> do<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.320> flight<00:02:06.710> baby<00:02:08.860> thanks<00:02:09.860> for<00:02:10.009> watching
