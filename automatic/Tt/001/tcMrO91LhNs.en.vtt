00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.530 

right<00:00:01.380> I've<00:00:01.829> now<00:00:02.070> compared<00:00:02.610> this<00:00:02.760> panel<00:00:03.149> to

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
right I've now compared this panel to

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.630 
right I've now compared this panel to
the<00:00:03.629> actual<00:00:03.959> body<00:00:04.170> of<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.470> car<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.100> it's

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
the actual body of the car and it's

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.099 
the actual body of the car and it's
going<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> right<00:00:06.240> direction<00:00:06.450> but<00:00:06.990> it's

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
going in the right direction but it's

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.470 
going in the right direction but it's
not<00:00:07.319> sufficient<00:00:07.529> yet<00:00:08.099> that<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:08.940> profile

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
not sufficient yet that is the profile

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.600 
not sufficient yet that is the profile
that<00:00:09.660> we've<00:00:09.809> taken<00:00:10.050> from<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.590> car<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.099> as<00:00:11.490> I

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
that we've taken from the car and as I

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.509 
that we've taken from the car and as I
showed<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:11.940> previously<00:00:12.410> it's<00:00:13.410> just<00:00:13.860> not

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
showed you previously it's just not

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.180 
showed you previously it's just not
enough<00:00:14.790> yet<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.020> we<00:00:16.109> need<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> do<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:17.039> we

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
enough yet so what we need to do is we

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.700 
enough yet so what we need to do is we
need<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.369> mallet<00:00:18.090> some<00:00:18.300> more<00:00:18.510> shape<00:00:18.810> into<00:00:19.560> that

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
need to mallet some more shape into that

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.160 
need to mallet some more shape into that
and<00:00:19.859> that's<00:00:20.039> what<00:00:20.189> I'm<00:00:20.279> going<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:21.170> so

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and that's what I'm going to do now so

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.810 
and that's what I'm going to do now so
we're<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> closer<00:00:22.800> by<00:00:23.130> mallet<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.699> it

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
we're going to closer by mallet in it

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:57.439 
we're going to closer by mallet in it
not<00:00:24.779> forgetting<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:55.850> yeah<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.149> getting

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
not forgetting the yeah it's getting

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.900 
not forgetting the yeah it's getting
closer<00:00:57.690> now<00:00:57.840> gap<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> middle<00:00:59.160> clearly

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
closer now gap in the middle clearly

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:21.650 
closer now gap in the middle clearly
want<00:01:00.059> some<00:01:00.270> more<00:01:00.420> work<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.870> middle

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:02:18.750 

yes<00:01:22.660> a<00:01:22.690> little<00:01:22.960> bit<00:01:23.170> more<00:02:17.160> that<00:02:18.160> looks<00:02:18.459> pretty

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
yes a little bit more that looks pretty

00:02:18.760 --> 00:03:54.620 
yes a little bit more that looks pretty
close

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.460 

let<00:03:55.630> me<00:03:55.690> go<00:03:55.840> that's<00:03:56.050> how<00:03:56.200> much<00:03:56.320> I've<00:03:56.440> never

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
let me go that's how much I've never

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.210 
let me go that's how much I've never
read<00:03:56.800> a<00:03:57.630> little<00:03:58.630> bit<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:58.960> check<00:04:00.420> we're<00:04:01.420> doing

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
read a little bit of a check we're doing

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.640 
read a little bit of a check we're doing
not<00:04:03.220> too<00:04:03.400> bad<00:04:03.610> okay<00:04:04.180> back<00:04:05.050> into<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.440> wheeler

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
not too bad okay back into the wheeler

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:27.000 
not too bad okay back into the wheeler
machine<00:04:05.950> again<00:04:25.470> now<00:04:26.470> we<00:04:26.680> learn<00:04:26.830> this<00:04:26.980> very

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
machine again now we learn this very

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.190 
machine again now we learn this very
quickly<00:04:27.460> it's<00:04:28.030> actually<00:04:28.300> not<00:04:28.480> about<00:04:28.570> speed

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
quickly it's actually not about speed

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.470 
quickly it's actually not about speed
it's<00:04:29.620> about<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.550> decision<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.090> where<00:04:31.300> your

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
it's about the decision of where your

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.960 
it's about the decision of where your
wheel<00:04:31.660> then<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.680> tricky<00:04:32.950> part<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.280> steering

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
wheel then the tricky part is steering

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.520 
wheel then the tricky part is steering
it<00:04:34.090> and<00:04:34.330> you're<00:04:34.510> steering<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:35.110> panel<00:04:35.410> it's

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
it and you're steering the panel it's

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.220 
it and you're steering the panel it's
rather<00:04:35.770> like<00:04:36.040> driving<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:37.030> dumper<00:04:37.660> truck<00:04:37.900> it's

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
rather like driving a dumper truck it's

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.909 
rather like driving a dumper truck it's
rear-wheel<00:04:38.530> steer<00:04:39.280> so<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.750> change<00:04:41.050> direction

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
rear-wheel steer so to change direction

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.680 
rear-wheel steer so to change direction
we're<00:04:42.160> basically<00:04:42.340> turn<00:04:42.910> it<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.180> opposite<00:04:43.419> way

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
we're basically turn it the opposite way

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.380 
we're basically turn it the opposite way
to<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.500> way<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.740> we<00:04:44.800> want<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.160> go<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.850> we

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
to the way that we want to go and we

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.500 
to the way that we want to go and we
draw<00:04:46.900> down<00:04:47.169> in<00:04:47.200> a<00:04:47.440> straight<00:04:47.710> line<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.520> then

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
draw down in a straight line and then

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.330 
draw down in a straight line and then
twist<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.960> roll<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.010> next<00:04:51.220> position

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
twist it roll to the next position

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.520 
twist it roll to the next position
straight<00:04:52.180> not<00:04:52.390> draw<00:04:53.020> back<00:04:53.230> in<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.470> straight

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530

straight not draw back in a straight
line<00:04:53.740> twist<00:04:54.580> it<00:04:54.790> roll<00:04:55.510> to<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.810> point

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110

some<00:05:08.380> of<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.590> out<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.280> wind<00:05:09.460> process<00:05:10.830> but

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
some of it out in the wind process but

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.440 
some of it out in the wind process but
we<00:05:12.070> were<00:05:12.220> touch<00:05:12.400> then<00:05:12.610> pull<00:05:12.910> down<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.210> little

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
we were touch then pull down a little

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:44.540 
we were touch then pull down a little
bit

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.890 

getting<00:05:45.550> close<00:05:45.760> now<00:05:45.790> it<00:05:46.389> might<00:05:46.600> be<00:05:46.720> an<00:05:46.810> idea

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
getting close now it might be an idea

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.770 
getting close now it might be an idea
that<00:05:47.320> we<00:05:47.470> now<00:05:47.650> switch<00:05:48.160> from<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.060> medium<00:05:49.479> crown

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
that we now switch from the medium crown

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.600 
that we now switch from the medium crown
wheel<00:05:50.020> to<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.290> smoothing<00:05:50.830> wheel<00:05:51.010> that<00:05:51.490> will

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
wheel to the smoothing wheel that will

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.689 
wheel to the smoothing wheel that will
get<00:05:51.760> final<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.800> remove<00:05:53.800> any<00:05:54.039> surface

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699 
get final and remove any surface

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.710
