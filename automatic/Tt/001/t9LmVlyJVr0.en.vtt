just<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.640> really<00:02:05.939> great<00:02:06.210> job<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.540> detail<00:02:07.190> all

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
just a really great job of detail all

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.430 
just a really great job of detail all
around<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.849> figure<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.450> really<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
around this figure I really think the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.900 
around this figure I really think the
paint's<00:02:10.890> great<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> really<00:02:11.520> suits<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
paint's great it really suits the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.610 
paint's great it really suits the
original<00:02:12.390> look<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.660> Iron<00:02:12.900> Monger

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620

as far as articulation his head there's

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.460 
as far as articulation his head there's
a<00:02:18.030> very<00:02:18.299> stiff<00:02:18.870> full<00:02:19.409> 360<00:02:20.930> he<00:02:21.930> also<00:02:22.110> has<00:02:22.349> this

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
a very stiff full 360 he also has this

a very stiff full 360 he also has this

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
piece around his neck which appears to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.949 
piece around his neck which appears to
be<00:02:24.959> separate<00:02:25.819> kind<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:26.879> move<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.180> itself<00:02:27.450> moves

on its own his shoulder pads move ever
so<00:02:32.310> slightly<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.790> allow<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> more<00:02:33.329> arm

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
so slightly to allow you more arm

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.339 
so slightly to allow you more arm
articulation<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.760> arms<00:02:35.760> can<00:02:35.879> do<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.709> slightly

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
articulation the arms can do a slightly

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.690 
articulation the arms can do a slightly
blocked<00:02:40.349> 360<00:02:41.159> s<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.280> can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.519> kind<00:02:41.640> of

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
blocked 360 s you can see you kind of

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.970 
blocked 360 s you can see you kind of
have<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.849> spin<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.269> out<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.530> be<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:43.799> bulky

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
have to spin them out but to be so bulky

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.390 
have to spin them out but to be so bulky
the<00:02:44.280> arms<00:02:44.579> actually<00:02:44.940> spin<00:02:45.329> very<00:02:45.660> well<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the arms actually spin very well the

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.430 
the arms actually spin very well the
elbow<00:02:47.670> joint<00:02:47.849> not<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.359> much<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:49.200> can<00:02:49.319> see

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
elbow joint not so much you can see

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.869 
elbow joint not so much you can see
there<00:02:49.590> is<00:02:49.709> definitely<00:02:50.099> is<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> joint<00:02:50.579> on<00:02:50.700> both

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
there is definitely is a joint on both

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.059 
there is definitely is a joint on both
arms<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:52.280> really<00:02:53.280> really<00:02:53.730> stiff<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:55.680> can

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
arms but really really stiff and I can

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.280 
arms but really really stiff and I can
get<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.220> very<00:02:56.660> pretty<00:02:57.660> much<00:02:57.750> getting<00:02:58.109> no

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
get a very pretty much getting no

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.440 
get a very pretty much getting no
movement<00:02:58.709> out<00:02:58.769> of<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.950> elbows<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.519> this<00:03:00.299> is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
movement out of the elbows on this is

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.690 
movement out of the elbows on this is
something<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.720> will<00:03:00.870> probably<00:03:01.250> free<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.430> as

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
something that will probably free up as

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.360 
something that will probably free up as
time<00:03:03.090> goes<00:03:03.299> by<00:03:03.329> but<00:03:03.859> right<00:03:04.859> now<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.310> just

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
time goes by but right now it's just

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.740 
time goes by but right now it's just
really<00:03:05.760> stiff<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.299> don't<00:03:06.420> want<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.599> risk

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
really stiff and I don't want to risk

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.599 
really stiff and I don't want to risk
breaking<00:03:07.349> it<00:03:07.620> um<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:09.150> wrist<00:03:09.359> spin<00:03:10.400> ever<00:03:11.400> so

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
breaking it um the wrist spin ever so

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.610 
breaking it um the wrist spin ever so
slightly<00:03:13.340> he<00:03:14.340> does<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.579> full<00:03:15.060> well<00:03:15.629> his<00:03:16.290> side<00:03:16.500> to

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
slightly he does a full well his side to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.099 
slightly he does a full well his side to
side<00:03:16.829> at<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.099> torso<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:17.669> like<00:03:18.209> he<00:03:18.329> would<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.079> a

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
side at the torso but like he would do a

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.490 
side at the torso but like he would do a
full<00:03:19.349> 360<00:03:19.560> if<00:03:19.919> he<00:03:19.980> wasn't<00:03:20.280> quite<00:03:20.519> so<00:03:20.790> bulky<00:03:21.500> his

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
full 360 if he wasn't quite so bulky his

apparently<00:03:27.599> he<00:03:28.200> is<00:03:28.290> double-jointed<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.069> knee

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
apparently he is double-jointed the knee

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.979 
apparently he is double-jointed the knee
which<00:03:29.879> has<00:03:30.060> an<00:03:30.180> impressive<00:03:30.480> amount<00:03:30.870> of

actually<00:03:52.139> going<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.500> detail<00:03:53.010> on<00:03:53.129> this<00:03:53.280> guy<00:03:54.470> so

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
actually going to detail on this guy so

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.900 
actually going to detail on this guy so
you<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:55.620> see<00:03:55.739> they've<00:03:55.889> got<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.129> antenna<00:03:56.669> they

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
you can see they've got the antenna they

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.689 
you can see they've got the antenna they
did<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> great<00:03:57.599> job<00:03:57.629> on<00:03:58.019> his<00:03:58.319> little<00:03:58.549> legs<00:03:59.549> as

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
did a great job on his little legs as

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.030 
did a great job on his little legs as
his<00:03:59.879> own<00:03:59.970> personal<00:04:00.419> arc<00:04:00.629> reactor<00:04:01.049> the<00:04:01.620> cords

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
his own personal arc reactor the cords

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.610 
his own personal arc reactor the cords
definitely<00:04:02.459> add<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.579> nice<00:04:02.849> touch<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:04.470> once

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
definitely add a nice touch and once

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.809 
definitely add a nice touch and once
again<00:04:04.709> I<00:04:04.799> just<00:04:04.829> think<00:04:05.160> they<00:04:05.220> really<00:04:05.489> picked<00:04:05.730> a

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
again I just think they really picked a

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.670 
again I just think they really picked a
fantastic<00:04:06.599> shade<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.930> blue<00:04:07.109> for<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.379> figure

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
fantastic shade of blue for this figure

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.729 
fantastic shade of blue for this figure
so<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:10.709> being<00:04:11.099> said<00:04:11.190> let's<00:04:11.400> actually<00:04:11.730> get

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
so that being said let's actually get

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.469 
so that being said let's actually get
his<00:04:13.739> armor<00:04:14.310> cards<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.910> face<00:04:15.150> back<00:04:15.449> out<00:04:15.660> here

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
his armor cards and face back out here

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.849 
his armor cards and face back out here
hello<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.599> was<00:04:18.720> hoping<00:04:19.169> they<00:04:19.289> would<00:04:19.440> size<00:04:19.829> up

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
hello it was hoping they would size up

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.480 
hello it was hoping they would size up
the<00:04:20.430> base<00:04:20.760> just<00:04:21.659> a<00:04:21.870> little<00:04:22.169> button

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
the base just a little button

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.150 
the base just a little button
yeah<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:25.020> like<00:04:25.080> it's<00:04:25.289> makes<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.009> figure

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
yeah it's not like it's makes the figure

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.870 
yeah it's not like it's makes the figure
terrible<00:04:27.259> just<00:04:28.259> a<00:04:28.410> little<00:04:28.770> bit<00:04:28.889> difficulty<00:04:29.669> on

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
terrible just a little bit difficulty on

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.980 
terrible just a little bit difficulty on
this<00:04:30.060> base<00:04:30.389> here<00:04:34.370> okay<00:04:35.570> okay<00:04:36.570> so<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.810> chair

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
this base here okay okay so the chair

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.180 
this base here okay okay so the chair
should<00:04:37.110> actually<00:04:37.350> get<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.860> size<00:04:38.160> comparison

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
should actually get a size comparison

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.900 
should actually get a size comparison
here<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:40.110> previously<00:04:40.919> released<00:04:41.130> Hulkbuster

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
here the previously released Hulkbuster

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.409 
here the previously released Hulkbuster
from<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.150> Iron<00:04:42.419> Man<00:04:42.539> 2<00:04:42.750> line<00:04:42.960> you<00:04:43.830> can<00:04:43.949> see

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
from the Iron Man 2 line you can see

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.790 
from the Iron Man 2 line you can see
Iron<00:04:45.419> Monger<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.810> actually<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.199> bit<00:04:46.500> bigger

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
Iron Monger is actually a bit bigger

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.320 
Iron Monger is actually a bit bigger
than<00:04:46.919> him<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.880> figure<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:49.280> then

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
than him that figure and then

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.670 
than him that figure and then
essentially<00:04:51.330> back<00:04:51.870> it<00:04:52.050> off<00:04:52.169> a<00:04:52.350> little<00:04:52.560> bit

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
essentially back it off a little bit

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.870 
essentially back it off a little bit
here<00:04:56.270> and<00:04:57.270> get<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.169> Iron<00:04:58.590> Man<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.039> Mark<00:04:59.340> six

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
here and get the Iron Man and Mark six

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.360 
here and get the Iron Man and Mark six
armor<00:05:00.240> out<00:05:00.300> here<00:05:00.650> this<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.949> one<00:05:02.099> that<00:05:02.220> came

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
armor out here this is the one that came

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.279 
armor out here this is the one that came
to<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.580> fury<00:05:02.849> of<00:05:02.910> combat<00:05:03.389> 4<00:05:03.660> pack<00:05:03.900> so<00:05:04.050> he<00:05:04.139> does

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
to the fury of combat 4 pack so he does

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.439 
to the fury of combat 4 pack so he does
not<00:05:04.320> have<00:05:04.590> his<00:05:04.650> base<00:05:04.949> but<00:05:05.250> you<00:05:05.430> can<00:05:06.330> definitely

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
not have his base but you can definitely

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.040 
not have his base but you can definitely
tell<00:05:06.840> even<00:05:07.440> with<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.800> without<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.580> base<00:05:09.050> very

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
tell even with the without the base very

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.930 
tell even with the without the base very
massive<00:05:10.560> difference<00:05:11.070> in<00:05:11.190> size<00:05:11.400> between<00:05:11.430> these

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
massive difference in size between these

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.490 
massive difference in size between these
guys<00:05:12.090> I'm<00:05:12.300> I<00:05:12.449> don't<00:05:12.630> have<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:13.020> movie<00:05:13.289> Iron

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
guys I'm I don't have the movie Iron

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.460 
guys I'm I don't have the movie Iron
Monger<00:05:13.800> but<00:05:14.479> I'm<00:05:15.479> pretty<00:05:15.750> pretty<00:05:16.020> sure<00:05:16.289> that

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
Monger but I'm pretty pretty sure that

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.270 
Monger but I'm pretty pretty sure that
this<00:05:16.620> guy<00:05:16.800> is<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:17.430> tiny<00:05:18.030> bit<00:05:18.150> taller<00:05:18.539> than<00:05:18.780> him

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
this guy is a tiny bit taller than him

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.879 
this guy is a tiny bit taller than him
so<00:05:20.280> just<00:05:20.460> a<00:05:20.550> massive<00:05:20.880> figure<00:05:21.180> in<00:05:21.419> general<00:05:21.889> now

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
so just a massive figure in general now

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.939 
so just a massive figure in general now
when<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.099> found<00:05:23.370> this<00:05:23.550> guy<00:05:23.820> I<00:05:24.060> actually<00:05:24.360> on<00:05:24.949> its

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
when I found this guy I actually on its

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.010 
when I found this guy I actually on its
kind<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.550> little<00:05:27.150> bit<00:05:27.360> hard<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.659> find<00:05:27.840> these

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
kind a little bit hard to find these

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.330 
kind a little bit hard to find these
newer<00:05:28.199> ways<00:05:28.440> for<00:05:28.620> me<00:05:28.710> because<00:05:28.979> most<00:05:29.159> of<00:05:29.280> my

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
newer ways for me because most of my

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.210 
newer ways for me because most of my
