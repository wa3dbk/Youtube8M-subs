network it's go ahead and take a look at
some<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.689> connectors<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.739> this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
some of the connectors on this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.399 
some of the connectors on this
particular<00:02:24.549> television<00:02:25.269> now<00:02:26.049> you're<00:02:26.290> going

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
particular television now you're going

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.470 
particular television now you're going
to<00:02:26.530> notice<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.980> way<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.579> connectivity<00:02:28.390> on

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
to notice the way the connectivity on

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.199 
to notice the way the connectivity on
this<00:02:28.629> is<00:02:28.780> arranged<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.409> so<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.489> TV<00:02:31.000> can

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
this is arranged is so that this TV can

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.420 
this is arranged is so that this TV can
be<00:02:31.359> mounted<00:02:31.510> flush<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.620> your<00:02:32.890> wall<00:02:33.099> because

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
be mounted flush on your wall because

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.979 
be mounted flush on your wall because
that's<00:02:33.609> obviously<00:02:33.909> how<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.689> going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> look

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
that's obviously how it's going to look

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.170 
that's obviously how it's going to look
it's<00:02:35.349> best<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.280> all<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.640> connectors<00:02:37.000> are

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
it's best so all the connectors are

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.720 
it's best so all the connectors are
going<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.540> found<00:02:37.859> lining<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:38.890> right<00:02:39.489> or

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730
